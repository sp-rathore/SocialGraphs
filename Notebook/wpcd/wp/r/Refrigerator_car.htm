      <p>A <b>refrigerator car</b> (or <b>&quot;reefer&quot;</b>) is a <!--del_lnk--> refrigerated <!--del_lnk--> boxcar, a piece of <!--del_lnk--> railroad <!--del_lnk--> rolling stock designed to carry perishable freight at specific temperatures. Refrigerator cars differ from simple <!--del_lnk--> insulated boxcars and <!--del_lnk--> ventilated boxcars (commonly used for transporting fruit), neither of which are fitted with cooling apparatus. Reefers can be ice-cooled, come equipped with any one of a variety of mechanical refrigeration systems, or utilize <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> (either as <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">dry ice</a>, or in liquid form) as a cooling agent. <a href="../../wp/m/Milk.htm" title="Milk">Milk</a> cars (and other types of &quot;express&quot; reefers) may or may not include a cooling system, but are equipped with high-speed <!--del_lnk--> wheelsets and other modifications that allow them to travel with <a href="../../wp/t/Train.htm" title="Train">passenger trains</a>.<p>Reefer applications can be divided into four broad groups: 1) dairy and poultry producers require refrigeration and special interior racks; 2) fruit and vegetable reefers tend to see seasonal use, and are generally used for long-distance shipping (for some shipments, only ventilation is necessary to remove the heat in transit created by the ripening process); 3) manufactured foods (such as canned goods and candy) as well as beer and wine do not require refrigeration, but do need the protection of an insulated car; and 4) meat reefers come equipped with specialized <!--del_lnk--> beef rails for handling sides of meat, and brine-tank refrigeration to provide lower temperatures (most of these units are either owned or leased by meat packing firms).<p>

Getting the animals to market required herds to be driven distances of up to 1,200 miles (2,000 km) to <!--del_lnk--> railheads in <a href="../../wp/k/Kansas_City%252C_Missouri.htm" title="Kansas City, Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a>, whereupon they were loaded into specialized <a href="../../wp/s/Stock_car_%2528rail%2529.htm" title="Stock car (rail)">stock cars</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Transport.htm" title="Transport">transported</a> live (&quot;on-the-hoof&quot;) to regional <!--del_lnk--> processing centers. Driving cattle across the plains also led to tremendous weight loss, and a number of animals were typically lost along the way.<p>Upon arrival at the local processing facility, livestock were either <!--del_lnk--> slaughtered by wholesalers and delivered fresh to nearby butcher shops for retail sale, smoked, or packed for shipment in barrels of salt. Certain costly inefficiencies were inherent in the process of transporting live animals by rail, particularly the fact that about sixty percent of the animal&#39;s mass is inedible. The death of animals weakened by the long drive further increased the per-unit shipping cost.

      <p>A number of attempts were made during the mid-1800s to ship <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agricultural</a> products via rail car. As early as 1842, the <!--del_lnk--> Western Railroad of Massachusetts was reported in the <!--del_lnk--> June 15 edition of the <i>Boston Traveler</i> to be experimenting with innovative <!--del_lnk--> freight car designs capable of carrying all types of perishable goods without spoilage. The first refrigerated boxcar entered service in June 1851, on the <!--del_lnk--> Northern Railroad of New York (or NRNY, which later became part of the <!--del_lnk--> Rutland Railroad). This &quot;icebox on wheels&quot; was a limited success in that it was only able to function in cold weather. That same year, the <!--del_lnk--> Ogdensburg and Lake Champlain Railroad (O&amp;LC) began shipping butter to Boston in purpose-built freight cars, utilizing ice to cool the contents.<p>The first consignment of dressed beef to ever leave the Chicago stockyards did so in 1857, and was carried in ordinary <!--del_lnk--> boxcars retrofitted with bins filled with ice. Placing the meat directly against ice resulted in discoloration and affected the taste, however, and therefore proved to be impractical. During the same period Swift experimented by moving cut meat using a string of ten boxcars which ran with their doors removed, and made a few test shipments to <!--del_lnk--> New York during the winter months over the <!--del_lnk--> Grand Trunk Railway (GTR). The method proved too limited to be practical.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p><a href="../../wp/d/Detroit%252C_Michigan.htm" title="Detroit, Michigan">Detroit&#39;s</a> <!--del_lnk--> William Davis patented a refrigerator car that employed metal racks to suspend the carcasses above a frozen mixture of ice and salt. He sold the design in 1868 to <!--del_lnk--> George H. Hammond, a Detroit meat-packer, who built a set of cars to transport his products to Boston using ice from the <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Lakes.htm" title="Great Lakes">Great Lakes</a> for cooling. The loads had the unfortunate tendency of swinging to one side when the car entered a curve at high speed, and the use of the units was discontinued after several derailments. Finally, in 1878, Swift hired engineer Andrew Chase to design a ventilated car that was well-insulated, and positioned the ice in a compartment at the top of the car, allowing the chilled air to flow naturally downward. The meat was packed tightly at the bottom of the car to keep the <!--del_lnk--> centre of gravity low and to prevent the cargo from shifting. Chase&#39;s design proved to be a practical solution to providing temperature-controlled carriage of dressed meats, and allowed <!--del_lnk--> Swift and Company to ship their products all over the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> and internationally.<p>Swift&#39;s attempts to sell Chase&#39;s design to the major railroads were unanimously rebuffed, as the companies feared that they would jeopardize their considerable investments in <a href="../../wp/s/Stock_car_%2528rail%2529.htm" title="Stock car (rail)">stock cars</a>, animal pens, and feedlots if refrigerated meat transport gained wide acceptance. In response, Swift financed the initial production run on his own, then &mdash; when the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">American</a> roads refused his business &mdash; he contracted with the GTR (a railroad that derived little income from transporting live cattle) to haul the cars into <!--del_lnk--> Michigan and then eastward through <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>. In 1880, the <!--del_lnk--> Peninsular Car Company (subsequently purchased by ACF) delivered to Swift the first of these units, and the Swift Refrigerator Line (SRL) was created. Within a year the Line&rsquo;s roster had risen to nearly 200 units, and Swift was transporting an average of 3,000 carcasses a week to <a href="../../wp/b/Boston%252C_Massachusetts.htm" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a>. Competing firms such as <!--del_lnk--> Armour and Company quickly followed suit. By <!--del_lnk--> 1920 the SRL owned and operated 7,000 of the ice-cooled rail cars; the <!--del_lnk--> General American Transportation Corporation would assume ownership of the line in 1930.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The use of ice to refrigerate and thus preserve food dates back to prehistoric times. Through the ages, the seasonal harvesting of snow and ice was a regular practice of many ancient cultures: <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Greece</a>, and <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Rome</a> (to name a few) all stored ice and snow in caves or dugouts lined with straw or other insulating materials. Rationing of the ice allowed the preservation of foods over the hot periods, a practice that was successfully employed for centuries. For most of the <!--del_lnk--> 1800s, natural ice (harvested from ponds and lakes) was used to supply the various refrigerator car lines. At high altitudes or northern latitudes, one-foot tanks were often filled with water and allowed to freeze. Ice was typically cut into blocks during the winter months and stored in insulated warehouses for use during the rest of the year, where sawdust and hay was packed around the ice blocks to provide additional thermal protection. A late-19th century model wood-bodied reefer required re-icing every 250 to 400 miles.<div class="thumb tright">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>By the turn of the century, artificially-produced ice became more common. The Pacific Fruit Express (PFE), for example, maintained 7 natural harvesting facilities, and operated 18 artificial ice plants. Their largest plant (located in <!--del_lnk--> Roseville, California) produced 1,200 short tons of ice each day; Roseville&rsquo;s docks could accommodate up to 254 cars at a time. At the industry&rsquo;s peak, 13 million short tons of ice was produced for refrigerator car use every year.<p><a name=".22Top_Icing.22"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">&quot;Top Icing&quot;</span></h4>
      <p>Top icing is the practice of placing a 2- to 4-inch layer of crushed ice over the top of agricultural products that have high respiration rates, need high relative humidity, and benefit from having the cooling agent sit directly atop the load (or within individual boxes). In practice, cars with pre-cooled fresh produce were top-iced just before shipment. Top-icing added considerable dead weight to the load; top-icing a 40-foot reefer required in excess of 10,000 pounds of ice. It had been postulated that as the ice melts, the resulting chilled water would trickle down through the load to continue the cooling process. It was found, however, that top-icing only benefited the uppermost layers of the cargo, and that the water from the melting ice often passed through spaces between the cartons and pallets with little or no cooling effect. It was ultimately determined that top-icing is useful only in preventing an increase in temperature, and was eventually discontinued altogether.<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="gallery">

      <p>Refrigerator cars required effective insulation to protect their delicate contents from temperature extremes. &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Hairfelt&quot; derived from compressed cattle fur, sandwiched into the floor and walls of the car, was inexpensive but flawed &mdash; over its three- to four-year service life it would decay, rotting out the car&#39;s wooden partitions and tainting the cargo with a foul odour in the process. The relatively higher cost of other less sensitive materials such as &quot;Linofelt&quot; (woven from <!--del_lnk--> flax fibers) or <!--del_lnk--> cork prevented their widespread adoption.

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Topeka, Kansas shops of the Santa Fe Railway built five experimental refrigerator cars employing liquid <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen.htm" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a> as the cooling agent in 1965. A fine mist of liquified nitrogen was released throughout the car if the temperature rose above a pre-determined level. Each car carried 3,000 <!--del_lnk--> pounds (1,360 <!--del_lnk--> kg) of refrigerant and could maintain a temperature of minus 20 degrees <!--del_lnk--> Fahrenheit (&minus;30 &deg;C). During the 1990s, a few railcar manufacturers experimented with the use of liquid carbon dioxide (CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>) as a cooling agent. The move was in response to rising fuel costs, and was an attempt to eliminate the standard mechanical refrigeration systems that required periodic maintenance. The CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> system can keep the car&#39;s load frozen solid for periods as long as 14 to 16 days, if necessary.<p>Several hundred &quot;<!--del_lnk--> cryogenic&quot; refrigerator cars were placed into service transporting frozen foodstuffs, though they failed to gain wide acceptance (due, in part, to the steadily-rising cost of liquid carbon dioxide). Since cryogenic refrigeration is a proven technology and environmentally friendly, the rising price of fuel and the increased availability of carbon dioxide from <a href="../../wp/k/Kyoto_Protocol.htm" title="Kyoto Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a>-induced capturing techniques may lead to a resurgence in cryogenic railcar usage. <!--del_lnk--> Cryo-Trans, Inc.

      <p><a id="Aluminum_and_stainless_steel" name="Aluminum_and_stainless_steel"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Aluminium and stainless steel</span></h4>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1946, the Pacific Fruit Express procured from the <!--del_lnk--> Consolidated Steel Corporation of <!--del_lnk--> Wilmington, California two 40-foot <a href="../../wp/a/Aluminium.htm" title="Aluminum">aluminium</a>-bodied ventilator refrigerator cars, in order to compare the durability of the lightweight alloy versus that of steel. It was hoped that weight savings (the units weighed almost 10,000 pounds less than a like-sized all-steel car) and better corrosion resistance would offset the higher initial cost. One of the aluminium car bodies was manufactured by <!--del_lnk--> Alcoa (PFE #44739), while the other was built by the <!--del_lnk--> Reynolds Aluminium Company (PFE #45698).<p>The cars (which were outfitted with state-of-the-art fibreglass insulation and fans driven by the car&#39;s axles for internal air circulation) traveled throughout the Southern Pacific and Union Pacific systems, where they were displayed to promote PFE&#39;s post-<a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> modernization efforts. Though both units remained in service over 15 years (#45698 was destroyed in a wreck in May, 1962, while #44739 was scrapped in 1966), no additional aluminium reefers were ever constructed, cost being the likely reason. Also in 1946, the Consolidated Steel delivered the world&#39;s only reefer to have a <!--del_lnk--> stainless steel car body to the Santa Fe Refrigerator Despatch. The 40-foot car was equipped with convertible ice bunkers, side ventilation ducts, and axle-driven circulation fans. It was thought that stainless steel would better resist the corrosive deterioration resulting from salting the ice. The one-of-a-kind unit entered service as #13000, but was subsequently redesignated as #1300. That number conflicted with a Santa Fe passenger car, and was given #4150 in <!--del_lnk--> 1955.<p>#4150 spent most of its life in express service. Cost was cited as the reason no additional units were ever ordered. The car was dismantled at <!--del_lnk--> Clovis, New Mexico in February, <!--del_lnk--> 1964.<p><a name=".22Depression_Baby.22"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">&quot;Depression Baby&quot;</span></h4>
      <p>During the <!--del_lnk--> 1930s, the <!--del_lnk--> North American Car Company produced a one-of-a-kind, four-wheeled ice bunker reefer intended to serve the needs of specialized shippers who did not generate sufficient product to fill a full-sized refrigerator car. NADX #10000 was a 22-<!--del_lnk--> foot-long, all-steel car that resembled the <!--del_lnk--> forty-and-eights used in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>. The prototype weighed in at 13&frac12; <!--del_lnk--> tons and was outfitted with a 1,500-<!--del_lnk--> pound ice bunker at each end. The car was leased to <!--del_lnk--> Hormel and saw service between <a href="../../wp/c/Chicago.htm" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago, Illinois</a> and the southern <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. However, the concept failed to gain acceptance with the big eastern railroads and therefore no additional units were built.<p><a id="Dry_ice" name="Dry_ice"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Dry ice</span></h4>
      <p>The Santa Fe Refrigerator Despatch (SFRD) briefly experimented with dry ice as a cooling agent in <!--del_lnk--> 1931. The compound was readily-available and seemed like an ideal replacement for frozen water. Dry ice melts at minus 109 degrees Fahrenheit (versus 32 degrees above zero for conventional ice) and was twice as effective thermodynamically. Overall weight was reduced as the need for brine and water was eliminated. While the higher cost of dry ice was certainly a drawback, logistical issues in loading long lines of cars efficiently prevented it from gaining acceptance over conventional ice. Worst of all, it was found that dry ice can adversely affect the colour and flavor of certain foods if placed in too close a proximity to them.<p><a id="Hopper_cars" name="Hopper_cars"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Hopper cars</span></h4>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1969, the <!--del_lnk--> Burlington Northern Railroad ordered a number of modified <!--del_lnk--> covered hopper cars from <!--del_lnk--> American Car and Foundry for transporting perishable food in bulk. The 55-foot-long cars were blanketed with a layer of insulation, were equipped with roof hatches for loading, and had centerflow openings along the bottom to allow for fast discharge of the contents. A mechanical refrigeration unit was installed at each end of the car, where sheet metal ducting forced the cool air into the cargo compartments.<p>The units, which were rated at 100 <!--del_lnk--> short tons load carrying capacity (more than twice that provided by the largest conventional refrigerator car of the day) were obviously economical to load and unload, as no secondary packaging was required. Apples, carrots, onions, and potatoes were transported in this manner with some success. Oranges, on the other hand, tended to burst under their own weight, even after wooden baffles were installed to better distribute the load. The Santa Fe Railway leased 100 of the hoppers from ACF, and in April, <!--del_lnk--> 1972 purchased 100 new units. The cars&#39; irregular, orange-colored outer surface (though darker in shade than the standard AT&amp;SF yellow-orange used on reefers) tended to collect dirt easily, and proved difficult to clean as well. Santa Fe eventually relegated the cars to more typical, non-refrigerated applications.<p><a id="Timeline" name="Timeline"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Timeline</span></h2>

      <p>Standard refrigerated transport is often utilized for good with less than 14 days of refrigerated &quot;shelf life&quot;: avocados, cut flowers, green leafy vegetables, lettuce, mangos, meat products, mushrooms, peaches and nectarines, pineapples and papayas, sweet cherries, and tomatoes. &quot;Express&quot; reefers are typically employed in the transport of special perishables: commodities with a refrigerated shelf life of less than 7 days such as human blood, fish, green onions, milk, strawberries, and certain pharmaceuticals.<p>The earliest express-service refrigerator cars entered service around 1890, shortly after the first express train routes were established in <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>. The cars did not, however, come into general use until the early <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a>. Most units designed for express service are larger than their standard counterparts, and are typically constructed more along the lines of <!--del_lnk--> baggage cars than freight equipment. Cars must be equipped with speed-rated trucks and brakes, and &mdash; if they are to be run ahead of the passenger car consist &mdash; must also incorporate an air line for pneumatic braking, a communication signal air line, and a steam line for train heating. Express units were typically painted in passenger car colors, such as <!--del_lnk--> Pullman green.<p>The first purpose-built express reefer emerged from the <!--del_lnk--> Erie Railroad&#39;s Susquehanna Shops on <!--del_lnk--> August 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1886. By 1927, some 2,218 express cars traveled over America&#39;s rails; three years later, that number had grown to 3,264. In 1940, private rail lines began to build and operate their own reefers, the <!--del_lnk--> Railway Express Agency (REA) being by far the largest. In 1948, the REA roster (which would continue to expand into the <!--del_lnk--> 1950s) numbered approximately 1,800 cars, many of which were <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> &quot;<a href="../../wp/t/Troop_sleeper.htm" title="Troop sleeper">troop sleepers</a>&quot; modified for express refrigerated transport. By 1965, due to an industry-wide decline in refrigerated rail traffic, many express reefers were found in lease service to railroad companies for use as bulk mail carriers.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>For many years, virtually all of the perishable traffic in the United States belonged to the railroads. But while the railroads were subject to government regulation regarding shipping rates, trucking companies could set their own rate for hauling agricultural products, giving them a competitive edge. In March, 1979 the <!--del_lnk--> ICC exempted rail transportation of fresh fruits and vegetables from all economic regulation. Once the &quot;Agricultural Exemption Clause&quot; was removed from the <i>Interstate Commerce Act</i>, railroad companies began aggressively pursuing trailer-on-flatcar (TOFC) business (a form of <!--del_lnk--> intermodal freight transport) for refrigerated trailers. Taking this strategy one step further, a number of carriers (including the PFE and SFRD) purchased their own refrigerated trailers in order to compete directly with interstate trucking concerns.<p>The final chapter has not, as many industry insiders have predicted, been written for the refrigerator car in America. The dawn of the <a href="../../wp/2/21st_century.htm" title="21st century">21st century</a> has seen the first significant reefer orders since the early 1970s.<p><a id="Tropicana_.22Juice_Train.22" name="Tropicana_.22Juice_Train.22"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Tropicana &quot;Juice Train&quot;</span></h3>

      <p>In 1970, Tropicana orange juice was shipped in bulk via <!--del_lnk--> insulated <!--del_lnk--> boxcars in one weekly round-trip from Florida to <!--del_lnk--> Kearny, New Jersey. By the following year, the company was operating two 60-car unit trains a week, each carrying around 1 million U.S. <!--del_lnk--> gallons (4 million <!--del_lnk--> liters) of juice. On <!--del_lnk--> June 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1971 the &quot;Great White Juice Train&quot; (the first unit train in the food industry, consisting of 150 one hundred <!--del_lnk--> short ton insulated boxcars fabricated in the <!--del_lnk--> Alexandria, Virginia shops of <!--del_lnk--> Fruit Growers Express) commenced service over the 1,250-<!--del_lnk--> mile (2,000-<!--del_lnk--> kilometer) route. An additional 100 cars were soon incorporated into the fleet, and small mechanical refrigeration units were installed to keep temperatures constant on hot days. Tropicana saved $40 million in fuel costs alone during the first ten years in operation.<p><a id="AAR_classificatons" name="AAR_classificatons"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">AAR classificatons</span></h2>
