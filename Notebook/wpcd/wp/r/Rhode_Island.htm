      <p>The <b>State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations</b> (commonly known as <b>Rhode Island</b>) is a <a href="../../wp/u/U.S._state.htm" title="U.S. state">state</a> in the <!--del_lnk--> New England region of the <!--del_lnk--> northeastern United States. It is the smallest state by <!--del_lnk--> area, and it is also the state with the longest official name. Rhode (pronounced &quot;Road&quot;) Island was the first of the <!--del_lnk--> thirteen original American colonies to <!--del_lnk--> declare independence from British rule, signaling the start of the <!--del_lnk--> American Revolution.<p>The state&#39;s common name, Rhode Island, actually refers only to the largest <!--del_lnk--> island in <!--del_lnk--> Narragansett Bay, also known as <!--del_lnk--> Aquidneck Island. Some historians think the name owes its origins to Italian explorer <!--del_lnk--> Giovanni da Verrazzano, upon discovering nearby (present-day) <!--del_lnk--> Block Island named it Rhode Island because of its similarity in shape to the Greek island of <!--del_lnk--> Rhodes. Later settlers, mistaking which island Verrazzano was referring to, gave the name to Aquidneck Island instead. Other historians believe that the name is derived from <i>Roodt Eylandt</i>, old Dutch for &quot;red island,&quot; given to the island by Dutch explorer <!--del_lnk--> Adriaen Block due to the red clay on the island&#39;s shore.<p>Despite most of the state being part of the <!--del_lnk--> mainland, the name Rhode Island leads some out-of-staters to mistakenly believe that the entire state is an island, sometimes confusing it with <!--del_lnk--> Long Island. Rhode Island is nicknamed &quot;Little Rhody&quot; traditionally but the state officially adopted the nickname &quot;The Ocean State&quot;.<p>

      <p>Rhode Island covers an area of approximately 1,214&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> square miles (3,144&nbsp; <!--del_lnk--> km&sup2;) and is bordered on the north and east by <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts, on the west by <!--del_lnk--> Connecticut, and on the south by <!--del_lnk--> Rhode Island Sound and the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>. It shares a water border with <!--del_lnk--> New York. The mean <!--del_lnk--> elevation of the state is 200&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> feet (60&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> m). Located within the <!--del_lnk--> New England province of the <!--del_lnk--> Appalachian Region, Rhode Island has two distinct natural regions. Eastern Rhode Island contains the <!--del_lnk--> lowlands of the <!--del_lnk--> Narragansett Bay, while Western Rhode Island forms part of the <!--del_lnk--> New England Upland. Narragansett Bay is a major feature of the state&#39;s topography. <!--del_lnk--> Block Island lies approximately 12 <!--del_lnk--> miles (19&nbsp;km) off the southern coast of the mainland. Within the Bay, there are over 30 islands. The largest is Aquidneck Island, shared by the municipalities of Newport, <!--del_lnk--> Middletown, and <!--del_lnk--> Portsmouth. Among the other islands in the Bay are Hope and Prudence.<p>Nicknamed the Ocean State, Rhode Island has the most oceanfront per capita as well as per land area of any <!--del_lnk--> United States state, and is home to a number of oceanfront <!--del_lnk--> beaches<p>Rhode Island is mostly flat with no real mountains. Rhode Island&#39;s highest natural point is <!--del_lnk--> Jerimoth Hill, only 812 feet (247&nbsp;m) above sea level.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>
      <p>Rhode Island is an example of a warm summer <!--del_lnk--> humid continental climate with hot rainy summers and cold snowy winters. The highest temperature recorded in Rhode Island was 105<!--del_lnk--> F (40&deg;<!--del_lnk--> C), recorded on August 2, 1975 at <!--del_lnk--> Providence. The lowest temperature in Rhode Island, -13 &deg;F (-25 &deg;C), was recorded on February 6, 1996 at <!--del_lnk--> Greene. Monthly average temperatures range from a high of 82 &deg;F (28 &deg;C) to a low of 20 &deg;F (-7 &deg;C). Average yearly precipitation for Rhode Island, from 1961 to 1991, is shown on <!--del_lnk-->  from Oregon State University.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>In 1614, the Dutch explorer Adriaen Block visited the island that is now called <!--del_lnk--> Block Island. Native American inhabitants included the <!--del_lnk--> Narragansett tribe, occupying most of the area, and the closely related <!--del_lnk--> Niantic tribe. Most of the Native Americans were decimated by introduced diseases, intertribal warfare, and the disastrous <!--del_lnk--> King Philip&#39;s War, but remnants of the Niantic merged into the Narragansett tribe, where they remain on a federally recognized reservation.<p>In 1636, <!--del_lnk--> Roger Williams, after being banished from the <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts Bay Colony for his religious views, settled at the tip of Narragansett Bay. He called the site Providence and declared it a place of religious freedom. This is the article of agreement Roger Williams and others made, and every person who decided to live in <!--del_lnk--> Providence had to sign it: &ldquo;We, whose names are hereunder written, being desirous to inhabit the town of Providence, do promise to submit ourselves, in active or passive obedience, to all such orders or agreements as shall be made for public good by the body in an orderly way by the major consent of the inhabitance, masters of families, incorporated together into a township, and such others as they shall admit into the same only in civil things.&rdquo; Rhode Island was a <!--del_lnk--> charter colony, Roger Williams received a <!--del_lnk--> charter to build the colony.<p>In 1637, <!--del_lnk--> Anne Hutchinson was banished from Massachusetts for criticizing the clergy there. She and some others, including <!--del_lnk--> William Coddington and <!--del_lnk--> John Clarke, founded the town of <!--del_lnk--> Portsmouth on <!--del_lnk--> Aquidneck Island. In 1639, Coddington left Portsmouth and founded Newport on Aquidneck Island.<p>In that same year a formal government was established for the island. William Coddington was the first governor and <!--del_lnk--> Philip Sherman was the first Secretary. In 1643, <!--del_lnk--> Samuel Gorton founded Shawomet, which is now called <!--del_lnk--> Warwick. In 1644, the name of Aquidneck Island was changed to Rhode Island.<p>John Clarke was granted a Charter in 1663 for Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, which effectively united the two colonies into one. Under the terms of the charter, only landowners could vote. Before the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, when most people were employed as farmers, this was considered democratic. The original charter was used as the state constitution until 1842.<p>In 1664, the seal of the colony was adopted. It pictured an anchor and the word <i>HOPE</i>.<p>The relationship between the <!--del_lnk--> New Englanders and the Native Americans was at first strained, but did not result in much bloodshed. The largest tribes that lived near Rhode island were the <!--del_lnk--> Wampanoag, <!--del_lnk--> Pequots, <!--del_lnk--> Narragansett, and <!--del_lnk--> Nipmuck. One native named <!--del_lnk--> Squanto, from the Wampanoag tribe, stayed with the pilgrims and taught them many valuable skills needed to survive in the area. He also helped greatly with the eventual peace between the colonists and the natives.<p>Roger Williams had won the respect of his colonial neighbors for his skill in keeping the powerful Narragansett on friendly terms with local white settlers. In 1637, the Narragansett were even persuaded to form an alliance with the <!--del_lnk--> English in carrying out an attack that nearly extinguished the warlike Pequots. However, this peace did not last long. By 1670 even the friendly tribes who had greeted Williams and the Pilgrims became estranged from the colonists, and smell of war began to cover the New England countryside.<p>The most important and traumatic event in 17th century Rhode Island was <!--del_lnk--> King Philip&#39;s War, which occurred during 1675&ndash;1676. King Philip (his British nickname, his real name was <!--del_lnk--> Metacomet) was the chief of the Wampanoag Indians. The settlers of Portsmouth had purchased their land from his father, <!--del_lnk--> Massasoit. King Philip rebelled against the English. The first attacks were around Narrangansett Bay but spread throughout New England.<p><a id="Revolution_and_Industrialization:_1770-1860" name="Revolution_and_Industrialization:_1770-1860"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Revolution and Industrialization: 1770-1860</span></h3>
      <p>Rhode Island&#39;s tradition of independence and dissent gave it a prominent role in the American Revolution. In 1772, the first bloodshed of the American Revolution took place in Rhode Island when a band of Providence residents attacked a grounded British ship for enforcing unpopular British trade regulations in the incident which would be come to known as the <!--del_lnk--> Gaspee Affair. Keeping with its culture of defiance, Rhode Island was the first of the original thirteen colonies to declare its independence from England (<!--del_lnk--> May 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1776,) and the last to ratify the Constitution (which replaced the Articles of Confederation)(<!--del_lnk--> May 29, <!--del_lnk--> 1790)&mdash;doing the latter only after being threatened with having its exports taxed as a foreign nation.<p>As the Industrial Revolution moved large numbers of workers into the cities, a permanently landless, and therefore voteless, class developed. By 1829, 60% of the state&#39;s free white males were ineligible to vote.<p>Several attempts had been made to address this problem, but none passed. In 1842, <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Dorr drafted a liberal <!--del_lnk--> constitution which was passed by popular referendum. However, the conservative sitting governor, <!--del_lnk--> Samuel Ward King, opposed the people&#39;s wishes, leading to the <!--del_lnk--> Dorr Rebellion. Although this collapsed, a modified version of the constitution was passed in November, which allowed any white male to vote that he owned land or could pay a US $1 <!--del_lnk--> poll tax.<p>In addition to industrialization, Rhode Island was heavily involved in the slave trade during the post-revolution era. Slavery was extant in RI as early as 1652, and by 1774, the slave population of RI was 6.3%, nearly twice as high as any other New England Colony. In the late Eighteenth century, several Rhode Island merchant families began actively engaging in the triangle slave trade. Notable among these was the Brown family, for whom Brown University is named, although some important Browns became prominent abolitionists. In the years after the Revolution, Rhode Island merchants controlled between 60 and 90% of the American trade in African slaves.<p><a id="Civil_War_to_Progressive_Era:_1860-1929" name="Civil_War_to_Progressive_Era:_1860-1929"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Civil War to Progressive Era: 1860-1929</span></h3>
      <p>During the Civil War, Rhode Island was one of the Union states. Rhode Island furnished 25,236 fighting men, of which 1,685 died. On the home front, Rhode Island, along with the other northern states, used its industrial capacity to supply the Union Army with the materials it needed to win the war. Rhode Island&#39;s continued growth and modernization led to the creation of an urban mass transit system, and improved health and sanitation programs. After the war, in 1866, Rhode Island abolished racial segregation throughout the state. Post-war immigration increased the population. From the 1860s to the 1880s, most of the immigrants were from England, Ireland, Germany, Sweden, and Quebec. Towards the end of the century however, most immigrants were from South and Eastern Europe, and the Mediterranean. At the turn of the century, Rhode Island had a booming economy, which fed the demand for immigration. In the years that lead up to <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, Rhode Island&#39;s constitution remained reactionary, in contrast to the more progressive reforms that were occurring in the rest of the country. The state never ratified the 18th Amendment establishing national Prohibition of alcohol.  During World War I, Rhode Island furnished 28,817 troops, of whom 612 died. After the war, the state was hit hard by the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish Influenza.<p><a id="Great_Depression_to_Present:_1929-" name="Great_Depression_to_Present:_1929-"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Great Depression to Present: 1929-</span></h3>
      <p>Since the Great Depression, the Rhode Island Democratic Party has dominated local politics. For years, the Speaker of the House, always a Democrat, has been one of the most powerful figures in government. The Republican Party has been restricted to the rural and suburban parts of the state, and occasional &quot;good government&quot; reform candidates, who criticize the state&#39;s high taxes and the excesses of Democratic domination. <!--del_lnk--> Cranston Mayor <!--del_lnk--> Stephen Laffey, Governor <!--del_lnk--> Donald Carcieri of East Greenwich, and former Mayor <!--del_lnk--> Vincent A. &quot;Buddy&quot; Cianci of Providence ran as Republican reform candidates.<p><a id="Law_and_government" name="Law_and_government"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Law and government</span></h2>

The state was devoted to <!--del_lnk--> Republicans until 1908, but has only strayed from the Democrats 7 times in the 24 elections that followed. In 2004, Rhode Island gave <!--del_lnk--> John Kerry a greater than 20 percentage point margin of victory (the third highest of any state) with 59.4% of its vote. All but two of Rhode Island&#39;s 39 cities and towns voted for the Democratic candidate.

It was in <!--del_lnk--> Pawtucket, Rhode Island that <!--del_lnk--> Samuel Slater set up his first mill in 1790, using the waterpower of the <!--del_lnk--> Blackstone River to power his mill. For a while, Rhode Island was one of the leaders in <!--del_lnk--> textiles. However, with the <!--del_lnk--> Great Depression, most textile factories relocated to the American South. Textiles still constitute a part of the Rhode Island economy, but does not have the same power that it once had. An interesting by-product of the textile industry is the amount of abandoned factories - many of them now are used for low-income or elderly housing or have been converted into offices. In Pawtucket, these abandoned mills are used as housing for artists.<p>The Fortune 500 companies <!--del_lnk--> CVS and <!--del_lnk--> Textron are based in <!--del_lnk--> Woonsocket, Rhode Island and <!--del_lnk--> Providence, Rhode Island respectively. <!--del_lnk--> FM Global, <!--del_lnk--> Hasbro, <!--del_lnk--> American Power Conversion, <!--del_lnk--> Nortek, and <!--del_lnk--> Amica Mutual Insurance are all Fortune 1000 companies based in Rhode Island. The <!--del_lnk--> GTECH Corporation is headquartered in Providence.<p>Rhode Island&#39;s 2000 total gross state product was $33 billion, placing it 45<sup>th</sup> in the nation. Its 2000 <i>per capita</i> Personal Income was $29,685, 16<sup>th</sup> in the nation.<p>Health services are Rhode Islands largest industry. Second is tourism, supporting 39,000 jobs, with tourism related sales at $3.26 billion in the year 2000. The third largest industry is manufacturing. Its industrial outputs are fashion jewelry, fabricated metal products, electric equipment, machinery, shipbuilding and boatbuilding.

      <p>Rhode Island has a unique and fascinating culture that distinguishes its people not only from other regions, but also from neighboring New England states.<p>Rhode Islanders speak with a distinct accent that many compare to a &quot;Brooklyn&quot; or a cross between a New York and Boston accent. The residents of this state also speak with a unique vernacular that many have dubbed &quot;Rhode Islandese&quot; or &quot;Rhode Islander&quot;. The <!--del_lnk--> letter &#39;r&#39; is often dropped at the end of a word, (&quot;water&quot; becomes &quot;wata&quot;). <!--del_lnk--> The letter &#39;r&#39; is also added in to the ending of words (&quot;soda&quot; becomes &quot;soder&quot;, &quot;idea&quot; becomes &quot;idear&quot;). Utilization of the word &quot;wicked&quot; is also very common among Rhode Islanders, especially young ones, to provide greater emphasis on something (e.g., &quot;That&#39;s wicked funny&quot; is a relatively common phrase).<p>It is a fairly common stereotype that Rhode Islanders are very superstitious, although this has not been scrutinized statistically. However, the belief in <!--del_lnk--> vampires, especially in the rural parts of the state, was widespread up until the late 19th century. There are several well-documented cases in which families disenterred deceased relatives, then removed and burned their hearts in the belief that the deceased was a vampire who was responsible for illness and misfortune that the family had been suffering. The most famous of these cases is that of 19-year-old Mercy Brown who died in <!--del_lnk--> Exeter, Rhode Island in 1892. It is believed that this widely-reported event inspired much of Bram Stoker&#39;s novel <!--del_lnk--> Dracula.<p>The Fox show <i><!--del_lnk--> Family Guy</i> takes place in a fictional town in Rhode Island named <!--del_lnk--> Quahog.<p>The state was notorious for organized crime activity from the 1950s into the 1990s when the Patriarca crime family held sway over most of New England from their Providence headquarters. Although the power of organized crime has greatly diminished in Rhode Island over the last 20 years, its residents are still stigmatized by popular perceptions of rampant graft and corruption that have haunted the state for decades.<p>Rhode Islanders developed a unique style of architecture in the 17th century, called the <!--del_lnk--> stone-ender.<p><a id="Food" name="Food"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Food</span></h2>
      <p>Rhode Island is known for being one of the biggest coffee-drinking states. According to a Providence Journal article, Providence features the highest number of coffee/donut shops per capita in the country, with over 100 <!--del_lnk--> Dunkin&#39; Donuts locations in the state alone. It is common belief that more coffee ice cream is sold here per-capita than any other state. The Official State Drink of Rhode Island is <!--del_lnk--> coffee milk, a beverage created by mixing milk with coffee syrup. This unique syrup was invented in the state and is bottled and sold in most Rhode Island supermarkets. Frozen lemonade, a mixture of ice-slush, lemons and sugar is also immensely popular in the summer, especially <!--del_lnk--> Del&#39;s Frozen Lemonade, a company based in <!--del_lnk--> Cranston.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Several foods and dishes are unique to Rhode Island. &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Wieners,&quot; which are sometimes called &quot;gaggers&quot; or &quot;weenies&quot; are smaller than a standard hot dog but are covered in a meat sauce, chopped onions, <!--del_lnk--> mustard, and <!--del_lnk--> celery salt. The most common way the word is spelt on menus is &quot;weiner.&quot; Submarine sandwiches are referred to as &quot;grinders&quot; in Rhode Island with a popular version being the Italian grinder, which is made with Italian cold cuts (usually ham, <!--del_lnk--> prosciutto, <!--del_lnk--> capicola, <!--del_lnk--> salami, and <!--del_lnk--> Provolone cheese). <!--del_lnk--> Chouri&ccedil;o (a spicy Portuguese sausage) and peppers, eaten with hearty bread, is also popular among the state&#39;s large Portuguese community. &quot;Dynamites&quot; are most popular in Woonsocket and are similar to a sloppy joe, except served with peppers and onions in a torpedo roll.<p>The Ocean State&#39;s tradition of seafood is one of the most celebrated in the country. <!--del_lnk--> Shellfish is extremely popular, with clams being used in multiple ways. The Quahog (whose shell is Rhode Island&#39;s state shell) is a large clam which is mixed with stuffing and spicy minced sausage and then baked in the shell to form a &quot;Stuffie.&quot; Steamed clams are also a very popular dish. Fried squid, or &quot;calamari,&quot; are fried squid rings and are most popular in Italian restaurants.<p>Rhode Island, like the rest of New England, has a long tradition of clam <!--del_lnk--> chowder. While both the White &quot;New England&quot; variety and the Red &quot;Manhattan&quot; variety are popular, Rhode Island makes a clear chowder, affectionately known as &quot;Rhode Island Clam Chowder.&quot;<p>Perhaps the most peculiar culinary tradition in Rhode Island is the &quot;clamcake.&quot; The clamcake is a deep fried ball of buttery dough with chopped bits of clam inside of it. They are sold in most seafood restaurants around the state, and usually come by the half-dozen or dozen. The quintessential summer meal in Rhode Island is &quot;chowder and clam cakes.&quot;<p>It is also said that clams casino originated in Rhode Island after being &quot;invented&quot; by Julius Keller, the maitre d&#39; in the original Casino next to the seaside Towers in Narragansett. Clams Casino resemble the beloved stuffed quahog but are generally made with the smaller littleneck or cherrystone clam and are unique in their use of bacon as a topping.<p><a id="Cities_and_towns" name="Cities_and_towns"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Cities and towns</span></h2>
