      <p>Russian is a <!--del_lnk--> Slavic language in the Indo-European family. From the point of view of the <!--del_lnk--> spoken language, its closest relatives are <!--del_lnk--> Ukrainian and <!--del_lnk--> Belarusian, the other two national languages in the <!--del_lnk--> East Slavic group. (Some academics also consider <!--del_lnk--> Rusyn an East Slavic language; others consider Rusyn just a dialect.) In many places in <a href="../../wp/u/Ukraine.htm" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Belarus.htm" title="Belarus">Belarus</a>, these languages are spoken interchangeably, and in certain areas traditional bilinguism resulted in language mixture, e.g. Surzhik in central Ukraine.<p>The basic vocabulary, principles of word-formation, and, to some extent, inflections and literary style of Russian have been heavily influenced by <!--del_lnk--> Church Slavonic, a developed and partly adopted form of the <!--del_lnk--> South Slavic <!--del_lnk--> Old Church Slavonic language used by the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Orthodox Church. Many words in modern literary Russian are closer in form to the modern <!--del_lnk--> Bulgarian language than to Ukrainian or Belarusian. However, the East Slavic forms have tended to remain in the various dialects that are experiencing a rapid decline. In some cases, both the <!--del_lnk--> East Slavic and the <!--del_lnk--> Church Slavonic forms are in use, with slightly different meanings. <i>For details, see <!--del_lnk--> Russian phonology and <!--del_lnk--> History of the Russian language.</i><p>Russian phonology and syntax (especially in northern dialects) have also been influenced to some extent by the numerous Finnic languages of the <!--del_lnk--> Finno-Ugric subfamily: <!--del_lnk--> Merya, <!--del_lnk--> Moksha, <!--del_lnk--> Muromian, the language of the <!--del_lnk--> Meshchera, <!--del_lnk--> Veps etc. These languages, some of them now extinct, used to be spoken right in the centre and in the north of what is now the European part of Russia. They came in contact with Eastern Slavic as far back as the early Middle Ages and eventually served as substratum for the modern Russian language. The Russian dialects spoken north, north-east and north-west of Moscow have a considerable number of words of Finno-Ugric origin.  <p>Outside the Slavic languages, the vocabulary and literary style of Russian have been greatly influenced by <!--del_lnk--> Greek, <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a>, and <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a>. Modern Russian also has a considerable number of words adopted from <!--del_lnk--> Tatar and some other Turkic languages.<p>According to the <!--del_lnk--> Defense Language Institute in <!--del_lnk--> Monterey, California, Russian is classified as a level III language in terms of learning difficulty for native English speakers, requiring approximately 780 hours of immersion instruction to achieve intermediate fluency. It is also regarded by the <!--del_lnk--> United States Intelligence Community as a &quot;hard target&quot; language, due to both its difficulty to master for English speakers as well as due to its critical role in American foreign policy.<p><a id="Geographic_distribution" name="Geographic_distribution"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geographic distribution</span></h2>
      <p>Russian is primarily spoken in <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> and, to a lesser extent, the other countries that were once constituent republics of the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">USSR</a>. Until 1917, it was the sole official language of the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Empire. During the Soviet period, the policy toward the languages of the various other ethnic groups fluctuated in practice. Though each of the constituent republics had its own official language, the unifying role and superior status was reserved for Russian. Following the break-up of 1991, several of the newly independent states have encouraged their native languages, which has partly reversed the privileged status of Russian, though its role as the language of post-Soviet national intercourse throughout the region has continued.<p>In <a href="../../wp/l/Latvia.htm" title="Latvia">Latvia</a>, notably, its official recognition and legality in the classroom have been a topic of considerable debate in a country where more than one-third of the population is Russian-speaking, consisting mostly of post-<a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> immigrants from Russia and other parts of the former <!--del_lnk--> USSR (Belarus, Ukraine). Similarly, in <a href="../../wp/e/Estonia.htm" title="Estonia">Estonia</a>, the Soviet-era immigrants and their Russian-speaking descendants constitute about one quarter of the country&#39;s current population.<p>A much smaller Russian-speaking minority in <a href="../../wp/l/Lithuania.htm" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> has largely been assimilated during the decade of independence and currently represent less than 1/10 of the country&#39;s overall population. Nevertheless, around 80% of the population of the Baltic states are able to hold a conversation in Russian and almost all have at least some familiarity with the most basic spoken and written phrases. The Russian occupation of <a href="../../wp/f/Finland.htm" title="Finland">Finland</a> in 1809-1918, however, has left few Russian speakers to Finland. There are 33400 Russian speakers in Finland, amounting to 0.6% of the population. 5000 (0.1%) of them are late 19th century and 20th century immigrants, and the rest are recent immigrants, who have arrived in the 90&#39;s and later.<p>In the twentieth century it was widely taught in the schools of the members of the old <!--del_lnk--> Warsaw Pact and in other <!--del_lnk--> countries that used to be satellites of the USSR. In particular, these countries include <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Poland</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Bulgaria.htm" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, the <a href="../../wp/c/Czech_Republic.htm" title="Czech Republic">Czech Republic</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Slovakia.htm" title="Slovakia">Slovakia</a>, <a href="../../wp/h/Hungary.htm" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>, <a href="../../wp/r/Romania.htm" title="Romania">Romania</a>, and <a href="../../wp/a/Albania.htm" title="Albania">Albania</a>. However, younger generations are usually not fluent in it, because Russian is no longer mandatory in the school system. It was, and to a lesser extent still is, widely taught in Asian countries such as <a href="../../wp/l/Laos.htm" title="Laos">Laos</a>, <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, and <a href="../../wp/m/Mongolia.htm" title="Mongolia">Mongolia</a> due to Soviet influence. Russian is still used as a <!--del_lnk--> lingua franca in <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> by a few tribes. It was also taught as the mandatory foreign language requisite in the <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">People&#39;s Republic of China</a> before the <!--del_lnk--> Sino-Soviet Split.<p>Russian is also spoken in <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israel</a> by at least 750,000 ethnic <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jew">Jewish</a> immigrants from the former <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> (1999 census). The Israeli <a href="../../wp/m/Mass_media.htm" title="Mass media">press</a> and <!--del_lnk--> websites regularly publish material in Russian.<p>Sizeable Russian-speaking communities also exist in <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>, especially in large urban centers of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">U.S.</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a> such as <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Boston%252C_Massachusetts.htm" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Los_Angeles%252C_California.htm" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a>, <!--del_lnk--> San Francisco, <!--del_lnk--> Seattle, <a href="../../wp/t/Toronto.htm" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Baltimore, <a href="../../wp/m/Miami%252C_Florida.htm" title="Miami, Florida">Miami</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Chicago.htm" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, and the <a href="../../wp/c/Cleveland%252C_Ohio.htm" title="Cleveland, Ohio">Cleveland</a> suburb of <!--del_lnk--> Richmond Heights. In the former two Russian-speaking groups total over half a million. In a number of locations they issue their own newspapers, and live in their self-sufficient neighborhoods (especially the generation of immigrants who started arriving in the early sixties). It is important to note, however, that only about a quarter of them are ethnic Russians. Before the <!--del_lnk--> dissolution of the Soviet Union, the overwhelming majority of <!--del_lnk--> Russophones in North America were Russian-speaking <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jews">Jews</a>. Afterwards the influx from the countries of the former <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> changed the statistics somewhat. According to the <!--del_lnk--> United States 2000 Census, Russian is the primary language spoken in the homes of over 700,000 individuals living in the United States.<p>Significant Russian-speaking groups also exist in <!--del_lnk--> Western Europe. These have been fed by several waves of immigrants since the beginning of the twentieth century, each with its own flavour of language. <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Belgium.htm" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greece</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> have significant Russian-speaking communities totaling 3 million people.<p>Two thirds of them are actually Russian-speaking descendants of <!--del_lnk--> Germans, <!--del_lnk--> Greeks, <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jews">Jews</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Armenians, or <!--del_lnk--> Ukrainians who either repatriated after the <!--del_lnk--> USSR collapsed or are just looking for temporary employment. But many are well-off Russian families acquiring property and getting an education.<p>Earlier, the descendants of the Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;s tended to lose the tongue of their ancestors by the third generation. Now, when the border is more open, Russian is likely to survive longer, especially when many of the emigrants visit their homelands at least once a year and also have access to Russian websites and TV channels.<p>Recent estimates of the total number of speakers of Russian:<table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">

Others divide the language into three groupings, Northern, Central and Southern, with Moscow lying in the Central region. <!--del_lnk--> Dialectology within Russia recognizes dozens of smaller-scale variants.<p>The dialects often show distinct and non-standard features of pronunciation and intonation, vocabulary, and grammar. Some of these are relics of ancient usage now completely discarded by the standard language. Also cf. Moscow pronunciation of &quot;-&#x447;&#x43D;-&quot;, e.g. <b>&#x431;&#x443;&#x43B;&#x43E;&#x448;&#x43D;&#x430;&#x44F;</b> (<i>buloshnaya</i> - bakery) instead of <b>&#x431;&#x443;&#x43B;&#x43E;&#x447;&#x43D;&#x430;&#x44F;</b> (<i>bulochnaya</i>).<p>The <!--del_lnk--> northern Russian dialects and those spoken along the <a href="../../wp/v/Volga_River.htm" title="Volga River">Volga River</a> typically pronounce unstressed <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/o/</span> clearly (the phenomenon called <!--del_lnk--> okanye <i>&#x43E;&#x43A;&#x430;&#x43D;&#x44C;&#x435;</i>). East of Moscow, particularly in <!--del_lnk--> Ryazan Region, unstressed <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/e/</span> and <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/a/</span> following <!--del_lnk--> palatalized consonants and preceding a stressed syllabus are not reduced to <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[&#x26A;]</span> (unlike in the Moscow dialect) and are instead pronounced as <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/a/</span> in such positions (e.g. &#x43D;&#x435;&#x441;&#x43B;<b>&#x438;</b> is pronounced as <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[n&#x2B2;as&#x2C8;l&#x2B2;i]</span>, not as <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[n&#x2B2;is&#x2C8;l&#x2B2;i]</span>) - this is called <!--del_lnk--> yakanye <b>&#x44F;&#x43A;&#x430;&#x43D;&#x44C;&#x435;</b>; many southern dialects palatalize the final <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/t/</span> in 3rd person forms of verbs and debuccalize the <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/g/</span> into <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[&#x266;]</span>. However, in certain areas south of Moscow, e.g. in and around <!--del_lnk--> Tula, <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/g/</span> is pronounced as in the Moscow and northern dialects unless it precedes a voiceless plosive or a silent pause. In this position <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/g/</span> is debuccalized and devoiced to the fricative <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[x]</span>, e.g. &#x434;&#x440;&#x443;&#x433; <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[drux]</span> (in Moscow&#39;s dialect, only &#x411;&#x43E;&#x433; <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[box]</span>, &#x43B;&#x451;&#x433;&#x43A;&#x438;&#x439; <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[l&#x2B2;ox&#x2B2;k&#x2B2;ij]</span>, &#x43C;&#x44F;&#x433;&#x43A;&#x438;&#x439; <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[&#x2C8;m&#x2B2;ax&#x2B2;k&#x2B2;&#x26A;j]</span> and some derivatives follow this rule). Some of these features (e.g. the debuccalized <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/g/</span> and palatalized final <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/t/</span> in 3rd person forms of verbs) are also present in modern <!--del_lnk--> Ukrainian, indicating either a linguistic continuum or strong influence one way or the other.<p>The town of <!--del_lnk--> Velikiy Novgorod has historically displayed a feature called chokanye/tsokanye (&#x447;&#x43E;&#x43A;&#x430;&#x43D;&#x44C;&#x435;/&#x446;&#x43E;&#x43A;&#x430;&#x43D;&#x44C;&#x435;), where <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/&#x2A8;/</span> and <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/&#x2A6;/</span> were confused (this is thought to be due to influence from <!--del_lnk--> Finnish, which doesn&#39;t distinguish these sounds). So, <b>&#x446;</b>&#x430;&#x43F;&#x43B;&#x44F; (&quot;heron&quot;) has been recorded as &#39;&#x447;&#x430;&#x43F;&#x43B;&#x44F;&#39;. Also, the second palatalization of <!--del_lnk--> velars did not occur there, so the so-called <b>&#x11B;&sup2;</b> (from the Proto-Slavonic diphthong *ai) did not cause <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/k, g, x/</span> to shift to <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/&#x2A6;, &#x2A3;, s/</span>; therefore where <!--del_lnk--> Standard Russian has <b>&#x446;</b>&#x435;&#x43F;&#x44C; (&quot;chain&quot;), the form <b>&#x43A;</b>&#x435;&#x43F;&#x44C; <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">kep&#x2B2;</span> is attested in earlier texts.<p>Among the first to study Russian dialects was <!--del_lnk--> Lomonosov in the eighteenth century. In the nineteenth, <!--del_lnk--> Vladimir Dal compiled the first dictionary that included dialectal vocabulary. Detailed mapping of Russian dialects began at the turn of the twentieth century. In modern times, the monumental <i>Dialectological Atlas of the Russian Language</i> (<i>&#x414;&#x438;&#x430;&#x43B;&#x435;&#x43A;&#x442;&#x43E;&#x43B;&#x43E;&#x433;&#x438;&#x447;&#x435;&#x441;&#x43A;&#x438;&#x439; &#x430;&#x442;&#x43B;&#x430;&#x441; &#x440;&#x443;&#x441;&#x441;&#x43A;&#x43E;&#x433;&#x43E; &#x44F;&#x437;&#x44B;&#x43A;&#x430;</i> <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[d&#x2B2;&#x28C;&#x28C;&#x2CC;l&#x2B2;&#x25B;kt&#x259;l&#x28C;&#x2C8;g&#x2B2;i&#x2A8;&#x26A;sk&#x2B2;&#x26A;j &#x2C8;atl&#x259;s &#x2C8;rusk&#x259;v&#x259; j&#x26A;z&#x268;&#x2C8;ka]</span>), was published in 3 folio volumes 1986-1989, after four decades of preparatory work.<p>The <i>standard language</i> is based on (but not identical to) the Moscow dialect.<p><a id="Derived_languages" name="Derived_languages"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Derived languages</span></h3>

      <p>Russian spelling is reasonably phonemic in practice. It is in fact a balance among phonemics, morphology, etymology, and grammar; and, like that of most living languages, has its share of inconsistencies and controversial points.<p>The current spelling follows the major reform of 1918, and the final codification of 1956. An update proposed in the late 1990&#39;s has met a hostile reception, and has not been formally adopted.<p>The punctuation, originally based on Byzantine Greek, was in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries reformulated on the French and German models.<p><a id="Sounds" name="Sounds"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sounds</span></h2>

      <p>The phonological system of Russian is inherited from <!--del_lnk--> Common Slavonic, but underwent considerable modification in the early historical period, before being largely settled by about 1400.<p>The language possesses five vowels, which are written with different letters depending on whether or not the preceding consonant is <!--del_lnk--> palatalized. The consonants typically come in plain vs. palatalized pairs, which are traditionally called <i>hard</i> and <i>soft.</i> (The <i>hard</i> consonants are often <!--del_lnk--> velarized, especially before back vowels, although in some dialects the velarization is limited to hard <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/l/</span>). The standard language, based on the Moscow dialect, possesses heavy stress and moderate variation in pitch. Stressed vowels are somewhat lengthened, while unstressed vowels tend to be reduced to near-close vowels or an unclear <!--del_lnk--> schwa. (See also: <!--del_lnk--> akanye.)<p>The Russian <!--del_lnk--> syllable structure can be quite complex with both initial and final consonant clusters of up to 4 consecutive sounds. Using a formula with V standing for the nucleus (vowel) and C for each consonant the structure can be described as follows:<p>(C)(C)(C)(C)V(C)(C)(C)(C)<p><a id="Consonants" name="Consonants"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Consonants</span></h3>

      <p>Russian is notable for its distinction based on <!--del_lnk--> palatalization of most of the consonants. While <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/k/, /g/, /x/</span> do have palatalized <!--del_lnk--> allophones <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[k&#x2B2;, g&#x2B2;, x&#x2B2;]</span>, only <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/k&#x2B2;/</span> might be considered a phoneme, though it is marginal and generally not considered distinctive (the only native <!--del_lnk--> minimal pair which argues for <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/k&#x2B2;/</span> to be a separate phoneme is &quot;&#x44D;&#x442;&#x43E; &#x442;&#x43A;&#x451;&#x442;&quot;/&quot;&#x44D;&#x442;&#x43E;&#x442; &#x43A;&#x43E;&#x442;&quot;). Palatalization means that the centre of the tongue is raised during and after the articulation of the consonant. In the case of <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/t&#x2B2;/ and /d&#x2B2;/</span>, the tongue is raised enough to produce slight frication (affricate sounds). These sounds: <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/t, d, &#x2A6;, s, z, n and r&#x2B2;/</span> are <!--del_lnk--> dental, that is pronounced with the tip of the tongue against the teeth rather than against the <!--del_lnk--> alveolar ridge.<p><a id="Grammar" name="Grammar"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Grammar</span></h2>

      <p>Russian has preserved an <!--del_lnk--> Indo-European <!--del_lnk--> synthetic-<!--del_lnk--> inflectional structure, although considerable levelling has taken place.<p>Russian grammar encompasses<ul>
       <li>a highly <!--del_lnk--> synthetic <b>morphology</b><li>a <b>syntax</b> that, for the literary language, is the conscious fusion of three elements: <ul>
         <li>a polished <!--del_lnk--> vernacular foundation;<li>a <!--del_lnk--> Church Slavonic inheritance;<li>a <!--del_lnk--> Western European style.</ul>
      </ul>
      <p>The spoken language has been influenced by the literary one, but continues to preserve characteristic forms. The dialects show various non-standard grammatical features, some of which are archaisms or descendants of old forms since discarded by the literary language.<p><a id="Vocabulary" name="Vocabulary"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Vocabulary</span></h2>

      <p>Philologists have estimated that the language today may contain as many as 350,000 to 500,000 words.<p>(As a historical aside, <!--del_lnk--> Dahl was, in the second half of the nineteenth century, still insisting that the proper spelling of the adjective <b>&#x440;&#x443;&#x441;&#x441;&#x43A;&#x438;&#x439;</b>, which was at that time applied uniformly to all the Orthodox Eastern Slavic subjects of the Empire, as well as to its one official language, be spelled <b>&#x440;&#x443;&#x441;&#x43A;&#x438;&#x439;</b> with one s, in accordance with ancient tradition and what he termed the &quot;spirit of the language&quot;.

      <p>The Russian language is replete with many hundreds of proverbs (<b>&#x43F;&#x43E;&#x441;&#x43B;&#x43E;&#x432;&#x438;&#x446;&#x430;</b> <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[p&#x28C;&#x2C8;slo.v&#x2B2;&#x26A;.&#x2A6;&#x259;]</span>) and sayings (<b>&#x43F;&#x43E;&#x433;&#x43E;&#x432;&#x43E;&#x440;&#x43A;a</b> <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[p&#x259;.g&#x28C;&#x2C8;vo.rk&#x259;]</span>). These were already tabulated by the seventeenth century, and collected and studied in the nineteenth and twentieth, with the folk-tales being an especially fertile source.<p><a id="History_and_examples" name="History_and_examples"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History and examples</span></h2>
      <p>The history of Russian language may be divided into the following periods.<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Kievan period and feudal breakup<li><!--del_lnk--> The Moscovite period (15th-17th centuries)<li><!--del_lnk--> Empire (18th-19th centuries)<li><!--del_lnk--> Soviet period and beyond (20th century)</ul>
      <p>Judging by the historical records, by approximately 1000 AD the predominant ethnic group over much of modern European <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="../../wp/u/Ukraine.htm" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, and <a href="../../wp/b/Belarus.htm" title="Belarus">Belarus</a> was the Eastern branch of the <!--del_lnk--> Slavs, speaking a closely related group of dialects. The political unification of this region into <!--del_lnk--> Kievan Rus&#39;, from which both modern Russia and Ukraine trace their origins, was soon followed by the adoption of <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> in 988-9 and the establishment of <!--del_lnk--> Old Church Slavonic as the liturgical and literary language. Borrowings and calques from Byzantine <!--del_lnk--> Greek began to enter the vernacular at this time, and simultaneously the literary language began to be modified in its turn to become more nearly Eastern Slavic.<p>Dialectal differentiation accelerated after the breakup of Kievan Rus&#39; in approximately 1100, and the Mongol conquest of the thirteenth century. After the disestablishment of the &quot;Tartar yoke&quot; in the late fourteenth century, both the political centre and the predominant dialect in European Russia came to be based in <a href="../../wp/m/Moscow.htm" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>. There is some consensus that Russian and Ukrainian can be considered distinct languages from this period <i>at the latest</i>. The official language remained a kind of Church Slavonic until the close of the seventeenth century, but, despite attempts at standardization, as by <!--del_lnk--> Meletius Smotrytsky c.&nbsp;1620, its purity was by then strongly compromised by an incipient secular literature.<p>The political reforms of <a href="../../wp/p/Peter_I_of_Russia.htm" title="Peter I of Russia">Peter the Great</a> were accompanied by a reform of the alphabet, and achieved their goal of secularization and Westernization. Blocks of specialized vocabulary were adopted from the languages of Western Europe. By 1800, a significant portion of the gentry spoke <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a>, less often <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a>, on an everyday basis. Many Russian novels of the 19th century, e.g. Lev Tolstoy&#39;s &quot;War and Peace&quot; contain entire paragraphs and even pages in French with no translation given, with an assumption that educated readers won&#39;t need one.<p>The modern literary language is usually considered to date from the time of <a href="../../wp/a/Aleksandr_Pushkin.htm" title="Aleksandr Pushkin">Aleksandr Pushkin</a> in the first third of the nineteenth century. Pushkin revolutionized Russian literature by rejecting archaic grammar and vocabulary (so called &quot;&#x432;&#x44B;&#x441;&#x43E;&#x43A;&#x438;&#x439; &#x448;&#x442;&#x438;&#x43B;&#x44C;&quot; - &quot;high style&quot;) in favour of grammar and vocabulary found in the spoken language of the time. Nevertheless, modern readers, especially of younger age may experience slight difficulty fully understanding Pushkin&#39;s texts, since many words used by Pushkin became archaic or changed meaning. E.g. &quot;&#x411;&#x440;&#x430;&#x437;&#x434;&#x44B; &#x43F;&#x443;&#x448;&#x438;&#x441;&#x442;&#x44B;&#x435; &#x432;&#x437;&#x440;&#x44B;&#x432;&#x430;&#x44F;, &#x41B;&#x435;&#x442;&#x438;&#x442; &#x43A;&#x438;&#x431;&#x438;&#x442;&#x43A;&#x430; &#x443;&#x434;&#x430;&#x43B;&#x430;&#x44F;&quot; (&quot;dashing carriage flies plowing fluffy furrows [in the snow]&quot;) may be misunderstood by modern reader as &quot;[Unknown object] flies and blows up fluffy reins&quot;).<div class="medialist listenlist">

      <p>The political upheavals of the early twentieth century and the wholesale changes of political ideology gave written Russian its modern appearance after the spelling reform of 1918. Political circumstances and Soviet accomplishments in military, scientific, and technological matters (especially cosmonautics), gave Russian a world-wide if occasionally grudging prestige, especially during the middle third of the twentieth century.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language&quot;</div>
