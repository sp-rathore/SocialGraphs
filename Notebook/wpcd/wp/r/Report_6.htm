<h2>Seeing Beyond Violence: Main report text</h2>
<p>Objectives and Methodology<br />10<br />&middot; Female genital mutilation<br />&quot;Estimates of the total number of women living today who have been subjected to<br />FGM/C in Africa range between 100 and 130 million. Given current birth rates this<br />means that some 2 million girls are at risk of some form of female genital mutilation e-<br />very year. Most of the girls and women who have undergone FGM/C live in 28 African<br />countries, although some live in Asia. They are also increasingly found in Europe, Aus-<br />tralia, Canada and the USA, primarily among immigrants from Africa and southwestern<br />Asia.&quot;14<br />&middot; Juvenile justice<br />&quot;Children in detention often suffer severe violations of their basic rights. Arrest, deten-<br />tion and sentencing are often arbitrary and sometimes even illegal - the results of extra-<br />judicial proceedings by police or military systems in which no civil protections exist. De-<br />tained children can be below the age of criminal responsibility and kept with adult pris-<br />oners who may abuse them.&quot;15<br />It is clear that there is an extensive research literature on different aspects of violence, and<br />especially its effects on the lives of children, and that this literature broadens the topic to<br />include child mortality, malnutrition, HIV/Aids, poverty, genocide16 as well as political<br />violence17, which can all be framed as violence against children.<br />The motive for much of this research is to create the basis of a world in which violence is<br />reduced, eliminated, or no longer necessary. To create a world in which there is no vio-<br />lence against children is a great aim. But, since violence, in some form, is so engrained in<br />almost all cultures and social structures, just to raise the possibility of a world without<br />violence immediately prompts questions about what such a world would look like. For<br />most of us, to eliminate, or even just to reduce, violence is as far as our imagination takes<br />us. The ideal future we imagine is one in which violence is absent. The implicit assump-<br />tion we make is that a world without violence would be like the world we have now, but it<br />would be a better and more harmonious place.<br />Perhaps so, but it would also be very different to the world we know, because to remove<br />facets of society that are so deeply part of its structure would inevitably lead to change.<br />Changes that we find it difficult to predict. At the least we would expect to find new cul-<br />tural forms emerging, but we would also expect changes in some of our basic institutions<br />&shy; the family, schools and work.<br />How might we begin to imagine such a world?<br />In this study we did not set out to add to the accumulated evidence on violence against<br />children but to try and turn the instruments of research around so that we could see the<br />world as children see it. One aspect of the problem, we believe, is that to continue to add<br />to the research on violence against children, important as it is to do so, risks the conse-</p><p>14 ibid: Female genital mutilation. http://www.unicef.org/protection/index_genitalmutilation.html<br />15 ibid: Juvenile Justice. http://www.unicef.org/protection/index_juveniljustice.html<br />16 Kent, George (1999) Structural Violence against Children.

In this study we set out to ask children to help us imagine fac-<br />ets of the world as they want it to be, not in abstract or futuristic terms but in terms cir-<br />cumscribed by their lives. We chose groups of children in four countries, Nicaragua, Co-<br />lombia, Thailand and India who shared the fact that they had been orphaned or aban-<br />doned and were growing up in SOS Children's Villages. We asked them to tell us about the<br />aspects of their lives that they most valued. We explained to them that most languages do<br />not have a word which describes `the opposite of violence', only words that are negatives<br />`absence of violence' and `non-violence', or words that are used so indiscriminately as to<br />be almost meaningless, like `love' and `peace'.<br />We knew that to ask children to respond to these questions in words alone was too ab-<br />stract and too difficult and so we asked them to approach the task through images. We<br />gave them digital cameras and asked them to photograph the most positive aspects of their<br />lives, the things that were important to them, the things (people and places) that they<br />loved, where they felt secure/protected and the things that were fun. Some of them we<br />asked to select those photos that were of highest importance for them and to explain to us<br />why and to write down their words. We asked them to share their images and to talk about<br />them and it is the results of this project that we will report here.<br />2.1.2 Participation<br />of Children in Research<br />One of the most commonly encountered forms of structural violence involves collecting<br />information from people and removing it for analysis, interpretation and application.<br />Whatever the intentions of the researcher, and however carefully ethical issues are consid-<br />ered, this is a form of alienation that is increasingly common in all societies and an en-<br />demic problem in most research.<br />In this study we wanted to find ways of working in which information, and its interpreta-<br />tion and application, are shared (as far as possible) with those who provide it. The guiding<br />principle we adopted is that `people own the facts of their lives', and that this sense of<br />ownership should be respected. There are of course costs in doing this. The process of<br />research has to be open, which means that the project has to be localised if relationships<br />are to be established, time has to be given to establishing these relationships, and the pro-<br />ject has to be open to adaptation and change as those who are its subjects become in-<br />volved in its process and understand its aims and purposes.<br />This is a qualitative study, but it is qualitative, not because we have a commitment to<br />qualitative methods, but because the principles of participation require that we work in<br />ways that make participation possible. We chose to work with digital photography because<br />this provides the basis for methods that are transparent, that involve children and adults<br />directly and immediately in collecting, interpreting and using information without the need<br />for extensive training, understanding of theory or knowledge of the research literature.</p>
