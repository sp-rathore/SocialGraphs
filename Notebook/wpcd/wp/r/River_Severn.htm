      <p>The <b>River Severn</b> (<!--del_lnk--> Welsh: <i>Afon <!--del_lnk--> Hafren</i>) is the longest <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <a href="../../wp/r/River.htm" title="River">river</a>, at 354 kilometres (219 miles) long<!--del_lnk--> ; it rises at an altitude of 610 metres on <!--del_lnk--> Plynlimon near <!--del_lnk--> Llanidloes, in the <!--del_lnk--> Cambrian Mountains, <!--del_lnk--> Mid Wales, and it passes through a number of English counties, with the <!--del_lnk--> county towns of <!--del_lnk--> Shrewsbury, <!--del_lnk--> Worcester, and <!--del_lnk--> Gloucester located on its banks. The Severn becomes the <!--del_lnk--> Bristol Channel at its <!--del_lnk--> estuary, eventually discharging into the <!--del_lnk--> celtic Sea and the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>. With an average discharge of 107 m&sup3;/s at <i>Hawbridge</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Gloucestershire), the Severn is <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>&#39;s largest river in terms of water flow.

      <p>According to some sources, the name &quot;Severn&quot; is derived from the name Sabrina or (<!--del_lnk--> Hafren), based on the <!--del_lnk--> mythical story of the drowning of a nymph in the river. Sabrina is also the goddess of the River Severn in <!--del_lnk--> Brythonic mythology. The story of Sabrina is featured in <a href="../../wp/j/John_Milton.htm" title="John Milton">Milton</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> <i>Comus</i>. There is a statue of &#39;Sabrina&#39; in the Dingle Gardens at the <!--del_lnk--> Quarry, <!--del_lnk--> Shrewsbury.<p>As the Severn becomes tidal the associated deity changes to <!--del_lnk--> Noadu, who (Romanized as <!--del_lnk--> Nodens) is represented mounted on a <!--del_lnk--> seahorse, riding on the crest of the Severn bore.<p><a id="Tributary_rivers" name="Tributary_rivers"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Tributary rivers</span></h2>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> River Stour rises in the north of Worcestershire in the <!--del_lnk--> Clent Hills, near St Kenelm&#39;s Church at Frankley. It flows north into the adjacent <!--del_lnk--> West Midlands at <!--del_lnk--> Halesowen. It then flows westwards through <!--del_lnk--> Cradley Heath and <!--del_lnk--> Stourbridge where it leaves the <!--del_lnk--> Black Country. It is joined by the Smestow Brook at Prestwood before it winds around southwards to <!--del_lnk--> Kinver, and then flows back into Worcestershire. It then passes through <!--del_lnk--> Wolverley, <!--del_lnk--> Kidderminster and <!--del_lnk--> Wilden to join the Severn at <!--del_lnk--> Stourport-on-Severn.<p>A tributary of the Severn, called the <!--del_lnk--> River Teme, joins it just below <!--del_lnk--> Worcester and above <!--del_lnk--> Kempsey.<p>One of the several rivers named <!--del_lnk--> Avon joins the Severn at <!--del_lnk--> Tewkesbury, <!--del_lnk--> Gloucestershire. That same Avon also flows through <a href="../../wp/s/Stratford-upon-Avon.htm" title="Stratford-upon-Avon">Stratford-upon-Avon</a>.<p>The port of <a href="../../wp/b/Bristol.htm" title="Bristol">Bristol</a> is located at the mouth of the Severn, where another <!--del_lnk--> River Avon flows into it. The <!--del_lnk--> River Wye flows into the Severn slightly upstream of the Avon and forms the boundary between England, specifically the <!--del_lnk--> Forest of Dean, and <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a>, with the town of <!--del_lnk--> Chepstow (Casgwent in Welsh) at the confluence, giving an important strategic position in yester-year and was the main route into South Wales, before the two bridges were built.<p><a id="Transport" name="Transport"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transport</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Bridges" name="Bridges"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Bridges</span></h3>
      <p>The two bridges of the <a href="../../wp/s/Severn_crossing.htm" title="Severn crossing">Severn crossing</a> carrying roads (opened in <!--del_lnk--> 1966 and <!--del_lnk--> 1996) link <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a> with the southern counties of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> and are among the most important in Britain. The Severn is bridged at many places, and many of these bridges are notable in their own right, with several designed and built by the engineer <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Telford. (See <!--del_lnk--> List of Severn bridges for more.) There also is the very famous <!--del_lnk--> Ironbridge at <!--del_lnk--> Coalbrookdale, which is the first ever Iron Bridge in the world.<p><a id="Disasters" name="Disasters"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Disasters</span></h3>
      <p>There have been many <!--del_lnk--> disasters on the Severn, making it Britain&#39;s most dangerous river. It has claimed many lives, especially during the 20th century.<p><a id="Locks" name="Locks"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Locks</span></h3>
      <p>There are locks on the lower Severn to enable sea going boats as far as <!--del_lnk--> Stourport. The most northerly lock is at Lincombe about a mile downstream from Stourport.<p><a id="Tunnels" name="Tunnels"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Tunnels</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Severn Tunnel carries the <!--del_lnk--> Great Western Main Line under the large estuary.<p><a id="Associated_canals" name="Associated_canals"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Associated canals</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, the <!--del_lnk--> Worcester and Birmingham Canal, and the <!--del_lnk--> Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal all join the Severn at <!--del_lnk--> Stourport, <!--del_lnk--> Worcester and <!--del_lnk--> Gloucester respectively. The <!--del_lnk--> Droitwich Barge Canal used to join the Severn at <!--del_lnk--> Hawford, near to the <!--del_lnk--> River Salwarpe and it hoped that a new link to the Severn via the Salwarpe will be re-established in the future.<p><a id="Paddle_Steamers" name="Paddle_Steamers"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Paddle Steamers</span></h3>
      <p>The main operator of pleasure craft and particularly <!--del_lnk--> Paddle Steamers on the river from the mid-1800&#39;s to the late 1970&#39;s were <!--del_lnk--> P and A Campbell of <a href="../../wp/b/Bristol.htm" title="Bristol">Bristol</a>, but also included the <!--del_lnk--> Barry Railway Company. There were also three ferries operating between Aust and Chepstow these were called the Severn King, Severn Queen and Severn Princess. The Severn Princess is <!--del_lnk--> currently undergoing restoration after being found in Ireland full of fertiliser, after dragging her back with her sinking twice on the way it is hoped that at some time in the near future she will be fully operational again. The Severn King and Queen were scrapped not long after their decommmision following the completion of the First Severn Bridge.<p><a id="Tidal_bore" name="Tidal_bore"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Tidal bore</span></h2>
      <p>A curious phenomenon associated with the lower reaches of the Severn is the <a href="../../wp/t/Tide.htm" title="Tide">tidal</a> phenomenon known as the <!--del_lnk--> bore. The bore forms somewhat upstream of the Port of <!--del_lnk--> Sharpness, which is also the Southern terminus of the <!--del_lnk--> Gloucester and Sharpness Canal.<p>The river&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> estuary, part of the <!--del_lnk--> Bristol Channel, has the second largest <!--del_lnk--> tidal range in the world &mdash; about <!--del_lnk--> 15 <!--del_lnk--> metres, exceeded only by the <!--del_lnk--> Bay of Fundy in <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a> &mdash; and at spring tides, the rising water is funnelled up the estuary into a wave that travels rapidly upstream against the river current; enthusiasts even attempt to <!--del_lnk--> surf along on the wave, which can be 2 m high. In 2006, a world record surf was achieved, for the longest-ever &#39;surf&#39;, by Steve King, a railway engineer from <!--del_lnk--> Gloucestershire, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>. (Note that the Gloucester Harbour Trustees, as competent harbour authority for this part of the river, explicitly advise against this pastime.) Being the onset of the flood tide it is accompanied by a rapid rise in water level which continues for about one and a half hours after the bore has passed. The Severn Bore is a natural example of a self-reinforcing solitary wave or <!--del_lnk--> soliton.<p><a id="Tidal_Power" name="Tidal_Power"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Tidal Power</span></h2>

      <p>The huge tidal range (15m) and high level of surrounding industry and population have long made the Severn estuary a focus for <!--del_lnk--> tidal energy schemes and ideas. Plans for a <b>Severn Barrage</b> - running 16 km (10 miles) from Lavernock Point near to and south west of <a href="../../wp/c/Cardiff.htm" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> to Brean Down near and just south west of <!--del_lnk--> Weston Super Mare in Somerset - would generate a massive 8640 MW when the tide flows, and have been discussed for several decades now. The power generated, coming from a lake of 185 square miles and 14 m potential energy depth, would be equivalent to 12 nuclear power stations. Tidal power only runs for some 10 hours a day, but by using the enclosed lake as a reservoir of potential energy more hours of operation could be achieved. Other energy sources, such as wind and solar power, also create electricity at times that do not always match when it is needed. Excess power could be stored by pumping water uphill, as is already done at a variety of other installations in the UK.<p>The UK Government shelved the plans in the late 1980s due largely to cost issues and local environmental concerns. However, this was before recent huge rises in the price of energy, and before <a href="../../wp/g/Global_warming.htm" title="Global Warming">Global Warming</a> had started to be taken seriously. As of 2006 the idea has been revitalised and now looks likely to be implemented.<p>Because global warming and nuclear power station waste and decomissioning have such vast environmental effects, the small environmental impact of the Severn Barrage is an overall reduction in impact. Further work is required to decrease the environmental impact of the project.<p><a id="Industry" name="Industry"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Industry</span></h2>
      <p>A six-mile stretch of the Severn valley in <!--del_lnk--> Shropshire, known as the <!--del_lnk--> Ironbridge Gorge, was designated a <a href="../../wp/w/World_Heritage_Site.htm" title="World Heritage Site">World Heritage Site</a> by <!--del_lnk--> UNESCO in 1986. Its historic importance is due to its role as the centre of the <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a> industry in the early stages of Britain&#39;s <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>. Ironbridge gets its name from the bridge across the Severn, built in <!--del_lnk--> 1779, which was the first cast-iron bridge ever constructed.<p><a id="Wildlife" name="Wildlife"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Wildlife</span></h2>
      <p>The sides of the estuary are also important feeding grounds for <a href="../../wp/w/Wader.htm" title="Wader">waders</a>, notably at the <!--del_lnk--> Bridgwater Bay <!--del_lnk--> National Nature Reserve and the <!--del_lnk--> Slimbridge Wildfowl Trust.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Severn&quot;</div>
