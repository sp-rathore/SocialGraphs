      <p>Reza Pahlavi was born in the city of <!--del_lnk--> Alasht in <!--del_lnk--> Savad Kooh county, <!--del_lnk--> Mazandaran in 1878.

He was also one of the last individuals to become an Officer of the <!--del_lnk--> Nishan-e-Aqdas prior to the collapse of the <!--del_lnk--> Qajar dynasty in 1925.<p><a id="Rise_to_power" name="Rise_to_power"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Rise to power</span></h2>

The <!--del_lnk--> National Assembly of Iran, known as the <!--del_lnk--> Majlis, officially deposed the <!--del_lnk--> Qajar dynasty in 1925, four years after the coup had taken place. On <!--del_lnk--> December 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1925, the Majlis, convening as a <!--del_lnk--> constituent assembly, voted to crown Reza Pahlavi as the new <!--del_lnk--> Shah of Persia.<p>Three days later, on <!--del_lnk--> December 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1925, he took his imperial oath and thus became the first Shah of the Pahlavi dynasty. However, it would not be until <!--del_lnk--> April 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1926, that Reza Shah would receive his <!--del_lnk--> coronation and first place the <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Crown on his head.

      <p>During Reza Shah&#39;s sixteen years of rule, major developments, such as large road construction projects and the <!--del_lnk--> Trans-Iranian Railway were built, modern education was introduced and the <!--del_lnk--> University of Tehran was established. The government sponsored European educations for many Iranian students.<p>Under Reza Shah&#39;s watch, the country changed its name as well. According to The New York Times, &quot;At the suggestion of the Persian Legation in <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin.htm" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>, the Teheran government, on the <!--del_lnk--> Persian New Year, <!--del_lnk--> March 21, <!--del_lnk--> 1935, substituted Iran for Persia as the official name of the country. It has been suggested that this decision was the result of the Nazi revival of interest in the so-called <!--del_lnk--> Aryan races, cradled in ancient Persia. As the Ministry of Foreign Affairs set forth in its memorandum on the subject, &#39;Perse,&#39; the French designation of Persia, connoted the weakness and tottering independence of the country in the nineteenth century, when it was the chessboard of European imperialistic rivalry. &#39;Iran,&#39; by contrast, conjured up memories of the vigor and splendor of its historic past.&quot; The very name &ldquo;Iran&rdquo; means &ldquo;Land of the Aryans&rdquo;.<p>At the expense of religion, the Shah backed a strong policy of <!--del_lnk--> industrialization to ensure that the country was not dependent solely on its fossil fuel reserves and agricultural revenues. While Persia was once an advanced empire, the Iran of the early 20th century had become technologically backwards compared to the Western world. The Shah&#39;s new policies helped his country enter <!--del_lnk--> modern times.<p>Though his achievements were great, by the mid-1930s, Reza Shah&#39;s constructive, but dictatorial style of rule had caused intense dissatisfaction to the <!--del_lnk--> Shi&#39;a <!--del_lnk--> clergy throughout Iran, thus widening the gap between religion and government. He forbade photographing aspects of Iran he considered backwards, like <a href="../../wp/c/Camel.htm" title="Camel">camels</a>, he banned <!--del_lnk--> Iranian dress and <!--del_lnk--> chadors in favour of <!--del_lnk--> Western dress.  Women who resisted this compulsory unveiling had their veils forcibly removed. He dealt harshly with opposition: troops were sent to massacre protesters at mosques and <!--del_lnk--> nomads who refused to settle; newspapers were closed and liberals imprisoned. He also used his power to vastly increase his fortune, becoming the biggest landowner in Iran, proprietor of nearly three thousand villages, as well as many factories and enterprises.<p><a id="Deposition_and_death" name="Deposition_and_death"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Deposition and death</span></h2>
      <p>During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Britain had ignored protests from the Qajar rulers and stationed troops in the province of <!--del_lnk--> Khuzestan. When <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> began, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> again wished to station troops in Khuzestan.<p>Reza Shah had declared Iran neutral so it could reconstruct Iran as a modern state without having to deal with the Soviets and British, whom the Shah feared had plans to seize control of the country and its resources. Having previously declared neutrality, Reza Shah protested against this challenge to central government authority. Britain interpreted this refusal as favouring <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>, especially as the Shah refused the Allies the right to use the <!--del_lnk--> trans-Iranian railroad used to transport Western supplies to <!--del_lnk--> Stalin. Fearing that Reza Shah was about to align his <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a>-rich country with Nazi Germany during the war, the United Kingdom and the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> <!--del_lnk--> occupied Iran and forced Reza Shah to <!--del_lnk--> abdicate in favour of his son (<i>see also <!--del_lnk--> Persian Corridor</i>).<p>The Shah&#39;s son, <!--del_lnk--> Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, officially replaced his father on the throne on <!--del_lnk--> September 16, <!--del_lnk--> 1941. Reza Shah soon went into <!--del_lnk--> exile, first to <a href="../../wp/m/Mauritius.htm" title="Mauritius">Mauritius</a>, then to <a href="../../wp/j/Johannesburg.htm" title="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, where he died on <!--del_lnk--> July 26, <!--del_lnk--> 1944, aged 66. After his death, a mausoleum was built in his honour in Iran, where his body was buried. His son later designated the title &quot;the Great&quot; to be added to his name.<p>Following the <!--del_lnk--> Iranian Revolution in 1979, Reza Shah&#39;s mausoleum was destroyed under the direction of <!--del_lnk--> Ayatollah <!--del_lnk--> Sadeq Khalkhali, which was sanctioned by Ayatollah <!--del_lnk--> Ruhollah Khomeini.<p><a id="Family" name="Family"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Family</span></h2>
