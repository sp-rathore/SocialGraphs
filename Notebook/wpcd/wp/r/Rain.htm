      <p><b>Rain</b> is a form of <!--del_lnk--> precipitation, other forms of which include <a href="../../wp/s/Snow.htm" title="Snow">snow</a>, <!--del_lnk--> sleet, <!--del_lnk--> hail, and <!--del_lnk--> dew. Rain forms when separate drops of <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a> fall to the <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a>&#39;s surface from <a href="../../wp/c/Cloud.htm" title="Cloud">clouds</a>. Not all rain reaches the surface, however; some evaporates while falling through dry <a href="../../wp/e/Earth%2527s_atmosphere.htm" title="Air">air</a>. When none of it reaches the ground, it is called <!--del_lnk--> virga, a phenomenon often seen in hot, dry <a href="../../wp/d/Desert.htm" title="Desert">desert</a> regions. The scientific explanation of how rain forms and falls is called the <!--del_lnk--> Bergeron process.<p>

      <p>Rain plays a major role in the <!--del_lnk--> hydrologic cycle in which <!--del_lnk--> moisture from the <a href="../../wp/o/Ocean.htm" title="Ocean">oceans</a> evaporates, condenses into clouds, precipitates back to earth, and eventually returns to the ocean via streams and <a href="../../wp/r/River.htm" title="River">rivers</a> to repeat the cycle again. There is also a small amount of water vapor that respires from plants and evaporates to join other water molecules in condensing into clouds.<p>The amount of rainfall is measured using a <!--del_lnk--> rain gauge. It is expressed as the depth of water that collects on a flat surface, and can be measured to the nearest 0.27 mm or 0.01 in. It is sometimes expressed in litres per square metre (1 liter/m&sup2; = 1 mm).<p>Falling raindrops are often depicted in <!--del_lnk--> cartoons or <!--del_lnk--> anime as &quot;teardrop-shaped&quot;&nbsp;&mdash; round at the bottom and narrowing towards the top&nbsp;&mdash; but this is incorrect. Only drops of water dripping from some sources are tear-shaped at the moment of formation. Small raindrops are nearly <a href="../../wp/s/Sphere.htm" title="Sphere">spherical</a>. Larger ones become increasingly flattened on the bottom, like <!--del_lnk--> hamburger buns; very large ones are shaped like <!--del_lnk--> parachutes.The shape of raindrops was studied by <!--del_lnk--> Philipp Lenard in 1898. He found that small raindrops (less than about 2 mm diameter) are approximately spherical. As they get larger (to about 5 mm diameter) they become more doughnut-shaped. Beyond about 5 mm they become unstable and fragment. On average, raindrops are 1 to 2 mm in diameter. The biggest raindrops on Earth were recorded over <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> and the <a href="../../wp/m/Marshall_Islands.htm" title="Marshall Islands">Marshall Islands</a> in 2004&nbsp;&mdash; some of them were as large as 10 mm. The large size is explained by condensation on large <!--del_lnk--> smoke particles or by collisions between drops in small regions with particularly high content of liquid water.<p>Raindrops impact at their <!--del_lnk--> terminal velocity, which is greater for larger drops. At sea level and without wind, 0.5 mm <!--del_lnk--> drizzle impacts at about 2 m/s, while large 5 mm drops impact at around 9 m/s .<p>Generally, rain has a <!--del_lnk--> pH slightly under 6. This is because atmospheric <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> dissolves in the droplet to form minute quantities of <!--del_lnk--> carbonic acid, which then partially dissociates, lowering the pH. In some desert areas, airborne dust contains enough <!--del_lnk--> calcium carbonate to counter the natural acidity of precipitation, and rainfall can be neutral or even <!--del_lnk--> alkaline. Rain below pH 5.6 is considered <a href="../../wp/a/Acid_rain.htm" title="Acid rain">acid rain</a>.<p>Rain is said to be heavier immediately after a bolt of <!--del_lnk--> lightning. The cause of this phenomenon is traceable to the bipolar aspect of the water molecule. The intense electric and magnetic field generated by a lightning bolt forces many of the water molecules in the air surrounding the stroke to line up. These molecules then spontaneously create localized chains of water (similar to nylon or other &quot;poly&quot; molecules). These chains then form water droplets when the electric/magnetic field is removed. These drops then fall as intensified rain.<p><a id="Effect_on_agriculture" name="Effect_on_agriculture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Effect on agriculture</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Precipitation, especially rain, has a dramatic effect on <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>. All but perhaps a couple of <a href="../../wp/p/Plant.htm" title="Plant">plants</a> need at least some water to survive, therefore rain (being the most effective means of watering) is important to <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>. While a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy <a href="../../wp/p/Plant.htm" title="Plant">plants</a>, too much or too little rainfall can be harmful, even devastating to <!--del_lnk--> crops. <a href="../../wp/d/Drought.htm" title="Drought">Drought</a> can kill crops in massive numbers, while overly wet weather can cause disease and harmful <a href="../../wp/f/Fungus.htm" title="Fungus">fungus</a>. <a href="../../wp/p/Plant.htm" title="Plant">Plants</a> need varying amounts of <a href="../../wp/r/Rain.htm" title="Rainfall">rainfall</a> to survive. For example, cacti need small amounts of water while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of rain to survive.<p><a id="Human_influence" name="Human_influence"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Human influence</span></h2>
      <p>The fine particulate matter produced by car exhaust and other human sources of pollution form <!--del_lnk--> cloud condensation nuclei, leading to the production of clouds and increasing the likelihood of rain. As commuters and commercial traffic cause pollution to build up over the course of the week, the likelihood of rain increases: it peaks by Saturday, after five days of weekday pollution has been built up. In heavily populated areas that are near the coast, such as the United States&#39; <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Seaboard, the effect can be dramatic: there is a 22% higher chance of rain on Saturdays than on Mondays.<p>

      <p>Cultural attitudes towards rain differ across the world. In the largely <a href="../../wp/t/Temperate.htm" title="Temperate">temperate</a> <!--del_lnk--> Western world, rain metaphorically has a sad and negative connotation&nbsp;&mdash; reflected in children&#39;s rhymes like <!--del_lnk--> Rain Rain Go Away&nbsp;&mdash; in contrast to the bright and happy <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">sun</a>. Though the traditional notion of rain in the Western World is negative, rain can also bring joy, as some consider it to be soothing or enjoy the aesthetic appeal of it. In dry places, such as parts of <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, and the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, rain is greeted with <!--del_lnk--> euphoria. (In <a href="../../wp/b/Botswana.htm" title="Botswana">Botswana</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Setswana word for rain, &quot;pula,&quot; is used as <!--del_lnk--> the name of the national currency, in recognition of the economic importance of rain in this desert country.)<p>Several cultures have developed means of dealing with rain and have developed numerous protection devices such as <!--del_lnk--> umbrellas and <!--del_lnk--> raincoats, and diversion devices such as <!--del_lnk--> gutters and <!--del_lnk--> storm drains that lead rains to sewers. Many people also prefer to stay inside on rainy days, especially in tropical climates where rain is usually accompanied by <a href="../../wp/t/Thunderstorm.htm" title="Thunderstorm">thunderstorms</a> or rain is extremely heavy (<!--del_lnk--> monsoon). Rain may be <!--del_lnk--> harvested, though rainwater is rarely pure (as <a href="../../wp/a/Acid_rain.htm" title="Acid rain">acid rain</a> occurs naturally), or used as <!--del_lnk--> greywater. Excessive rain, particularly after a dry period has hardened the soil so that it cannot absorb water, can cause <a href="../../wp/f/Flood.htm" title="Flood">floods</a>.<p>Many people find the scent during and immediately after rain especially pleasant or distinctive. The source of this scent is <!--del_lnk--> petrichor, an oil produced by plants, then absorbed by rocks and soil, and later released into the air during rainfall. Light, or sometimes heavy, rain is sometimes also seen as romantic. Rain can also and always will be to some people very depressing due to bleak clouds.<p>A country noted for its raininess is the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. The reputation is partly deserved because of the frequency of rain driven into the country by the south-western trade winds following the warm <!--del_lnk--> gulf stream currents. Areas along the western coasts (including those in <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>) can receive between 40 inches (sea-level) and 100 inches (mountains) of rain per year. However, what is less well known is that the eastern and southern half of the country is much drier, with the south east having a lower rainfall average than <a href="../../wp/j/Jerusalem.htm" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Beirut.htm" title="Beirut">Beirutat</a> between 450 and 600mm per year.<p>One city that is known for rain is <a href="../../wp/s/Seattle%252C_Washington.htm" title="Seattle, Washington">Seattle, Washington</a>, <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. Rain is common in the winter, but mostly the climate is cloudy with little rain. Seattle&#39;s average rainfall is 37.1 inches (942 mm) per year, less than New York City with 46.2 inches (1173 mm), but has 201 cloudy days per year (compared to 152 in New York). However, it should be noted that Seattle lies in the <!--del_lnk--> rain shadow of the nearby <!--del_lnk--> Olympic Mountains, with some locations on the <!--del_lnk--> windward sides of the mountains receiving close to 200 inches (5080 mm) per year.<p><!--del_lnk--> Melbourne, Australia has a similar reputation, in comparison to <!--del_lnk--> Sydney, Australia; however, Sydney receives an average of 43.1 inches (1094 mm) of rain per year compared to Melbourne&#39;s 21.4 inches (544 mm). Sydney, meanwhile, experiences 53 fewer overcast days per year than Melbourne.<div style="overflow: auto; overflow-y: hidden; width: 100%;">
