      <p><b>Robert Stephenson</b> <!--del_lnk--> FRS (<!--del_lnk--> October 16, <!--del_lnk--> 1803&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> October 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1859) was an <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a> <!--del_lnk--> civil engineer. He was the only son of <!--del_lnk--> George Stephenson, the famed <a href="../../wp/r/Rail_transport.htm" title="Rail transport">railway</a> and <!--del_lnk--> locomotive engineer; many of the achievements popularly credited to his father were actually joint efforts of father and son.<p><a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Overview</span></h2>
      <p>Robert Stephenson was well-educated prior to officially starting his career. His mother and sister died early in his life so young Robert spent much of his time as a child in the shadows of his father <!--del_lnk--> George Stephenson. Although lacking any formal education of his own, George had considerable engineering skills having improved mining operations for the Killingworth pits near their home. Robert thus developed a growing familiarity with mining equipment and machinery as he grew up in the <!--del_lnk--> Tyneside mining community. Early on, George saw great potential in Robert and was very dedicated to seeing that Robert was as well-educated and schooled as possible.<p>After a private education at the Bruce Academy in <a href="../../wp/n/Newcastle_upon_Tyne.htm" title="Newcastle upon Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a>, an apprenticeship to <!--del_lnk--> Nicolas Wood, the manager of <!--del_lnk--> Killingworth Colliery, and a period at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Edinburgh, Robert went to work with his father on his railway projects, the first being the <!--del_lnk--> Stockton and Darlington. In <!--del_lnk--> 1823 Robert set up a company in partnership with his father and <!--del_lnk--> Edward Pease to build railway locomotives; the firm, <i><!--del_lnk--> Robert Stephenson and Company</i>, built a large proportion of the world&#39;s early locomotives and survived into the mid-<a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a>. The original factory building still exists, at <!--del_lnk--> Forth Street in Newcastle, as the Robert Stephenson Centre.<p>Robert did a good deal of the work for the <a href="../../wp/r/Rainhill_Trials.htm" title="Rainhill Trials">Rainhill Trials</a>-winning <i><!--del_lnk--> Rocket</i>; following its success, the company built further locomotives for the <a href="../../wp/l/Liverpool_and_Manchester_Railway.htm" title="Liverpool and Manchester Railway">Liverpool and Manchester Railway</a> and other newly-established railways, including the <!--del_lnk--> Leicester and Swannington Railway.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1833 Robert was given the post of Chief Engineer for the <!--del_lnk--> London and Birmingham Railway, the first main-line railway to enter <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, and the initial section of the <!--del_lnk--> West Coast Main Line. The line posed a number of difficult civil engineering challenges, most notably <!--del_lnk--> Kilsby Tunnel, and was completed in <!--del_lnk--> 1838. Stephenson was directly responsible for the tunnel under <!--del_lnk--> Primrose Hill, which required excavation by shafts. Early locomotives could not manage the climb from <!--del_lnk--> Euston Station to <!--del_lnk--> Chalk Farm, requiring Stephenson to devise a system that would be draw them up the hill by chains using a steam engine near <!--del_lnk--> The Roundhouse. This impressive structure remains in use today as an Arts Centre.<p>He constructed a number of well-known bridges, including the <!--del_lnk--> High Level Bridge at Newcastle upon Tyne, the wrought-iron box-section <!--del_lnk--> Britannia Bridge across the <!--del_lnk--> Menai Strait, the <!--del_lnk--> Conwy railway bridge between <!--del_lnk--> Llandudno Junction and <!--del_lnk--> Conwy, <!--del_lnk--> Arnside Viaduct in <!--del_lnk--> Cumbria, the Royal Border Bridge at <!--del_lnk--> Berwick-upon-Tweed and a joint road and rail bridge in 1850 over the <!--del_lnk--> River Nene at <!--del_lnk--> Sutton Bridge in <!--del_lnk--> Lincolnshire.<p>One of Stephenson&#39;s few failures was his design of the <!--del_lnk--> Dee bridge, which <!--del_lnk--> collapsed under a train. He was heavily criticized for the design, even before the collapse, particularly for the poor choice of materials, which included <!--del_lnk--> cast iron.<p>He served as <!--del_lnk--> Conservative <!--del_lnk--> Member of Parliament for <!--del_lnk--> Whitby from <!--del_lnk--> 1847 until his death. He was a commissioner of the short-lived London <!--del_lnk--> Metropolitan Commission of Sewers from <!--del_lnk--> 1848. He was President of the <!--del_lnk--> Institution of Civil Engineers for two years from <!--del_lnk--> 1855. His remains are interred at <a href="../../wp/w/Westminster_Abbey.htm" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>.<p>Stephenson was well respected by his engineering peers and had a lifetime friendship with <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Locke, a rival engineer during his career. One other such friendship included a friendship with <a href="../../wp/i/Isambard_Kingdom_Brunel.htm" title="Isambard Kingdom Brunel">Isambard Kingdom Brunel</a> who often help Stevenson on other various projects.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Stephenson Railway Museum in <!--del_lnk--> North Shields is named after George and Robert Stephenson.<p><a id="In_fiction" name="In_fiction"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">In fiction</span></h2>
      <p>Stephenson appears as a character in the <!--del_lnk--> anime <a href="../../wp/f/Film.htm" title="Film">film</a> <i><!--del_lnk--> Steamboy</i>, in that <!--del_lnk--> world having apparently lived until 1866. In the English dub of the film his character also speaks with a rather posh stereotypical English accent and not the northern tones Stephenson used.<p><a id="External_links" name="External_links"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Stephenson&quot;</div>
