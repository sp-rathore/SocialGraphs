      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1607, <a href="../../wp/j/James_I_of_England.htm" title="James I of England">James I</a> granted a <!--del_lnk--> royal charter to the <!--del_lnk--> Virginia Company of London to settle colonists in <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>. After the first permanent <!--del_lnk--> English settlement was established later that year at <!--del_lnk--> Jamestown, <!--del_lnk--> Captain Christopher Newport and <!--del_lnk--> Captain John Smith set sail ten days after landing at Jamestown, traveling northwest up Powhatan&#39;s River (now known as the <!--del_lnk--> James River) to Powhatan Hill. The first expedition consisted of 120 men from Jamestown, and made the first attempt to settle at the Falls of the James, located between the 14th Street Bridge in modern downtown Richmond and the Pony Pasture (a recreational area along the banks of the river south of the City of Richmond). The settlement was made at this location as it is the highest navigable site along the James River.<p>In 1673, <!--del_lnk--> William Byrd I was granted lands on the James River that included the area around Falls that would become Richmond and already included small settlements. Byrd became a well-connected fur trader in the area and established a fort on the site. <!--del_lnk--> William Byrd II inherited his father&#39;s land in 1704 and in 1737 he founded the town of Richmond at the Falls of the James and commissioned Major William Mayo to lay out the original town grid. Byrd named the city Richmond after the town of Richmond or <!--del_lnk--> Richmond-upon-Thames in England, a suburb of London. He gave the new town the name because the view of the James River in Richmond, Virginia is strikingly similar to the view of the Thames River from Richmond, England, where he had spent time during his youth. The new town became the seat of <!--del_lnk--> Henrico County in 1752 which had been located in nearby <!--del_lnk--> Varina (now a Richmond suburb) where John Rolfe and Pocahontas had established their farm the previous century and developed the new world&#39;s first commercially successful export product, tobacco.<p>war<div class="thumb tleft">

Both Thomas Jefferson, who would soon write the Declaration of Independence and George Washington, who would soon command the Continental Army were in attendance at this critical moment on the path to the <!--del_lnk--> American Revolution.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1780, Virginia&rsquo;s state capital was moved from the colonial capital of <!--del_lnk--> Williamsburg to Richmond because it was less vulnerable to attack by the British. In <!--del_lnk--> 1781, under the command of <!--del_lnk--> Benedict Arnold, Richmond was burned by British troops causing Governor Thomas Jefferson to flee the city. Yet Richmond shortly recovered and, by 1782, Richmond was once again a thriving city.<p><a id="Post-Revolution" name="Post-Revolution"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Post-Revolution</span></h3>
      <p>In 1786, one of the most important and influential passages of legislation in American history was passed at the temporary state capital in Richmond, the <!--del_lnk--> Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. Written by <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Jefferson.htm" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> and sponsored by <!--del_lnk--> James Madison, the statute was the basis for the separation of church and state, and led to <!--del_lnk--> freedom of religion for all Americans as protected in the religion clause in the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Constitution&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> First Amendment. Its importance is recognized annually by the President of The United States, with January 16th established as <!--del_lnk--> National Religious Freedom Day.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Virginia State Capitol building was designed by Thomas Jefferson and completed in 1788. It is the second-oldest US statehouse in continuous use (Maryland&#39;s is the oldest) and was the first US government building built in the classical Roman style of architecture, setting the trend for other state houses and the federal government buildings (including the White House and The Capitol) in Washington, DC.<p>Richmond soon emerged an important industrial centre and crossroads of transportation and commerce. <a href="../../wp/g/George_Washington.htm" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> proposed and received the support of the Virginia legislature for the establishment of the <!--del_lnk--> James River and Kanawha Canal, the first canal system to be established in the U.S. The canal allowed goods and services coming up the James River to be navigated around the falls at Richmond and connect Richmond and the eastern part of Virginia with the west. As a result Richmond became home of some of the largest manufacturing facilities in the country, including iron works and flour mills, the largest facilities of their kind in the south. Canal traffic peaked in the 1860s and slowly gave way to railroads, allowing Richmond to become a major railroad crossroads, eventually including the site of the world&#39;s first triple railroad crossing. The Canal officially ceased operations in the 1880s and portions of the canal have been preserved and rebuilt in the late 1990s, spurring tourism and economic development along the old canal route in downtown Richmond.<p><a id="Civil_War" name="Civil_War"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Civil War</span></h3>

      <p>The aversion to the slave trade was growing by the mid-nineteenth century, and in <!--del_lnk--> 1848, Henry &ldquo;Box&rdquo; Brown made history by having himself nailed into a small box and shipped from Richmond to <!--del_lnk--> Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, escaping slavery.<p>At the outbreak of the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1861, the strategic location of the Tredegar Iron Works was one of the primary factors in the decision to make Richmond the <b>Capital of the Confederacy</b>. From this arsenal came the 723 tons of armor plating that covered the <!--del_lnk--> CSS Virginia, the world&rsquo;s first <!--del_lnk--> ironclad used in war, as well as much of the Confederates&#39; heavy ordnance machinery. In February <!--del_lnk--> 1861, <!--del_lnk--> Jefferson Davis was inaugurated as <!--del_lnk--> President of the <!--del_lnk--> Confederate States of America in Montgomery, Alabama, the first Confederate capital. In the early morning of April 12, 1861, the Confederate army fired on <!--del_lnk--> Fort Sumter in <!--del_lnk--> Charleston, South Carolina, and the Civil War had begun. On April 17, 1861, Virginia seceded from the United States and joined the Confederate States, and soon thereafter the Confederate government moved its capital to Richmond. The Seven Days Battle, in which Union General McClellan threatened Richmond and came very near it but ultimately failed to take the city, followed in late June and early July of 1862. Three years later on <!--del_lnk--> April 3, <!--del_lnk--> 1865 <a href="../../wp/u/Ulysses_S._Grant.htm" title="Ulysses S. Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> and the Union Army captured Richmond, and six days later, <!--del_lnk--> Robert E. Lee&#39;s retreating <!--del_lnk--> Army of Northern Virginia surrendered to Grant at Appomattox Court House symbolically ending the war. On April 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1865, about 25% of the city&#39;s buildings were destroyed in a fire set by retreating Confederate soldiers.<p><!--del_lnk--> Monument Avenue was laid out in <!--del_lnk--> 1887, with a series of monuments at various intersections honoring the city&#39;s Confederate heroes. Included (east to west) were <!--del_lnk--> J.E.B. Stuart, <!--del_lnk--> Robert E. Lee, <!--del_lnk--> Jefferson Davis, <!--del_lnk--> Stonewall Jackson, and <!--del_lnk--> Matthew F. Maury. Richmond is the final resting place of both Stuart and Davis (see <!--del_lnk--> Hollywood Cemetery).<p>Richmond had the first successful electrically-powered <!--del_lnk--> trolley system in the United States. Designed by electric power pioneer <!--del_lnk--> Frank J. Sprague, the trolley system opened its first line in January, <!--del_lnk--> 1888. Richmond&#39;s hills, long a transportation obstacle, were considered an ideal proving ground. The new technology soon replaced horse-powered <!--del_lnk--> streetcars.<p><a id="Twentieth_Century" name="Twentieth_Century"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Twentieth Century</span></h3>
      <p>By the beginning of the Twentieth Century, the city&#39;s population had reached 85,050 in 5 square miles, making it the most densely populated city in the Southern US.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1903, African-American businesswoman and financier <!--del_lnk--> Maggie L. Walker chartered St. Luke Penny Savings Bank, and served as its first president, as well as the first female bank president in the United States. Today, the bank is called the Consolidated Bank and Trust Company, and it is the oldest surviving African-American bank in the U.S. The Governor&#39;s School in Richmond City is also dedicated to her name.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1910, the former city of <!--del_lnk--> Manchester was consolidated with the city of Richmond. In <!--del_lnk--> 1914, the city annexed the Barton Heights, Ginter Park, and Highland Park areas of <!--del_lnk--> Henrico County. In <!--del_lnk--> 1914, Richmond became the headquarters of the <!--del_lnk--> Fifth District of the Federal Reserve Bank. In <!--del_lnk--> 1919, at the end of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Philip Morris was established in the city. The Fan district also began to develop during the <!--del_lnk--> 1920s.<p>Also during the <!--del_lnk--> 1920s, several entertainment venues developed that remain today. The city&#39;s first <a href="../../wp/r/Radio.htm" title="Radio">radio</a> station, <!--del_lnk--> WRVA, first began broadcasting in <!--del_lnk--> 1925. The Mosque (now called the <!--del_lnk--> Landmark Theatre) also opened in <!--del_lnk--> 1925. The Byrd Theater and Loew&#39;s Theatre (now the <!--del_lnk--> Carpenter Centre) opened in 1928.<p><a id="Modern_city_development" name="Modern_city_development"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Modern city development</span></h3>
      <p>Between <!--del_lnk--> 1963 and <!--del_lnk--> 1965, there was a huge, &quot;downtown boom,&quot; that led to the construction of more than 700 buildings in the city. In <!--del_lnk--> 1968, <!--del_lnk--> Virginia Commonwealth University was created by the merger of the <!--del_lnk--> Medical College of Virginia with the <!--del_lnk--> Richmond Professional Institute.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1984, the city completed the Diamond ballpark, a new home for the <!--del_lnk--> Richmond Braves, a AAA baseball team in the <!--del_lnk--> Atlanta Braves minor league system, replacing the old Parker Field. In <!--del_lnk--> 1985, Sixth Street Marketplace, a downtown shopping district, opened. Sixth Street Marketplace was closed and demolished in 2004-2005.<p>A multi-million dollar floodwall was completed in <!--del_lnk--> 1995, in order to protect the city and the Shockoe Bottom businesses from the rising waters of the James River. This very same flood wall is thought to have contributed to the severe flooding of the Shockoe Bottom area of downtown Richmond in August of 2004.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1996, a statue of Richmond native and tennis star <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Ashe was added amid controversy to the famed series of statues of Confederate heroes of the Civil War on <!--del_lnk--> Monument Avenue.<p>Recent renovations included the rebuilt <!--del_lnk--> James River and Kanawha Canal and Haxall Canal, now designed as a Canal Walk. The riverfront project has brought this 1.25-mile corridor back to life, with trendy loft apartments, restaurants, shops and hotels winding along the Canal Walk, along with canal boat cruises and walking tours. The <!--del_lnk--> National Park Service&#39;s Richmond Civil War Visitor Centre, in the <!--del_lnk--> Tredegar Iron Works, brought three floors of exhibits and artifacts, films, a bookstore, picnic areas and more. The Cordish Company also began construction of Riverside on the James, a power plant development project with shopping and entertainment venues.<p><a id="Geography_and_climate" name="Geography_and_climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography and climate</span></h2>

      <p>According to the <!--del_lnk--> United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 62.5 <!--del_lnk--> mi&sup2; (162.0 <!--del_lnk--> km&sup2;). 60.1 mi&sup2; (155.6 km&sup2;) of it is land and 2.5 mi&sup2; (6.4 km&sup2;) of it (3.96%) is water. The city is located in the <!--del_lnk--> Piedmont region of <!--del_lnk--> Virginia, at the highest navigable point of the James River. The Piedmont region is categorized by relatively low, rolling hills, and lies between the low, sea level <!--del_lnk--> tidewater region and the <!--del_lnk--> Blue Ridge mountains. Significant bodies of water in the region include the <!--del_lnk--> Chickahominy River, the <!--del_lnk--> James River, and the <!--del_lnk--> Appomattox River.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Richmond-Petersburg <!--del_lnk--> Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), the <!--del_lnk--> 46th largest in the United States, includes the independent cities of Richmond, <!--del_lnk--> Colonial Heights, <!--del_lnk--> Hopewell, and <!--del_lnk--> Petersburg, as well as the counties of <!--del_lnk--> Amelia, <!--del_lnk--> Caroline, <!--del_lnk--> Charles City, <!--del_lnk--> Chesterfield, <!--del_lnk--> Cumberland, <!--del_lnk--> Dinwiddie, <!--del_lnk--> Goochland, <!--del_lnk--> Hanover, <!--del_lnk--> Henrico, <!--del_lnk--> King and Queen, <!--del_lnk--> King William, <!--del_lnk--> Louisa, <!--del_lnk--> New Kent, <!--del_lnk--> Powhatan, <!--del_lnk--> Prince George, and <!--del_lnk--> Sussex. As of July 2004, the total population of the Richmond&mdash;Petersburg <!--del_lnk--> MSA was 1,154,317.<p><a id="Cityscape" name="Cityscape"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cityscape</span></h3>
      <p>The city is made up of a number of neighborhoods, including the <!--del_lnk--> Fan district, <!--del_lnk--> Oregon Hill, Shockoe Bottom, the <!--del_lnk--> West End, <!--del_lnk--> Northside, and <!--del_lnk--> Church Hill &ndash; site of Patrick Henry&#39;s famous speech.<p>Most of the roads in the downtown area are arranged in a regular grid arrangement, with alternating one way streets. Several major roads lead outward from the city, and are actually former Indian trails, leading to other towns and sites in <!--del_lnk--> Virginia. For example, <i>Three Chopt Road</i>, was so named as it was an Indian trail marked by three chops on trees near the trail. The major highways leading into the city of Richmond are <!--del_lnk--> I-64, <!--del_lnk--> I-95 and <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Highway 360. <!--del_lnk--> I-295, combined with <!--del_lnk--> State Route 288 form an &quot;outer loop&quot;, or bypass, around the metropolitan area. <!--del_lnk--> I-195 is a &quot;spur&quot; that, along with the Downtown Expressway and the Powhite Parkway, create thruways in the downtown, south-side, and near west-end regions that also serve as bypasses that connect I-95 and I-64 with US Highway 360 in the far southwest areas. Also Richmond is the eastern terminus of U.S. highways <!--del_lnk--> 250 and <!--del_lnk--> 33.<p>Ever since the first electric trolley was installed in 1888, Richmond <!--del_lnk--> urban sprawl has been steadily expanding westward and southward. Development along <!--del_lnk--> Monument Avenue and <!--del_lnk--> Broad Street has led to the most affluent people moving farther and farther west, towards a part of the metro area known to some as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The Far West End&quot; &amp; to others as simply &quot;<!--del_lnk--> West End&quot;.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>

      <p>As of the <!--del_lnk--> census<sup id="fn_GR2_back"><!--del_lnk--> GR2</sup> of 2000, there were 197,790 people, 84,549 households, and 43,627 families residing in the city. A more recent census estimate indicates that the city&#39;s population has fallen to 193,777. The <!--del_lnk--> population density was 1,271.3/km&sup2; (3,292.6/mi&sup2;). There were 92,282 housing units at an average density of 593.1/km&sup2; (1,536.2/mi&sup2;).

The average household size was 2.21 and the average family size was 2.95.<p>In the city the population was spread out with 21.8% under the age of 18, 13.1% from 18 to 24, 31.7% from 25 to 44, 20.1% from 45 to 64, and 13.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females there were 87.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 83.5 males.<p>The median income for a household in the city was $31,121, and the median income for a family was $38,348. Males had a median income of $30,874 versus $25,880 for females. The <!--del_lnk--> per capita income for the city was $20,337. About 17.1% of families and 21.4% of the population were below the <!--del_lnk--> poverty line, including 32.9% of those under age 18 and 15.8% of those age 65 or over.<p>Much of Richmond&rsquo;s political and social history was influenced by its high society origins. In the 1920s, <!--del_lnk--> Ellen Glasgow and <!--del_lnk--> James Branch Cabell wrote novels that included thinly veiled mocking of elite institutions like the <!--del_lnk--> FFV, the Commonwealth Club, and the Richmond German <!--del_lnk--> d&eacute;butante dance. Even today, Richmonders speak of &ldquo;Come-heres&rdquo; (<!--del_lnk--> carpetbaggers) versus &ldquo;from-heres.&rdquo;<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>

      <p>Richmond&#39;s strategic location on the James River, built on undulating hills at the rocky fall line separating the <!--del_lnk--> piedmont and <!--del_lnk--> tidewater regions of <!--del_lnk--> Virginia provided a natural site for the development of commerce. For centuries, the native peoples of the powerful <!--del_lnk--> Powhatan tribe recognized the value of this site, rich in natural beauty. They knew it as a place to hunt, fish, play, and trade, and they called it <i>&quot;Shocquohocan,&quot;</i>, or <i>Shockoe</i>.<p>The first <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="European">European</a> explorers came in <!--del_lnk--> 1607, from the <!--del_lnk--> Virginia Company of <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>. They discovered a fragrant weed grown by the natives, and <a href="../../wp/t/Tobacco.htm" title="Tobacco">tobacco</a> became a lucrative commodity in the area. The trading post developed into a village, and by <!--del_lnk--> 1733 a town was laid out by <!--del_lnk--> William Byrd II and <!--del_lnk--> William Mayo. Its early buildings were clustered around the Farmers&#39; Market, existing today at 17th Street.<p>Early trade grew rapidly, primarily in the agriculture sector, but also in the <!--del_lnk--> slave trade. Slaves were imported to Richmond&#39;s Manchester docks from Africa, and were bought and sold at the same market.<p>To facilitate the transfer of cargo from the flat-bottomed <!--del_lnk--> bateaux above the <!--del_lnk--> fall line to the ocean-faring ships below, <a href="../../wp/g/George_Washington.htm" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> helped design the <!--del_lnk--> James River and Kanawha Canal in the 1700s to bypass Richmond&#39;s rapids. The canal was later superseded by rail in the 1800s, and the railroads were laid on the original canal towpaths. In the 1900s highways were constructed in the air over the same area.<p>Throughout these three centuries and three modes of transportation, downtown has always been a hub, with the Great Turning Basin for boats, the world&#39;s only triple crossing of rail lines, and the intersection of two major interstates.

      <p>Richmond emerged from the smoldering rubble of the <!--del_lnk--> Civil War as an economic powerhouse, with iron front buildings and massive brick factories. Innovations of this era included the world&#39;s first cigarette-rolling machine, invented by <!--del_lnk--> James Albert Bonsack of <!--del_lnk--> Roanoke in 1880/81, and the world&#39;s first successful electric street car system.<p>Freed slaves and their descendants created a thriving <!--del_lnk--> African-American business community, led by such influential people as <!--del_lnk--> Maggie L. Walker and <!--del_lnk--> John Mitchell, Jr. The city&#39;s historic <!--del_lnk--> Jackson Ward became known as the &quot;Wall Street of Black America.&quot;<p>Law and finance have long been driving forces in the economy. Because the city is home to both a <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and a <!--del_lnk--> Federal Reserve Bank, as well as offices for international firms such as <!--del_lnk--> Hunton &amp; Williams LLP, <!--del_lnk--> McGuireWoods LLP, Troutman Sanders LLP, <!--del_lnk--> CapitalOne, and numerous other banks and brokerages, Richmond was cited as having minimal evidence of being a <a href="../../wp/g/Global_city.htm" title="Global city">Global city</a>.<p>Since the 1960s Richmond has been a prominent hub for advertising agencies and advertising related businesses, including <!--del_lnk--> The Martin Agency. As a result of local advertising agency support, <!--del_lnk--> VCU&#39;s graduate advertising school (VCU AdCenter) is consistently ranked the #1 advertising graduate program in the country.<p><a id="Business_rankings" name="Business_rankings"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Business rankings</span></h3>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 2005, <!--del_lnk--> Forbes ranked the Richmond area as the #14 Best Place for Business and Careers, primarily due to its highly educated labor force and relatively low business costs. Other areas of the economy that have developed recently in the city include pharmaceuticals, insurance, advertising, biotechnology, education, tourism health services, or semi-conductors. In <!--del_lnk--> 2006, Forbes also named Richmond as the sixth best city in which to find employment among the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the nation.<p><a id="Fortune_500_Companies_and_other_large_corporations" name="Fortune_500_Companies_and_other_large_corporations"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Fortune 500 Companies and other large corporations</span></h3>
      <p>The Richmond Metro area is the home of eight <!--del_lnk--> Fortune 500 companies (soon to be nine with the announced relocation of Connecticut-based <!--del_lnk--> MeadWestvaco to Richmond), including electric utility <!--del_lnk--> Dominion Resources; consumer electronics retailer <!--del_lnk--> Circuit City, which also spun off the used car retailer <!--del_lnk--> CarMax, now a separate <!--del_lnk--> Fortune 500 company; <!--del_lnk--> Performance Food Group; <!--del_lnk--> LandAmerica Financial Group; <!--del_lnk--> Owens &amp; Minor; <!--del_lnk--> Brink&#39;s Company, a security services outfit; <!--del_lnk--> Genworth Financial, the former <!--del_lnk--> insurance arm of <!--del_lnk--> GE and the recently relocated <!--del_lnk--> MeadWestvaco, a leading global producer of packaging, coated and specialty papers, consumer and office products and specialty chemicals.

Located adjacent to the Medical College of Virginia (MCV) Campus of <!--del_lnk--> Virginia Commonwealth University, the park currently has more than 575,000 square feet (53,000 m&sup2;) of research, laboratory and office space for a diverse tenant mix of companies, research institutes, government laboratories and non-profit organizations. The <!--del_lnk--> United Network for Organ Sharing, which maintains the nation&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> organ transplant waiting list, occupies one building in the park. <!--del_lnk--> Philip Morris USA also recently announced their plans to build a $350 million research and development facility in the park as well. Once fully developed in the next five to 10 years, park officials expect the site to employ roughly 3,000 scientists, technicians and engineers. Philip Morris will add roughly 600 employees once it opens in 2007.<p>Richmond is also the home of the <!--del_lnk--> Ukrop&#39;s Super Market, a regional, family-owned chain of <!--del_lnk--> supermarkets, known for its remarkable customer service and friendly employees, as well as its closed-on-Sundays and no-alcohol-on-the-shelves policies. Ukrops is a high-profile sponsor of community events like the <!--del_lnk--> Monument Avenue 10K, Easter on Parade, and the Ukrop&#39;s Christmas Parade.

      <p>The city operates one of the oldest municipal park systems in the country. The park system began when the city council voted in <!--del_lnk--> 1851 to acquire 7.5 acres (3 hectare), now known as Monroe Park. Today, Monroe Park sits adjacent to the <!--del_lnk--> Virginia Commonwealth University campus and is one of more than 40 parks comprising a total of more than 1,500 acres (610 hectare).<p>Several parks are located along the James River, and the James River Parks System offers bike trails, hiking and nature trails, and many scenic overlooks along the river&#39;s route through the city. The mountain bike trail system in James River and Forest Hill parks is considered by professional riders to be one of the best urban trail systems in the country. The trails are used as part of the Xterra East Championship course for both the running and mountain biking portions of the off-road triathlon.<p>There are also parks on two major islands in the river: <!--del_lnk--> Belle Isle and Brown&#39;s Island. Belle Isle, at various former times a Powhatan fishing village, colonial-era horse race track, and Civil War prison camp, is the larger of the two, and contains many bike trails as well as a small cliff that is used for <!--del_lnk--> rock climbing instruction. One can walk the island and still see many of the remains of the Civil War prison camp, such as an arms storage room and a gun emplacement that was used to quell prisoner riots. Brown&#39;s Island is a smaller island and a popular venue of a large number of free outdoor concerts and festivals in the <a href="../../wp/s/Spring_%2528season%2529.htm" title="Spring (season)">spring</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Summer.htm" title="Summer">summer</a>, such as the weekly Friday Cheers concert series or the James River Beer and Seafood Festival.<p>Two other major parks in the city are <!--del_lnk--> Byrd Park and <!--del_lnk--> Maymont, located near the fan district of Richmond.

      <p>Richmond has several historic churches. Because of its early English colonial history from the early 1600s to 1776, Richmond has a number of prominent Anglican/Episcopal churches including <!--del_lnk--> Monumental Church, <!--del_lnk--> St. Paul&#39;s Episcopal Church and <!--del_lnk--> St. John&#39;s Episcopal Church. Methodists and Baptists made up another section of early churches, and <!--del_lnk--> First Baptist Church of Richmond was the first of these, established in <!--del_lnk--> 1780. In the <!--del_lnk--> Reformed church tradition, the first Presbyterian Church in the City of Richmond was First Presbyterian Church, organized on <!--del_lnk--> June 18, <!--del_lnk--> 1812. On <!--del_lnk--> February 5, <!--del_lnk--> 1845, <!--del_lnk--> Second Presbyterian Church of Richmond was founded, which was an historic church where <!--del_lnk--> Stonewall Jackson attended and was the first <!--del_lnk--> Gothic building and the first <!--del_lnk--> gas-lit church to be built in Richmond. Due to the influx of <!--del_lnk--> German immigrants in the 1840s, <!--del_lnk--> Saint Johns German Evangelical church was formed in 1843.<p>The first Jewish congregation in Richmond was <!--del_lnk--> Kahal Kadosh Beth Shalome. Beth Shalome was the sixth in the United States and was the westernmost Jewish congregation in the United States at the time of its foundation. By 1822 K.K. Beth Shalome members worshipped in the first synagogue building in Virginia. They eventually merged with Congregation Beth Ababah, an offshoot of Beth Shalome. Today there is a diverse Jewish community with the largest temple, Beth El, located in Henrico County.<p>There are several <!--del_lnk--> seminaries in Richmond. Three of these have banded together to become the <!--del_lnk--> Richmond Theological Consortium.

      <p>Richmond is served by the <!--del_lnk--> Richmond International Airport (<!--del_lnk--> IATA: <b>RIC</b>,&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ICAO: <b>KRIC</b>), located in nearby <!--del_lnk--> Sandston, seven miles southeast of Richmond and within an hour drive of historic <!--del_lnk--> Williamsburg, Virginia, RIC airport is served by seven airlines with non-stop flights to 21 destinations and connecting flights to destinations worldwide. In <!--del_lnk--> 2004, the airport served approximately 2.5 million passengers.<p>Intercity <!--del_lnk--> bus service is provided by <!--del_lnk--> Greyhound Lines. Local <!--del_lnk--> transit and <!--del_lnk--> paratransit bus service in Richmond, <!--del_lnk--> Henrico, and <!--del_lnk--> Chesterfield counties is provided by the <!--del_lnk--> Greater Richmond Transit Company (GRTC). The GRTC, however, serves only small parts of the suburban counties. The far West End (Innsbrook and Short Pump) and almost all of Chesterfield County have no public transportation despite dense housing, retail, and office development. Recent statistics in the Richmond Times-Dispatch have shown that the vast majority of GRTC riders ride the bus because they do not own a car and have no other choice; automobile owners in Richmond find that due to the layout of the city and its roads, driving is always a far faster method of reaching one&#39;s destination than is walking or the sparse bus service.<p>Richmond also has two railroad stations served by <a href="../../wp/a/Amtrak.htm" title="Amtrak">Amtrak</a>. Each station receives regular service from north of Richmond from <!--del_lnk--> Washington, DC, <!--del_lnk--> Philadelphia, and <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York</a>. The suburban <i>Staples Mill Road Station</i> is located on a major north-south freight line and receives all service to and from all points south including, <!--del_lnk--> Raleigh, <!--del_lnk--> Durham, <!--del_lnk--> Savannah, <!--del_lnk--> Newport News, <!--del_lnk--> Williamsburg and <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a>. The historic and recently renovated <!--del_lnk--> Main Street Station near downtown Richmond only receives trains bound for <!--del_lnk--> Newport News and <!--del_lnk--> Williamsburg at this time, due to its track layout. As a result, the Staples Mill Road station receives more service overall.<p>Richmond also benefits from an excellent position in reference to the state&#39;s transportation network, lying at the junction of east-west <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 64 and north-south <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 95, two of the most heavily traveled highways in the state, as well as along several major rail lines.<p><a id="Utilities" name="Utilities"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Utilities</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Electricity in the Richmond Metro area is provided by Dominion Virginia Power. The company, based in Richmond, is one of the nation&#39;s largest producers of energy, serving retail energy customers in nine states. Electricity is provided in the Richmond area primarily by the <!--del_lnk--> North Anna Nuclear Generating Station and <!--del_lnk--> Surry Nuclear Generating Station, as well as a <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a>-fired station in <!--del_lnk--> Chester, Virginia. These three plants provide a total of 4,453 <!--del_lnk--> megawatts of power. Several other <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_gas.htm" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a> plants provide extra power during times of peak demand. These include a facility in <!--del_lnk--> Chester, in <!--del_lnk--> Surry, and two plants in Richmond (Gravel Neck and Darbytown).<p><a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">Water</a> is provided by the city&#39;s Department of Public Utilities, and is one of the largest water producers in <!--del_lnk--> Virginia, with a modern plant that can treat up to 132 million gallons of water a day from the <!--del_lnk--> James River.<p><!--del_lnk--> Wastewater: The treatment plant and distribution system of water mains, pumping stations and storage facilities provide water to approximately 62,000 customers in the city. The facility also provides water to the surrounding area through wholesale contracts with <!--del_lnk--> Henrico, <!--del_lnk--> Chesterfield, and <!--del_lnk--> Hanover counties. Overall, this results in a facility that provides water for approximately 500,000 people. There is also a wastewater treatment plant located on the south bank of the James River. This plant can treat up to 70 million gallons of water per day of sanitary sewage and stormwater before returning it to the river. The wastewater utility also operates and maintains 1,500 miles of sanitary sewer, pumping stations, 38 miles of intercepting sewer lines, and the Shockoe Retention Basin, a 44-million-gallon stormwater reservoir used during heavy rains.<p><a href="../../wp/t/Telephone.htm" title="Telephone">Telephone</a> service for the Richmond area is provided by three <!--del_lnk--> local exchange carriers: <!--del_lnk--> Verizon is the <!--del_lnk--> incumbent telephone company, and Cavalier Telephone &amp; TV and Comcast are the <!--del_lnk--> competitive local exchange carriers.<p><a id="Sister_cities" name="Sister_cities"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sister cities</span></h2>
