      <p><i>Titanic</i> was a <!--del_lnk--> White Star Line ocean liner built at the <!--del_lnk--> Harland and Wolff shipyard in <a href="../../wp/b/Belfast.htm" title="Belfast">Belfast</a> and was designed to compete with rival company <!--del_lnk--> Cunard Line&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> <i>Lusitania</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Mauretania</i>, known for being the fastest liners on the Atlantic. <i>Titanic</i>, along with her Olympic class sisters, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Olympic</i> and the soon-to-be-built <!--del_lnk--> <i>Britannic</i> (originally to be named <i>Gigantic</i>), were intended to be the largest, most luxurious ships ever to operate. <i>Titanic</i> was designed by Harland and Wolff chairman <!--del_lnk--> Lord Pirrie, head of Harland and Wolff&#39;s design department <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Andrews and general manager Alexander Carlisle, with the plans regularly sent to White Star Line&#39;s managing director <!--del_lnk--> J. Bruce Ismay for suggestions and approval. Construction of <i>Titanic,&#39; funded by the American <!--del_lnk--> J.P. Morgan and his <!--del_lnk--> International Mercantile Marine Co., began on <!--del_lnk--> March 31, <!--del_lnk--> 1909.</i> Titanic No. 401<i>, was launched two years and two months later on <!--del_lnk--> May 31, <!--del_lnk--> 1911.</i> Titanic<i>&#39;s outfitting was completed on <!--del_lnk--> March 31 the following year.</i><p><i>Titanic</i> was 882&nbsp;ft&nbsp;9&nbsp;in (269&nbsp;m) long and 92&nbsp;ft&nbsp;6&nbsp;in (28&nbsp;m) at its beam, it had a <!--del_lnk--> Gross Register Tonnage of 46,328&nbsp;tons, and a height from the water line to the boat deck of 60&nbsp;ft (18&nbsp;m). It contained two <!--del_lnk--> reciprocating four-<!--del_lnk--> cylinder, triple-expansion, inverted <a href="../../wp/s/Steam_engine.htm" title="Steam engine">steam engines</a> and one low-pressure <!--del_lnk--> Parsons turbine. These powered three <!--del_lnk--> propellers. There were 25 double-ended and 4 single-ended Scotch-type <!--del_lnk--> boilers fired by 159 <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a> burning <!--del_lnk--> furnaces that made possible a top speed of 23&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> knots (43&nbsp;km/h). Only three of the four 63&nbsp;foot (19&nbsp;m) tall <!--del_lnk--> funnels were functional; the fourth, which served only as a vent, was added to make the ship look more impressive. <i>Titanic</i> could carry a total of 3,547 passengers and crew and, because she carried <!--del_lnk--> mail, her name was given the <!--del_lnk--> prefix <!--del_lnk--> RMS (Royal Mail Steamer) as well as SS (Steam Ship).<p><i>Titanic</i> was considered a pinnacle of <!--del_lnk--> naval architecture and technological achievement, and was thought by <i>The Shipbuilder</i> magazine to be &quot;practically unsinkable.&quot; She was divided into 16 compartments by doors held up, i.e. in the open position, by electro-magnetic latches and which could be allowed to fall closed by means of a switch on the bridge. However, the watertight <!--del_lnk--> bulkheads did not reach the entire height of the <!--del_lnk--> decks, only going up as far as E-Deck. <i>Titanic</i> could stay afloat with any two of her compartments flooded, or with eleven of fourteen possible combinations of three compartments flooded, or with the first/last four compartments flooded: any more and the ship would sink.<p><a id="Unsurpassed_luxury" name="Unsurpassed_luxury"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Unsurpassed luxury</span></h3>
      <p>For her time, <i>Titanic</i> was unsurpassed in luxury and opulence. She offered an onboard swimming pool, a gymnasium, a <!--del_lnk--> Turkish bath, a library and a <a href="../../wp/s/Squash_%2528sport%2529.htm" title="Squash (sport)">squash court</a>. <!--del_lnk--> First-class common rooms were adorned with elaborate wood paneling, expensive furniture and other elegant decorations. In addition, the Caf&eacute; Parisienne offered superb cuisine for the first-class passengers with a delightful sunlit veranda fitted with trellis decorations.<p>Second-class and even third-class accommodation and common rooms were likewise considered to be as opulent as those in the first-class sections of many other ships of the day. <i>Titanic</i> had three <!--del_lnk--> lifts for use of first-class passengers and, as an innovation, offered one lift for second-class passengers.<p>The crown jewels of the ship&#39;s interior was undoubtedly her forward first-class grand <!--del_lnk--> staircase, between the forward and second funnels. Extending down to E-Deck and decorated with oak paneling and gilded balustrades, it was topped by an ornate wrought-iron and glass dome which brought in natural light. On the uppermost landing was a large panel containing a clock flanked by the allegorical figures of Honour and Glory crowning Time. A similar, but less ornate staircase, complete with matching dome, was located between the third and fourth <!--del_lnk--> funnels.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p><i>Titanic</i> was almost identical to her older sister, <i>Olympic</i>, but there were a few differences, some suggested by <!--del_lnk--> Bruce Ismay and based on observations he had made of <i>Olympic</i>. The most noticeable were that half of <i>Titanic&#39;s</i> forward promenade A-Deck (below the lifeboat deck) was enclosed, and her B-Deck configuration was completely different from <i>Olympic&#39;s</i>. <i>Titanic</i> had a specialty restaurant called Caf&eacute; Parisienne, a feature that <i>Olympic</i> wouldn&#39;t be provided with until 1913. Some of the flaws found on <i>Olympic</i>, such as the creaking of the aft expansion joint, were corrected on <i>Titanic</i>. Other differences such as <i>Titanic&#39;s</i> skid lights, that provide natural illumination on A-deck, were round while on <i>Olympic</i> they were oval. <i>Titanic&#39;s</i> wheelhouse was made narrower and longer than <i>Olympic&#39;s</i>. <!--del_lnk-->  These and other modifications made <i>Titanic</i> 1,004 tonnes larger than <i>Olympic</i>.<p><a id="Passengers" name="Passengers"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Passengers</span></h2>
      <p>On Titanic&#39;s maiden voyage, some of the most prominent people in the world were on board in first class. These included millionaire <!--del_lnk--> John Jacob Astor IV and his pregnant wife <!--del_lnk--> Madeleine; industrialist <!--del_lnk--> Benjamin Guggenheim; <!--del_lnk--> Macy&#39;s department store owner <!--del_lnk--> Isidor Straus and his wife Ida; <!--del_lnk--> Denver millionaire <!--del_lnk--> Margaret &quot;Molly&quot; Brown; Sir <!--del_lnk--> Cosmo Duff Gordon and his wife, couturiere <a href="../../wp/l/Lucy%252C_Lady_Duff-Gordon.htm" title="Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon">Lady Duff-Gordon</a>; streetcar magnate <!--del_lnk--> George Dunton Widener, his wife Eleanor and their 27-year-old son, <!--del_lnk--> Harry Elkins Widener; <a href="../../wp/p/Pennsylvania_Railroad.htm" title="Pennsylvania Railroad">Pennsylvania Railroad</a> executive John Borland Thayer, his wife Marion and their seventeen-year-old son, Jack; journalist <!--del_lnk--> William Thomas Stead; the <!--del_lnk--> Countess of Rothes; United States presidential aide <!--del_lnk--> Archibald Butt; author and socialite Helen Churchill Candee; author <!--del_lnk--> Jacques Futrelle, his wife May, and their friends, <!--del_lnk--> Broadway producers Henry and Rene Harris; pioneer aviation entrepreneur <!--del_lnk--> Pierre Mar&eacute;chal Sr.; and silent film actress <!--del_lnk--> Dorothy Gibson. Also in first class were White Star Line&#39;s Managing Director <!--del_lnk--> J. Bruce Ismay (who survived the sinking) and, from the ship&#39;s builders, <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Andrews, who was on board to observe any problems and assess the general performance of the new ship.<p>Among the second-class passengers was Lawrence Beesley, a journalist who wrote one of the finest first-hand accounts of the voyage and the sinking. He left the ship on Lifeboat #13. Also in second class was <!--del_lnk--> Michel Navratil, a Frenchman kidnapping his two sons, <!--del_lnk--> Michel Jr. and Edmond and taking them to America.<p>Both <!--del_lnk--> J.P.

      <p>There are several figures regarding the number of passengers lost. The United States senate investigation reported 1,522 people perished in the accident, while the British investigation has the number at 1,490. Regardless, it ranks as one of the worst peacetime maritime <!--del_lnk--> disasters in history and by far the most famous. <i>Titanic</i>&#39;s design used some of the most advanced technology available at the time and the ship was popularly believed to be &quot;unsinkable.&quot; It was a great shock that, despite the advanced technology and experienced crew, <i>Titanic</i> sank with a great loss of life. The <a href="../../wp/m/Mass_media.htm" title="Mass media">media</a> frenzy about <i>Titanic</i>&#39;s famous victims, the <!--del_lnk--> legends about what happened on board the ship, the resulting changes to <!--del_lnk--> maritime law, and the discovery of the <!--del_lnk--> wreck in 1985 by a team led by <!--del_lnk--> Robert Ballard and <!--del_lnk--> Jean Louis Michel have made <i>Titanic</i> persistently famous in the years since.<p><a name="1:45_PM_-_Amerika_iceberg_warning"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1:45 PM - <i>Amerika</i> iceberg warning</span></h3>
      <p>On the night of Sunday, <!--del_lnk--> April 14, the temperature had dropped to near freezing and the ocean was completely calm. Surviving 2nd Officer <!--del_lnk--> Charles Lightoller later wrote &quot;the sea was like glass&quot;. There was no moon and the sky was clear. Captain <!--del_lnk--> Edward Smith, perhaps in response to <!--del_lnk--> iceberg warnings received by <!--del_lnk--> wireless over the previous few days, had altered <i>Titanic</i>&#39;s course around 10&nbsp;miles (18&nbsp;km) south of the normal shipping route. That Sunday at 1:45 p.m., a message from the steamer <i><!--del_lnk--> SS Amerika</i> warned that large icebergs lay south of <i>Titanic</i>&#39;s path but the warning was addressed to the USN Hydrographic office and was never relayed to the <!--del_lnk--> bridge. Iceberg warnings were received throughout the day and were quite normal for the time of year. Later that evening at 9:30pm, another report of numerous, large icebergs in <i>Titanic</i>&#39;s path was received by Jack Phillips and Harold Bride in the radio room, this time from the <i>Mesaba</i>, but this report also did not reach the bridge. Although there were warnings, there were no operational or safety reasons to slow down or alter course. The Titanic had three teams of two lookouts high up in the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Crow&#39;s nest&quot; who were rotated every two hours, and on any other night it is almost certain they would have seen the iceberg in time. However, a combination of factors came together: with no moon, no wind and the dark side of the berg facing the ship, the lookouts were powerless. Had they spotted the iceberg 10 seconds later or 10 seconds earlier, or even had the ship simply hit it straight on, it is likely that <i>Titanic</i> would not have foundered. But as Lightoller stated at the American inquiry, &quot;Everything was against us that night.&quot;<p><a name="11:40_PM_-_.22Iceberg.2C_right_ahead.21.22"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">11:40 PM - &quot;Iceberg, right ahead!&quot;</span></h3>
      <p>At 11:40 p.m. while sailing south of the <!--del_lnk--> Grand Banks of Newfoundland, lookouts <!--del_lnk--> Frederick Fleet and <!--del_lnk--> Reginald Lee spotted a large iceberg directly ahead of the ship. Fleet sounded the <!--del_lnk--> ship&#39;s bell three times and telephoned the bridge. <!--del_lnk--> Sixth Officer Moody answered, &quot;Yes, what do you see?&quot;, only to hear Fleet exclaiming, &quot;Iceberg, right ahead!&quot;, to which Moody responded &quot;Thank you&quot; before informing <!--del_lnk--> First Officer Murdoch of the call. Murdoch (who had now already seen the iceberg) ordered an abrupt turn to <!--del_lnk--> port (left) and full speed astern, which reversed the engines driving the outer propellers (the turbine driving the centre propeller was not reversible).<p>The ship&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> starboard (right) side brushed the iceberg, buckling the hull in several places and popping out <!--del_lnk--> rivets below the waterline, creating a total of six leaks in the first five watertight compartments. The fifth compartment was breached for only 10-15 feet. Murdoch then ordered hard right rudder, which swung <i>Titanic</i>&#39;s stern away from the iceberg. The watertight doors were shut as water started filling the five compartments - one more than <i>Titanic</i> could stay afloat with. Captain Smith, alerted by the jolt of the impact, ordered &quot;all-stop&quot; once he arrived on the bridge. Following an inspection by the ship&#39;s senior officers, the ship&#39;s carpenter and Thomas Andrews, which included a survey of the half-flooded two-deck postal room, it was apparent that the <i>Titanic</i> would sink. At 12:30 a.m., 45 minutes after the collision, Captain Smith ordered the lifeboats prepared for boarding; 15 minutes later, Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall fired the first white distress rocket.<p><a name="12:45_AM_-_First_lifeboat_lowered"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">12:45 AM - First lifeboat lowered</span></h3>
      <p>The first lifeboat launched, boat 7, was lowered shortly after 12:45 a.m. on the starboard side with only 28 people on board out of a maximum capacity of 65. The <i>Titanic</i> carried 20 lifeboats with a total capacity of 1,178 persons for the ship&#39;s total complement of passengers and crew of 2,223. Thirty-two lifeboats had been originally specified, but management decided the doubled-up boats spoiled the lines of the ship. Sixteen lifeboats, indicated by number, were in the <!--del_lnk--> davits; and four canvas-sided collapsibles, indicated by letter, stowed on the roof of the officers&#39; quarters or on the forward Boat Deck to be launched in empty davits. With only enough space for a little more than half the passengers and crew, <i>Titanic</i> carried more boats than required by the British <!--del_lnk--> Board of Trade. At the time, the number of lifeboats required was determined by a ship&#39;s gross tonnage, rather than its human capacity. The regulations concerning lifeboat capacity had last been updated in 1894, when the largest ships afloat measured approximately 10,000&nbsp;gross&nbsp;tons, compared to <i>Titanic</i>&#39;s 46,328&nbsp;tons.<p>First and second-class passengers had easy access to the lifeboats with staircases that led right up to the boat deck, but third-class passengers found it much harder. Many found the corridors leading from the lower sections of the ship difficult to navigate and had trouble making their way up to the lifeboats. Some gates separating the third-class section of the ship from the other areas, like the one leading from the aft well deck to the second-class section, are known to have been locked. While the majority of first and second-class women and children survived the sinking, more third-class women and children were lost than saved. The locked 3rd class gates were the result of miscommunication between the boat deck and F-G decks. Lifeboats were supposed to be lowered with women and children from the boat deck and then subsequently to pick up F-G deck women and children from open gangways. Unfortunately, with no boat drill or training for the seamen, the boats were simply lowered into the water without stopping.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Wireless operators <!--del_lnk--> Jack Phillips and <!--del_lnk--> Harold Bride were busy sending out <!--del_lnk--> distress signals. The message was &quot;SOS-MGY, sinking, need immediate assistance.&quot; Several ships responded, including <i>Mount Temple</i>, <i>Frankfurt</i> and <i>Titanic</i>&#39;s sister ship, <i>Olympic</i>, but none were close enough to make it in time. The Olympic was over 500 nautical miles away. The closest ship to respond was <!--del_lnk--> Cunard Line&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> RMS <i>Carpathia</i>, and at 58&nbsp;nautical&nbsp;miles (107&nbsp;km) away it would arrive in about four hours, still too late to get to <i>Titanic</i> in time. Two land&ndash;based locations received the distress call from <i>Titanic</i>. One was the <!--del_lnk--> wireless station at <!--del_lnk--> Cape Race, <!--del_lnk--> Newfoundland, and the other was a Marconi telegraph station on top of the <!--del_lnk--> Wanamaker&#39;s department store in New York City. Shortly after the distress signal was sent, a radio drama ensued as the signals were transmitted from ship to ship, through Halifax to New York, throughout the country. People began to show up at White Star Line offices in New York almost immediately.<p>From the bridge, the lights of a ship could be seen off the starboard side approximately 10-15 miles away. Since it was not responding to wireless, nor to the distress rockets being launched every 15 minutes or so, <!--del_lnk--> Fourth Officer Boxhall and Quartermaster Rowe attempted signaling the ship with a <!--del_lnk--> Morse lamp, but the ship never appeared to respond. The <!--del_lnk--> SS <i>Californian</i> was nearby but had stopped for the night because of ice, and its wireless was turned off because the wireless operator had gone to bed for the night. The Titanic&#39;s wireless set had broken down earlier that day and Phillips and Bride had spent most of the day fixing it. As a result, they were extremely backlogged in their sending of messages. Finally, with the set fixed and a strong signal available from the Halifax station, Phillips was getting some work done. Just before he went to bed at around 11:00 p.m. <i>Californian</i>&#39;s radio operator Cyril Evans attempted to warn <i>Titanic</i> that there was a large field of ice ahead, but he was cut off by an exhausted Jack Phillips, who sent back, &quot;Shut up, shut up! I am busy, I am working <!--del_lnk--> Cape Race.&quot; Two officers, 2nd Officer Stone and Apprentice Gibson on the <i>Californian</i> noticed a ship approaching at around 11:00pm, noticed her stop and then about an hour later noticed her beginning to send up rockets. They informed <!--del_lnk--> Captain Stanley Lord. The rockets Titanic sent up had the colour of distress rockets for White Star Line, but because of a lack of uniformity in Naval regulations at that time, Captain Lord was confused, he did not know they were distress rockets.He said &quot;Keep watching it&quot; and he went back to sleep. Even though there was much discussion about the mysterious ship, which the officers on duty thought to be moving away before disappearing, the crew of <i>Californian</i> did not wake its wireless operator until morning.<p><a name="2:00_AM_-_Waterline_reaches_forward_boat_deck"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">2:00 AM - Waterline reaches forward boat deck</span></h3>
      <p>At first, passengers were reluctant to leave the warm, well lit and ostensibly safe <i>Titanic</i>, which showed no outward signs of being in imminent danger, and board small, unlit, open lifeboats. This was one of the reasons most of the boats were launched partially empty: it was perhaps hoped that many people would jump into the water and swim to the boats. Also important was an uncertainty regarding the boats&#39; structural integrity; it was feared that the boats might break if they were fully loaded before being set in the water. Captain Smith ordered the lifeboats be lowered half empty in the hope the boats would come back to save people in the water, and some boats were given orders to do just that. One boat, boat number one, meant to hold 40 people, left <i>Titanic</i> with only 12 people on board. It was rumored that Lord and Lady Duff Gorden bribed 7 crew members to take them and their 3 companions off the ship. Bruce Ismay, managing director of the White Star Line, left on Collapsible Boat C and was criticised by both the American and British Inquiries for not going down with the ship.<p>As the ship&#39;s tilt became more apparent, people started to become nervous, and some lifeboats began leaving fully loaded. &quot;Women and children first&quot; remained the imperative (see <!--del_lnk--> origin of phrase) for loading the boats. (Despite this slogan, in reality a higher proportion of First-Class men survived than Third-class women and children., according to the <!--del_lnk--> Lloyd&#39;s of London report.)<p>Shortly after 2:00 a.m. the waterline reached the bridge and forward boat deck, and all the lifeboats, save for the awkwardly located Collapsibles A and B, had been lowered. Collapsible D, with 44 of its 47 seats filled, was the last lifeboat to be lowered from the davits. The total number of vacancies was close to 475.<p><a name="2:10_AM_-_Stern_rises_out_of_water"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">2:10 AM - Stern rises out of water</span></h3>
      <p>Around 2:10 a.m., the stern rose out of the water, exposing the propellers, and the forward boat deck was flooding. The last two lifeboats floated right off the deck as the ocean reached them: collapsible lifeboat B upside down, and collapsible lifeboat A half-filled with water. Shortly afterwards the first funnel fell forward, crushing part of the bridge and many of those struggling in the water. On deck, people scrambled towards the stern or jumped overboard in hopes of reaching a lifeboat. As the ship&#39;s stern continued to slowly rise into the air, everything not secured crashed towards the bow. The electrical system finally failed and the lights, which had until now burned brightly, went out. Titanic&#39;s second funnel broke off and fell into the water, and Titanic herself tore apart.<p><a name="2:20_AM_-_Titanic_sinks"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">2:20 AM - <i>Titanic</i> sinks</span></h3>
      <p>Stress on the hull caused <i>Titanic</i> to break apart into two large pieces, between the third and fourth funnels, and the bow section went completely under. The stern section briefly righted itself on the water before rising back up vertically. After a few moments, the stern section also sank into the ocean about two hours and forty minutes after the collision with the iceberg.<p>White Star attempted to persuade surviving crewmen not to state that the hull broke in half. The company believed that this information would cast doubts upon the integrity of their vessels. In fact, the stresses inflicted on the hull when it was almost vertical (bow down and stern in the air) were well beyond the design limits of the structure and no legitimate engineer could have fairly criticised the work of the shipbuilders in that regard.<p>Of a total of 2,223 people, only 706 survived; 1,517 perished.. If the lifeboats had been filled to capacity, 1,178 people could have been saved. Of the First Class, 199 were saved (60%) and 130 died. Of the Second Class, 119 (44%) were saved and 166 were lost. Of the Third Class, 174 were saved (25%) and 536 perished. Of the crew, 214 were saved (24%) and 685 perished. 1,347 men (80%) died, and 103 women (26%) died. 53 children (about 50%) also died. Of particular note, the entire complement of the Engineering Department, remaining at their posts to keep the ship&#39;s electrical systems running, drowned. The entirety of the Ship&#39;s band were lost. Led by bandleader Wallace Hartley, they played music on the boat deck of the Titanic that night to calm the passengers. It is rumored that they played the hymn &quot;Nearer, My God, to Thee&quot; as their finale. The majority of deaths were caused by victims succumbing to <!--del_lnk--> hypothermia in the 28&nbsp;&deg;F (&minus;2&nbsp;&deg;C) water. Only one lifeboat came back to the scene of the sinking to attempt to rescue survivors. Another boat helped. Lifeboat 4 was close by and picked up eight crewmen, two of whom later died. Close to an hour later, after tying 3 or 4 lifeboats together on the open sea (a difficult task), Lifeboat 14, under the command of Fifth Officer <!--del_lnk--> Harold Lowe, went back looking for survivors and rescued four people, one of whom died afterwards. Collapsable B was upended all night and began with 30 people. By the time the Carpathia arrived the next morning, 13-14 remained. Included on this boat were the highest ranking officer to survive, Charles Lightolloer, wireless operator Harold Bride, and the chief baker, James Jougin. There were some arguments in some of the other lifeboats about going back, but many survivors were afraid of being swamped by people trying to climb into the lifeboat or being pulled down by the anticipated suction from the sinking ship, though this turned out not to be severe. Only 12 survivors were recovered from the water;<p>As the ship sank into the depths, the two sections ended their final plunges very differently. The streamlined bow planed off approximately 2,000&nbsp;feet (600&nbsp;m) below the surface and slowed somewhat, landing relatively gently. The stern fell fairly straight down towards the ocean floor, possibly rotating as it sank, with the air trapped inside causing implosions. It was already half-crushed when it hit bottom at high speed; the shock caused everything still loose to fall off. The bow section however, having been opened up by the iceberg and having sunk slowly, had little air left in it as it sank and therefore remained relatively intact during its descent.<p><a name="4:10_AM_-_Carpathia_picks_up_first_lifeboat"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">4:10 AM - <i>Carpathia</i> picks up first lifeboat</span></h3>

      <p>Almost two hours after <i>Titanic</i> sank, <!--del_lnk--> RMS <i>Carpathia</i>, commanded by Captain <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Henry Rostron, arrived on scene and picked up its first lifeboat at 4:10 AM, even though the Californian was much closer, their wireless operator had gone to bed for the night and as a result the crew was ignorant of the tragedy unfolding just a few miles away. Over the next hours, the remainder of the survivors were rescued. On board <i>Carpathia</i>, a short prayer service for the rescued and a memorial for the people who lost their lives was held, and at 8:50 a.m. <i>Carpathia</i> left for New York, arriving on <!--del_lnk--> April 18. Once the loss of life was verified, White Star Line chartered the ship <i>MacKay-Bennett</i> to retrieve bodies. A total of 328 bodies were eventually recovered. Many of the bodies were taken to <!--del_lnk--> Halifax, <!--del_lnk--> Nova Scotia where the majority of the unclaimed were buried in <!--del_lnk--> Fairview Cemetery.

      <p>As news of the disaster spread, many people were shocked that <i>Titanic</i> could sink with such great loss of life despite all of its technological advances. Newspapers were filled with stories and descriptions of the disaster and were eager to get the latest information. Many charities were set up to help the victims and their families, many of whom lost their sole breadwinner, or, in the case of third-class survivors, lost everything they owned. The people of Southampton were deeply affected by the sinking. According to the <i>Hampshire Chronicle</i> on <!--del_lnk--> April 20, 1912, almost 1,000 local families were directly affected. Almost every street in the Chapel district of the town lost more than one resident and over 500 households lost a member.<p><a id="Investigation.2C_Safety_Rules_and_The_Californian" name="Investigation.2C_Safety_Rules_and_The_Californian"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Investigation, Safety Rules and <i>The Californian</i></span></h3>
      <p>Before the survivors even arrived in New York, investigations were being planned to discover what had happened to <i>Titanic</i>, and what could be done to prevent a recurrence. The <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Senate.htm" title="United States Senate">United States Senate</a> initiated an inquiry into the <i>Titanic</i> disaster on <!--del_lnk--> April 19, a day after <!--del_lnk--> Carpathia arrived in New York.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The chairman of the inquiry, Senator <!--del_lnk--> William Alden Smith, wanted to gather accounts from passengers and crew while the events were still fresh in their minds. Smith also needed to <!--del_lnk--> subpoena the British citizens while they were still on American soil. The American inquiry lasted until <!--del_lnk--> May 25.<p><!--del_lnk--> Lord Mersey was appointed to head the <!--del_lnk--> British Board of Trade&#39;s inquiry into the disaster. The British inquiry took place between <!--del_lnk--> May 2 and <!--del_lnk--> July 3. Each inquiry took testimony from both passengers and crew of <i>Titanic</i>, crewmembers of <!--del_lnk--> Leyland Line&#39;s <i>The Californian</i>, Captain <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Rostron of the <i>Carpathia</i> and other experts.<p>The investigations found that many safety rules were simply out of date and new laws were recommended. Numerous safety improvements for ocean-going vessels were implemented, including improved hull and bulkhead design, access throughout the ship for egress of passengers, lifeboat requirements, life-vest design, safety drills, better passenger notification, radio communications laws, etc. The investigators also learned that the Titanic had sufficient lifeboat space for all First-Class passengers, but not for the lower classes. In fact, most Third-Class, or Steerage, passengers had no idea where the lifeboats were, much less any way of getting up to the higher decks where the lifeboats were kept. (According to the report published by <!--del_lnk--> Lloyd&#39;s, a higher proportion of First-Class men survived than of Third-Class women or children.)<p>Both inquiries into the disaster found that the <i>Californian</i> and its captain, <!--del_lnk--> Stanley Lord, failed to give proper assistance to <i>Titanic</i>. Testimony before the inquiry revealed that, at 10:10 pm, the <i>Californian</i> observed lights of a ship to the south; it was later agreed between Captain Lord and the third officer (who had relieved Lord of duty at 10:10) that this was a passenger liner. The <i>Californian</i> warned the ship by radio of pack ice on account of which <i>Californian</i> had stopped for the night. At 11:50pm, the officer had watched this ship&#39;s lights flash out, as if the ship had shut down or turned sharply, and that the port light was now observed. Morse signals to the ship, upon Lord&#39;s order, occurred five times between 11:30pm and 1:00am, but were not acknowledged. (In testimony, it was stated that <i>Californian&#39;s</i> Morse lamp had a range of about four miles.)<p>Captain Lord had retired at 11:30; however, the second officer, now on duty, notified Lord at 1:15 am that the ship had fired a rocket, followed by four more. Lord wanted to know if they were &quot;company signals,&quot; that is, colored flares used for identification. The second officer said that he &quot;didn&#39;t know,&quot; that the rockets were all white. Captain Lord instructed the crew to continue Morseing and went back to sleep. Three more rockets were observed at 1:50 and the second officer noted that the ship looked strange in the water, as if it were listing. At 2:15 am, Lord was notified that the ship could no longer be seen. Lord asked again if the lights had had any colors in them, and he was informed that they were all white.<p>The <i>Californian</i> eventually responded. At 5:30 am, the first officer awakened the radio operator, informed him that rockets had been seen during the night, and asked that he try to communicate with any ships. The &lsquo;&lsquo;Frankfurt&rsquo;&rsquo; notified the operator of <i>Titanic&#39;s</i> loss, Captain Lord was notified, and the ship set out for assistance.<p>The inquiries found that <i>Californian</i> was much closer to <i>Titanic</i> than the 19&frac12;&nbsp;miles (36&nbsp;km) that Captain Lord had believed and that Lord should have awakened the wireless operator after the rockets were first reported to him, and thus could have acted to prevent a loss of life. As a result of <i>Californian</i>&#39;s off-duty wireless officer, 29 nations ratified the <!--del_lnk--> Radio Act of 1912, which streamlined radio communications, especially in the event of emergencies.<p><a id="International_Ice_Patrol" name="International_Ice_Patrol"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">International Ice Patrol</span></h3>
      <p>The disaster also led to the convening of the first <!--del_lnk--> International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, on <!--del_lnk--> November 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1913. On <!--del_lnk--> January 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1914, a treaty was signed by the conference and resulted in the formation and international funding of the <!--del_lnk--> International Ice Patrol, an agency of the <!--del_lnk--> United States Coast Guard that to the present day monitors and reports on the location of North <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> icebergs that could pose a threat to transatlantic sea lane traffic. It was also agreed in the new regulations that all passenger vessels would have sufficient lifeboats for everyone on board, that appropriate safety drills would be conducted, and that radio communications would be operated 24 hours a day along with a secondary power supply, so as not to miss distress calls. In addition, it was agreed that the firing of red rockets from a ship must be interpreted as a distress signal. This treaty was scheduled to go into effect <!--del_lnk--> July 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1915, but was upstaged by <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>.<p><a id="Ship_design_changes" name="Ship_design_changes"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Ship design changes</span></h3>
      <p>The sinking of <i>Titanic</i> also changed the way passenger ships were designed, and many existing ships such as <i>Olympic</i> were refitted for increased safety. Besides increasing the number of lifeboats on board, improvements included increasing the height of the watertight bulkheads. The bulkheads on <i>Titanic</i> extended 10&nbsp;feet (3&nbsp;m) above the <!--del_lnk--> waterline, and after <i>Titanic</i> sank the bulkheads on other ships were extended higher to make compartments fully watertight. While <i>Titanic</i> had a <!--del_lnk--> double bottom it did not have a <!--del_lnk--> double hull; after her sinking new ships were designed with double hulls and the double bottoms of other ships (including <i>Olympic&#39;s</i>) were extended up the sides of their hulls above their waterlines to give them double hulls.<p><a id="Legends.2C_myths.2C_and_controversy" name="Legends.2C_myths.2C_and_controversy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Legends, myths, and controversy</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Lifeboats" name="Lifeboats"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Lifeboats</span></h3>
      <p>No single aspect regarding the huge loss of life from the <i>Titanic</i> disaster has provoked more outrage than the fact that the ship did not carry enough lifeboats for all its passengers and crew. This is partially due to the fact that an outdated trade law required a minimum of 16 lifeboats for ships of the <i>Titanic&#39;</i>s size&mdash;meaning that the ship was legally required to carry only enough lifeboats for <i>less</i> than half of its capacity. Actually, White Star Line exceeded the regulations by including four more collapsible lifeboats&mdash;making room for slightly <i>more</i> than half the capacity.<p>A plan was submitted for <i>Titanic</i> to have each of the 16 lifeboats complemented with another three lifeboats, for a total of 64 (four boats at each pair of davits instead of only one). However, J. Bruce Ismay, the President of White Star on the British end, said it would detract from the leisure space for passengers. The priority, it seems, was to give First Class passengers as much deck space as possible to stroll and enjoy the outside air.<p>In addition, at the time, the belief in the shipbuilding industry was that lifeboats would be used to ferry passengers to another ship and disembark them, returning to a stricken liner for more passengers.<p>The lack of lifeboats was not the only cause of the tragic loss of lives. After the collision with the iceberg, one hour was spent to evaluate the damages, recognize what was going to happen, inform first class passengers, and lower the first lifeboat. Afterward, the crew worked quite efficiently, taking a total of 80 minutes to lower all 16 lifeboats. Since the crew was divided in two teams, one on each side of the ship, an average of 10 minutes of work was necessary for a team to fill a lifeboat with passengers and lower it. Only 10 minutes after the last lifeboat was lowered, the stern rose out of water, suggesting that it would not have been possible to lower any more lifeboats, if any were remaining.<p>Yet another factor in the high death toll that related to the lifeboats was the reluctance of the passengers to board the lifeboats. They were, after all, on a ship deemed to be unsinkable. Because of this, some lifeboats were launched with far less than capacity, the most notable being Lifeboat 1, with a capacity of 40, launched with only twelve people aboard, with only two women and no children.<p><a id="Use_of_SOS" name="Use_of_SOS"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Use of SOS</span></h3>
      <p>The sinking of <i>Titanic</i> was not the first time the internationally recognized <!--del_lnk--> Morse code distress signal &quot;<!--del_lnk--> SOS&quot; was used. The SOS signal was first proposed at the <!--del_lnk--> International Conference on Wireless Communication at Sea in <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin.htm" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> in 1906. It was ratified by the international community in 1908 and had been in widespread use since then. The SOS signal was, however, rarely used by British wireless operators, who preferred the older <!--del_lnk--> CQD code. First Wireless Operator <!--del_lnk--> Jack Phillips began transmitting CQD until Second Wireless Operator <!--del_lnk--> Harold Bride suggested, half-jokingly, &quot;Send SOS; it&#39;s the new call, and this may be your last chance to send it.&quot; Phillips, who perished in the disaster, then began to intersperse SOS with the traditional CQD call.<p><a id="Titanic.27s_rudder_and_turning_ability" name="Titanic.27s_rudder_and_turning_ability"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Titanic</i>&#39;s rudder and turning ability</span></h3>

      <p>Although <i>Titanic</i>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> rudder was not legally too small for a ship its size, the rudder&#39;s design was hardly state-of-the-art. According to researchers with the <!--del_lnk--> Titanic Historical Society: &quot;<i>Titanic</i>&#39;s long, thin rudder was a copy of a 19th-century steel sailing ship. Compared with the rudder design of the Cunard&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Mauretania</i> or <i><!--del_lnk--> Lusitania</i>, <i>Titanic</i>&#39;s was a fraction of the size. Apparently no account was made for advances in scale, and little thought given to how a ship 882&frac12; feet (269&nbsp;m) in length might turn in an emergency, or avoid a collision with an iceberg. This was <i>Titanic</i>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Achilles&#39; heel.<p>Perhaps more fatal to the <i>Titanic</i> was its triple-screw engine configuration, which had reciprocating steam engines driving its wing propellers, and a steam turbine driving its centre propeller. The reciprocating engines were reversible, while the turbine was not. When First Officer Murdoch gave the order to reverse engines to avoid the iceberg, he inadvertently handicapped the turning ability of the ship. Since the centre turbine could not reverse during the &quot;full speed astern&quot; maneuver, it simply stopped turning. Furthermore, the centre propeller was positioned forward of the ship&#39;s rudder, diminishing the turning effectiveness of the rudder.<p>Had Murdoch reversed the port engine, and reduced speed while maintaining the forward motion of the other two propellers (as recommended in the training procedures for this type of ship), experts theorize that the <i>Titanic</i> may have been able to navigate around the berg without a collision. However, given the closing distance between the ship and the berg at the time the bridge was notified, this may not have been possible.<p>Additionally, <i>Titanic</i> experts have hypothesized that if <i>Titanic</i> had not altered its course at all and had run head on into the iceberg, the damage would only have affected the first or, at most, the first two compartments. However, other experts have argued that this might also have doomed the ship, since a direct head-on collision with an iceberg would have stopped the ship as abruptly and as violently, possibly compromising its structural integrity and possibly causing the large, heavy boilers to dislodge and possibly crush through the ship&#39;s bottom hull.<p><a id="Titanic.27s_band" name="Titanic.27s_band"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Titanic</i>&#39;s band</span></h3>
      <p>One of the most famous stories of <i>Titanic</i> is of the <!--del_lnk--> band. On <!--del_lnk--> 15 April, <i>Titanic</i>&#39;s eight-member band, led by <!--del_lnk--> Wallace Hartley, had assembled in the first-class lounge in an effort to keep passengers calm and upbeat. Later they would move on to the forward half of the boat deck. The band continued playing music even when it became apparent the ship was going to sink.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>None of the band members survived the sinking, and there has been much speculation about what their last song was. Some witnesses said the final song played was the <!--del_lnk--> hymn &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Nearer, my God, to Thee.&quot; However, there are three versions of this song in existence and no one really knows which version, if any, was played. Hartley reportedly said to a friend if he was on a sinking ship &quot;Nearer, My God, to Thee&quot; would be one of the songs he would play. <!--del_lnk--> Walter Lord&#39;s book <i><!--del_lnk--> A Night to Remember</i> popularised wireless operator Harold Bride&rsquo;s account that he heard the song &quot;Autumn&quot; before the ship sank. It is considered Bride either meant the hymn called &quot;Autumn&quot; or &quot;Songe d&#39;Automne,&quot; a popular ragtime song of the time. Others claimed they heard &quot;Roll out the Barrel.&quot;<p>Hartley&#39;s body was one of those recovered and identified. Considered a hero, his funeral in England was attended by thousands.<p><a id="David_Sarnoff" name="David_Sarnoff"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">David Sarnoff</span></h3>
      <p>An often-quoted story that has been blurred between fact and fiction states that the first person to receive news of the sinking was <!--del_lnk--> David Sarnoff, who would later found media giant <!--del_lnk--> RCA. Sarnoff was not the first to hear the news (though Sarnoff willingly promoted this notion), but he and others did man the <!--del_lnk--> Marconi wireless station atop the <!--del_lnk--> Wanamaker Department Store in New York City, and for three days relayed news of the disaster and names of survivors to people waiting outside.<p><a id="Faults_in_construction" name="Faults_in_construction"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Faults in construction</span></h3>
      <p>Though this topic is seldom discussed, there is some speculation on whether or not <i>Titanic</i> was constructed by methods considered sufficiently robust by the standards of the day. Rumored faults in the construction included problems with safety doors and missing or detached bolts in the ship&#39;s hull plating. Some people say that this was a major contributing factor to the sinking and that the iceberg, in part with the missing bolts and screws, eventually led to the demise of <i>Titanic</i>. Many believe that if the watertight bulkheads had completely sealed the ship&#39;s compartments (they only went 10 ft above the waterline), the ship would have stayed afloat.<p>However, it should be noted that <i>Titanic&#39;s</i> hull was held together by rivets, which are intended to be a permanent way of attaching metal items together, whereas bolts can be removed and would require periodic tightening unless the nut and bolt are welded after being screwed together. Welding technology in 1912 was in its infancy, so this was not done. While issues with <i>Titanic&#39;s</i> rivets have been identified from samples salvaged from the wreck site, many ships of the era would have been constructed with similar methods and did not sink after being involved in collisions. There was a claim that the rivets of the Titanic had not been properly tempered, leaving them brittle and sensitive to fracture in the infamous collision.<p>While sealing off the watertight bulkheads with watertight decks would have increased the survivability of a vessel such as <i>Titanic</i>, they would have by no means ensured the survival of a ship with as much underwater damage as <i>Titanic</i> sustained in her collision with the iceberg: it was a big iceberg. Even if the compartments themselves had remained completely watertight, the weight of water would still have pulled the bow of the ship down to the point where decks above the watertight deck would have been below the waterline. The ship would then have flooded via the portholes and sunk anyway. It should also be noted that watertight decks would have hampered access to the lower sections of the ship and would have required watertight hatches, all of which would have had to be properly sealed to maintain the barrier between the incoming water and the rest of the ship. As the increased survivability such watertight decks would have offered is questionable, they are generally considered to this day to be impractical in merchant vessels (though some military vessels, which are exposed to much greater risk of flooding by virtue of being targets for enemy mines and torpedoes, do feature such decks).<p>It should also be noted that <!--del_lnk--> <i>Olympic</i>, built to almost identical specifications by the same builders as <i>Titanic</i>, was involved with several collisions during the course of her operational lifetime, one of which occurred before the <i>Titanic</i> sank; and <i>Olympic&#39;s</i> hull was modified to protect her from flooding in a fashion similar to her ill-fated sister&#39;s. None of these collisions threatened to sink the ship, suggesting that the <i>Olympic</i>-class liners were built to be sufficiently tough and did not suffer from slipshod construction.<p><a id="Parochial_headline" name="Parochial_headline"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Parochial headline</span></h3>

      <p>As with many famous events, many alternative theories about the sinking of <i>Titanic</i> have appeared over the years. Theories that it was not an iceberg that sank the ship or that a curse caused the disaster have been popular reading in newspapers and books. Most of these theories have been debunked by <i>Titanic</i> experts, citing inaccurate or incomplete facts on which the theories are based.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 2003 Captain L. M. Collins, a former member of the Ice Pilotage Service published <i>The Sinking of the</i> Titanic<i>: The Mystery Solved</i> proposing, based upon his own experience of ice navigation, and witness statements given at the two post-disaster enquiries, that what the Titanic hit was not an iceberg but low-lying pack ice. He based his conclusion upon three main pieces of evidence.<p>Another theory is that the <i>Titanic</i> was sacrificed because, once construction had been completed, she was expected to be a potential perpetual financial loss. Supporters of this theory cite the claim that everyone concerned, the company and the officers aboard, had received iceberg warnings and yet the Titanic maintained a northern course instead of sailing to the south of the warning limit.<p>There is even a curse legend. While the ship was being built in the <a href="../../wp/b/Belfast.htm" title="Belfast">Belfast</a> shipyard, several <!--del_lnk--> Catholic workers reportedly walked off the job in protest when they noticed horrible blasphemies against Catholicism and the <!--del_lnk--> Virgin Mary spray-painted by <!--del_lnk--> Protestant workers on parts of the ship. One of the workers stated, &quot;This ship will not finish its first voyage&quot;. The graffiti were noted by coal-fillers when the ship stopped at <!--del_lnk--> Cobh, Ireland.<p>A similar legend states that <i>Titanic</i> was given hull number 390904 (which, when seen in a mirror or written using <!--del_lnk--> mirror writing, looks like &quot;no <a href="../../wp/p/Pope.htm" title="Pope">pope</a>&quot;). This is a myth.<!--del_lnk--> <p>One popular myth states that the <i>Titanic</i> was carrying a cursed <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">Egyptian</a> <a href="../../wp/m/Mummy.htm" title="Mummy">mummy</a>. The mummy, nicknamed Shipwrecker, after changing hands several times, and causing many terrible things to each of its owners, exacts its final revenge by sinking the famous ship. This myth is untrue.<!--del_lnk--> <p>Another myth says that the bottle of champagne used in christening the <i>Titanic</i> did not break on the first try, which in sealore is said to be bad luck for a ship. In fact, <i>Titanic</i> was not christened, as White Star Line&#39;s custom was to launch ships without a christening. <!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Rediscovery" name="Rediscovery"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Rediscovery</span></h2>

      <p>The idea of finding the <!--del_lnk--> wreck of <i>Titanic</i> and even raising the ship from the ocean floor had been perpetuated since shortly after the ship sank. No attempts even to locate the ship were successful until <!--del_lnk--> September 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1985, when a joint American-French expedition, led by Jean-Louis Michel of <!--del_lnk--> Ifremer and Dr. <!--del_lnk--> Robert Ballard of the <!--del_lnk--> Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, sailing on the Research Vessel <!--del_lnk--> <i>Knorr</i>, discovered the wreck using the video camera sled <i><!--del_lnk--> Argo</i>. It was found at a depth of 12,500 feet (3800 m), south-east of <!--del_lnk--> Newfoundland at <span class="plainlinksneverexpand"><!--del_lnk--> <span style="white-space:nowrap">41&deg;43&prime;55&Prime;N,</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap">49&deg;56&prime;45&Prime;W</span></span>, 13 nautical miles (24&nbsp;km) from where <i>Titanic</i> was originally thought to rest.<p>The most notable discovery the team made was that the ship had split apart, the stern section lying 1,970 feet (600&nbsp;m) from the bow section and facing opposite directions. There had been conflicting witness accounts of whether the ship broke apart or not, and both the American and British inquiries found that the ship sank intact. Up until the discovery of the wreck, it was generally assumed the ship did not break apart. In 2005, a theory was presented that a portion of <i>Titanic</i>&#39;s bottom broke off right before the ship broke in two. The theory was conceived after an expedition sponsored by <!--del_lnk--> The History Channel examined the two hull pieces.<p>The bow section had embedded itself 60 feet (18&nbsp;m) into the silt on the ocean floor. Besides parts of the hull having buckled, the bow was mostly intact, as the water inside had equalized with the increasing water pressure. The stern section was in much worse condition. As the stern section sank, water pushed out the air inside tearing apart the hull and decks. The speed at which the stern hit the ocean floor caused even more damage. Surrounding the wreck is a large debris field with pieces of the ship (including a large amount of coal), <!--del_lnk--> furniture, dinnerware and personal items scattered over one square mile (2.6 km&sup2;). Softer materials, like wood and carpet, were devoured by undersea organisms. Human remains suffered a similar fate.<p>Later exploration of the vessel&#39;s lower decks, as chronicled in the book <i>Ghosts of the Titanic</i> by Dr. <!--del_lnk--> Charles Pellegrino, showed that much of the wood from the <i>Titanic&#39;s</i> staterooms was still intact. A new theory has been put forth that much of the wood from the upper decks was not devoured by undersea organisms but rather broke free of its moorings and floated away. This is supported by some eyewitness testimony from the survivors. Also, while filming James Cameron&#39;s <i>Titanic</i>, the Grand Staircase set broke free of supports when it was flooded for sinking sequences of the film. This has led historian <!--del_lnk--> Don Lynch and historical artist <!--del_lnk--> Ken Marschall to believe that the Grand Staircase in fact exited the sinking ship in this way (as mentioned in DVD commentary of the film).<p>Although the British inquiry had determined mathematically that the damage to the ship could not have comprised more than twelve square feet, the popular notion was that the iceberg had cut a 300 foot (90&nbsp;m) long gash into <i>Titanic</i>&#39;s hull. Since the part of the ship that the iceberg had damaged was buried, scientists used <!--del_lnk--> sonar to examine the area and discovered the iceberg had caused the hull to buckle, allowing water to enter <i>Titanic</i> between its steel plates. During subsequent dives, scientists retrieved small pieces of <i>Titanic</i>&#39;s hull. A detailed analysis of the pieces revealed the ship&#39;s steel plating was of a variety that loses its elasticity and becomes <!--del_lnk--> brittle in cold or icy water, leaving it vulnerable to dent-induced ruptures. Furthermore, the rivets holding the hull together were much more fragile than once thought. It is unknown if stronger steel or rivets could have saved the ship.<p>The samples of steel rescued from the wrecked hull were found to have very high content of <a href="../../wp/p/Phosphorus.htm" title="Phosphorus">phosphorus</a> and <!--del_lnk--> sulphur (four times and two times as high as common for modern steels), with a <a href="../../wp/m/Manganese.htm" title="Manganese">manganese</a>-sulphur ratio of 6.8:1 (compare with over 200:1 ratio for modern steels). High content of phosphorus initiates fractures, sulphur forms grains of iron sulphide that facilitate propagation of cracks, and lack of manganese makes the steel less ductile. The recovered samples were found to be undergoing <!--del_lnk--> ductile-brittle transition in temperatures of 32&nbsp;&deg;C (for longitudinal samples) and 56&nbsp;&deg;C (for transversal samples&mdash;compare with transition temperature of &minus;27&nbsp;&deg;C common for modern steels&mdash;modern steel would become as brittle between &minus;60 and &minus;70&nbsp;&deg;C). The <!--del_lnk--> anisotropy was likely caused by <!--del_lnk--> hot rolling influencing the orientation of the sulphide <!--del_lnk--> stringer inclusions. The steel was probably produced in the acid-lined, open-hearth furnaces in <a href="../../wp/g/Glasgow.htm" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, which would explain the high content of phosphorus and sulphur, even for the times.<p>Dr. Ballard and his team did not bring up any artifacts from the site, considering it to be tantamount to grave robbing. Under international maritime law, however, the recovery of artifacts is necessary to establish <!--del_lnk--> salvage rights to a shipwreck. In the years after the find, <i>Titanic</i> has been the object of a number of court cases concerning ownership of artifacts and the wreck site itself.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> June 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1994, RMS Titanic Inc. was awarded ownership and salvaging rights of the wreck by the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. (See <!--del_lnk--> Admiralty law) RMS Titanic Inc., a subsidiary of Premier Exhibitions Inc., and its predecessors have conducted seven expeditions to the wreck between 1987 and 2004 and salvaged over 5,500 objects. The biggest single recovered artifact was a 17-ton section of the hull, recovered in 1998. Many of these artifacts are part of travelling museum exhibitions.<p>Beginning in 1987, a joint American-French expedition, which included the predecessor of RMS Titanic Inc., began salvage operations and, during 32 dives, recovered approximately 1,800 artifacts which were taken to France for conservation and restoration. In 1993, a French administrator in the Office of Maritime Affairs of the Ministry of Equipment, Transportation, and Tourism awarded RMS Titanic Inc&#39;s predecessor title to the artifacts recovered in 1987.<p>In a motion filed on <!--del_lnk--> February 12, <!--del_lnk--> 2004, RMS Titanic Inc. requested that the District Court enter an order awarding it &quot;title to all the artifacts (including portions of the hull) which are the subject of this action pursuant to the law of finds&quot; or, in the alternative, a salvage award in the amount of $225 million. RMS Titanic Inc. excluded from its motion any claim for an award of title to the 1987 artifacts. But it did request that the district court declare that, based on the French administrative action, &quot;the artifacts raised during the 1987 expedition are independently owned by RMST.&quot; Following a hearing, the district court entered an order dated <!--del_lnk--> July 2, <!--del_lnk--> 2004, in which it refused to grant comity and recognize the 1993 decision of the French administrator, and rejected RMS Titanic Inc&#39;s claim that it should be awarded title to the artifacts recovered since 1993 under the maritime law of finds.<p>RMS Titanic Inc. appealed to the <!--del_lnk--> United States court of appeals. In its decision of <!--del_lnk--> January 31, <!--del_lnk--> 2006 the court recognized &quot;explicitly the appropriateness of applying maritime salvage law to historic wrecks such as that of <i>Titanic</i>&quot; and denied the application the maritime law of finds. The court also ruled that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the &quot;1987 artifacts&quot;, and therefore vacated that part of the court&#39;s July 2, 2004 order. In other words, according to this decision, RMS Titanic Inc. has ownership title to the artifacts awarded in the French decision (valued $16.5 million earlier) and continues to be salvor-in-possession of the <i>Titanic</i> wreck. The Court of Appeals remanded the case to the District Court to determine the salvage award ($225 million requested by RMS Titanic Inc.).<p><a id="Current_condition_of_the_wreck" name="Current_condition_of_the_wreck"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Current condition of the wreck</span></h2>
      <p>Many scientists, including Robert Ballard, are concerned that visits by tourists in <!--del_lnk--> submersibles and the recovery of artifacts are hastening the <!--del_lnk--> decay of the wreck. Underwater microbes have been <!--del_lnk--> eating away at <i>Titanic</i>&#39;s iron since the ship sank, but because of the extra damage visitors have caused, <!--del_lnk--> National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that &quot;the hull and structure of the ship may collapse to the ocean floor within the next 50 years.&quot; Several scientists and conservationists have also complained about the removal of the crow&#39;s nest on the mast by a French expedition.<p>Ballard&#39;s book <i>Return to Titanic</i>, published by the <!--del_lnk--> National Geographic Society, includes photographs showing the deterioration of the <!--del_lnk--> promenade deck and alleged damage caused by submersibles landing on the ship; however, Ballard was the first person to crash a camera sled into the wreck, and also the first person to repeatedly land on its deck in a submersible. The <!--del_lnk--> mast has almost completely deteriorated and repeated accusations were made in print by Ballard that it had been stripped of its bell and brass light by salvagers, despite his own original discovery images clearly showing that the bell was never actually on the mast- it was recovered from the sea floor. Even the memorial plaque left by Ballard on his second trip to the wreck was alleged to have been removed; Ballard replaced the plaque in 2004. Recent expeditions, notably by <!--del_lnk--> James Cameron, have been diving on the wreck to learn more about the site and explore previously unexplored parts of the ship before <i>Titanic</i> decays completely.<p><a id="Comparable_maritime_disasters" name="Comparable_maritime_disasters"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Comparable maritime disasters</span></h2>
      <p><i>Titanic</i> was at the time one of the worst maritime disasters in history, a comparable loss of life having never happened before on the heavily travelled North Atlantic route. It remains the worst civilian maritime disaster in British history. The biggest civilian maritime disaster in the Atlantic Ocean up to that time had been the wreck of <!--del_lnk--> SS <i>Norge</i> off <a href="../../wp/r/Rockall.htm" title="Rockall">Rockall</a> in 1904 with the loss of 635 lives. However, <i>Titanic</i>&#39;s death toll had been exceeded by the explosion and sinking of the steamboat <!--del_lnk--> <i>Sultana</i> on the <a href="../../wp/m/Mississippi_River.htm" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</a> in 1865, where an estimated 1,700 died. Two years after the <i>Titanic</i> disaster, a <!--del_lnk--> Canadian liner, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Empress of Ireland</i> sank in the <!--del_lnk--> Saint Lawrence River with 1,012 lives lost after colliding with <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norwegian</a> coal freighter <i>Storstad</i>. The ratio has been repeated with the sinking of <!--del_lnk--> RMS <i>Lusitania</i> and the sinking of <!--del_lnk--> RMS <i>Leinster</i>. Both were sunk by German <!--del_lnk--> U-boats in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>.<p>Also similar to <i>Titanic</i> was <!--del_lnk--> <i>Hans Hedtoft</i>.

In 2002, a <!--del_lnk--> Senegalese government-owned ferry <!--del_lnk--> MV <i>Joola</i> capsized off the coast of <!--del_lnk--> Gambia resulted in the deaths of at least 1,863 people.<p>The worst maritime disasters happened during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. <!--del_lnk--> RMS Lancastria sank during the evacuation from Dunkirk in June 1940 with the loss of 4,000+ lives.

The <!--del_lnk--> SS <i>Cap Arcona</i> (which, ironically, stood in for <i>Titanic</i> in the <!--del_lnk--> 1943 film version of the tragedy) was sunk by the <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Air_Force.htm" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a> on <!--del_lnk--> May 3, <!--del_lnk--> 1945, with an estimated death toll of more than 7,700.

Of its 558 passengers and crew, 276 were lost. The White Star Line had also previously lost the <!--del_lnk--> RMS <i>Atlantic</i> on rocks near Nova Scotia in 1873 with 546 fatalities, and <!--del_lnk--> SS <i>Naronic</i> in 1893, probably in an iceberg collision near the <i>Titanic</i>&#39;s position, with the loss of all 74 aboard. Three years before <i>Titanic</i>, on <!--del_lnk--> January 24, <!--del_lnk--> 1909, another palatial and &quot;unsinkable&quot; White Star Line passenger liner, the <!--del_lnk--> RMS <i>Republic</i> sank 50 miles off the coast of Nantucket killing six persons. <i>Titanic&#39;</i>s sister ship <i><!--del_lnk--> Britannic</i> sank in the Mediterranean sea while serving as a British hospital ship during World War I. Conflicting accounts say it was either a <!--del_lnk--> torpedo attack or an unlucky encounter with an ocean <!--del_lnk--> mine (the sinking was proved to have been caused by a mine). 34 people died when one of the lifeboats was launched before the ship had come to a total stop and the boat was sucked into a still revolving propeller.<p><a id="Popular_culture" name="Popular_culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Popular culture</span></h2>

Therefore, with the death of Lillian Gertrude Asplund, firsthand passenger experience of the <i>Titanic&#39;s</i> sinking has passed out of living memory.<p><a id="The_last_ten_survivors" name="The_last_ten_survivors"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The last ten survivors</span></h3>
