      <p>The <b>Redwood National and State Parks</b> (RNSP) are located in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, along the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> coast of northern <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a>. With an area of 112,512&nbsp;acres (45,500&nbsp;ha), the parks protect 45% of the remaining groves of <a href="../../wp/s/Sequoia.htm" title="Sequoia">coastal redwood</a> (<i>Sequoia sempervirens</i>) <a href="../../wp/t/Tree.htm" title="Tree">trees</a>, the tallest and one of the most massive tree species on Earth. In addition to the redwood forests, the parks preserve grassland <!--del_lnk--> prairie, cultural resources, and 37&nbsp;miles (60&nbsp;km) of pristine coastline.<p>In 1850, <!--del_lnk--> old growth redwood forest covered 2 million acres (810,000&nbsp;ha) of the north California coast, an area which had been inhabited by <!--del_lnk--> Native Americans for 3,000 years, when a minor <!--del_lnk--> gold rush brought miners and <!--del_lnk--> loggers who began cutting down the trees. The efforts of the <!--del_lnk--> Save-the-Redwoods League, founded in 1918, to preserve three large redwood groves eventually resulted in the establishment of <!--del_lnk--> Prairie Creek, <!--del_lnk--> Del Norte Coast, and <!--del_lnk--> Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Parks. <a href="../../wp/r/Redwood_National_and_State_Parks.htm" title="Redwood National Park">Redwood National Park</a> was created in 1968, by which time nearly 90% of the original redwood trees had been logged. The <!--del_lnk--> National Park Service and the <!--del_lnk--> California Department of Parks and Recreation administratively combined Redwood National Park with the three state parks in 1994, a degree of collaboration between the National Park Service and a state park system which is unique in the U.S.<p>The ecosystem of the RNSP preserves a number of <!--del_lnk--> threatened animal species such as the <!--del_lnk--> brown pelican, <!--del_lnk--> tidewater goby, <!--del_lnk--> bald eagle, <!--del_lnk--> chinook salmon, <!--del_lnk--> northern-spotted owl, and <!--del_lnk--> Steller&#39;s sea lion. In recognition of the rare ecosystem and cultural history found in the parks, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> designated them a <a href="../../wp/w/World_Heritage_Site.htm" title="World Heritage Site">World Heritage Site</a> on <!--del_lnk--> September 5, <!--del_lnk--> 1980, and an <!--del_lnk--> International Biosphere Reserve on <!--del_lnk--> June 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1983.<p>

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>As early as 3,000 years ago, <!--del_lnk--> Native Americans lived in the park area. Such groups as the <!--del_lnk--> Yurok, <!--del_lnk--> Tolowa, <!--del_lnk--> Shasta, <!--del_lnk--> Karok, <!--del_lnk--> Chilula, and <!--del_lnk--> Wiyot all have historical ties to the region. An 1852 census determined that the Yurok were the most numerous, with 55 villages and an estimated population of 2,500. They used the abundant redwood, which with its linear <!--del_lnk--> grain was easily split into planks, as a building material for boats, houses, and small villages. For buildings, the planks would be erected side by side in a narrow trench, with the upper portions bound with <!--del_lnk--> leather strapping and held by notches cut into the supporting roof beams. Redwood boards were used to form a shallow sloping roof.<p><a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spanish</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">British</a>, <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russian</a>, and American explorers visited the coast near the present park as early as the mid 16th century, to trade with local people for <!--del_lnk--> seal pelts. Until the arrival of <!--del_lnk--> Jedediah Smith, in 1828, no white explorer is known to have thoroughly investigated the inland region. The discovery of gold along Trinity Creek in 1850 brought thousands of miners into the area, which led to conflicts; the native peoples were forcibly removed and in some cases massacred. By 1895, only one third of the Yurok in one group of villages remained; and, by 1919, virtually all members of the Chilula tribe had either died or been assimilated into other tribes. The miners <!--del_lnk--> logged redwoods for building; and, when this minor <!--del_lnk--> gold rush ended, some of them became loggers, cutting down as many trees as they could sell. In 1850, 2&nbsp;million <!--del_lnk--> acres (810,000&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ha) of the northwest California coast was old-growth redwood forest; but, by 1910, so many redwoods had been cut down that <!--del_lnk--> conservationists and concerned citizens began seeking ways to preserve the remaining trees. In 1911, <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_House_of_Representatives.htm" title="United States House of Representatives">U.S. Representative</a> <!--del_lnk--> John E. Raker, of California, became the first politician to introduce legislation for the creation of a national park. However, no further action was taken by Congress at this time.<p>The completion of <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Route 101 brought conservationists <!--del_lnk--> John C. Merriam, <!--del_lnk--> Madison Grant, and <!--del_lnk--> Henry Fairfield Osborn to the region. Disappointed to find that there were no public lands set aside to preserve the redwoods, they founded the <!--del_lnk--> Save-the-Redwoods League in 1918. Using matching funds provided by the state of California, the Save-the-Redwoods League managed to save three large redwood groves by the early 1920s. When California created a state park system, in 1927, these three groves became the Prairie Creek Redwoods, Del Norte Coast Redwoods, and Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Parks. Because of the high demand for lumber during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> and the construction boom of the 1950s, the creation of a national park was delayed. Efforts by the Save-the-Redwoods League, the <!--del_lnk--> Sierra Club, and the <!--del_lnk--> National Geographic Society to create a national park began in the early 1960s. After intense lobbying of <!--del_lnk--> Congress, the bill creating Redwood National Park was signed by <a href="../../wp/p/President_of_the_United_States.htm" title="President of the United States">President</a> <!--del_lnk--> Lyndon Johnson on <!--del_lnk--> 2 October <!--del_lnk--> 1968. The Save-the-Redwoods League and other entities purchased over 100,000&nbsp;acres (40,000&nbsp;ha), which were added to existing state parks. In 1978, 48,000&nbsp;acres (19,000&nbsp;ha) were added to Redwood National Park in a major expansion. However, only a fifth of that land was old-growth forest, the rest having been logged. This expansion protected the watershed along <!--del_lnk--> Redwood Creek from being adversely affected by logging operations outside the park. The federal and state parks were administratively combined in 1994.<p>The <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> designated Redwood National and State Parks a <a href="../../wp/w/World_Heritage_Site.htm" title="World Heritage Site">World Heritage Site</a> on <!--del_lnk--> 5 September <!--del_lnk--> 1980. The evaluation committee noted 50 prehistoric <!--del_lnk--> archaeological sites, spanning 4,500 years. It also cited ongoing research in the park by <!--del_lnk--> Humboldt State University researchers, among others. The park is part of a much larger region designated the <i>California Coast Ranges</i> <!--del_lnk--> International Biosphere Reserve on <!--del_lnk--> June 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1983. The California Coast Ranges biosphere is overseen by the <!--del_lnk--> University of California Natural Reserve System.<p><a id="Park_management" name="Park_management"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Park management</span></h2>

      <p>The RNSP are managed jointly by the <!--del_lnk--> National Park Service, a federal agency within the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Department of the Interior, and the <!--del_lnk--> California Department of Parks and Recreation, with an annual budget of $7,380,000 (2004). The two agencies work cooperatively to protect the redwoods, the pristine Pacific Ocean coastline, the cultural resources, and the unique natural habitat. The land that was added to the parks in 1978 had previously been logged, and efforts to restore these areas have been ongoing for decades, with old logging roads being removed and the land allowed to return to its original state. Lack of funding has precluded major improvements, however, and timber companies have replanted much of the logged area with non-native tree species. Coastline areas, including dunes and coastal prairie, have been invaded by exotic species, partly due to the suppression of <!--del_lnk--> forest fires until the 1980s. A fire management plan now allows <!--del_lnk--> controlled burning as one method to return the parkland to its original state. Since the redwoods were logged on the basis of accessibility, with inaccessible areas being cut last, large old growth forest sections were isolated from one another, sometimes by many miles. In these cases it will be decades more before mature forest can return, regardless of the amount of money used to rehabilitate the ecosystem.<p>The park has transformed a few logging roads into scenic public drives. These do not meet current safety standards, but funding to improve them is not available at present. Park structures such as visitor centers and employee housing also need updating to meet increasing demands. The park employees perform air and water quality surveys, monitor endangered and <!--del_lnk--> threatened species, and work closely with the <!--del_lnk--> California Coastal National Monument, which is managed by the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Bureau of Land Management. The park headquarters is in <!--del_lnk--> Crescent City, California.<p><a id="Natural_resources" name="Natural_resources"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Recreation</span></h2>
      <p>Other than the DeMartin Redwood Youth Hostel, a low-amenities shared lodging facility, there are no <!--del_lnk--> hotels or <!--del_lnk--> motels within the parks. Nearby towns such as <!--del_lnk--> Eureka and Crescent City have accommodation facilities. The park is 340&nbsp;miles (550&nbsp;km) north of <a href="../../wp/s/San_Francisco%252C_California.htm" title="San Francisco, California">San Francisco, California</a>, and 330&nbsp;miles (530&nbsp;km) south of <!--del_lnk--> Portland, Oregon, and <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Route 101 passes through it from north to south. The <!--del_lnk--> Smith River National Recreation Area, part of the <!--del_lnk--> Six Rivers National Forest, is adjacent to the north end of RNSP.<p>While the state parks have front country campsites that can be driven to, the federal sections of the park do not, and hiking is the only way of reaching back country campsites. These are at Mill Creek campground in Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park and Jedediah Smith campground in Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, which have together have 251 campsites, the Elk Prairie campground in Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park which has 75, and the Gold Bluffs Beach campground which has 25 campsites. Other nearby state parks have additional front country camping. Back country camping is by permit only and is only allowed in designated sites, except on gravel bars along <!--del_lnk--> Redwood Creek.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The back country is highly regulated to prevent overuse and to permit as many groups as possible to explore the forest. Camping in the back country is therefore limited to five consecutive nights, and 15 nights in any one year. Proper food storage to minimize encounters with bears is strongly enforced, and hikers and backpackers are required to take out any trash they generate.<p>Almost 200&nbsp;miles (320&nbsp;km) of hiking trails exist in the parks, but during the rainy season some temporary footbridges are removed, as they would be destroyed by high streams. Throughout the year, trails are often wet and hikers need to be well prepared for rainy weather and consult information centers for updates on trail conditions.<p><!--del_lnk--> Horseback riding and <!--del_lnk--> mountain biking are popular but are only allowed on certain trails. <!--del_lnk--> Kayaking is popular along the seacoast and in the various rivers and streams. Kayakers and canoeists frequently travel the <!--del_lnk--> Smith River, which is the longest un<a href="../../wp/d/Dam.htm" title="Dam">dammed</a> river remaining in California. <a href="../../wp/f/Fishing.htm" title="Fishing">Fishing</a> for <!--del_lnk--> salmon and <!--del_lnk--> steelhead, (a highly prized <!--del_lnk--> rainbow trout over 16&nbsp;inches (40&nbsp;cm) long), is best in the Smith and <!--del_lnk--> Klamath rivers. A California sport fishing license is required to fish any of the rivers and streams. Hunting is not permitted anywhere in the parks, but is allowed in nearby <!--del_lnk--> National Forests.<p>The park has two visitor centers and three additional information points. At the visitor centers, guided nature walks and general information is available. Each campground offers campfire talks during the summer months as well as guided tours. The parks have many <!--del_lnk--> picnic areas, which are all easily accessed by vehicle.<p><a id="In_films" name="In_films"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">In films</span></h2>
