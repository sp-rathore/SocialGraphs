<h2>SOS Children in Russia</h2>
<img src="../../wp/s/SOS_map_russia.jpg" width="540" height="326" alt="SOS Russia sponsorship locations" class="left" /><p>Russia is the largest country in the world and one of the most fascinating and diverse in terms of climate, peoples, culture and history. It spans 11 time zones and 160 degrees of longtitude - nearly halfway around the Earth. </p><p>Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia has been striving to overcome the legacy of Communism. While there have been positive economic trends, the benefits are slow to filter down to ordinary people. Wages are low, inequality continues to rise and poverty is at significant levels, particularly among families with children or single-parent families, leading to many children being abandoned into state care or onto the streets. </p><p>Plans for the charity to establish an SOS Children's Villagein Russia began in the late 1980s but it wasn&rsquo;t until 1996 that the first children moved into the 11 family houses in the charity's Tomolino community, on the outskirts of Moscow, as the initial site for the village proved unsuitable and an alternative had to be found. In 2002, a youth house for the older children was established, where they can live and be supported until they are independent.</p><p>Since then three more villages have been built. SOS Children Lavrovo, in Oryol region, about 350km south of Moscow, opened its doors in 1998 and currently has 12 family houses for 85 children. </p><p>SOS Children's Village Pushkin, 17km south of St Petersburg, was finished in 2000 and has 12 family houses for 76 children, many of whom were previously living in the streets or in run-down, overcrowded state orphanages.</p><img src="../../wp/c/Children_Kandalaksha.jpg" width="346" height="259" alt="Children at SOS Children's Village Kandalaksha" class="right" /><p>A fourth Village has been built 250km from Murmansk - SOS Children&rsquo;s Village Kandalaksha. The village, which is the most northern SOS Children's Village not only in Russia but in the world, came into operation in 2003. SOS Children originally began working in the area through a relief programme in 1998/99 in conjunction with the Norwegian Red Cross, providing warm clothing and toiletries to over 2500 children in orphanages or living with foster parents.</p><p>All four villages have the advantage of good infrastructure and the children attend local public nurseries and schools. Planning is underway for two more villages to be constructed in Russia in the near future.</p><p>There are also seven SOS Youth Homes in Russia, into which the older children, aged 15-16, move from the children&rsquo;s villages once they have finished their general school education. They live here for 3-4 years until they have finished training for their chosen profession. They are helped to study, find employment, and prepare all the necessary documents to get accommodation of their own. </p><p>The 18-19 year old youngsters are offered an after-care programme for the next 3 years. Three of these youth homes are located in Moscow and the Moscow region, two in Oryol, and two in St Petersburg.</p><p>Since 2006 a Foster Family Project and Family Strengthening Programme have also been in operation in the Murmansk region.</p><h3>Local Contact</h3>
