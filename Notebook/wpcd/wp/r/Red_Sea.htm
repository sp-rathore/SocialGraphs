      <p>The <b>Red Sea</b> is an inlet of the <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Ocean.htm" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> between <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a>. The connection to the ocean is in the south through the <!--del_lnk--> Bab el Mandeb sound and the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf of Aden. In the north are the <!--del_lnk--> Sinai Peninsula, the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf of Aqaba or the Gulf of <!--del_lnk--> Eilat and the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf of Suez (leading to the <a href="../../wp/s/Suez_Canal.htm" title="Suez Canal">Suez Canal</a>).<p>Occupying a part of the <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Rift_Valley.htm" title="Great Rift Valley">Great Rift Valley</a>, the Red Sea has a surface area of roughly 174,000 <!--del_lnk--> square miles (450,000 <!--del_lnk--> km&sup2;): being roughly 1,200 <!--del_lnk--> miles (1,900 km) long and, at its widest point, over 190 miles (300 <!--del_lnk--> km) wide. It has a maximum depth of 8,200 <!--del_lnk--> feet (2,500 m) in the central median trench and an average depth of 1,640 feet (500 m), but there are also extensive shallow shelves, noted for their marine life and <!--del_lnk--> corals. The sea is the habitat of over 1,000 <a href="../../wp/i/Invertebrate.htm" title="Invertebrate">invertebrate</a> species and 200 soft and hard corals and is <!--del_lnk--> the world&#39;s most northern tropical sea.<p>The Red Sea is regarded as one of the most <!--del_lnk--> saline water bodies in the world that is governed by the effects of the water circulation pattern, resulting from evaporation and wind stress in the Red Sea. Salinity ranges between 36 and 38 &permil;.<p>

      <p>Red Sea is a direct translation of the <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> Mare Erythraeum, <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> Al-Ba&#x1E25;r Al-A&#x1E25;mar (&#x627;&#x644;&#x628;&#x62D;&#x631; &#x627;&#x644;&#x623;&#x62D;&#x645;&#x631;), and <!--del_lnk--> Tigrinya Qey&#x1E25; b&#x101;&#x1E25;r&#x12B; (&#x1240;&#x12ED;&#x1215; &#x1263;&#x1215;&#x122A;).<p>The name of the sea does not indicate the color of the water, because it is not red in colour. It may signify the seasonal blooms of the red-colored <!--del_lnk--> cyanobacteria <i><!--del_lnk--> Trichodesmium erythraeum</i> near the water surface. Some suggest that it refers to the mineral-rich red <!--del_lnk--> mountains nearby which are called Harei Edom (&#x5D4;&#x5E8;&#x5D9; &#x5D0;&#x5D3;&#x5D5;&#x5DD;). <i><!--del_lnk--> Edom</i>, meaning &quot;ruddy complexion&quot;, is also an alternative <a href="../../wp/h/Hebrew_language.htm" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> name for the red-faced biblical character <!--del_lnk--> Esau (brother of <!--del_lnk--> Jacob), and the nation descended from him, the <!--del_lnk--> Edomites, which in turn provides yet another possible origin for <i>Red Sea</i>.<p>There is also speculation that the name Red Sea came from a mistranslation of what should have been <!--del_lnk--> Reed Sea in the <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">Biblical</a> account of <!--del_lnk--> the Exodus.<p>Another hypothesis is that the name comes from the <!--del_lnk--> Himarites, a local group whose own name means <i>red</i>.<p>Yet another theory favored by some modern scholars is the name <i>red</i> is referring to the direction south, the same way the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Sea.htm" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a>&#39;s name may refer to north. The basis of this theory is that some Asiatic languages used colour words to refer to the <!--del_lnk--> cardinal directions.<p>A final theory suggests that it was named so because because it borders the Egyptian Desert which the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">ancient Egyptians</a> called the <i>Dashret</i> or &quot;red land&quot;; therefore it would have been the sea of the red land.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Egyptians were the first to attempt a <!--del_lnk--> mission of exploration in the Red Sea. In the <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">Bible</a>, the story of <!--del_lnk--> The Exodus tells how <!--del_lnk--> Moses, the son of a slave woman, leads the <!--del_lnk--> Israelites across its headwaters, (presumably the <!--del_lnk--> Reed Sea which has since disappeared because of the Suez Canal water diversion) to freedom, by using the powers of <a href="../../wp/g/God.htm" title="God">God</a> to <!--del_lnk--> part the waters. However, it was a Greek sailor, <!--del_lnk--> Hippalus, who conferred an international dimension upon the Red Sea in his manifesto on the voyage of the <a href="../../wp/e/Eritrea.htm" title="Eritrea">Eritrea</a> Sea and thus opened it up to an immense and exclusive trade with <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a>. It was only from the 15th century onwards that <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> began to show interest in this area. In 1798, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> charged General <!--del_lnk--> Bonaparte with invading Egypt and capturing the Red Sea. Although he failed in his mission, the engineer J.B. <!--del_lnk--> Lepere, who took part in it revitalised the plan for a canal which had been envisaged during the reign of the <!--del_lnk--> Pharaohs. The <a href="../../wp/s/Suez_Canal.htm" title="Suez Canal">Suez Canal</a> was opened in November 1869. At the time, the British, French, and Italians shared the trading posts. The posts were gradually dismantled following the <!--del_lnk--> First World War. After the <!--del_lnk--> Second World War, the Americans and Soviets exerted their influence whilst the volume of oil tanker traffic intensified. However, the <!--del_lnk--> Six Day War culminated in the closure of the Suez Canal from 1967 to 1975. Still today, in spite of patrols by the major maritime fleets in the waters of the Red Sea, the Suez Canal has never recovered its supremacy over the Cape route, which is believed to be less vulnerable.<p><a id="Oceanography" name="Oceanography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Oceanography</span></h2>
      <p>The Red Sea lies between arid land, <a href="../../wp/d/Desert.htm" title="Desert">desert</a> and semi-desert. The main reasons for the better development of reef systems along the Red Sea is because of its greater depths and an efficient water circulation pattern, The Red Sea water mass exchanges its water with the <!--del_lnk--> Arabian Sea, <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Ocean.htm" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> via the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf of Aden. These physical factors reduce the effect of high salinity caused by evaporation and cold water in the north and relatively hot water in the south.<p><b>Climate:</b> The <a href="../../wp/c/Climate.htm" title="Climate">climate</a> of the Red Sea is the result of two distinct monsoon seasons; a northeasterly monsoon and a southwesterly monsoon. Monsoon winds occur because of the differential heating between the land surface and sea. Very high surface temperatures coupled with high salinities makes this one of the hottest and saltiest bodies of seawater in the world. The average surface water temperature of the Red Sea during the <a href="../../wp/s/Summer.htm" title="Summer">summer</a> is about 26&deg;C in the north and 30&deg;C in the south, with only about 2&deg;C variation during the winter months. The overall average water temperature is 22&deg;C. The <a href="../../wp/r/Rain.htm" title="Rainfall">rainfall</a> over the Red Sea and its coasts is extremely low averaging 0.06 m per year; the rain is mostly in the form of showers of short spells often associated with thunderstorms and occasionally with dust <!--del_lnk--> storms. The scarcity of rainfall and no major source of fresh water to the Red Sea result in the excess evaporation as high as 205 cm per yr and high salinity with minimal seasonal variation.<p><b>Salinity:</b> The Red Sea is regarded as one of the most saline water bodies in the world that is governed by the effects of the water circulation pattern, resulting from evaporation and wind stress in the Red Sea. Salinity ranges between 36 and 38 &permil;.<p><b>Tidal range:</b> In general tide ranges between 0.6 m in the north, near the mouth of the Gulf of Suez and 0.9 m in the south near the Gulf of Aden but it fluctuates between 0.20 and 0.30 m away from the nodal point. The central Red Sea (Jeddah area) is therefore almost tideless, and as such the annual water level changes are more significant. Because of the small tidal range the water during high tide inundates the coastal sabkhas as a thin sheet of water up to a few hundred meters rather than inundating the sabkhas through a network of channels. However, south of Jeddah in the Shoiaba area the water from the lagoon may cover the adjoining sabkhas as far as 3 km whereas, north of Jeddah in the Al-kharrar area the sabkhas are covered by a thin sheet of water as far as 2 km. The prevailing north and northeastern winds influence the movement of water in the coastal inlets to the adjacent sabkhas, especially during storms. Winter mean sea level is 0.5 m higher than in summer. Tidal velocities passing through constrictions caused by reefs, sand bars and low islands commonly exceed 1-2 m per sec.<p><b>Current:</b> In the Red Sea detailed current data is lacking, partially because they are weak and variable both spatially and temporally. Temporal and spatial currents variation is as low as 0.5 m and are governed mostly by wind. In summer NW winds drive surface water south for about four months at a velocity of 15-20 cm per sec., whereas in winter the flow is reversed resulting in the inflow of water from the Gulf of Aden into the Red Sea. The net value of the latter predominates, resulting in an overall drift to the northern end of the Red Sea. Generally the velocity of the tidal current is between 50-60 cm per sec with a maximum of 1 m per sec. at the mouth of the al-Kharrar Lagoon. However, the range of north-northeast current along the Saudi coast is 8-29 cm per sec.<p><b>Wind Regime:</b> With the exception of the northern part of the Red Sea, which is dominated by persistent north-west <!--del_lnk--> winds, with speeds ranging between 7 and 12 km per hr., the rest of the Red Sea and the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf of Aden are subjected to the influence of regular and seasonally reversible winds. The wind <!--del_lnk--> regime is characterized by both seasonal and regional variations in <!--del_lnk--> speed and <!--del_lnk--> direction with average speed generally increasing northward.<p>Wind is the driving force in the Red Sea for transporting the material either as suspension or as bedload. Wind induced currents play an important role in the Red Sea in initiating the process of resuspension of bottom sediments and transfer of materials from sites of dumping to sites of burial in quiescent environment of deposition. Wind generated current <a href="../../wp/m/Measurement.htm" title="Measurement">measurement</a> is therefore important in order to determine the sediment dispersal pattern and its role in the erosion and accretion of the coastal rock exposure and the submerged coral beds.<p><a id="Geology" name="Geology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geology</span></h2>

      <p>The Red Sea formed by <!--del_lnk--> Arabia splitting from <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a> due to <!--del_lnk--> continental drift. This split started in the <a href="../../wp/e/Eocene.htm" title="Eocene">Eocene</a> and accelerated during the <a href="../../wp/o/Oligocene.htm" title="Oligocene">Oligocene</a>. The sea is still widening and it is considered that the sea will become an ocean in time (as proposed in the model of <!--del_lnk--> Tuzo Wilson).<p>Sometimes during the <!--del_lnk--> Tertiary period the <!--del_lnk--> Bab el Mandeb closed and the Red Sea evaporated to an empty hot dry salt-floored sink. Effects causing this would be:-<ul>
       <li>A &quot;race&quot; between the Red Sea widening and <!--del_lnk--> Perim Island <a href="../../wp/v/Volcano.htm" title="Volcano">erupting</a> filling the Bab el Mandeb with <!--del_lnk--> lava.<li>The lowering of world <!--del_lnk--> sea level during the <!--del_lnk--> Ice Ages due to much water being locked up in the <!--del_lnk--> ice caps.</ul>
      <p>Today surface water temperatures remain relatively constant at 70&ndash;77 <!--del_lnk--> &deg;F (21&ndash;25 <!--del_lnk--> &deg;C) and temperature and visibility remain good to around 660 feet (200 m), but the sea is known for its strong winds and tricky local currents.<p>In terms of salinity, the Red Sea is greater than the world average, approximately 4 percent. This is due to several factors: 1) high rate of evaporation and very little precipitation, 2) a lack of significant rivers or streams draining into the sea, and 3) limited connection with the Indian Ocean (and its lower water salinity).<p><a id="Living_Resources" name="Living_Resources"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Desalination Plants</span></h2>
      <p>The Red Sea water is an essential asset. There is extensive demand of desalinated water to meet the requirement of the population and the industries along the Red Sea.<p>There are at least 18 desalination plants along the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia which discharge warm brine and treatment chemicals(chlorine and anti-scalants) that may cause bleaching and mortality of corals and diseases to the fish stocks. Although this is only a localized phenomenon, it may intensify with time and have a profound impact on the fishing industry.<p>The water from the Red Sea is also utilized by oil refineries and cement factories for cooling purposes. Used water drained back into the coastal zones may cause harm to the nearshore environment of the Red Sea.<p><a id="Facts_and_Figures_at_a_Glance" name="Facts_and_Figures_at_a_Glance"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Facts and Figures at a Glance</span></h2>
