<h2>Seeing Beyond Violence: Main report text</h2>
<p>Seeing beyond Violence<br />Children as Researchers<br />Introduction<br />1<br />1 Introduction </p><p>Our endeavour to learn with and from children on a global issue </p><p>Imagine.<br />A world abundant with tolerance and appreciation,<br />full of curiosity and the endeavour to understand the other.<br />Imagine respect towards nature, culture, gender, the elders and the young ones.<br />Imagine, a world where children can grow up in stable, supporting, caring environments.<br />Imagine, a world in which children are heard and listened to.<br />Imagine! </p><p>Recently a yellow press tabloid had a cover story on children and domestic violence. Pic-<br />tures of children, ranging from eight to maybe thirteen, their gruesome stories, all now<br />separated from their parents, living in foster homes or small group residential care. Stories<br />of abuse, neglect, maltreatment. Even the photo of a blood sodden T-shirt next to a tiny<br />girl, having been almost killed by her father, and detailed descriptions of human perver-<br />sity. Tabloid language and photos picturing emotionally and physically scarred children<br />longing in vain for a normal life.<br />The story leaves me puzzled. Does it really raise the issues of domestic violence? Was it<br />geared towards depicting youth welfare authorities as too slow in acting? Was it to press<br />on the readers' emotions so they would donate money for a shelter? Or was it using the<br />children's stories purely for higher circulation? (Only the latter would account for the<br />blood sodden T-shirt next to a girl's face, printed in colour). Or was it even a story about<br />human abnormalities, veiled in phoney compassion?<br />Violence comes in many forms. We are all of us quick to seize on the big issues - sexual<br />abuse, child trafficking, child labour, child pornography, hunger, physical violence, child<br />soldiers, hunger and children as refugees. But printing a picture of a blood sodden T-shirt<br />next to small children's faces might be a further, if more subtle form of abuse. What are<br />the consequences of such an act? For the reader, for the editor or for the girl and her fam-<br />ily? We are most of us aware that the landscape of violence is changing and that there are<br />new questions that need to be asked. Whether we consider something as violence or vio-<br />lent depends on a variety of factors that are themselves conceptually fluid, even problem-<br />atic, and which invoke gender, culture, education and age.<br />And usually we unite in the longing for non violence. But while we can perhaps imagine<br />lives free from physical violence, it is less easy to imagine a world free from institutional<br />or symbolic violence. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Introduction<br />2<br />What is it really that we long for if we aspire to &quot;no violence&quot;? Would it mean freedom?<br />Security? Gender equality? Emotional stability? Happiness and Peace? A family environ-<br />ment for growing up? Food and education for all? Sufficient living conditions and income<br />for families rearing children? State support? No physical punishment, no female circumci-<br />sion? No ante-natal sex screening for sex selection and abortion of the unwanted sex?<br />Respect and appreciation of diversity concerning minorities, handicaps, special challenges?<br />No more skeletons walking on catwalks and depicting the western illusion of female bod-<br />ies into a Potemkin's glamour show of eating disorder and plastic surgery? The right to<br />wear the headscarf? An end to the paradigm of economic growth with simultaneous pau-<br />perisation of millions? Sustainable development? Affordable medication for all? Clean<br />drinking water? No more war movies? A cut down in divorce rate? Life sentence for rape<br />or murder? Protection, prevention and participation according to the Child Rights Char-<br />ter? Enough money in the annual state budgets for education, welfare and health and less<br />for rearmament? No more pictures and cover stories of one country bombing another live<br />on TV? Demilitarisation? The right of a child to divorce his family? Tolerance? Religious<br />freedom?<br />It is easier, it seems, to define what we do not want than what we want. And being against<br />something easily unites us across our many differences, whereas taking a stand for some-<br />thing specific forces individuals to choose and take a stand - to step beyond anonymity.<br />As the notion of violence is also a social and gender issue, whatever the idea of &quot;violence&quot;<br />and &quot;non violence&quot; is will be influenced by social construction in any given cultural set-<br />ting.<br />When the UN announced a study on Violence against Children, NGOs like SOS Chil-<br />dren's Village were asked to participate. We responded because the issue of violence<br />against children is daily fact in the worldwide work of SOS Children's Village.<br />Children admitted to SOS Children's Villages come with an array of experiences of vio-<br />lence. The files and records are full of stories of abuse, neglect, poverty, hunger, physical<br />and emotional violence, war stories, trauma, personal tragedies of individuals and families.<br />The life stories of children and families participating in the SOS-Social Centres pro-<br />grammes multiply these findings.<br />As a global organisation it would have been possible for us to take the numerous stories<br />held in our files and to catalogue and categorize the various levels and intensity of reports<br />of violence against children. We could report on the number of children who have been<br />sexually assaulted. We would state numbers of children who almost have been starved<br />close to death, the numbers who were found on the street, we could state the amount of<br />crack babies, the amount of abandoned children, the amount of children whose parents<br />are alcoholics, on the dole, in jail, disinterested in their well being.<br />Such would be a bookkeeping exercise that would add to the analysis and categorisation of<br />violence. Whether it would help us understand the many forms of violence to be found in<br />our societies is less certain. Families who have abandoned babies are not easily interviewed<br />about their reasons and neither are families killed in civil war or by famine able to state<br /><a href="../../wp/r/Report_3.htm">next page</a></p>
