The river is 5464 km long . Originating in the Bayankala Mountains in <!--del_lnk--> Qinghai <!--del_lnk--> Province in western China, the Yellow river flows through nine provinces of China and empties into the <!--del_lnk--> Bohai Sea.

      <p>In the early history, the Yellow River is referred to in Chinese literatures simply as <i>He</i> (&#x6CB3;), or &quot;River&quot;. The first appearance of the name &quot;Yellow River&quot; (&#x9EC4;&#x6CB3;) is in the <!--del_lnk--> Book of Han (&#x6C49;&#x4E66;) written in the <!--del_lnk--> Western Han dynasty (206 BC&ndash;AD 9). The name &quot;Yellow River&quot; describes the perennial ochre-yellow colour of the muddy water in the lower course of the river. An alternative poetic name of the river referring to this is the <i>Muddy Flow</i> (<a href="../../wp/c/Chinese_language.htm" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a>: <span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x6FC1;&#x6D41;</span>; <!--del_lnk--> pinyin: Zhuo Liu). The <!--del_lnk--> Chinese expression &quot;when the Yellow River flows clear&quot; is similar to the <!--del_lnk--> English expression &quot;when hell freezes over&quot;.<p><a id="History_and_Culture" name="History_and_Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History and Culture</span></h2>

      <p>The Yellow River has special importance in the origins of the Chinese civilization. It is referred to as &quot;the Mother River&quot; and &quot;the Cradle of the Chinese civilization&quot; by Chinese. Traditionally, it is believed that the Chinese civilization originated from the Yellow River basin areas.<p>During the long <!--del_lnk--> history of China, the Yellow River has been considered a blessing as well as a curse and has been <!--del_lnk--> nicknamed both &quot;China&#39;s Pride&quot; (<i>Zh&#x14D;nggu&oacute; de Ji&#x101;o&agrave;o</i>) and &quot;China&#39;s Sorrow&quot; (<i>Zh&#x14D;nggu&oacute; de T&ograve;ng</i>). Records indicate that, from <!--del_lnk--> 602 BC to present, the river&#39;s course made at least 5 major large-scale changes in direction and its levees were breached more than 1,500 times. A major course change that took place in 1194 took over the <!--del_lnk--> Huai River drainage system throughout the next 700 years. The mud in the Yellow River literally blocked the mouth of the Huai River and left thousands homeless. The Yellow River adopted its present course in 1897 after the final course change occurred in 1855. Currently, the Yellow River flows through <!--del_lnk--> Jinan, capital of the <!--del_lnk--> Shandong province and ends in the <!--del_lnk--> Bohai Sea.<p>The river gets its yellow colour mostly from the fine-grained calcareous <!--del_lnk--> silts originated from the <!--del_lnk--> Loess Plateau which are carried in the flow. Centuries of silt deposition and <!--del_lnk--> diking has caused the river to flow above the surrounding farmland, making flooding a critically dangerous problem. Flooding of the Yellow River has caused some of the highest <!--del_lnk--> death tolls in world history, with the <!--del_lnk--> 1887 Huang He flood killing 900,000-2,000,000 and the <!--del_lnk--> 1931 Huang He flood killing 1,000,000-3,700,000. In 1938, during the <!--del_lnk--> Second Sino-Japanese War, the <!--del_lnk--> Nationalist troops under <!--del_lnk--> Chiang Kai-Shek broke the levees holding back the Yellow River in order to stop the advancing <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japanese</a> troops. The river at that time flooded a huge area and the floodwaters took some 500,000-900,000 lives.<p>Another historic source of devastating floods was the collapse of upstream <!--del_lnk--> ice dams in <!--del_lnk--> Inner Mongolia with their accompanying sudden release of vast quantities of impounded water. There have been 11 such major floods in the past century, each causing tremendous loss of life and property. Nowadays, explosives dropped from aircraft are used to break the ice dams before they become dangerous.<p>Sometimes the Yellow River is poetically called the <i>Zhuo Liu</i> (<span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x6FC1;&#x6D41;</span>), or the &quot;Muddy Flow.&quot; The <!--del_lnk--> Chinese expression &quot;when the Yellow River flows clear&quot; is similar to the <!--del_lnk--> English expression &quot;when hell freezes over.&quot;<p>Some of the known flood defenses used in ancient times were the building of ditches, walls (dams), <!--del_lnk--> levees, and rebound channels to route floodwaters around a blockage. The main problem was that the solutions were local and sometimes the dams were too small and weak for the impact. If the river broke down the defenses, it would cause far more damage than if no levees had been built.<p><a id="Characteristics_of_the_Yellow_River" name="Characteristics_of_the_Yellow_River"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Characteristics of the Yellow River</span></h2>
      <p>The Yellow River is notable for the amount of <!--del_lnk--> silt it carries, amounting to 1.6 billion tons annually at the point where it descends from the <!--del_lnk--> Loess Plateau. If the river is running to the sea with sufficient volume, 1.4 billion tons are carried to the sea. In modern times, since 1972 when it first went dry, the river has gone dry in its lower reaches, from <!--del_lnk--> Jinan to the sea, in most years, in 1997 for 226 days. The low volume of the river is due to increased demands on the river for use in <a href="../../wp/i/Irrigation.htm" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a> which has increased by a factor of five since 1950. Water diverted from the river by 1999 served 140 million people and irrigated 74000 km&sup2; of land. Highest volume occurs during the rainy season, from July to October, when 60% of the volume of the river flows. Water for irrigation, on the other hand, is needed between March and June. In order to capture excess water for use when needed and for flood control and electricity generation several dams have been built, but due to the high silt load their life is expected to be limited. A proposed <!--del_lnk--> South-North Water Transfer Project involves several schemes to divert water from the <a href="../../wp/y/Yangtze_River.htm" title="Yangtze River">Yangtze River</a>, one in the western headwaters of the rivers where they are closest to one another, another from the upper reaches of the <!--del_lnk--> Han River, and a third using the route of the <a href="../../wp/g/Grand_Canal_of_China.htm" title="Grand Canal of China">Grand Canal</a>.<p>Due to its heavy load of silt the Yellow River is a <!--del_lnk--> depositing stream, that is, it deposits part of its carried burden of soil in its bed in stretches where it is flowing slowly. These deposits elevate the riverbed which flows between <!--del_lnk--> natural levees in its lower reaches. Should a flood occur the river may break out of the levees into the surrounding lower flood plain and adopt a new course. Historically this has occurred about once every hundred years. In modern times considerable effort has been made to strengthen levees and control floods.<p>The Yellow River Delta totals 8,000 square kilometers. However, since 1996 it has been reported to be shrinking slightly each year, through erosion.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>
      <p>From its sources, Gyaring Lake and Ngoring Lake, high in the Bayankala Mountains in <!--del_lnk--> Qinghai Province in the far west of China, the Yellow River loops north, bends south, creating the &quot;Great Bend&quot;, and then flows generally eastwards across northern China to the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf of Bohai, draining a <!--del_lnk--> basin of 752443 km&sup2;, which nourishes 120 million people.<p>The river is commonly divided into three stages. However, different scholars have different opinions in how the three stages are divided. This article adopts the division by the Yellow River Hydrology Committee.<p><a id="Upper_reaches" name="Upper_reaches"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Upper reaches</span></h3>

      <p>The upper reaches of the Yellow River is a segment starting from the source in the Bayankala Mountains and ending at Hekou County of <!--del_lnk--> Inner Mongolia just before turning sharply to the south. This segment has a total length of 3472 km and total basin area of 386,000 km&sup2; (51.3% of total basin area). Along this length, the elevation of the Yellow River drops 3496 metres, with an average drop of 1%.<p>The upper reaches can be further divided into three sections: the source, valley, and <!--del_lnk--> alluvial plain section. The source section flows mainly through pastures, swamps, and knolls between the <!--del_lnk--> Bayankala Mountains and <!--del_lnk--> Anemaqen Mountains. The river water is clear and flows steadily. Crystal clear lakes and sluggish meandering are characteristic in this section. The two main lakes along this section are Lake Zhaling (&#x624E;&#x9675;&#x6E56;) and Lake Eling (&#x9102;&#x9675;&#x6E56;), having capacities of 4.7 billion and 10.8 billion m&sup3;, respectively. At elevations over 4260 m above sea level, they are the largest two plateau fresh water lakes in China.<p>The valley section stretches from Longyang Gorge in <!--del_lnk--> Qinghai to Qingtong Gorge in <!--del_lnk--> Gansu. Steep cliffs line both sides of the Yellow River. As the water bed is narrow and the average drop is large, the water flow in this section is extremely turbulent and fast. There are 20 gorges in this section, the more famous of these being the Longyang, Jishi, Liujia, Bapan, and Qingtong Gorges. The flow conditions in this section makes it the best location to build <!--del_lnk--> hydroelectric plants.<p>After emerging from the Qingtong Gorge, the Yellow River comes into a section of vast alluvial plains, the Yinchuan Plain and Hetao Plain. In this section, the regions along the river are mostly <!--del_lnk--> deserts and <!--del_lnk--> grasslands, with very few tributaries. The flow is slow and on both sides of the river. The Hetao Plain has a length of 900 km and width of 30 to 50 km. It is historically the most important irrigation plain along the Yellow River.<p><a id="Middle_reaches" name="Middle_reaches"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Middle reaches</span></h3>

      <p>The part of Yellow River between Hekou County in <!--del_lnk--> Inner Mongolia and <!--del_lnk--> Zhengzhou in <!--del_lnk--> Henan constitutes the middle reaches of the river. The middle reaches has a length of 1206 km long and basin area of 344,000 km&sup2; (45.7% of total), with a total elevation drop of 890 meters, and average drop of 0.074%. There are 30 large tributaries along the middle reaches, and the water flow is increased by 43.5% on this stage of the river. The middle reaches is the main source of the Yellow River silts, contributing 92% of the total silts.<p>From Hekou County to Yumenkou, the Yellow River passes through the longest series of continuous valleys on its main course, known collectively as the Jinshan Valley. The abundant hydrodynamic resources stored in this section makes it the second most suitable area to build hydroelectric power plants. The famous Hukou Waterfall is in the lower part of this valley.<p><a id="Lower_reaches" name="Lower_reaches"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Lower reaches</span></h3>
      <p>In the lower reaches, from Zhengzhou to the sea, a distance of 786 km, the river is confined to a <!--del_lnk--> levee-lined course as it flows to the northeast across the <!--del_lnk--> North China Plain before emptying into the <!--del_lnk--> Bohai Sea. The basin area in this stage is only 23,000 km&sup2; (3% of total). The total drop in elevation of the lower reaches is 93.6 meters, with an average drop of 0.012%.<p>The silts received from the middle reaches form sediments in this stage, elevating the river bed. During two thousand years of levee construction, excessive sediment deposits have raised the riverbed several meters above the surrounding grounds. The levee-confined Yellow River receives flows from few tributaries in this stage. Nearly all rivers to the south of Yellow River drain into the <!--del_lnk--> Huai River, whereas those to the north of it drain into the <!--del_lnk--> Hai River.<p><a id="Tributaries_of_the_Yellow_River" name="Tributaries_of_the_Yellow_River"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Tributaries of the Yellow River</span></h2>
