      <p>[[Category:1928 establishments|]][[Category:Suburbs of Canberra|]]<p><b>Yarralumla</b> is a large suburb in the inner south of <a href="../../wp/c/Canberra.htm" title="Canberra">Canberra</a>, the capital city of <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>. Located approximately 3.5 <!--del_lnk--> kilometres south-west of the <!--del_lnk--> city centre, Yarralumla extends for much of the southern bank of <a href="../../wp/l/Lake_Burley_Griffin.htm" title="Lake Burley Griffin">Lake Burley Griffin</a>.<p>Europeans first settled in the area in 1828. It was officially named <i>Yarralumla</i> after the local <!--del_lnk--> Ngunnawal <!--del_lnk--> Indigenous Australian name for the area in 1834. Fredrick Campbell built a large homestead on his property in 1891 that now serves as <!--del_lnk--> Government House, the official residence of the <!--del_lnk--> Governor-General of <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>. The suburb was officially <!--del_lnk--> gazetted in 1928 and today is home to approximately 3000 people and many <!--del_lnk--> diplomatic missions. In recent years, it has become one of Canberra&#39;s most desirable and expensive suburbs because of its leafy streets, attractive lakeside setting and central location.<p>

      <p>Yarralumla is located in the central Canberra district of <!--del_lnk--> South Canberra. It is bordered by Lake Burley Griffin to the north, <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth Avenue and <!--del_lnk--> Capital Hill to the east, Adelaide Avenue and the Cotter Road to the south, and Scrivener Dam and part of the <!--del_lnk--> Molonglo River to the west.<p>Although Yarralumla is one of the largest suburbs in Canberra by area, its population remains quite small because more than half of its area consists of open space or non-residential developments. Yarralumla&#39;s open areas, Weston and Stirling Parks, the Royal Canberra Golf Club, the grounds of Government House and its proximity to the City and Lake Burley Griffin, are the main reasons for its growing popularity.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The embassy area of Yarralumla is located towards the eastern end of the suburb next to Stirling Park. It is the hilliest area of Yarralumla and was one of the most recent parts to be developed; <!--del_lnk--> Parliament House and the <!--del_lnk--> Parliamentary Triangle are located nearby.<p>The streets in Yarralumla are named after Australian <!--del_lnk--> governors and botanists.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_actplatheme"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Most of the older streets in the suburb are laid out on a rectangular grid, while the more hilly eastern end of the suburb, including the embassy area, is set out with organic contour-guided roads. Major roads in Yarralumla include Banks Street, Novar Street and Hopetoun Circuit in a north-south direction and Schlich Street, Loftus Street and Weston Street running east-west. Being a <!--del_lnk--> dormitory suburb there are no major through roads. Access to the rest of the city can be made from Adelaide Avenue, <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth Avenue, Lady Denman Drive and the Cotter Road, all of which run along the borders of the suburb.<p>Yarralumla is located on the <i>Yarralumla Formation</i> which is a <!--del_lnk--> mudstone/<!--del_lnk--> siltstone formation that was formed around 425 <!--del_lnk--> million years ago during the <!--del_lnk--> Silurian Period. The formation extends from <!--del_lnk--> Red Hill and <!--del_lnk--> Woden in the South to Lake Burley Griffin in to the north, passing under the suburb of Yarralumla. The formation is evidence of the last major marine sedimentary period when eastern Australia was still covered by shallow seas. It shows fossil evidence of <!--del_lnk--> trilobites, <!--del_lnk--> coral and primitive <!--del_lnk--> crinoids. The Yarralumla brickworks quarry and the <!--del_lnk--> Deakin anticline are places where the formation is exposed and easily studied.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_eactbw"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>The area now called Yarralumla is part of two original land grants, which were granted to free settlers for the establishment of farms. In 1828 Henry Donnison was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge, while a second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe, who had bought the land from John Stephen, on <!--del_lnk--> 7 March <!--del_lnk--> 1839. Donnison&#39;s land was officially named <i>Yarralumla</i> in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. <i>Yarralumla</i> was a name for the area used by the local <!--del_lnk--> Ngunnawal people, apparently meaning &quot;echo&quot;. Fredrick Campbell, a descendant of <!--del_lnk--> Robert Campbell, bought the property in 1881 and built a new three-storey house that would later form the basis of what is now the Governor General&#39;s residence <i>Government House</i>. Campbell also built a large woolshed nearby in 1904 that remains standing to this day.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_govhouse"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p>In 1908, the Limestone Plains area, including <i>Yarralumla</i>, was selected as the site for the capital city of the newly-established Commonwealth of Australia. Soon afterwards in 1913, the <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth Government purchased both properties. Tenant farmers were allowed to stay on the land on annual leases, some remaining until 1963 when the Molonglo River was dammed to form Lake Burley Griffin.<p><a id="Development" name="Development"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Development</span></h3>
      <p>With the construction of Australia&#39;s capital city underway, the <!--del_lnk--> Yarralumla brickworks were established in 1913 to supply building material. The bricks were used for many of Canberra&#39;s buildings, including the <!--del_lnk--> provisional Parliament House. In 1917 Walter Burley Griffin named the area surrounding the brickworks &quot;Westridge&quot;.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_1928roll"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> A <!--del_lnk--> Narrow gauge goods <!--del_lnk--> railway line was constructed for the transportation of bricks to some of the major building sites in central Canberra. This linked the brickworks to places like Parliament House, and the <!--del_lnk--> Kingston Power House.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_actplabwpr"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Construction on the Commonwealth nursery and <i>Westbourne Woods</i> <!--del_lnk--> arboretum was started in 1914, and a temporary camp was built near the brickworks to accommodate the workers. <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Charles Weston was Officer-in-Charge (Afforestation Branch) in the years 1913 to 1926, and later became Director of City Planting and the Superintendent of Parks and Gardens. Weston was responsible for testing and selecting plant species at the arboretum for their suitability to Canberra&#39;s environment; from 1913 through to 1924 Weston oversaw the propagation of more than two million trees which were then planted in the Canberra area.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_ncagreening"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Most of the original <i>Westbourne Woods</i> arboretum is now leased to the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Canberra Golf Club, with the remainder forming part of <!--del_lnk--> Weston Park. The Yarralumla nursery is still active, albeit on a smaller scale and functioning as a retail nursery selling both wholesale and direct to the public.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_ntyarranurs"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p>In 1922 A workers&#39; tent camp was erected in the area on the eastern side of Stirling Ridge to house the men working on the main intercepting sewer. The following year saw the start of the construction of 62 small, four-room, unlined timber cottages, to be used as housing for the married tradesmen involved in the construction of the provisional Parliament House. Other camps were established at the eastern end of Stirling Park on the hills opposite modern Lotus Bay. The first of these was contractor John Howie&#39;s settlement (1922&ndash;30), consisting of 25 timber cottages for his married men and timber barracks (Hostel Camp) for his single men. Two other single mens&#39; tent camps were established nearby &ndash; Old Tradesmen&#39;s Camp (1923&ndash;27) and No 1 Labourers Camp (1924&ndash;27). The men from Howie&#39;s worked on the <!--del_lnk--> Hotel Canberra and the others on the construction of the provisional Parliament House and nearby administrative buildings.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_westlake"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The Stirling Park camps were known as &quot;Westlake&quot; to their new inhabitants, and previously &quot;Gura Bung Dhaura&quot; (stony ground) to the local <!--del_lnk--> Aboriginal people.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_ngunnawalbib"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> In 1925, the population of this temporary suburb was 700. This represented roughly one-fifth of the total population of the Federal Capital Territory at the time; in the region, only Molonglo Settlement had a larger population, at 750. The site was chosen so that it was near to Parliament House but hidden from direct line of sight from anywhere &quot;important&quot;. The small cottages at Westlake were removed starting in the mid-1950s, with the last one removed in 1965. Many of the Westlake workers&#39; cottages were moved to <!--del_lnk--> Queanbeyan and are still used as housing today. The Stirling Park near the embassy area of Yarralumla now covers the historic Westlake settlement area. Some evidence of these former dwellings still remains today, and signage has been erected to commemorate these pioneering people of early Canberra.<p>The Commonwealth Forestry School was established in Westridge near the brickworks and <i>Westbourne Woods</i> in 1926. It opened with its first intake of students in the following year. Today the heritage-listed Forestry School and the associated principal&#39;s residence <i>Westridge House</i> are located on Banks Street, Yarralumla. <!--del_lnk--> CSIRO Forestry and Forestry Products subsumed the school in 1975.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_csiroffp"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> <i>Westridge House</i>, an impressive <!--del_lnk--> tudor-style structure, recently underwent a $500,000 refurbishment and is presently in use as a residence for the chief officer of the CSIRO.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_hansardcsiro"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p>By 1928 there were over 130 people on the electoral roll for Westridge. The majority of the population consisted of men working at the brickworks and nursery. Westridge was officially gazetted as a Canberra suburb in 1928. Its residential area was situated adjacent to the proposed site for Lake Burley Griffin, close to Westbourne Woods and the 53-<!--del_lnk--> hectare grounds of the Governor-General&#39;s residence.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Westridge was officially renamed to Yarralumla in the 1950s. In 1963 Lake Burley Griffin was filled and Yarralumla was expanded to include Westlake, which had up until then been officially part of <!--del_lnk--> Acton.<p>After <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the suburb began to expand rapidly with the construction of many private homes. Yarralumla&#39;s image as a &quot;lower-class&quot; suburb would persist into the 1960s and 1970s. This general perception began to alter once Lake Burley Griffin had been created and its surrounds landscaped into parklands; the area soon gained a reputation for its attractive lakeside location.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_ppybay"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> During the 1980s house prices began to rise co-incident with a rejuvenation of the suburb. Large numbers of the original government-built <!--del_lnk--> monocrete, brick and weatherboard houses have now been demolished and replaced by larger dwellings of a variety of more modern styles and materials. The suburb is generally regarded as one of the more desirable in Canberra.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>Yarralumla is notable among Canberra suburbs for its large number of landmarks and places of historical interest. The <!--del_lnk--> Governor-General&#39;s residence <!--del_lnk--> Government House, which shares the name <i>Yarralumla</i>, is located at the western end of the suburb in 53 <!--del_lnk--> hectares of parkland. It sits alongside Lake Burley Griffin, next to the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Canberra Golf Club and Scrivener Dam. The house was built in 1891 as the homestead for the <i>Yarralumla</i> property. The nearby Yarralumla Woolshed is available for event hire, often playing host to parties and bush dances. The land surrounding the woolshed has been developed as an equestrian park, including areas for <!--del_lnk--> showjumping, <!--del_lnk--> eventing and <!--del_lnk--> endurance riding.<p>The Yarralumla brickworks are notable as the first industrial manufacturing facility in the ACT. The brickworks were closed temporarily several times due to the <!--del_lnk--> Great Depression and both <!--del_lnk--> World Wars. They closed permanently in 1976 after plans for major modernisation upgrades were not proceeded with. Presently the site is closed to the public and is in a state of disrepair. The unfenced parkland around the brickworks is a popular recreation area for Yarralumla residents. Future plans for the site have not yet been decided.<div class="thumb tleft">
