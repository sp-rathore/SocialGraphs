      <p>Yuri Gagarin was born in <!--del_lnk--> Klushino near <!--del_lnk--> Gzhatsk, a region west of <a href="../../wp/m/Moscow.htm" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>, <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>, on March 9, <!--del_lnk--> 1934. The town would be renamed <!--del_lnk--> Gagarin in <!--del_lnk--> 1968 to honour Yuri. His parents worked on a collective farm. While <i>manual labourers</i> are described in official reports as &quot;peasants,&quot; this may be an oversimplification if applied to his parents - his mother was reportedly a voracious reader, and his father a skilled <!--del_lnk--> carpenter. Yuri was the third of four children, and his elder sister helped raise him while his parents worked. Like millions of people in the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, the Gagarin family suffered great hardship in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. His two elder siblings were &quot;taken away&quot; to <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>, apparently as conscripts, in <!--del_lnk--> 1943, and did not return until after the war. His teachers described Gagarin as intelligent and hard-working, if occasionally mischievous. His mathematics teacher flew in the <!--del_lnk--> Red Army <!--del_lnk--> Air Force during the war, which presumably made some substantial impression on young Gagarin.<p>After starting an apprenticeship in a metalworks as a foundryman, Gagarin was selected for further training at a high technical school in <!--del_lnk--> Saratov. While there, he joined the &quot;AeroClub,&quot; and learned to fly a light aircraft, a hobby that would take up an increasing proportion of his time. Through dint of effort, rather than brilliance, he reportedly mastered both; in <!--del_lnk--> 1955, after completing his technical schooling, he entered military flight training at the <!--del_lnk--> Orenburg Pilot&#39;s School. While there he met <!--del_lnk--> Valentina Goryacheva, whom he married in <!--del_lnk--> 1957, after gaining his pilot&#39;s wings in a <!--del_lnk--> MiG-15. Post-graduation, he was assigned to an airbase in the <!--del_lnk--> Murmansk region, near the <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norwegian border</a>, where terrible weather made flying risky. As a full-grown man, Gagarin was 5 feet 2 inches (approx. 157.5cm) tall.<p>
       <br />
      <p><a id="Career_in_Soviet_space_program" name="Career_in_Soviet_space_program"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Career in Soviet space program</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Selection_and_training" name="Selection_and_training"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Selection and training</span></h3>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1960, an extensive search and selection process saw Yuri Gagarin, as one of 20 cosmonauts, selected for the <!--del_lnk--> Soviet space program. Along with the other prospective cosmonauts, he had been subjected to a punishing series of experiments designed to test his physical and psychological endurance, as well as training related to the upcoming flight. Out of the 20 selected, the eventual choices for the first launch were Gagarin and <!--del_lnk--> Gherman Titov, because of their excellent performance in training, as well as their physical characteristics - space was at a premium in the small <!--del_lnk--> Vostok cockpit. Gagarin&#39;s last-minute assignment, approved at the highest levels of the <!--del_lnk--> CPSU, to take the historic flight, may have been due to Gagarin&#39;s modest upbringing and genial, outgoing personality, as opposed to the middle-class and somewhat aloof demeanor of Titov. Soviet officials weighed other factors as well in selecting Yuri: his appearance, his capacity to handle media attention, his Russian heritage and even the name &quot;Gagarin&quot; which was also a family name associated with Tsarist aristocracy.<p><a id="Space_flight" name="Space_flight"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Space flight</span></h3>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> April 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1961, Gagarin became the first human to travel into <!--del_lnk--> space in <i>Vostok 3KA-2</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Vostok 1). His call sign in this flight was <!--del_lnk--> Cedar (<a href="../../wp/r/Russian_language.htm" title="Russian language">Russian</a>: &#x41A;&#x435;&#x434;&#x440;). According to international media, from orbit Gagarin made the comment, &quot;I don&#39;t see any God up here.&quot; There are, however, no such words in the full verbatim record of Gagarin&#39;s conversations with the Earth during the spaceflight .<p>He is also known in Russian history as <i><b>&quot;The Columbus of the Cosmos.&quot;</b></i><p>While in orbit Gagarin was promoted &quot;in the field&quot; from the lowly rank of Senior <!--del_lnk--> Lieutenant to <!--del_lnk--> Major - and this was the rank at which <!--del_lnk--> TASS announced him in its triumphant statement during the flight. At the time the Soviet authorities thought it was more likely he would perish during his descent than survive.<p>During his flight, Gagarin famously whistled the tune <i><b>&quot;The Motherland Hears, The Motherland Knows&quot;</b></i> (<a href="../../wp/r/Russian_language.htm" title="Russian language">Russian</a>: &quot;&#x420;&#x43E;&#x434;&#x438;&#x43D;&#x430; &#x441;&#x43B;&#x44B;&#x448;&#x438;&#x442;, &#x420;&#x43E;&#x434;&#x438;&#x43D;&#x430; &#x437;&#x43D;&#x430;&#x435;&#x442;&quot;). The first two lines of the song are: <i><b>&quot;The Motherland hears, the Motherland knows/Where her son flies in the sky&quot;</b></i>. This patriotic song was written by <!--del_lnk--> Dmitri Shostakovich in 1951 (opus 86), with words by Dolmatovsky.<p>Safely returned, <!--del_lnk--> Nikita Khrushchev rushed to his side and Gagarin issued a statement praising the <!--del_lnk--> Communist Party of the Soviet Union as the &quot;organiser of all our victories.&quot; Khrushchev saw Gagarin&#39;s achievement as a vindication of his policy of strengthening the Soviet Union&#39;s missile forces at the expense of conventional arms. This policy antagonized the Soviet military establishment and contributed to Khrushchev&#39;s eventual downfall.<p>After the flight, Gagarin became an instant, worldwide celebrity, touring widely with appearances in Italy, Germany, Canada, and Japan to promote the Soviet achievement.<p>From 1962 he served as a deputy to the <!--del_lnk--> Supreme Soviet, but later returned to &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Star City&quot;, the cosmonaut facility, where he worked on designs for a reusable spacecraft.<p><a id="Death_and_legacy" name="Death_and_legacy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Death and legacy</span></h2>

      <p>Gagarin then became deputy training director of <!--del_lnk--> Star City. At the same time, he began to requalify as a fighter pilot. On <!--del_lnk--> March 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1968 he and his instructor died in a <!--del_lnk--> MiG-15UTI on a routine training flight near <!--del_lnk--> Kirzhach. It is uncertain what caused the crash, but a <!--del_lnk--> 1986 inquest suggests that the turbulence from a <!--del_lnk--> Su-11 interceptor airplane using its <!--del_lnk--> afterburners may have caused Gagarin&#39;s plane to go out of control. Weather conditions were also poor, which probably contributed to the inability of Gagarin and the instructor to correct before they crashed.<p>In his book &quot;Two Sides of the Moon&quot; <!--del_lnk--> Alexei Leonov recounts that he was flying a helicopter in the same area on that day when he heard &quot;two loud booms in the distance&quot;. Corroborating the above hypothesis, his conclusion is that a Sukhoi jet (which he identifies as a <!--del_lnk--> Su-15), flying below its minimum allowed altitude, &quot;without realizing it because of the terrible weather conditions, passed within 10 or 20 meters of Yuri and Seregin&#39;s plane while breaking the sound barrier&quot;. The resulting turbulence would have sent the MiG into an uncontrolled spin. Leonov believes the first boom he heard was that of the jet breaking the sound barrier, and the second was Gagarin&#39;s plane crashing.<p>A new theory, advanced by the original crash investigator in 2005, hypothesises that a cabin vent was accidentally left open by the crew or the previous pilot, thus leading to <!--del_lnk--> oxygen deprivation and leaving the crew incapable of controlling the aircraft.<p>Many figures in his life published memoirs involving Yuri including his mother and his wife in 1983. <p>There were two <!--del_lnk--> commemorative coins issued in the Soviet Union to commemorate 20th and 30th anniversaries of his flight: 1 ruble coin (1981, copper-nickel) and 3 ruble coin (1991, silver). In 2001, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Gagarin&#39;s flight, a series of four coins bearing his likeness was issued in <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>:2 ruble coin (copper-nickel), 3 ruble coin (silver), 10 ruble coin (brass-copper, nickel), 100 ruble coin (silver). <p><a id="Gagarin.27s_name" name="Gagarin.27s_name"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Gagarin&#39;s name</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> FAI Gold Medal, awarded since 1968 is named after Gagarin . A <!--del_lnk--> crater on the <!--del_lnk--> far side of the <a href="../../wp/m/Moon.htm" title="Moon">Moon</a>, and an <!--del_lnk--> asteroid <!--del_lnk--> 1772 Gagarin are named after him. In Russia Gzhatsk was renamed <!--del_lnk--> Gagarin in 1968, a square in <a href="../../wp/m/Moscow.htm" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> featuring a large monument to Gagarin is named after him. <!--del_lnk--> Cosmonauts Training Centre in <!--del_lnk--> Star City bears his name since 1968. There are also numerous streets, avenues and squares bearing Gagarin&#39;s name in Russian towns.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Gagarin&quot;</div>
