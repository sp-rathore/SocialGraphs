      <p>Zhang Qian was born in present day <!--del_lnk--> Hanzhong, Shaanxi, at the border of northeastern <!--del_lnk--> Sichuan. He entered the capital, Chang&#39;an, today&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Xi&#39;an, between 140 BCE and 134 BCE as a Gentleman (&#x90CE;), serving <!--del_lnk--> Emperor Wu. At the time the <!--del_lnk--> Xiongnu tribes controlled modern <!--del_lnk--> Inner Mongolia and dominated much of modern Xiyu (&#x897F;&#x57DF; &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Western Regions&quot;).<p>The Han court despatched Zhang Qian to the Western Regions in <!--del_lnk--> 138 BCE with a delegation of over one hundred members, including a surrendered Xiongnu guide. The objective of Zhang Qian&#39;s first mission was to seek a military alliance with the Greater <!--del_lnk--> Yuezhi (&#x6708;&#x6C0F;), in modern <a href="../../wp/t/Tajikistan.htm" title="Tajikistan">Tajikistan</a>. On route he was captured by the Xiongnu and detained for ten years. There he married a Xiongnu wife and gained the trust of the Xiongnu leader.<p>When Zhang finally made it to Yuezhi lands, he found that they were too settled to want war against the Xiongnu. He spent about one year in Yuezhi and <!--del_lnk--> Bactrian territory, documenting their cultures, lifestyles and economy, before returning to China.<p><a id="Zhang_Qian.27s_report" name="Zhang_Qian.27s_report"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Zhang Qian&#39;s report</span></h2>

Visited countries are highlighted in <!--del_lnk--> blue.</div>
       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Zhang Qian starts with a report on the first country he visited (after his captivity among the Xiongnu), <a href="../../wp/d/Dayuan.htm" title="Dayuan">Dayuan</a>, in <!--del_lnk--> Ferghana, west of the <!--del_lnk--> Tarim Basin. They are considered by him as sophisticated urban dwellers, on the same footing as the Parthian and the Bactrians. The name Dayuan (meaning Great Yuan), may be a transliteration of the word <i><!--del_lnk--> Yona</i> used to designate Greeks, who occupied the region from the 4th to the 2nd century BCE.<dl>
       <dd>&quot;Dayuan lies southwest of the territory of the Xiongnu, some 10,000 <i><!--del_lnk--> li</i> (5,000 kilometers) directly west of China. The people are settled on the land, plowing the fields and growing rice and wheat. They also make wine out of grapes. The people live in houses in fortified cities, there being some seventy or more cities of various sizes in the region. The population numbers several hundred thousand&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> Shiji, 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).</dl>
      <p><a id="Yuezhi_.28Tocharians.3F.29" name="Yuezhi_.28Tocharians.3F.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Yuezhi (Tocharians?)</span></h3>
      <p>After obtaining the help of the king of Dayuan, Zhang Qian went southwest to the territory of the Yuezhi, with whom he was supposed to obtain a military alliance against the Xiongnu.<dl>
       <dd>&quot;The Great Yuezhi live some 2,000 or 3,000 li (1,000 or 1,500 kilometers) west of Dayuan, north of the Gui (<!--del_lnk--> Oxus) river. They are bordered to the south by Daxia (Bactria), on the west by Anxi (Parthia), and on the north by <!--del_lnk--> Kangju (&#x5EB7;&#x5C45;). They are a nation of nomads, moving place to place with their herds and their customs are like those of the Xiongnu. They have some 100,000 or 200,000 archer warriors.&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> Shiji, 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).</dl>
      <p>Zhang Qian also describes the origins of the Yuezhi, explaining they came from the eastern part of the <!--del_lnk--> Tarim Basin, a momentous explanation which has encouraged historians to connect them to the <!--del_lnk--> Caucasoid <!--del_lnk--> mummies, as well as to the <!--del_lnk--> Indo-European-speaking <!--del_lnk--> Tocharians that have been identified from precisely the same area:<dl>
       <dd>&quot;The Yuezhi originally lived in the area between the Qilian or Heavenly Mountains (<!--del_lnk--> Tian Shan) and <!--del_lnk--> Dunhuang, but after they were defeated by the Xiongnu they moved far away to the west, beyond Dayuan (Ferghana), where they attacked the people of Daxia (Bactria) and set up the court of their king on the northern bank of the Gui (Oxus) river.&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> Shiji, 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).</dl>
      <p>A smaller group of Yuezhi, the &quot;Little Yuezhi&quot; were not able to follow the exodus and reportedly found refuge among the &quot;Qiang barbarians&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> Tibetans).<p><a id="Daxia_.28Bactria.29" name="Daxia_.28Bactria.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Daxia (Bactria)</span></h3>
      <p>Zhang Qian probably witnessed the last period of the <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Bactrian kingdom, as it was being subjugated by the nomad Yuezhi. Only small powerless chiefs remained, who were apparently vassals to the Yuezhi horde. Their civilization was urban, almost identical to the civilizations of Parthia and Dayuan, and the population was numerous.<dl>
       <dd>&quot;Daxia is situated over 2,000 <i>li</i> (1,000 kilometers) southwest of <a href="../../wp/d/Dayuan.htm" title="Dayuan">Dayuan</a> (Ferghana), south of the Gui (Oxus) river. Its people cultivate the land, and have cities and houses. Their customs are like those of Dayuan. It has no great ruler but only a number of petty chiefs ruling the various cities. The people are poor in the use of arms and afraid of battle, but they are clever at commerce. After the Great Yuezhi moved west and attacked and conquered Daxia, the entire country came under their sway. The population of the country is large, numbering some 1,000,000 or more persons. The capital is Lanshi (<!--del_lnk--> Bactra) where all sorts of goods are bought and sold.&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> Shiji, 123, Zhang Qian quote, translation Burton Watson).</dl>
      <p><a id="Shendu_.28India.29" name="Shendu_.28India.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Shendu (India)</span></h3>
      <p>Zhang Qian also reports about the existence of <!--del_lnk--> India southeast of Bactria. The name <i>Shendu</i> comes from the <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> word &quot;Sindhu&quot;, used for the province of <!--del_lnk--> Sindh (now a province of <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>) by its local people. Sindh was one of the most advanced regions of India at the time. Although it was part of India, it practiced separate authority over itself. Because of its coastal borders with Persia and the Arabian Sea, it invited great wealth from these regions. Parts of Northwestern India (modern Pakistan) was ruled by the <a href="../../wp/i/Indo-Greek_Kingdom.htm" title="Indo-Greek Kingdom">Indo-Greek Kingdom</a> at the time, which explains the reported cultural similarity between Bactria and India.<dl>
       <dd>&quot;Southeast of Daxia is the kingdom of Shendu (India)... Shendu, they told me, lies several thousand <i>li</i> southeast of Daxia (Bactria). The people cultivate the land and live much like the people of Daxia. The region is said to be hot and damp. The inhabitants ride elephants when they go in battle. The kingdom is situated on a great river (<a href="../../wp/i/Indus_River.htm" title="Indus River">Indus</a>)&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> Shiji, 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).</dl>
      <p><a id="Anxi_.28Parthia.29" name="Anxi_.28Parthia.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Anxi (Parthia)</span></h3>
      <p>Zhang Qian clearly identifies Parthia as an advanced urban civilization, like Dayuan (Ferghana) and Daxia (Bactria). The name &quot;Anxi&quot; is a transliterations of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Arsacid&quot;, name of the Parthian dynasty.<dl>
       <dd>&quot;Anxi is situated several thousand <i><!--del_lnk--> li</i> west of the region of the Great Yuezhi. The people are settled on the land, cultivating the fields and growing rice and wheat. They also make wine out of grapes. They have walled cities like the people of Dayuan (Ferghana), the region contains several hundred cities of various sizes. The coins of the country are made of silver and bear the face of the king. When the king dies, the currency is immediately changed and new coins issued with the face of his successor. The people keep records by writing on horizontal strips of leather. To the west lies Tiaozhi (Mesopotamia) and to the north Yancai and Lixuan (<!--del_lnk--> Hyrcania).&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> Shiji, 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).</dl>
      <p><a id="Tiaozhi" name="Tiaozhi"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Tiaozhi</span></h3>
      <p>Zhang Qian reports about Mesopotamia, beyond Parthia, although in rather tenuous terms, because he didn&#39;t go there, and was only able to reports other&#39;s accounts.<dl>
       <dd>&quot;Tiaozhi (Mesopotamia) is situated several thousand <i>li</i> west of Anxi (Parthia) and borders the Western Sea (<a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Gulf.htm" title="Persian Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>/ <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>?). It is hot and damp, and the people live by cultivating the fields and planting rice... The people are very numerous and are ruled by many petty chiefs. The ruler of Anxi (Parthia) give orders to these chiefs and regards them as vassals.&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> Shiji, 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).</dl>
      <p><a id="Kangju_.28.E5.BA.B7.E5.B1.85.29_northwest_of_Sogdiana_.28.E7.B2.9F.E7.89.B9.29" name="Kangju_.28.E5.BA.B7.E5.B1.85.29_northwest_of_Sogdiana_.28.E7.B2.9F.E7.89.B9.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../wp/t/Tashkent.htm" title="Kangju">Kangju (&#x5EB7;&#x5C45;)</a> northwest of Sogdiana (&#x7C9F;&#x7279;)</span></h3>
      <p>Zhang Qian also visited directly the area of <!--del_lnk--> Sogdiana, home to the Sogdian nomads:<dl>
       <dd>&quot;Kangju is situated some 2,000 li (1,000 kilometers) northwest of Dayuan (Bactria). Its people are nomads and resemble the <!--del_lnk--> Yuezhi in their customs. They have 80,000 or 90,000 skilled archer fighters. The country is small, and borders Dayuan. It acknowledges sovereignty to the Yuezhi people in the South and the Xiongnu in the East.&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> Shiji, 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).</dl>
      <p><a id="Yancai_.E5.A5.84.E8.94.A1_.28Vast_Steppe.29" name="Yancai_.E5.A5.84.E8.94.A1_.28Vast_Steppe.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Yancai &#x5944;&#x8521; (Vast Steppe)</span></h3>
      <dl>
       <dd>&quot;Yancai lies some 2,000 <i><!--del_lnk--> li</i> (832 km) northwest of <a href="../../wp/t/Tashkent.htm" title="Kangju">Kangju</a> (centered on <!--del_lnk--> Turkestan at Bei&#39;tian). The people are nomads and their customs are generally similar to those of the people of <a href="../../wp/t/Tashkent.htm" title="Kangju">Kangju</a>. The country has over 100,000 archer warriors, and borders a great shoreless lake, perhaps what is known as the Northern Sea (<a href="../../wp/a/Aral_Sea.htm" title="Aral Sea">Aral Sea</a>, distance between <a href="../../wp/t/Tashkent.htm" title="Tashkent">Tashkent</a> to <!--del_lnk--> Aralsk is about 866 km)&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> Shiji, 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).</dl>
      <p><a id="Return_to_China" name="Return_to_China"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Return to China</span></h2>
      <p>On his return trip he was again captured by the Xiongnu who again spared his life because they valued his sense of duty and composure in the face of death. Two years later the Xiongnu leader died and in the midst of chaos and infighting Zhang Qian escaped.<p>Zhang Qian returned in <!--del_lnk--> 125 BCE with detailed news for the Emperor, which showed that sophisticated civilizations existed to the West, with which China could advantageously develop relations. The Shiji relates that &quot;the emperor learned of the Dayuan, Daxia, Anxi, and the others, all great states rich in unusual products whose people cultivated the land and made their living in much the same way as the Chinese. All these states, he was told, were militarily weak and prized Han goods and wealth&quot;. (<!--del_lnk--> Shiji, 123, trans. Burton Watson).<p>His second expedition was more organised, a trade mission to the <!--del_lnk--> Wu-sun people in <!--del_lnk--> 119 BCE. This was a success and led to trade between China and <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Empire.htm" title="Persian Empire">Persia</a>.<p><a id="Development_of_East-West_contacts" name="Development_of_East-West_contacts"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Development of East-West contacts</span></h2>
      <p>Following Zhang Qian&#39; embassy and report, commercial relations between China and Central as well as Western Asia flourished, as many Chinese missions were sent throughout the end of the <!--del_lnk--> 2nd century BCE and the <!--del_lnk--> 1st century BCE, initiating the development of the <!--del_lnk--> Silk Road:<dl>
       <dd>&quot;The largest of these embassies to foreign states numbered several hundred persons, while even the smaller parties included over 100 members... In the course of one year anywhere from five to six to over ten parties would be sent out.&quot; (Shiji, trans. Burton Watson).</dl>
      <p>Many objects were soon exchanged, and travelled as far as <a href="../../wp/g/Guangzhou.htm" title="Guangzhou">Guangzhou</a> in the East, as suggested by the discovery of a <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Empire.htm" title="Persian Empire">Persian</a> box and various artifacts from Central Asia in the <!--del_lnk--> 122 BCE tomb of the Chinese King <!--del_lnk--> Wen of <!--del_lnk--> Nanyue.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Around 120 BCE, one of these missions may have brought the first Buddhist statues to China. Murals in <!--del_lnk--> Mogao Caves in <!--del_lnk--> Dunhuang describe the Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Han Wudi (156-87 BCE) worshipping Buddhist statues, explaining them as &quot;golden men brought in <!--del_lnk--> 120 BCE by a great Han general in his campaigns against the nomads&quot;, although there is no other mention of Han Wudi worshipping the Buddha in Chinese historical literature.<p>China also sent a mission to <!--del_lnk--> Parthia, which were followed up by reciprocal missions from Parthian envoys around <!--del_lnk--> 100 BCE:<dl>
       <dd>&quot;When the Han envoy first visited the kingdom of Anxi (Parthia), the king of Anxi dispatched a party of 20,000 horsemen to meet them on the eastern border of the kingdom... When the Han envoys set out again to return to China, the king of Anxi dispatched envoys of his own to accompany them... The emperor was delighted at this.&quot; (Shiji, 123, trans. Burton Watson).</dl>
      <p>The Roman historian <!--del_lnk--> Florus describes the visit of numerous envoys, included <i><!--del_lnk--> Seres</i> (Chinese), to the first Roman Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Augustus, who reigned between <!--del_lnk--> 27 BCE and <!--del_lnk--> 14 CE:<dl>
       <dd>&quot;Even the rest of the nations of the world which were not subject to the imperial sway were sensible of its grandeur, and looked with reverence to the Roman people, the great conqueror of nations. Thus even <!--del_lnk--> Scythians and <!--del_lnk--> Sarmatians sent envoys to seek the friendship of Rome. Nay, the <!--del_lnk--> Seres came likewise, and the <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">Indians</a> who dwelt beneath the vertical sun, bringing presents of precious stones and pearls and elephants, but thinking all of less moment than the vastness of the journey which they had undertaken, and which they said had occupied four years.
