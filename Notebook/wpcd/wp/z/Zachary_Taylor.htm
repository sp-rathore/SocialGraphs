      <p>Taylor was born on <!--del_lnk--> November 24, <!--del_lnk--> 1984, in a <!--del_lnk--> log cabin near <!--del_lnk--> Barboursville in <!--del_lnk--> Orange County, Virginia.<p>Zachary Taylor was the third of eight children of Richard Taylor and Sarah Strother. Taylor&#39;s family was aristocratic: <!--del_lnk--> James Madison was a second cousin and <!--del_lnk--> Robert E. Lee was a fourth cousin once removed. In his infancy, Taylor&#39;s family moved to <!--del_lnk--> Kentucky, where Taylor grew up on a <!--del_lnk--> plantation. He was known as &quot;Little Zack&quot; and was educated by private tutors. He is one of the descendants of <!--del_lnk--> King Edward III of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> <!--del_lnk--> .<p>Taylor met <!--del_lnk--> Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; Mackall Smith of <!--del_lnk--> Maryland in early 1810, and they were married on <!--del_lnk--> June 21, <!--del_lnk--> 1810. They had one son and five daughters, two of whom died in infancy. The surviving children were:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Ann Taylor (born <!--del_lnk--> April 9, <!--del_lnk--> 1811)<li><!--del_lnk--> Sarah Knox &quot;Knoxie&quot; Taylor (born <!--del_lnk--> March 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1814)<li><!--del_lnk--> Mary Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Taylor (born <!--del_lnk--> April 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1824)<li><!--del_lnk--> Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Taylor(born <!--del_lnk--> January 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1826)</ul>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Sarah Knox Taylor married future <!--del_lnk--> Confederate president <!--del_lnk--> Jefferson Davis at age 21 over her father&#39;s strenuous objections; she died from <a href="../../wp/m/Malaria.htm" title="Malaria">malaria</a> three months after the marriage.<p><a id="Military_career" name="Military_career"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Military career</span></h2>

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> May 3, <!--del_lnk--> 1808, Taylor joined the U.S. Army, receiving a <!--del_lnk--> commission as a <!--del_lnk--> first lieutenant of the <!--del_lnk--> Seventh Infantry Regiment. He was ordered west into <!--del_lnk--> Indiana Territory, taking command at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Fort Harrison; he was promoted to <!--del_lnk--> captain in November 1810.<p>During the <!--del_lnk--> War of 1812, Taylor became known as a talented military commander. Assigned to command <!--del_lnk--> Fort Harrison on the <!--del_lnk--> Wabash River, at the northern edge of present-day <!--del_lnk--> Terre Haute, Indiana, he successfully commandeered a small force of soldiers and civilians to stave off a British-inspired attack by about 500 Native Americans between September 4 and September 15. The <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Fort Harrison, as it became known, has been referred to as the &quot;first American land victory of the War of 1812.&quot; Taylor received a <!--del_lnk--> brevet promotion to <!--del_lnk--> major on <!--del_lnk--> October 31, <!--del_lnk--> 1812. Taylor was promoted to <!--del_lnk--> lieutenant colonel on <!--del_lnk--> April 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1819, and <!--del_lnk--> colonel on <!--del_lnk--> April 5, <!--del_lnk--> 1832.<p>Taylor served in the <!--del_lnk--> Black Hawk War (May-August 1832) and the Second Seminole War (1835-1842). During the Seminole War, Taylor fought at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Lake Okeechobee and received a brevet promotion to <!--del_lnk--> brigadier general in January 1838. It was here he gained his nickname &quot;Old Rough and Ready&quot; for his rumpled clothes and wide-brimmed <!--del_lnk--> straw hat. On <!--del_lnk--> May 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1838, Taylor was promoted commanding general of all U.S. forces in <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a>.<p><a href="../../wp/j/James_K._Polk.htm" title="James K. Polk">James K. Polk</a> sent the Army of Occupation under Taylor&#39;s command to the <!--del_lnk--> Rio Grande in 1846. <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> attacked Taylor&#39;s troops and Taylor defeated them despite being outnumbered 4-to-1. Polk later declared war. In the <!--del_lnk--> Mexican-American War that followed, Taylor won additional important victories at <!--del_lnk--> Monterrey and <!--del_lnk--> Buena Vista and became a <!--del_lnk--> national hero.<p>Polk kept Taylor in northern Mexico, disturbed by his informal habits of command and his affiliation with the Whig Party. He sent an expedition under General <!--del_lnk--> Winfield Scott to capture <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico_City.htm" title="Mexico City">Mexico City</a>. Taylor, incensed, thought that &quot;the battle of Buena Vista opened the road to the city of Mexico and the halls of <!--del_lnk--> Montezuma, that others might revel in them.&quot;<p><a id="Election_of_1848" name="Election_of_1848"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Election of 1848</span></h2>

      <p>He received the <!--del_lnk--> Whig nomination for President in 1848. Like many other army officers, he was nonpolitical and had never voted. His homespun ways and his status as a war hero were political assets. Taylor defeated <!--del_lnk--> Lewis Cass, the Democratic candidate, and <a href="../../wp/m/Martin_Van_Buren.htm" title="Martin Van Buren">Martin Van Buren</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Free Soil candidate.<p>To the astonishment of Whigs, Taylor ignored their platform, As historian Michael Holt explains:<blockquote>
       <p>Taylor was equally indifferent to programs Whigs had long considered vital. Publicly, he was artfully ambiguous, refusing to answer queries about his views on banking, the tariff, and internal improvements. Privately, he was more forthright. The idea of a national bank &quot;is dead, &amp; will not be revived in my time.&quot; In the future the tariff &quot;will be increased only for revenue&quot;; in other words, Whig hopes of restoring the protective <!--del_lnk--> tariff of 1842 were vain. There would never again be surplus federal funds from public land sales to distribute to the states, and internal improvements &quot;will go on in spite of presidential vetoes.&quot; In a few words, that is, Taylor pronounced an epitaph for the entire Whig economic program.</blockquote>
      <p>Although Taylor won the election, he didn&#39;t know it at first. Having been a popular war general, he received many fan letters, some without <!--del_lnk--> postage. To avoid paying large sums of money, he had asked his post office to stop sending letters without postage. The letter from Washington, informing Taylor had won the election, did not have postage, and Taylor didn&#39;t receive the letter until another letter with postage had been sent.<p><a id="Presidency" name="Presidency"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Presidency</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Policies" name="Policies"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Policies</span></h3>
      <p>Although Taylor had subscribed to <!--del_lnk--> Whig principles of legislative leadership, he was not inclined to be a puppet of Whig leaders in <!--del_lnk--> Congress. He ran his administration in the same rule-of-thumb fashion with which he had fought Indians.<p>Under Taylor&#39;s administration the <!--del_lnk--> United States Department of the Interior was organized, although the department had been activated under President Polk&#39;s last day in office.<p><a id="Compromise_of_1850" name="Compromise_of_1850"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Compromise of 1850</span></h3>
      <p>The slavery issue dominated Taylor&#39;s short term. Although he owned slaves, he took a moderately anti-slavery position. Taylor urged settlers in <!--del_lnk--> New Mexico and <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a> to draft constitutions and apply for statehood, bypassing the territorial stage. New Mexico was too small to act but California&mdash;which had high population growth from the <!--del_lnk--> gold rush&mdash;wrote a constitution that did not allow slavery; it was approved by the voters and a new state government took over in December 1849 without Congressional approval. Southerners were furious with Taylor (a southerner) and with California. In February 1850, Taylor held a stormy conference with southern leaders who threatened <!--del_lnk--> secession. He told them that if necessary to enforce the laws, he personally would lead the Army. Persons &quot;taken in rebellion against the Union, he would hang ... with less reluctance than he had hanged deserters and spies in Mexico.&quot; He never wavered. <!--del_lnk--> Henry Clay then proposed a complex <!--del_lnk--> Compromise of 1850. Taylor died as it was being debated. (The Clay version failed but another version did pass under the new president, <a href="../../wp/m/Millard_Fillmore.htm" title="Millard Fillmore">Millard Fillmore</a>.)<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The cause of Zachary Taylor&#39;s death is not well understood, nor is it well documented. On <!--del_lnk--> July 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1850, Taylor was diagnosed by his physicians with <i>cholera morbus</i>, a term that included <!--del_lnk--> diarrhea and <!--del_lnk--> dysentery but not true <a href="../../wp/c/Cholera.htm" title="Cholera">cholera</a>. Cholera, <!--del_lnk--> typhoid fever, and <!--del_lnk--> food poisoning have all been indicated as the source of the president&#39;s ultimately fatal gastroenteritis. More specifically, a hasty snack of iced milk, cold cherries and pickled cucumbers consumed at an <!--del_lnk--> Independence Day celebration might have been the culprit. By <!--del_lnk--> July 9, Taylor was dead.<p>In 1991, Taylor&#39;s body was exhumed, and <!--del_lnk--> Larry Robinson and <!--del_lnk--> Frank Dyer conducted an autopsy at the <!--del_lnk--> Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Investigating the possibility of assassination by means of deliberate poisoning, Dyer and Robinson detected traces of arsenic and sent the results to a Kentucky medical examiner, who determined the quantity of arsenic present -- there is a faint amount of arsenic present naturally in the human body -- was several hundred times less than there would have been, had he been poisoned with arsenic.<!--del_lnk-->  Taylor is buried in <a href="../../wp/l/Louisville%252C_Kentucky.htm" title="Louisville, Kentucky">Louisville, Kentucky</a>, at what is now the <!--del_lnk--> Zachary Taylor National Cemetery.<p>There is some strong evidence that Taylor died from complications of heat stroke. On July 4, 1850, the weather in Washington was hot and rather humid. Taylor was there to preside over ceremonies at the laying of the cornerstone of the Washington Monument. Taylor was sporting a thick coat, vest, high-collared shirt, and a top hat. Shortly after arriving, Taylor complained that he was very thirsty. He went to the reception table and downed a large amount of water directly from a pitcher.<p>Since the water was sitting in the sun, the idea of cholera is a possibility. But Taylor exhibited classic symptoms of heat stroke, particularly red, flushed skin on the face. Records also indicate that Taylor was having trouble walking and exhibiting slurred speech. At no time while outside did anyone loosen or remove Taylor&#39;s clothing. Only after returning to the White House was some of his clothing loosened. It was only a short time before Taylor collapsed.<p>At this point his clothing was removed, but internal organs had already been damaged. In fact, his doctors were mystified as to the cause of multiple organ failure. Medical sciences had not addressed heat stroke and the internal damage caused by it. According to author Charles Panati, Taylor actually awoke briefly and said- &quot;I should not be surprised if this were to result in my death.&quot; He took a few sips of iced milk, again adding to the possibility of cholera. He lapsed again into unconsciousness and died on July 9.<p><a id="Surviving_family" name="Surviving_family"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Surviving family</span></h2>
