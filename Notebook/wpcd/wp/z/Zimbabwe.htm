      <p><b>Zimbabwe</b> (<!--del_lnk--> IPA: <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[z&#x26A;m&#x2C8;b&#x251;bwe]</span>), officially the <b>Republic of Zimbabwe</b>, and formerly <b>Republic of Rhodesia</b>, is a <!--del_lnk--> landlocked country in the southern part of the <a href="../../wp/c/Continent.htm" title="Continent">continent</a> of <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>, between the <a href="../../wp/z/Zambezi.htm" title="Zambezi">Zambezi</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Limpopo rivers.

      <p><a href="../../wp/i/Iron_Age.htm" title="Iron Age">Iron Age</a> <a href="../../wp/b/Bantu.htm" title="Bantu">Bantu</a>-speaking peoples began migrating into the area about 2,000 years ago, including the ancestors of the <!--del_lnk--> Shona, who account for roughly four-fifths of the country&#39;s population today. By the middle ages, there was a Bantu civilization in the region, as evidenced by ruins at <!--del_lnk--> Great Zimbabwe, a Shona-speaking state. Around the early <a href="../../wp/1/10th_century.htm" title="10th century">10th century</a>, trade developed with <!--del_lnk--> Muslim <!--del_lnk--> merchants on the <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Ocean.htm" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> coast, helping to develop Great Zimbabwe in the <a href="../../wp/1/11th_century.htm" title="11th century">11th century</a>. The state traded <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Ivory.htm" title="Ivory">ivory</a>, and <a href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper">copper</a> for <!--del_lnk--> cloth and <a href="../../wp/g/Glass.htm" title="Glass">glass</a>. It ceased to be the leading Shona state in the mid-<a href="../../wp/1/15th_century.htm" title="15th century">15th century</a>.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1837, the Shona were conquered by the <!--del_lnk--> Ndebele, who forced them to pay tribute. Later, in the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a>, British and <!--del_lnk--> Boer traders, missionaries, and hunters started encroaching on the area.<p><a id="Rhodesian_era" name="Rhodesian_era"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Rhodesian era</span></h3>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1888, British imperialist <!--del_lnk--> Cecil Rhodes extracted <a href="../../wp/m/Mining.htm" title="Mining">mining</a> rights from <!--del_lnk--> King Lobengula of the Ndebele. The following year, he obtained a charter for the <!--del_lnk--> British South Africa Company, which conquered the Ndebele and their territory and promoted the colonization of the region&#39;s land, labour, and precious metal and mineral resources. In <!--del_lnk--> 1895, the territory was named &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Rhodesia&quot; after Cecil Rhodes. Both the Ndebele and the Shona staged unsuccessful revolts against the encroachment on their native lands in <!--del_lnk--> 1896 and <!--del_lnk--> 1897. Both the Ndebele and Shona became subject to the Rhodes administration. This was the beginning of a larger settlement of white settlers, that also led to the land distribution favouring whites and displacing both the Shona and Ndebele and other black people. The land issue in Zimbabwe remains a controversial issue to this day.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1911, the territory was divided into <!--del_lnk--> Northern Rhodesia (now <a href="../../wp/z/Zambia.htm" title="Zambia">Zambia</a>) and <!--del_lnk--> Southern Rhodesia, the latter becoming a <!--del_lnk--> self-governing <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British colony</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1922. In <!--del_lnk--> 1953, the two parts of Rhodesia were reunited together with <!--del_lnk--> Nyasaland (now <a href="../../wp/m/Malawi.htm" title="Malawi">Malawi</a>) in the <!--del_lnk--> Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, but this dissolved in <!--del_lnk--> 1963. The same year, <!--del_lnk--> Ian Smith&#39;s regime <!--del_lnk--> declared <!--del_lnk--> Unilateral Independence from Britain and Southern Rhodesia was renamed to Rhodesia.<p><a id="White_minority_rule_and_civil_war" name="White_minority_rule_and_civil_war"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">White minority rule and civil war</span></h3>
      <p><a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> politics served as a menacing backdrop for <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> and British <!--del_lnk--> decolonisation in Southern Africa. After African-majority governments assumed control in neighbouring Northern Rhodesia and in Nyasaland, and after realising that Britain was not prepared to offer special conditions to Southern Rhodesia, which had been a self-governing colony since <!--del_lnk--> 1922, the white-minority government led by <!--del_lnk--> Ian Smith declared unilateral independence on <!--del_lnk--> 11 November <!--del_lnk--> 1965.<p>When negotiations with the Ian Smith administration in <!--del_lnk--> 1966 and <!--del_lnk--> 1968 stalemated, the UK requested <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">UN</a> <!--del_lnk--> economic sanctions against Rhodesia. Faced with no alternative, the white-minority regime declared itself a <!--del_lnk--> republic in <!--del_lnk--> 1970. It was not recognized by the UK or any other state, other than white-minority&ndash;led <!--del_lnk--> apartheid <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>. The newly independent neighbouring African nations of Zambia and Malawi meanwhile, declared themselves to be one-party states. During this time, the <!--del_lnk--> Soviet bloc intensified its efforts to gain a foothold in Africa, with troops drafted in from <a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, <a href="../../wp/y/Yugoslavia.htm" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> USSR, openly funding lawless guerrilla warfare in Africa. Large shipments of <!--del_lnk--> landmines and weaponry were handed over to groups which have been criticised by some as being &quot;untrained groups of poorly educated youths led by power-hungry political activists&quot;.<p><!--del_lnk--> Guerrilla fighting against the white minority intensified, and the Smith regime opened negotiations with the leaders of the Patriotic Fronts <!--del_lnk--> Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), led by <!--del_lnk--> Robert Mugabe and the <!--del_lnk--> Zimbabwe African People&#39;s Union (ZAPU), led by <!--del_lnk--> Joshua Nkomo. With his regime near the brink of collapse, in March 1978 Smith signed a desperate accord with three black leaders, led by the moderate Bishop <!--del_lnk--> Abel Muzorewa, who offered safeguards for white civilians.<p>Muzorewa, who had the support not only of the Smith regime but also of the white-minority regime in <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, lacked credibility among significant parts of the African population, and his government soon faltered. In <!--del_lnk--> 1979, the British Government asked all parties to come to <!--del_lnk--> Lancaster House in an attempt to negotiate a settlement in the civil war.<p><a id="Independence" name="Independence"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Independence</span></h3>
      <p>Following the conference, held in London (<!--del_lnk--> 1979&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 80), Britain&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Lord Soames was appointed governor to oversee the disarming of revolutionary guerrillas, the holding of elections, and the granting of independence to an uneasy coalition government with Joshua Nkomo, head of ZAPU. In the free elections of February 1980, Mugabe and his ZANU won a landslide victory. Mugabe has won re-election ever since.<p>During the first decade of independence Robert Mugabe used the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Korea.htm" title="North Korea">North Korean</a> trained <!--del_lnk--> Fifth Brigade to silence any opposition from the <!--del_lnk--> Ndebele nation in an operation referred to as <!--del_lnk--> Gukurahundi. The killing was done on the pretext of dissidents existing within the Zimbabwean armed forces. An estimated 20 000 civilians, mostly Ndebele, were killed or disappeared and have not been accounted for to this date. Allegations of <!--del_lnk--> genocide and <!--del_lnk--> ethnic cleansing have resulted in calls for Mugabe&#39;s arrest and prosecution for crimes against humanity.<p>Land issues, which the liberation movement promised to solve, re-emerged as the vital issue for the <!--del_lnk--> ruling party beginning in <!--del_lnk--> 1999. Despite majority-rule, and the existence of a &quot;willing buyer-willing seller&quot; land reform programme since the 1980s, ZANU (PF) claimed that <!--del_lnk--> whites made up less than 1% of the population but held 70% of the country&#39;s commercially viable <!--del_lnk--> arable land (though these figures are disputed by many outside of the <!--del_lnk--> Government of Zimbabwe). Mugabe began to <!--del_lnk--> redistribute land to blacks in 2000 with a compulsory land redistribution; charges that the programme as a whole is designed to reward loyal deputies have persisted in Zimbabwe since the beginning of the process. Despite claims by both the opposition and the government that land reform of one kind or another must take place, the Mugabe lead process has been seen as a diversion away from an ill conceived war in the <!--del_lnk--> DRC and economic maladministration. The legality and constitutionality of the process has regularly been challenged in the Zimbabwean High and Supreme Courts, however the <!--del_lnk--> policing agencies have rarely acted in accordance with courts&#39; rulings on these matters. The chaotic implementation of the land reform lead to a sharp decline in agricultural exports, traditionally the country&#39;s leading export producing sector. <a href="../../wp/m/Mining.htm" title="Mining">Mining</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">tourism</a> have surpassed <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>. As a result, Zimbabwe is currently experiencing a severe hard currency shortage, which has led to <!--del_lnk--> hyperinflation and chronic shortages in imported <!--del_lnk--> fuel and consumer goods. In 2002 Zimbabwe was suspended from the <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth of Nations on charges of <a href="../../wp/h/Human_rights.htm" title="Human rights">human rights</a> abuses during the land redistribution and of <a href="../../wp/e/Election.htm" title="Election">election</a> tampering.<p>Following elections in 2005, the government initiated &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Operation Murambatsvina&quot;, a supposed effort to crack down on illegal markets and homes that had seen slums unfit for human habitation emerge in towns and cities. This action has been widely condemned by opposition and international figures, who charge that it has left a large section of the urban poor homeless. The Zimbabwe government has described the operation as an attempt to provide decent housing to the population although they have yet to deliver any new housing for the forcefully removed people.<p>Zimbabwe&#39;s current economic and food crisis, described by some observers as the country&#39;s worst humanitarian crisis since independence, has been attributed, in varying degrees, to a drought affecting the entire region, the <a href="../../wp/h/HIV.htm" title="HIV">HIV</a>/<a href="../../wp/a/AIDS.htm" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> epidemic, and the government&#39;s price controls and land reforms.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>

The <!--del_lnk--> House of Assembly is the <!--del_lnk--> lower chamber of Parliament.<p><!--del_lnk--> Zanu PF party leader <!--del_lnk--> Robert Mugabe, elected <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister in <!--del_lnk--> 1980, revised the <!--del_lnk--> constitution in <!--del_lnk--> 1987 to make himself President. President Mugabe&#39;s affiliated party has won every election since independence on <!--del_lnk--> April 18, <!--del_lnk--> 1980. In some quarters <!--del_lnk--> corruption and <!--del_lnk--> rigging of elections have been alleged. In particular, the elections of <!--del_lnk--> 1990 were nationally and internationally condemned as being rigged, with the second-placed party, <!--del_lnk--> Edgar Tekere&#39;s Zimbabwe Unity Movement, winning only 20% of the vote. Presidential elections were last held in 2002 amid allegations of vote-rigging, intimidation and fraud. The next Presidential elections are to be held in <!--del_lnk--> 2008, although Mugabe is currently trying to amend the constitution in an attempt to stay in power until <!--del_lnk--> 2010.<p>The major opposition party at the moment is the <!--del_lnk--> Movement for Democratic Change, or MDC, led by <!--del_lnk--> Morgan Tsvangirai. The MDC is currently split into two factions. One faction, led by <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Mutambara is contesting the elections to the Senate, while the other led by Morgan Tsvangirai is opposed to contesting the elections, stating that participation in a rigged election is tantamount to endorsing Mugabe&#39;s claim that elections in Zimbabwe are completely free and fair. However, the opposition parties have resumed participation in national and local elections as recently as <!--del_lnk--> 2006. The two MDC camps had their congresses in 2005 with Morgan Tsvangirai being elected to lead the main splinter group which has become more popular than the other group. Professor <!--del_lnk--> Arthur G.O Mutambara, a Robotics Professor and former <!--del_lnk--> NASA robotics specialist has replaced <!--del_lnk--> Welshman Ncube who was the interim leader after the split. Morgan Tsvangirai did not participate in the Senate elections, while the Mutambara faction participated and won some seats in the senate. The Mutambara faction has however been weakened by defections from MPs and individuals who are disillusioned by their manifesto. <!--del_lnk--> As of 2007, the Tsvangirai-led MDC has become the most popular, with crowds as large as 20,000 attending their rallies as compared to between 500&ndash;5,000 for the other splinter group. There is wide disagreement in Zimbabwe and neighbouring states as to whether a divided MDC can win presidential elections against a disciplined ruling party. The opposition continues to be weak in rural areas, where a large number of the population of Zimbabwe resides.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> 2005 Zimbabwe parliamentary elections were held on <!--del_lnk--> March 31 and multiple claims of vote rigging, election fraud and intimidation were made by the MDC and <!--del_lnk--> Jonathan Moyo, calling for investigations into 32 of the 120 constituencies. Despite the allegations Jonathan Moyo participated in the elections and won a seat, enabling him to serve as an independent member of Parliament.<p><a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h2>
      <p>Zimbabwe had a literacy rate of 95.2% in 2000, the highest in Africa, although that had slipped to an estimated 90.7% in 2003.

      <p>The government of Zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems after having abandoned earlier efforts in developing a market-oriented economy. Current problems include a shortage of <!--del_lnk--> foreign exchange, soaring inflation, and supply shortages. Zimbabwe&#39;s involvement from <!--del_lnk--> 1998 to <!--del_lnk--> 2002 in the war in the <a href="../../wp/d/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo.htm" title="Democratic Republic of the Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy.<p>Mineral exports, agriculture, and tourism are the main foreign currency earners of Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe is the biggest trading partner of South Africa south of the equator. Since land redistribution began, agricultural exports, especially tobacco, have declined sharply.<p>The downward spiral of the economy has been attributed mainly to mismanagement, corruption and Zimbabwe&#39;s inability to feed itself after evicting more than 4000 white farmers in the controversial farm invasions of <!--del_lnk--> 2000.<p>According to official figures, inflation rose from an annual rate of 32% in 1998 to a high of 1,729.9% in February 2007, a state of <!--del_lnk--> hyperinflation. The exchange rate fell from 24 <!--del_lnk--> Zimbabwean dollars per <!--del_lnk--> US dollar to 250(000) Zimbabwean dollars per US dollar (official rate) and 10,000(000) Zimbabwean dollars per US dollar (parallel rate), in the same period.<p>Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe reached a record annual rate of some 1,730% as reported on <!--del_lnk--> 10 March <!--del_lnk--> 2007. Mugabe points to foreign governments and alleged &quot;sabotage&quot; as the cause of this, as well as the country&#39;s 80% unemployment rate. Critics of Mugabe&#39;s administration, however, immediately indicate the main cause of some of these issues stems from Mugabe&#39;s controversial program which sought to seize land from white commercial farmers.<p>Robert Mugabe has repeatedly blamed sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe by the EU and the USA for the state of the Zimbabwean economy. Governments that imposed the sanctions have however argued that the sanctions are only meant to target government officials and not ordinary citizens.<p><a id="Demographics_and_ethnicity" name="Demographics_and_ethnicity"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Demographics and ethnicity</span></h2>

      <p>Like in many African countries, a majority of Zimbabweans depend on staple foods. Mealie meal or <!--del_lnk--> cornmeal as it is known in other parts of the world is used to prepare <i>bota</i>, a <!--del_lnk--> porridge made by mixing the cornmeal with water, to produce a thick paste. This is usually flavoured with <!--del_lnk--> peanut butter, <a href="../../wp/m/Milk.htm" title="Milk">milk</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Butter.htm" title="Butter">butter</a> and sometimes even <!--del_lnk--> jam. <!--del_lnk--> Bota is usually eaten for breakfast. Cornmeal is also used to make <i><!--del_lnk--> sadza</i>, which is usually eaten for dinner, and by many for lunch too. The process of making sadza is similar to bota, however after the paste has been cooking for several minutes, more cornmeal is added to thicken the paste until it is hard. This meal is usually served with greens, (<!--del_lnk--> spinach, <!--del_lnk--> collard greens) etc, beans and meat that is stewed, grilled or roasted. Sadza is also commonly eaten with <!--del_lnk--> curdled milk commonly known as lacto (mukaka wakakora), or a small dried fish called kapenta (matemba). On special occasions rice and <a href="../../wp/c/Chicken.htm" title="Chicken">chicken</a> with cabbage salad is often served as the main meal.<p>Graduations, weddings and any other family gatherings will usually be celebrated with the killing of a <a href="../../wp/d/Domestic_goat.htm" title="Goat">goat</a> or <a href="../../wp/c/Cattle.htm" title="Cow">cow</a>, which will be <!--del_lnk--> braaied (an <!--del_lnk--> Afrikaner form of <!--del_lnk--> barbecue) for the family.<p>For the Afrikaners, (although a small part of the white minority group, their recipes are popular), meat is especially important, though often expensive and now rare in Zimbabwe. <!--del_lnk--> Biltong, a type of <!--del_lnk--> jerky, is a popular snack, prepared by hanging bits of raw meat to dry in the sun. <!--del_lnk--> Boerewors (<!--del_lnk--> pronounced <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/b&oslash;r&#x259;v&#x25E;&#x27E;s/</span> - bore-wore-vorse) is served alongside sadza.
