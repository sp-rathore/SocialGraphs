      <p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h3>
      <p>nak kuh Zeus, poetically referred to by the <!--del_lnk--> vocative <i>Zeu pater</i> (&quot;O, father Zeus&quot;), is a continuation of *<!--del_lnk--> <span class="PIE Unicode" style="white-space: nowrap" title="Proto-Indo-European language"><i>Di&#x32F;&#x113;us</i></span>, the <!--del_lnk--> Proto-Indo-European god of the daytime sky, also called *<span class="PIE Unicode" style="white-space: nowrap" title="Proto-Indo-European language"><i>Dyeus ph<sub>2</sub>t&#x113;r</i></span> (&quot;Sky Father&quot;). The god is known under this name in <!--del_lnk--> Sanskrit (cf. <i><!--del_lnk--> Dyaus/Dyaus Pita</i>), <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> (cf. <i><!--del_lnk--> Jupiter</i>, from <i>Iuppiter</i>, deriving from the <!--del_lnk--> PIE vocative *<span class="PIE Unicode" style="white-space: nowrap" title="Proto-Indo-European language"><i>dyeu-ph<sub>2</sub>t&#x113;r</i></span>), deriving from the basic form *<i>dyeu</i>- (&quot;to shine&quot;, and in its many derivatives, &quot;sky, heaven, god&quot;). And in <!--del_lnk--> Germanic and <a href="../../wp/n/Norse_mythology.htm" title="Norse mythology">Norse mythology</a> (cf. *<i>T&#x12B;waz</i> &gt; <!--del_lnk--> OHG <i>Ziu</i>, <!--del_lnk--> ON <i><!--del_lnk--> T&yacute;r</i>), together with Latin <i>deus</i>, <i>d&#x12B;vus</i> and <i>Dis</i>(a variation of <i>d&#x12B;ves</i>), from the related noun *<i>deiwos</i>. To the Greeks and Romans, the god of the sky was also the supreme god, whereas this function was filled out by <a href="../../wp/o/Odin.htm" title="Odin">Odin</a> among the <!--del_lnk--> Germanic tribes. Accordingly, they did not identify Zeus/Jupiter with either Tyr or Odin, but with <a href="../../wp/t/Thor.htm" title="Thor">Thor</a> (<span class="Unicode">&THORN;&oacute;rr</span>). Zeus is the only deity in the Olympic pantheon whose name has such a transparent Indo-European etymology.<p>In addition to his Indo-European inheritance, the classical Zeus also derives certain iconographic traits from the cultures of the <!--del_lnk--> ancient Near East, such as the <!--del_lnk--> scepter. Zeus is envisaged by Greek artists especially in two poses: standing, striding forward a thunderbolt levelled in his raised right hand and seated in majesty.<p>Aside from forced transformation, Zeus is known to punish those who veered out of his pleasure with lightning bolts.<p><a id="Role_and_epithets" name="Role_and_epithets"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Role and epithets</span></h3>
      <p>Zeus played a dominant role, presiding over the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Greek</a> Olympian pantheon. He fathered many of the heroes and heroines and was featured in many of their stories. Though the Homeric &quot;cloud collecter&quot; was the god of the sky and thunder like his Near-Eastern counterparts, he was also the supreme <a href="../../wp/c/Culture.htm" title="Culture">cultural</a> artifact; in some senses, he was the embodiment of Greek <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religious</a> beliefs and the <!--del_lnk--> archetypal Greek deity.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> epithets or titles applied to Zeus emphasized different aspects of his wide-ranging authority:<ul>
       <li><b>Olympios</b> emphasized Zeus&#39;s kingship over both the gods and the Panhellenic festival at <!--del_lnk--> Olympia.<li>A related title was <b>Panhellenios</b>, (&#39;Zeus of all the Hellenes&#39;) to whom <!--del_lnk--> Aeacus&#39; famous temple on <!--del_lnk--> Aegina was dedicated.<li>As <b>Xenios</b>, Zeus was the patron of hospitality and guests, ready to avenge any wrong done to a stranger.<li>As <b>Horkios</b>, he was the keeper of oaths. Liars who were exposed were made to dedicate a <a href="../../wp/s/Sculpture.htm" title="Sculpture">statue</a> to Zeus, often at the sanctuary of Olympia.<li>As <b>Agoraios</b>, Zeus watched over business at the <!--del_lnk--> agora, and punished dishonest traders.</ul>
      <p><a id="Panhellenic_cults_of_Zeus" name="Panhellenic_cults_of_Zeus"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Panhellenic cults of Zeus</span></h3>
      <p>The major center at which all Greeks converged to pay honour to their chief god was <!--del_lnk--> Olympia. The quadrennial festival there featured the famous Games. There was also an altar to Zeus made not of stone, but of ash - from the accumulated remains of many centuries&#39; worth of animals sacrificed there.<p>Outside of the major inter-<!--del_lnk--> polis sanctuaries, there were certain modes of worshipping Zeus that were shared across the Greek world. Most of the above titles, for instance, could be found at any number of <!--del_lnk--> Greek temples from <!--del_lnk--> Asia Minor to <!--del_lnk--> Sicily. Certain modes of ritual were held in common as well: sacrificing a white animal over a raised altar, for instance.<p>On the other hand, certain cities had Zeus-cults that operated in markedly different ways.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p><a id="Some_local_Zeus-cults" name="Some_local_Zeus-cults"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Some local Zeus-cults</span></h3>
      <p>In addition to the Panhellenic titles and conceptions listed above, local cults maintained their own idiosyncratic ideas about the king of gods and men. A few examples are listed below.<p><a id="Cretan_Zeus" name="Cretan_Zeus"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Cretan Zeus</span></h4>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> Crete, Zeus was worshipped at a number of caves at <!--del_lnk--> Knossos, <!--del_lnk--> Ida and <!--del_lnk--> Palaikastro. The stories of <!--del_lnk--> Minos and <!--del_lnk--> Epimenides suggest that these caves were once used for <!--del_lnk--> incubatory divination by kings and priests. The dramatic setting of <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a>&#39;s <i>Laws</i> is along the pilgrimage-route to one such site, emphasizing archaic Cretan knowledge. On Crete, Zeus was represented in art as a long-haired youth rather than a mature adult, and hymned as <i>ho megas kouros</i> &quot;the great youth&quot;. With the <!--del_lnk--> Kouretes, a band of ecstatic armed dancers, he presided over the rigorous military-athletic training and secret rites of the Cretan <!--del_lnk--> paideia.<p>The Hellenistic writer <!--del_lnk--> Euhemerus apparently proposed a theory that Zeus had actually been a great king of <!--del_lnk--> Crete and that posthumously his glory had slowly turned him into a deity. The works of Euhemerism have not survived, but Christian patristic writers took up the suggestion with enthusiasm.<p><a id="Zeus_Lykaios_in_Arcadia" name="Zeus_Lykaios_in_Arcadia"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Zeus Lykaios in Arcadia</span></h4>
      <p>The title <i>Lykaios</i> is morphologically connected to <i>lyke</i> &quot;brightness&quot;, and yet it <i>looks</i> a lot like <i>lykos</i> &quot;wolf&quot;. This semantic ambiguity is reflected in the strange cult of Zeus Lykaios in the backwoods of <!--del_lnk--> Arcadia, where the god takes on both lucent and lupine features. On the one hand, he presides over Mount Lykaion (&quot;the bright mountain&quot;) the tallest peak in Arcadia, and home to a precinct in which, allegedly, no shadows were ever cast (<!--del_lnk--> Pausanias 8.38). On the other hand, he is connected with <!--del_lnk--> Lycaon (&quot;the wolf-man&quot;) whose ancient cannibalism was commemorated with bizarre, recurring rites. According to <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a> (<i>Republic</i> 565d-e), a particular clan would gather on the mountain to make a sacrifice every eight years to Zeus Lykaios, and a single morsel of human entrails would be intermingled with the animal&#39;s. Whoever ate the human flesh was said to turn into a wolf, and could only regain human form if he did not eat again of human flesh until the next eight-year cycle had ended.<p><a id="Subterranean_Zeus" name="Subterranean_Zeus"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Subterranean Zeus</span></h4>
      <p>Although etymology indicates that Zeus was originally a sky god, many Greek cities honored a local Zeus, who lived underground. Athenians and Sicilians honored Zeus <i>Meilichios</i> (&quot;kindly&quot; or &quot;honeyed&quot;) while other cities had Zeus <i>Chthonios</i> (&quot;earthy&quot;), <i>Katachthonios</i> (&quot;under-the-earth) and <i>Plousios</i> (&quot;wealth-bringing&quot;). These deities might be represented indifferently as snakes or men in visual art. They also received offerings of black animal victims sacrificed into sunken pits, as did <!--del_lnk--> chthonic deities like <!--del_lnk--> Persephone and <!--del_lnk--> Demeter, and also the <!--del_lnk--> heroes at their tombs. Olympian gods, by contrast, usually received white victims sacrificed upon raised altars.<p>In some cases, cities were not entirely sure whether the <i>daimon</i> to whom they sacrificed was a hero or an underground Zeus. Thus the shrine at Lebadaea in <!--del_lnk--> Boeotia might belong to the hero <!--del_lnk--> Trophonius or to Zeus <i>Trephonius</i> (&quot;the nurturing&quot;), depending on whether you believe <!--del_lnk--> Pausanias or <!--del_lnk--> Strabo. The hero <!--del_lnk--> Amphiaraus was honored as <i>Zeus Amphiaraus</i> at Oropus outside of <!--del_lnk--> Thebes, and the Spartans even had a shrine to <i>Zeus <a href="../../wp/a/Agamemnon.htm" title="Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a></i>.<p><a id="Oracles_of_Zeus" name="Oracles_of_Zeus"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Oracles of Zeus</span></h3>
      <p>Although most oracle sites were usually dedicated to <a href="../../wp/a/Apollo.htm" title="Apollo">Apollo</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> heroes, or various <!--del_lnk--> goddesses like <!--del_lnk--> Themis, a few oracular sites were dedicated to Zeus.<p><a id="The_Oracle_at_Dodona" name="The_Oracle_at_Dodona"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The Oracle at Dodona</span></h4>
      <p>The cult of Zeus at <!--del_lnk--> Dodona in <!--del_lnk--> Epirus, where there is evidence of religious activity from the <!--del_lnk--> 2nd millennium BC onward, centered around a sacred oak. When the <a href="../../wp/o/Odyssey.htm" title="Odyssey">Odyssey</a> was composed (circa <!--del_lnk--> 750 BC), divination was done there by barefoot priests called <i>Selloi</i>, who lay on the ground and observed the rustling of the leaves and branches (<i>Odyssey</i> 14.326-7). By the time <a href="../../wp/h/Herodotus.htm" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> wrote about Dodona, female priestesses called <!--del_lnk--> peleiades (&quot;doves&quot;) had replaced the male priests.<p>Zeus&#39; consort at Dodona was not <!--del_lnk--> Hera, but the goddess <!--del_lnk--> Dione &mdash; whose name is a feminine form of &quot;Zeus&quot;. Her status as a <!--del_lnk--> titaness suggests to some that she may have been a more powerful pre-Hellenic deity, and perhaps the original occupant of the oracle.<p><a id="The_Oracle_at_Siwa" name="The_Oracle_at_Siwa"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The Oracle at Siwa</span></h4>
      <p>The oracle of <!--del_lnk--> Ammon at the <!--del_lnk--> oasis of Siwa in the Western Desert of <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> did not lie within the bounds of the Greek world before <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander</a>&#39;s day, but it already loomed large in the Greek mind during the archaic era: <a href="../../wp/h/Herodotus.htm" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> mentions consultations with Zeus Ammon in his account of the <!--del_lnk--> Persian War. Zeus Ammon was especially favored at <!--del_lnk--> Sparta, where a temple to him existed by the time of the <!--del_lnk--> Peloponnesian War (Pausanias 3.18).<p>After Alexander made a trek into the desert to consult the oracle at Siwa, the figure arose of a <!--del_lnk--> Libyan Sibyl.<p><a id="Other_oracles_of_Zeus" name="Other_oracles_of_Zeus"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Other oracles of Zeus</span></h4>
      <p>The chthonic Zeuses (or heroes) <!--del_lnk--> Trophonius and <!--del_lnk--> Amphiaraus were both said to give oracles at the cult-sites.<p><a id="Zeus_and_foreign_gods" name="Zeus_and_foreign_gods"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Zeus and foreign gods</span></h3>
      <p>Zeus was equivalent to the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_mythology.htm" title="Roman mythology">Roman</a> god <!--del_lnk--> Jupiter and associated in the syncretic classical imagination (see <i><!--del_lnk--> interpretatio graeca</i>) with various other deities, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Egyptian <!--del_lnk--> Ammon and the <!--del_lnk--> Etruscan <!--del_lnk--> Tinia. He (along with <!--del_lnk--> Dionysus) absorbed the role of the chief <!--del_lnk--> Phrygian god <!--del_lnk--> Sabazios in the <!--del_lnk--> syncretic deity known in Rome as <!--del_lnk--> Sabazius.<p><a id="Zeus_in_myth" name="Zeus_in_myth"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Zeus in myth</span></h2>

      <p>Cronus sired several children by Rhea: Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, and Poseidon, but swallowed them all as soon as they were born, since he had learned from Gaia and Uranus that he was destined to be overcome by his own son as he had overthrown his own father&mdash; an oracle that Zeus was to hear and avert. But when Zeus was about to be born, Rhea sought Gaia to devise a plan to save him, so that Cronus would get his retribution for his acts against Uranus and his own children. Rhea gave birth to Zeus in Crete, handing Cronus a rock wrapped in swaddling clothes, which he promptly swallowed. His mother hid Zeus in a basket under a tree and was raised by a shepherd family under the promise that their sheep would be saved from wolves.<p><a id="Childhood" name="Childhood"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Childhood</span></h3>
      <p>Rhea hid Zeus in a cave on <!--del_lnk--> Mount Ida in Crete. According to varying versions of the story:<ol>
       <li>He was then raised by <!--del_lnk--> Gaia.<li>He was raised by a <a href="../../wp/d/Domestic_goat.htm" title="Goat">goat</a> named <!--del_lnk--> Amalthea, while a company of <!--del_lnk--> Kouretes&mdash; soldiers, or smaller gods&mdash; danced, shouted and clashed their spears against their shields so that Cronus would not hear the baby&#39;s cry. (See <!--del_lnk--> cornucopia.)<li>He was raised by a <!--del_lnk--> nymph named <!--del_lnk--> Adamanthea. Since Cronus ruled over the <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> heavens and the <a href="../../wp/s/Sea.htm" title="Sea">sea</a>, she hid him by dangling him on a <!--del_lnk--> rope from a <a href="../../wp/t/Tree.htm" title="Tree">tree</a> so he was suspended between earth, sea and sky and thus, invisible to his father.<li>He was raised by a <!--del_lnk--> nymph named <!--del_lnk--> Cynosura. In gratitude, Zeus <!--del_lnk--> placed her among the stars.<li>He was raised by <!--del_lnk--> Melissa, who nursed him with <a href="../../wp/d/Domestic_goat.htm" title="Goat">goats</a>-milk</ol>
      <p><a id="Zeus_becomes_king_of_the_gods" name="Zeus_becomes_king_of_the_gods"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Zeus becomes king of the gods</span></h3>
      <p>After reaching manhood, Zeus forced Cronus to disgorge first the stone (which was set down at <!--del_lnk--> Pytho under the glens of <!--del_lnk--> Parnassus to be a sign to mortal men, the <!--del_lnk--> Omphalos) then his siblings in reverse order of swallowing. In some versions, <!--del_lnk--> Metis gave Cronus an <!--del_lnk--> emetic to force him to disgorge the babies, or Zeus cut Cronus&#39; <!--del_lnk--> stomach open. Then Zeus released the brothers of Cronus, the <!--del_lnk--> Gigantes, the <!--del_lnk--> Hecatonchires and the <!--del_lnk--> Cyclopes, from their dungeon in <!--del_lnk--> Tartarus (The <!--del_lnk--> Titans; he killed their guard, <!--del_lnk--> Campe. As gratitude, the Cyclopes gave him <!--del_lnk--> thunder and the thunderbolt, or <!--del_lnk--> lightning, which had previously been hidden by Gaia.) Together, Zeus and his brothers and sisters, along with the Gigantes, Hecatonchires and Cyclopes overthrew Cronus and the other Titans, in the combat called the <!--del_lnk--> Titanomachy. The defeated Titans were then cast into a shadowy underworld region known as Tartarus. Atlas, one of the titans that fought against Zeus, was punished by having to hold up the sky.<p>After the battle with the Titans, Zeus shared the world with his elder brothers, <!--del_lnk--> Poseidon and <!--del_lnk--> Hades, by drawing lots: Zeus got the sky and air, Poseidon the waters, and Hades the world of the dead (the underworld). The ancient Earth, <!--del_lnk--> Gaia, could not be claimed; she was left to all three, each according to their capabilities, which explains why Poseidon was the &quot;earth-shaker&quot; (the god of earthquakes) and Hades claimed the humans that died. (See also: <!--del_lnk--> Penthus)<p>Gaia resented the way Zeus had treated the Titans, because they were her children. Soon after taking the throne as king of the gods, Zeus had to fight some of Gaia&#39;s other children, the <!--del_lnk--> monsters <!--del_lnk--> Typhon and <!--del_lnk--> Echidna. He vanquished Typhon and trapped him under a mountain, but left Echidna and her children alive as challenges for future <!--del_lnk--> heroes.<p><a id="Zeus_and_Hera" name="Zeus_and_Hera"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Zeus and Hera</span></h3>
      <p>Zeus was brother and consort of <!--del_lnk--> Hera. By Hera, Zeus sired <!--del_lnk--> Ares, <!--del_lnk--> Hebe and <!--del_lnk--> Hephaestus, though some accounts say that Hera produced these offspring alone. Some also include <!--del_lnk--> Eileithyia as their daughter. The conquests of Zeus among <!--del_lnk--> nymphs and the mythic mortal progenitors of <!--del_lnk--> Hellenic dynasties are famous. Olympian mythography even credits him with unions with <!--del_lnk--> Demeter, <!--del_lnk--> Latona, <!--del_lnk--> Dione and <!--del_lnk--> Maia.<p>Among the mortals: <!--del_lnk--> Semele, <!--del_lnk--> Io, <!--del_lnk--> Europa and <!--del_lnk--> Leda. (For more details, see below).<p>Many myths renders Hera as jealous of his amorous conquests and a consistent enemy of Zeus&#39; mistresses and their children by him. For a time, a <!--del_lnk--> nymph named <!--del_lnk--> Echo had the job of distracting Hera from his affairs by incessantly talking: when Hera discovered the deception, she cursed Echo to repeat the words of others.<p><a id="Consorts_and_children" name="Consorts_and_children"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Consorts and children</span></h3>

He was also the protector of strangers and travelers against those who might seek to victimize them.<li>Zeus turned <!--del_lnk--> Pandareus to stone for stealing the golden <a href="../../wp/d/Dog.htm" title="Dog">dog</a> which had guarded him as an infant in the holy Dictaeon Cave of <!--del_lnk--> Crete.<li>Zeus killed <!--del_lnk--> Salmoneus with a thunderbolt for attempting to impersonate him, riding around in a <!--del_lnk--> bronze <!--del_lnk--> chariot and loudly imitating <!--del_lnk--> thunder.<li>Zeus turned <!--del_lnk--> Periphas into an <a href="../../wp/e/Eagle.htm" title="Eagle">eagle</a> after his <!--del_lnk--> death, as a reward for being righteous and just.<li>At the marriage of Zeus and Hera, a nymph named <!--del_lnk--> Chelone refused to attend. Zeus transformed her into a tortoise (chelone in Greek).<li>Zeus, with Hera, turned King <!--del_lnk--> Haemus and <!--del_lnk--> Queen Rhodope into <!--del_lnk--> mountains (the <!--del_lnk--> Balkan mountains, or Stara Planina, and <!--del_lnk--> Rhodope mountains, respectively) for their vanity.<li>Zeus condemned <!--del_lnk--> Tantalus to eternal torture in Tartarus for trying to trick the gods into eating the flesh of his butchered son.<li>Zeus condemned <!--del_lnk--> Sisyphus be tied to a fiery wheel for eternity as punishment for attempting to violate Hera.<li>Zeus sunk the <!--del_lnk--> Telchines beneath the sea for blighting the earth with their fell magics.<li>Zeus blinded the seer <!--del_lnk--> Phineus and sent the <!--del_lnk--> Harpies to plague him as punishment for revealing the secrets of the gods.<li>Zeus rewarded <!--del_lnk--> Tiresias with a life three times the norm as reward for ruling in his favour when he and Hera contested which of the sexes gained the most pleasure from the act of love.<li>Zeus punished <!--del_lnk--> Hera by having her hung upside down from the sky when she attempted to drown Heracles in a storm.<li>Of all the many, many children Zeus spawned, <!--del_lnk--> Hercules was often described as his favorite. Indeed, Hercules was often called by various gods and people as &quot;the favorite son of Zeus&quot;(where Hercules resents both the title and his father for much of the shows run), Zeus and Hercules were very close and in one story, where a tribe of earth-born Giants threatened Olympus and the Oracle at Delphi decreed that only the combined efforts of a lone god and mortal could stop the creature, Zeus chose Hercules to fight by his side. They proceeded to defeat the monsters.<li>His sacred bird was the golden eagle, which he kept by his side at all times. Like him, the eagle was a symbol of strength, courage, and justice.<li>His favourite tree was the oak, symbol of strength. Olive trees were also sacred to him.<li><!--del_lnk--> Zelus, <!--del_lnk--> Nike, <!--del_lnk--> Cratos and <!--del_lnk--> Bia were Zeus&#39; <!--del_lnk--> retinue.</ul>
