      <p>This is the first spaceflight for both taikonauts. The crew was introduced to the Chinese populace and international media about five hours before the launch. Ni&egrave; H&#x1CE;ish&egrave;ng celebrated his 41st birthday in space.<p><!--del_lnk--> Huang Chunping, the chief designer of the Long March 2F rocket, was quoted in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Beijing Times</i> as saying the astronauts who would fly the mission were selected from a pool of three pairs. Five pairs of astronauts trained for the flight and about one month before launch the two pairs with the lowest performance were dropped. The <i><!--del_lnk--> Ta Kung Pao</i> newspaper had reported that Zhai Zhigang and Nie Haisheng were the leading pair, after having been in the final group of three for <i><!--del_lnk--> Shenzhou 5</i>.<p><a id="Mission_highlights" name="Mission_highlights"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Mission highlights</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Launch" name="Launch"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Launch</span></h3>
      <p>The taikonauts arrived at the spacecraft about 2 hours and 45 minutes before the launch and the hatch closed 30 minutes after their arrival. At 01:00:03.583 UTC on <!--del_lnk--> October 12 <i>Shenzhou 6</i> lifted off from the launch pad at <!--del_lnk--> Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre. The launch phase was reported to be normal with the escape rocket separating 120 seconds after launch when the rocket was travelling 1,300 m/s (4300 ft/s). Sixteen seconds later the four booster rockets separating at an altitude of 52 km (32 miles). The payload fairing and first stage detached 200 seconds after launch. The second stage burned for a further 383 seconds and the spacecraft separated from the rocket 200 km (124 miles) above the <!--del_lnk--> Yellow Sea. The spacecraft then used its own propulsion system to place it into a 211 km by 345 km (131 by 214 statute miles) orbit, with an <!--del_lnk--> inclination of 42.4 degrees, about 21 minutes after launch. At 01:39 UTC <!--del_lnk--> Chen Bingde, the Chief Commander of the <!--del_lnk--> Chinese space program, announced the launch was successful. The crew ate their first meal in space at 03:11 UTC.<p>Before the flight, the launch time had been the object of speculation by the Chinese media. For several months before the planned launch its time was only given as mid-October, or even late-September. Then on <!--del_lnk--> 23 September it was reported by the <a href="../../wp/h/Hong_Kong.htm" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>-based <!--del_lnk--> news agency <i><!--del_lnk--> China News Service</i> that the launch was tentatively scheduled for 03:00 UTC on <!--del_lnk--> 13 October. This launch time was confirmed two weeks later by <!--del_lnk--> Jiang Jingshan, a member of the <!--del_lnk--> Chinese Academy of Engineering. But then on <!--del_lnk--> 10 October an official from the technical department of the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre said the launch was then scheduled for 01:00 UTC on <!--del_lnk--> 12 October. This new launch time could have been designed to dodge the cold weather which had been forecast to hit the area. Assembly of the rocket was reported complete on <!--del_lnk--> 26 September. On <!--del_lnk--> 4 October, the <i>Shenzhou 6</i> spacecraft was attached to the <!--del_lnk--> CZ-2F rocket, also known as <i>Shenjian</i>.<p>Unlike the unmanned Shenzhou flights, <i><!--del_lnk--> Shenzhou 5</i> and <i>6</i> were launched during daylight hours to provide greater safety in case of abort. The launch was televised live with <!--del_lnk--> China Central Television selling advertising for <a href="../../wp/r/Renminbi.htm" title="Renminbi">RMB&yen;</a>2.56 million (<a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">US$</a>316,000) for five seconds, to RMB&yen;8.56 million (US$1 million) for 30 seconds. A video camera had been added to the rocket and images of it were broadcast during the ascent and the separation of the Shenzhou spacecraft.<p>Shortly after launch, recovery crews began searching a region from the <!--del_lnk--> Badain Jaran Desert in <!--del_lnk--> Inner Mongolia to <!--del_lnk--> Shaanxi for the launch escape tower, booster rockets, first stage and payload fairing. Of particular interest was the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> black box&quot; of the rocket, which contained <!--del_lnk--> telemetry that may not have been downlinked during the launch phase. It was found 45 minutes after launch somewhere near <!--del_lnk--> Otog Banner. It was first sighted by a herdswoman, Lian Hua, about 1.5 km from her home. Other wreckage from the launch was found and destroyed at its impact location or brought back to Jiuquan.<p><!--del_lnk--> President <!--del_lnk--> Hu Jintao was present at the <!--del_lnk--> Beijing Aerospace Control Centre to watch the launch. <!--del_lnk--> Premier <!--del_lnk--> Wen Jiabao was present at the <!--del_lnk--> Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre.<p><a id="Five_days_in_orbit" name="Five_days_in_orbit"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Five days in orbit</span></h3>
      <p>The first of several orbit changing maneuvers happened as planned at 07:54:45, with a 63 second burn to circularize the orbit. Based on <!--del_lnk--> United States Space Command <!--del_lnk--> orbital elements, it is in a 332 by 336 km (206 by 209 statute miles) orbit. After about an hour and a half, the hatch between the re-entry and orbital modules was opened and, for the first time, crew were able to enter the second living compartment of the Shenzhou spacecraft. F&egrave;i J&ugrave;nl&oacute;ng was the first to enter, while Ni&egrave; H&#x1CE;ish&egrave;ng remained in the reentry module. They would swap positions about three hours later.<p>At 13:32 UTC, Ni&egrave; and F&egrave;i had a seven minute conversation with their wives and children who were in Mission Control. Ni&egrave;&#39;s daughter sang &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Happy Birthday to You&quot;, as his birthday is <!--del_lnk--> 13 October.<p>The activities of the crew were not fully revealed by the Chinese. Only vague references to experiments were made, though some were made public. One experiment involved the crew testing the reaction of the spacecraft to movement within the orbital and reentry modules. They moved between the modules, opening and closing the hatches and operating equipment with &quot;more strength&quot; than normally required.<p>A second orbital maneuver occurred at 21:56 on <!--del_lnk--> October 13. It raised the orbit that had been lowered due to <!--del_lnk--> atmospheric drag, and lasted 6.5 seconds.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> October 15, Ni&egrave; and F&egrave;i had a two minute conversation with <!--del_lnk--> President <!--del_lnk--> Hu Jintao, beginning at 08:29. During the conversation, Hu told them &quot;The motherland and people are proud of you. I hope you will successfully complete your task by carrying out the mission calmly and carefully and have a triumphant return&quot;.<p><a id="Re-entry_and_landing" name="Re-entry_and_landing"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Re-entry and landing</span></h3>
      <p>The re-entry process began at 19:44 on <!--del_lnk--> October 16 when the orbital module separated as planned from the rest of the spacecraft. Unlike with the <!--del_lnk--> Soyuz spacecraft, this is done before the re-entry burn, allowing the orbital module to stay in orbit for extended months-long missions or to act as a docking target for later flights. The orbital module fired its engines twice on <!--del_lnk--> 19 October to give it a circular orbit with a height of 355 km (220 miles).<p>One minute after this separation, the engines on the service module ignited over the coast of <!--del_lnk--> West Africa to slow the spacecraft. At 20:07, the re-entry module separated and five minutes later the re-entry proper began, as the Shenzhou capsule entered the top of the atmosphere, over China. The <!--del_lnk--> communications blackout that occurs during re-entry started at 20:16 and two minutes later radio communication was regained with the spacecraft. The main parachute opened and the capsule began to slowly descend to a landing on the Inner Mongolia northern grasslands at 4:33 a.m. local time (20:33 UTC). The capsule landed approximately 1 km (about 1000 yards) from its planned target.<p>About half an hour after landing the recovery forces had the hatch of the spacecraft open and first F&egrave;i and then Ni&egrave; emerged. Hou Ying, chief designer of the landing site system, said the recovery was improved over that of <i>Shenzhou 5</i>. After medical check-ups and a light meal the astronauts were put on a special plane bound for <a href="../../wp/b/Beijing.htm" title="Beijing">Beijing</a>, where they were placed into medical isolation for the following two weeks. At 21:46, <!--del_lnk--> Chen Bingde had declared the entire mission to be a success. The capsule was returned to <a href="../../wp/b/Beijing.htm" title="Beijing">Beijing</a> by train and handed over to <!--del_lnk--> China Research Institute of Space Technology at <!--del_lnk--> Changping railway station.<p>The orbital module continued to orbit the Earth, gathering more information from experiments onboard. The module also gave Chinese mission controllers experience at long-duration spaceflights. After 2,920 orbits of the Earth, its active mission ended on <!--del_lnk--> April 15, <!--del_lnk--> 2006. It is currently still in orbit, and will reenter when its orbit sufficiently decays.<p>There were two planned landing sites for the mission. The primary site was the <!--del_lnk--> banner of <!--del_lnk--> Siziwang in <!--del_lnk--> Inner Mongolia. The secondary site was at the Jiuquan launch site. In addition, there were recovery forces at <!--del_lnk--> Yinchuan, <!--del_lnk--> Yulin and <!--del_lnk--> Handan. It is also possible for the Shenzhou spacecraft to <!--del_lnk--> splashdown in the ocean should the need arise, with further recovery crews in the <!--del_lnk--> Yellow Sea, the <!--del_lnk--> East China Sea and the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>.<p>Some Chinese diplomats are trained and equipped for any emergency landing at sites that are not on Chinese territory. <!--del_lnk--> Zhang Shuting, chief designer of the emergency and rescue system, has said that emergency landing sites have been identified in <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Southwest Asia, <a href="../../wp/n/North_Africa.htm" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Western Europe, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a>. The diplomatic mission nearest to the landing site will be given the task to head any rescue mission if necessary. The Chinese government had advised <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a> that emergency landing sites have been identified in <!--del_lnk--> New South Wales, <!--del_lnk--> Queensland, the <!--del_lnk--> Northern Territory and <!--del_lnk--> Western Australia. <!--del_lnk--> Emergency Management Australia, the <!--del_lnk--> Australian government agency that co-ordinates the response to major contingencies, has said they are ready to deal with any emergencies that arise during spaceflights. However, the return module is designed to allow access from the outside only to those with a special key. A copy of this key has not been made available to Australian officials, but it was reported that an unnamed Chinese <!--del_lnk--> military attach&eacute; at the Chinese embassy in <a href="../../wp/c/Canberra.htm" title="Canberra">Canberra</a> had one.<p><a id="Upgrades" name="Upgrades"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Upgrades</span></h2>
      <p>The Chinese space officials have said that the Long March 2F rocket featured a &quot;fire security system&quot; on the escape tower. Speculation on what this means ranges from better fail-safes to stop accidental firings, to the addition of a <!--del_lnk--> fire extinguisher. The <i><!--del_lnk--> Wen Wei Po</i> newspaper have reported that the rocket appeared the same as that used for <i>Shenzhou 5</i> except that a &quot;transition segment&quot; was visible at the top of the <i>Shenzhou 6</i> stack, attached to one end of the orbital module.<p>China Aerospace Science and Technology, the major manufacturer of both the Shenzhou spacecraft and the Long March rocket have said that although the flight featured a second astronaut and was much longer than <i>Shenzhou 5</i>, the rocket and spacecraft did not weigh much more due to optimisation of its systems. Only 200 kg (about 440 lb) more was needed for the second astronaut. Among the amenities on board for the crew was hot food, sleeping bags and essential sanitary equipment. The sleeping bag was hooked to a wall of the orbital module and the crew had alternating sleep periods. The <!--del_lnk--> shock absorbers in the crew seats were redesigned so as to provide more safety to the crew in case the braking rockets fail to fire just before touchdown. The flight telemetry recorder on the spacecraft had its memory increased to about 1 <!--del_lnk--> gigabyte, and the <!--del_lnk--> read/write speed was now 10 times as fast as the computers carried on previous flights. It was also about half the size of that carried on <i>Shenzhou 5</i>. Overall, 95% of the Shenzhou 6 space capsule is indigenously designed/produced in China, the highest rate in comparison to the previous ones.<p>The menu included <!--del_lnk--> pineapple-filled <!--del_lnk--> mooncakes, <!--del_lnk--> green vegetables, <!--del_lnk--> braised <!--del_lnk--> bamboo shoots, <a href="../../wp/r/Rice.htm" title="Rice">rice</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> bean congee. In total there was 40 kg (about 88 lb) of food on board. A somewhat strange aspect of the mission reported in the Chinese press was the fixation on the purity of drinking water for the astronauts, where it was claimed that their water reportedly comes from a mine 1.7 km (1.1 miles) underground and was disinfected with an <!--del_lnk--> electrolytic <a href="../../wp/s/Silver.htm" title="Silver">silver</a> solution. It has thus been said by the press that they are drinking the &quot;purest water in China&quot;. Since it is commonly known that water produced by a process of <!--del_lnk--> reverse osmosis and <!--del_lnk--> deionization would produce water of a far higher purity than any naturally found underground, it is possible that the use of water specifially from one of China&#39;s deepest mines may have been used to carry a symbolic meaning to the mission.<p>It had been reported that, on <i>Shenzhou 5</i>, astronaut <!--del_lnk--> Yang Liwei suffered from a &quot;minor heartache&quot; after his launch. It is thought that this refers to <!--del_lnk--> space adaptation syndrome experienced by about one third of astronauts during the first few days of a spaceflight. The <i><!--del_lnk--> People&#39;s Daily</i> said that the interior design of the spacecraft has been changed to hopefully lessen the likelihood of <!--del_lnk--> nausea and other symptoms.<p><a id="Experiments" name="Experiments"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Experiments</span></h2>
      <p>It was announced in <!--del_lnk--> July 2005 that <i>Shenzhou 6</i> would carry one experiment involving the <!--del_lnk--> sperm of <a href="../../wp/p/Pig.htm" title="Pig">pigs</a> from Rongchang County, <!--del_lnk--> Chongqing. But on <!--del_lnk--> October 11 it was revealed by Liu Luxiang, director of the Centre for Space Breeding at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, that there were no plans for animal or plant seeds on the flight. He said the focus of <i>Shenzhou 6</i> was the physical reactions of the crew to the space environment.<p>Morris Jones who writes for SpaceDaily.com has speculated that the lack of any other announced experiments suggested that the mission could be oriented more toward the military. The crew could have operated a large surveillance film camera, supplementing the unmanned recoverable satellite program.<p><a id="Tracking" name="Tracking"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Tracking</span></h2>

      <p>There are 20 land-based tracking stations in the Chinese space telemetry network. These are supplemented by four <i><!--del_lnk--> Yuanwang</i>-series tracking ships. The <!--del_lnk--> Beijing Aerospace Command global map showed their positions to be:<ul>
