      <p>The islands of <strong class="selflink">S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Pr&iacute;ncipe</strong> were uninhabited before the arrival of the <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> sometime between <!--del_lnk--> 1469 and <!--del_lnk--> 1471. Over these three years, Portuguese navigators explored the islands and decided that it would be a good location for bases to trade with the mainland.<p>The first successful settlement of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; was established in <!--del_lnk--> 1493 by <!--del_lnk--> &Aacute;lvaro Caminha, who received the land as a grant from the crown. Pr&iacute;ncipe was settled in 1500 under a similar arrangement. Attracting settlers proved difficult, however, and most of the earliest inhabitants were &quot;undesirables&quot; sent from Portugal, mostly <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jew">Jews</a>. In time these settlers found the excellent volcanic soil of the region suitable for agriculture, especially the growing of <a href="../../wp/s/Sugar.htm" title="Sugar">sugar</a>.<p>The cultivation of sugar was a labour intensive process and the Portuguese began to import large numbers of <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slaves</a> from the mainland. By the mid-1500s the Portuguese settlers had turned the islands into Africa&#39;s foremost exporter of <a href="../../wp/s/Sugar.htm" title="Sugar">sugar</a>. S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Pr&iacute;ncipe were taken over and administered by the Portuguese crown in <!--del_lnk--> 1522 and <!--del_lnk--> 1573, respectively.<p>However, superior sugar colonies in the <!--del_lnk--> western hemisphere began to hurt the islands. The large slave population also proved difficult to control with Portugal unable to invest many resources in the effort. Sugar cultivation thus declined over the next 100 years, and by the mid-1600s, the economy of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; had changed. It was now primarily a transit point for ships engaged in the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_slave_trade.htm" title="Atlantic slave trade">slave trade</a> between the West and continental Africa.<p>In the early 1800s, two new cash crops, <a href="../../wp/c/Coffee.htm" title="Coffee">coffee</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Cocoa.htm" title="Cocoa">cocoa</a>, were introduced. The rich volcanic soils proved well suited to the new cash crop industry, and soon extensive plantations (<!--del_lnk--> ro&ccedil;as), owned by Portuguese companies or absentee landlords, occupied almost all of the good farmland. By <!--del_lnk--> 1908, S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; had become the world&#39;s largest producer of <a href="../../wp/c/Cocoa.htm" title="Cocoa">cocoa</a>, which still is the country&#39;s most important crop.<p>The ro&ccedil;as system, which gave the plantation managers a high degree of authority, led to abuses against the <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">African</a> farm workers. Although <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portugal</a> officially abolished slavery in <!--del_lnk--> 1876, the practice of forced paid labor continued. In the early 1900s, an internationally publicized controversy arose over charges that <a href="../../wp/a/Angola.htm" title="Angola">Angolan</a> contract workers were being subjected to forced labor and unsatisfactory working conditions. Sporadic labor unrest and dissatisfaction continued well into the <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a>, culminating in an outbreak of riots in <!--del_lnk--> 1953 in which several hundred African laborers were killed in a clash with their Portuguese rulers. This &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Batep&aacute; Massacre&quot; remains a major event in the colonial history of the islands, and its anniversary is officially observed by the government.<p>By the late <!--del_lnk--> 1950s, when other emerging nations across the African Continent were demanding independence, a small group of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;ans had formed the <!--del_lnk--> Movement for the Liberation of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Pr&iacute;ncipe (MLSTP), which eventually established its base in nearby Gabon. Picking up momentum in the <!--del_lnk--> 1960s, events moved quickly after the overthrow of the Caetano dictatorship in Portugal in April <!--del_lnk--> 1974. The new Portuguese regime was committed to the dissolution of its overseas colonies; in November <!--del_lnk--> 1974, their representatives met with the MLSTP in Algiers and worked out an agreement for the transfer of sovereignty. After a period of transitional government, S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Pr&iacute;ncipe achieved independence on <!--del_lnk--> July 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1975, choosing as its first president the MLSTP Secretary General <!--del_lnk--> Manuel Pinto da Costa.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1990, S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; became one of the first African countries to embrace <!--del_lnk--> democratic reform and changes to the constitution &mdash; the legalization of opposition political parties &mdash; led to elections in <!--del_lnk--> 1991 that were nonviolent, free, and transparent. <!--del_lnk--> Miguel Trovoada, a former prime minister who had been in exile since <!--del_lnk--> 1986, returned as an independent candidate and was elected president. Trovoada was re-elected in S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;&#39;s second multiparty presidential election in <!--del_lnk--> 1996. The <!--del_lnk--> Party of Democratic Convergence (PCD) toppled the MLSTP to take a majority of seats in the <!--del_lnk--> National Assembly, with the MLSTP becoming an important and vocal minority party. Municipal elections followed in late <!--del_lnk--> 1992, in which the MLSTP came back to win a majority of seats on five of seven regional councils. In early legislative elections in October <!--del_lnk--> 1994, the MLSTP won a plurality of seats in the Assembly. It regained an outright majority of seats in the November <!--del_lnk--> 1998 elections. The Government of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; fully functions under a multiparty system. Presidential elections were held in July <!--del_lnk--> 2001. The candidate backed by the <!--del_lnk--> Independent Democratic Action party, <!--del_lnk--> Fradique de Menezes, was elected in the first round and inaugurated on September 3. Parliamentary elections were held in March <!--del_lnk--> 2002. For the next four years, a series of short-lived, opposition-led governments were formed.<p>The army seized power for one week in July 2003, complaining of corruption and that forthcoming oil revenues would not be divided fairly. An accord was negotiated under which President de Menezes was returned to office.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> cohabitation period ended in March <!--del_lnk--> 2006, when a pro-presidential coalition won enough seats in National Assembly elections to form and head a new government.<p>In the 30 July 2006 presidential election, Fradique de Menezes easily won a second five-year term in office, defeating two other candidates <!--del_lnk--> Patrice Trovoada (son of former President Miguel Trovoada) and independent <!--del_lnk--> Nilo Guimar&atilde;es. Local elections, the first since 1992, took place on 27 August 2006 and were dominated by members of the ruling coalition.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>

      <p>The islands of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Pr&iacute;ncipe, situated in the equatorial Atlantic about 300 and 250&nbsp;kilometers (200 and 150&nbsp;miles), respectively, off the northwest coast of Gabon, constitute Africa&#39;s smallest country. Both are part of an extinct volcanic mountain range, which also includes the islands of <!--del_lnk--> Annob&oacute;n to the southwest and <!--del_lnk--> Bioko to the northeast, both part of <a href="../../wp/e/Equatorial_Guinea.htm" title="Equatorial Guinea">Equatorial Guinea</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Mount Cameroon on the African west coast. S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; is 50&nbsp;kilometers (31&nbsp;miles) long and 32&nbsp;kilometers (20&nbsp;miles) wide and the more mountainous of the two islands. Its peaks reach 2,024&nbsp;meters (6,640&nbsp;feet). Pr&iacute;ncipe is about 30&nbsp;kilometers (19&nbsp;miles) long and 6&nbsp;kilometers (4&nbsp;miles) wide. Swift streams radiating down the mountains through lush forest and cropland to the sea cross both islands.<p>At sea level, the climate is tropical&mdash;hot and humid with average yearly temperatures of about 27&deg;C (80&deg;F) and little daily variation. At the interior&#39;s higher altitudes, the average yearly temperature is 20&deg;C (68&deg;F), and nights are generally cool. Annual rainfall varies from 5&nbsp;m (200&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> inches) on the southwestern slopes to 1&nbsp;m (40&nbsp;in) in the northern lowlands. The rainy season runs from October to May.<ul>
       <li>The island of <!--del_lnk--> S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; is 32 by 48&nbsp;kilometers (20 by 30&nbsp;miles) in size and the more mountainous of the two islands. The capital, also named <a href="../../wp/s/S%25C3%25A3o_Tom%25C3%25A9.htm" title="S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;">S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;</a>, lies on this island.<li>The island of <!--del_lnk--> Pr&iacute;ncipe is 6 by 16&nbsp;kilometers (4 by 10&nbsp;miles) in size.</ul>
      <p>The equator lies immediately south of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; Island, passing through or near the islet named <!--del_lnk--> Ilh&eacute;u das Rolas.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>

      <p>Since the 1800s, the economy of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Pr&iacute;ncipe has been based on plantation agriculture. At the time of independence, Portuguese-owned plantations occupied 90% of the cultivated area. After independence, control of these plantations passed to various state-owned agricultural enterprises, which have since been privatized. The dominant crop on S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; is cocoa, representing about 95% of exports. Other export crops include copra, palm kernels, and coffee.<p>Domestic food-crop production is inadequate to meet local consumption, so the country imports some of its food. Efforts have been made by the government in recent years to expand food production, and several projects have been undertaken, largely financed by foreign donors.<p>Other than agriculture, the main economic activities are fishing and a small industrial sector engaged in processing local agricultural products and producing a few basic consumer goods. The scenic islands have potential for tourism, and the government is attempting to improve its rudimentary tourist industry infrastructure. The government sector accounts for about 11% of employment.<p>Following independence, the country had a centrally directed economy with most means of production owned and controlled by the state. The original constitution guaranteed a &ldquo;mixed economy,&rdquo; with privately owned cooperatives combined with publicly owned property and means of production. In the 1980s and 1990s, the economy of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; encountered major difficulties. Economic growth stagnated, and cocoa exports dropped in both value and volume, creating large balance-of-payments deficits. Efforts to redistribute plantation land resulted in decreased cocoa production. At the same time, the international price of cocoa slumped.<p>In response to its economic downturn, the government undertook a series of far-reaching economic reforms. In 1987, the government implemented an International Monetary Fund (IMF) structural adjustment program, and invited greater private participation in management of the parastatals, as well as in the agricultural, commercial, banking, and tourism sectors. The focus of economic reform since the early 1990s has been widespread privatization, especially of the state-run agricultural and industrial sectors.<p>The S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;an Government has traditionally obtained foreign assistance from various donors, including the UN Development Programme, the World Bank, the European Union (EU), Portugal, Taiwan, and the African Development Bank. In April 2000, in association with the central bank, the <!--del_lnk--> Banco National S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe, the IMF approved a poverty reduction and growth facility for S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; aimed at reducing inflation to 3% for 2001, raising ideal growth to 4%, and reducing the fiscal deficit. In late 2000, S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; qualified for significant debt reduction under the IMF-World Bank&rsquo;s heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative. The reduction is currently being reevaluated by the IMF, due to the attempted coup d&rsquo;etat in July 2003 and subsequent emergency spending. Following the truce, the IMF decided to send a mission to S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; to evaluate the macroeconomic state of the country. This evaluation is ongoing, reportedly pending oil legislation to determine how the government will manage incoming oil revenues.<p>In 2001, S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Nigeria reached agreement on joint exploration for petroleum in waters claimed by the two countries of the <!--del_lnk--> Niger Delta geologic province. After a lengthy series of negotiations, in April 2003 the joint development zone (JDZ) was opened for bids by international oil firms. The JDZ was divided into 9 blocks; the winning bids for block one, ChevronTexaco, ExxonMobil, and the Norwegian firm Equity Energy, were announced in April 2004, with S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; to take in 40% of the $123&nbsp;million bid, and Nigeria the other 60%. Bids on other blocks were still under consideration in October 2004. S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; stands to gain significant revenue both from the bidding process and from follow-on production, should reserves in the area match expectations.<p>Portugal remains one of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;&#39;s major trading partners, particularly as a source of imports. Food, manufactured articles, machinery, and transportation equipment are imported primarily from the EU.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>Of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Pr&iacute;ncipe&#39;s total population, about 137,500 live on S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and 6,000 on Pr&iacute;ncipe. All are descended from various ethnic groups that have migrated to the islands since 1485. Six groups are identifiable:<ul>
       <li><i>Mesti&ccedil;os</i>, or mixed-blood, descendants of Portuguese colonists and African slaves brought to the islands during the early years of settlement from Benin, Gabon, and Congo (these people also are known as <i>filhos da terra</i> or &quot;sons of the land&quot;);<li><i>Angolares</i>, reputedly descendants of Angolan slaves who survived a 1540 shipwreck and now earn their livelihood fishing;<li><i>Forros</i>, descendants of freed slaves when slavery was abolished;<li><i>Servi&ccedil;ais</i>, contract laborers from Angola, Mozambique, and Cape Verde, living temporarily on the islands;<li><i>Tongas</i>, children of <i>servi&ccedil;ais</i> born on the islands; and<li>Europeans, primarily Portuguese.</ul>
      <p>In the 1970s, there were two significant population movements&mdash;the exodus of most of the 4,000 Portuguese residents and the influx of several hundred S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;an refugees from Angola. The islanders have been absorbed largely into a common Luso-African culture. Almost all belong to the Roman Catholic, Evangelical Protestant, or Seventh-day Adventist Churches, with a small but growing Muslim population.<p>Although a small country, S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Pr&iacute;ncipe has four national languages: <a href="../../wp/p/Portuguese_language.htm" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a> (the official language, spoken by 95% of the population), and the <!--del_lnk--> Portuguese-based creoles <!--del_lnk--> Forro (85%), <!--del_lnk--> Angolar (3%) and <!--del_lnk--> Principense (0.1%).<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>
