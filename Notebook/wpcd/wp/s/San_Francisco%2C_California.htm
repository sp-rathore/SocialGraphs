      <p>The <b>City and County of San Francisco</b> is the fourth most populous city in <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> fourteenth-most populous in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, with a 2006 population of 798,680 (estimate). It is located on the tip of the <!--del_lnk--> San Francisco Peninsula and is the focal point of the <!--del_lnk--> San Francisco Bay Area. San Francisco is the second most densely populated major city in the United States.<p>In 1776, the Spanish <!--del_lnk--> settled the tip of the San Francisco peninsula, establishing a <!--del_lnk--> fort at the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Gate and a <!--del_lnk--> mission named for <a href="../../wp/f/Francis_of_Assisi.htm" title="Francis of Assisi">Francis of Assisi</a>. As a result of the <!--del_lnk--> California Gold Rush in 1848, the city entered a period of rapid growth. After being devastated by the <!--del_lnk--> 1906 earthquake and fire, San Francisco was quickly rebuilt.<p>San Francisco is renowned for its months-long episodes of <!--del_lnk--> fog, steep rolling hills, an eclectic mix of <!--del_lnk--> Victorian and <!--del_lnk--> modern architecture, its peninsular location (surrounded by the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> and <!--del_lnk--> San Francisco Bay), and its liberal cultural and political identity. Famous hallmarks and landmarks include the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Gate Bridge, <!--del_lnk--> Alcatraz Island, the <!--del_lnk--> cable cars, the <!--del_lnk--> Transamerica Pyramid, <!--del_lnk--> Coit Tower, and <!--del_lnk--> Chinatown.<p>

      <p>The earliest archaeological evidence of inhabitation of the territory of the city of San Francisco dates to 3000 BC. The <!--del_lnk--> Yelamu group of the <!--del_lnk--> Ohlone people resided in several small villages when a <!--del_lnk--> Spanish exploration party, led by Don <!--del_lnk--> Gaspar de Portol&agrave; arrived on <!--del_lnk--> November 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1769, the first documented European discovery of <!--del_lnk--> San Francisco Bay. Seven years later, on <!--del_lnk--> March 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1776 the <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spanish</a> established a <!--del_lnk--> fort, followed by a <!--del_lnk--> mission, <!--del_lnk--> Mission San Francisco de As&iacute;s (Mission Dolores).<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Upon <!--del_lnk--> independence from <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> in 1821, the area became part of <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. In 1835, Englishman <!--del_lnk--> William Richardson erected the first significant homestead outside the immediate vicinity of the Mission Dolores, near a boat anchorage around what is today <!--del_lnk--> Portsmouth Square. Together with Mission <!--del_lnk--> Alcalde <!--del_lnk--> Francisco de Haro, he laid out a street plan for the expanded settlement, and the town, named <!--del_lnk--> Yerba Buena, began to attract American settlers. Commodore <!--del_lnk--> John D. Sloat claimed California for the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> on <!--del_lnk--> July 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1846, during the <!--del_lnk--> Mexican-American War, and Captain <!--del_lnk--> John B. Montgomery arrived to claim Yerba Buena two days later. Yerba Buena was renamed San Francisco the next year. Despite its attractive location as a port and naval base, San Francisco was still a small settlement with inhospitable geography.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> California Gold Rush brought a flood of treasure seekers. With their <!--del_lnk--> sourdough bread in tow, prospectors accumulated in San Francisco over rival <!--del_lnk--> Benicia, raising the population from 1,000 in 1848 to 25,000 by December 1849. The promise of riches was so strong that crews on arriving vessels deserted and rushed off to the gold fields, leaving behind a forest of masts in San Francisco harbour. <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a> was quickly granted <a href="../../wp/u/U.S._state.htm" title="U.S. state">statehood</a> and the U.S. military built <!--del_lnk--> Fort Point at the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Gate and a fort on <!--del_lnk--> Alcatraz island to secure the San Francisco Bay. Silver discoveries, including the <!--del_lnk--> Comstock Lode in 1859, further drove rapid population growth. With hordes of fortune seekers streaming through the city, lawlessness was common, and the <!--del_lnk--> Barbary Coast section of town gained notoriety as a haven for criminals, prostitution, and gambling.<p><!--del_lnk--> Entrepreneurs sought to capitalize on the wealth generated by the Gold Rush. Early winners were the <!--del_lnk--> banking industry, which saw the founding of <!--del_lnk--> Wells Fargo in 1852, and the <!--del_lnk--> railroad industry, as the <!--del_lnk--> magnates of <!--del_lnk--> the Big Four, led by <!--del_lnk--> Leland Stanford, collaborated in the building of the <a href="../../wp/f/First_Transcontinental_Railroad.htm" title="First Transcontinental Railroad">First Transcontinental Railroad</a>. The development of the <!--del_lnk--> Port of San Francisco established the city as a centre of <!--del_lnk--> trade. Catering to the needs and tastes of the growing population, <!--del_lnk--> Levi Strauss opened a dry goods business and <!--del_lnk--> Domingo Ghirardelli began manufacturing <a href="../../wp/c/Chocolate.htm" title="Chocolate">chocolate</a>. Immigrant laborers made the city a polyglot culture, with <!--del_lnk--> Chinese railroad workers creating the city&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Chinatown quarter. The first <!--del_lnk--> cable cars carried San Franciscans up <!--del_lnk--> Clay Street in 1873. The city&#39;s sea of <!--del_lnk--> Victorian houses began to take shape, and civic leaders campaigned for a spacious public park, resulting in plans for <!--del_lnk--> Golden Gate Park. San Franciscans built schools, churches, theaters, and all the hallmarks of civic life. The Presidio developed into the most important American military installation on the Pacific coast. By the turn of the century, San Francisco was a city of international renown, celebrated for a flamboyant style, stately hotels, ostentatious mansions on <!--del_lnk--> Nob Hill, and a thriving arts scene.<div class="center">

      <p>At 5:12 AM on the morning of <!--del_lnk--> April 18, <!--del_lnk--> 1906, a major <a href="../../wp/e/Earthquake.htm" title="Earthquake">earthquake</a> struck San Francisco and northern California. As buildings collapsed from the shaking, ruptured gas lines ignited fires that would spread across the city and burn out of control for several days. With water mains out of service, the Presidio Artillery Corps attempted to contain the inferno by dynamiting blocks of buildings to create firebreaks. More than three-quarters of the city lay in ruins, including almost all of the downtown core. Contemporary accounts reported that 498 people lost their lives, though modern estimates put the number in the several thousands. More than half the city&#39;s population of 400,000 were left homeless. Refugees settled temporarily in makeshift tent villages in Golden Gate Park, the Presidio, on the beaches, and elsewhere. Many fled permanently to the <!--del_lnk--> East Bay.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Rebuilding was rapid and performed on a grand scale. Rejecting calls to completely remake the street grid, San Franciscans opted for speed. <!--del_lnk--> Amadeo Giannini&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Bank of Italy, later to become <!--del_lnk--> Bank of America, provided loans for many of those whose livelihoods had been devastated. The destroyed mansions of Nob Hill became grand hotels. <!--del_lnk--> City Hall rose once again in <!--del_lnk--> Beaux Arts splendor, and the city celebrated its rebirth at the <!--del_lnk--> Panama-Pacific International Exposition in 1915.<p>In ensuing years, the city solidified its standing as a financial capital; in the wake of the <!--del_lnk--> 1929 stock market crash, not a single San Francisco-based bank failed. Indeed, it was at the height of the <!--del_lnk--> Great Depression that San Francisco undertook two great civil engineering projects, simultaneously constructing the <!--del_lnk--> San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Gate Bridge, completing them in 1936 and 1937 respectively. It was in this period that the island of Alcatraz, a former military stockade, began its service as a federal maximum security prison, housing notorious inmates such as <!--del_lnk--> Al Capone. San Francisco later celebrated its regained grandeur with a <!--del_lnk--> World&#39;s Fair, the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Gate International Exposition in 1939-40, creating <!--del_lnk--> Treasure Island in the middle of the bay to house it.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Hunters Point Naval Shipyard became a hub of activity and <!--del_lnk--> Fort Mason became the primary port of embarkation for service members shipping out to the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific theatre of operations. The explosion of jobs drew many people, especially <!--del_lnk--> African Americans from the South, to the area. After the end of the war, many military personnel returning from service abroad and civilians who had originally come to work decided to stay. The <!--del_lnk--> UN Charter creating the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> was drafted and signed in San Francisco in 1945 and, in 1951, the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of San Francisco officially ended the <!--del_lnk--> war with Japan.<p>Urban planning projects in the 1950s and 1960s saw widespread destruction and redevelopment of westside neighborhoods and the construction of new freeways. The <!--del_lnk--> Transamerica Pyramid was completed in 1972, and in the 1980s the <!--del_lnk--> Manhattanization of San Francisco saw extensive high rise development downtown. Port activity moved to <!--del_lnk--> Oakland, the city began to lose industrial jobs, and San Francisco began to turn to tourism as the most important segment of its economy. The suburbs experienced rapid growth and San Francisco underwent significant demographic change, as large segments of the white population left the city, supplanted by an increasing wave of immigration from Asia and Latin America.<p>Over this same period, San Francisco became a magnet for America&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> counterculture. <!--del_lnk--> Beat Generation writers fueled the <!--del_lnk--> San Francisco Renaissance and centered on the <!--del_lnk--> North Beach neighbourhood in the 1950s. <!--del_lnk--> Hippies flocked to <!--del_lnk--> Haight-Ashbury in the 1960s, reaching a peak with the 1967 <!--del_lnk--> Summer of Love. In the 1970s, the city became a centre of the <!--del_lnk--> gay rights movement, with the emergence of <!--del_lnk--> The Castro as an urban <!--del_lnk--> gay village, the election of <!--del_lnk--> Harvey Milk to the <!--del_lnk--> Board of Supervisors, and his assassination, along with that of Mayor <!--del_lnk--> George Moscone, in 1978.<p>The 1989 <!--del_lnk--> Loma Prieta earthquake caused destruction and loss of life throughout the Bay Area. In San Francisco, the quake severely damaged structures in the <!--del_lnk--> Marina and <!--del_lnk--> South of Market districts and precipitated the demolition of the damaged <!--del_lnk--> Embarcadero Freeway and much of the damaged <!--del_lnk--> Central Freeway, allowing the city to reclaim its historic downtown waterfront.<p>During the <!--del_lnk--> dot-com boom of the late 1990s, <!--del_lnk--> startup companies invigorated the economy. Large numbers of entrepreneurs and computer application developers moved into the city, followed by marketing and sales professionals that changed the social landscape as once poorer neighborhoods became <!--del_lnk--> gentrified. When the bubble burst in 2001, many of these companies folded and their employees left, although high technology and entrepreneurship continued to be mainstays of the San Francisco economy.<br clear="all" />

      <p>San Francisco is located on the <!--del_lnk--> west coast of the U.S. at the tip of the <!--del_lnk--> San Francisco Peninsula and includes significant stretches of the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> and <!--del_lnk--> San Francisco Bay within its boundaries. Several <!--del_lnk--> islands are part of the city, notably <!--del_lnk--> Alcatraz, <!--del_lnk--> Treasure Island, and the adjacent <!--del_lnk--> Yerba Buena Island. Also included are the uninhabited <!--del_lnk--> Farallon Islands, 27 <!--del_lnk--> miles (43&nbsp;km) offshore in the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. The land within the city limits roughly forms a seven by seven mile square, which has become a colloquialism referring to the city&#39;s shape.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>San Francisco is famous for its hills, which are defined as elevations over 100 <!--del_lnk--> feet (30&nbsp;m). There are a total of <!--del_lnk--> 43 hills within city limits. Some neighborhoods are named after the hill on which they are situated, including <!--del_lnk--> Nob Hill, <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Heights, <!--del_lnk--> Russian Hill, <!--del_lnk--> Potrero Hill, and <!--del_lnk--> Telegraph Hill.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Near the geographic centre of the city, southwest of the downtown area, are a series of less densely populated hills. Dominating this area is <!--del_lnk--> Mount Sutro, the site of <!--del_lnk--> Sutro Tower, a large red and white radio and television transmission tower. Nearby is <!--del_lnk--> Twin Peaks, a pair of hills resting at one of the city&#39;s highest points and a popular overlook spot for tour groups. San Francisco&#39;s tallest hill, <!--del_lnk--> Mount Davidson, is 925 feet (282&nbsp;m) high, and is capped with a 103 feet (31.4&nbsp;m) tall cross built in 1934.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> San Andreas and <!--del_lnk--> Hayward Faults are responsible for much <a href="../../wp/e/Earthquake.htm" title="Earthquake">earthquake</a> activity, even though neither passes through the city itself. It was the San Andreas Fault which slipped and caused the earthquakes in 1906 and 1989. Minor earthquakes occur on a regular basis. The threat of major earthquakes plays a large role in the city&#39;s infrastructure development. New buildings must meet high structural standards, and older buildings and bridges must be retrofitted to comply with new building codes.<p>San Francisco&#39;s shoreline has grown beyond its natural limits. Entire neighborhoods such as the <!--del_lnk--> Marina and <!--del_lnk--> Hunters Point, as well as large sections of the <!--del_lnk--> Embarcadero sit on areas of <!--del_lnk--> landfill. <!--del_lnk--> Treasure Island was constructed from material dredged from the bay as well as material resulting from tunneling through Yerba Buena Island during the construction of the Bay Bridge. Such land tends to be unstable during earthquakes; the resultant <!--del_lnk--> liquefaction causes extensive damage to property built upon it, as was evidenced in the Marina district during the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>

      <p>A quotation incorrectly attributed to <a href="../../wp/m/Mark_Twain.htm" title="Mark Twain">Mark Twain</a> goes, &quot;The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco.&quot; San Francisco benefits from California&rsquo;s <!--del_lnk--> Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild wet winters and warm dry summers. However, surrounded on three sides by water, San Francisco has a climate strongly influenced by the cool <!--del_lnk--> currents of the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> which tends to moderate temperature swings and produce a remarkably mild climate with little seasonal temperature variation. Average summertime high temperatures in San Francisco peak at 70&nbsp;&deg;F (21&nbsp;&deg;C) and are 20&nbsp;&deg;F (9&nbsp;&deg;C) lower than they are in nearby inland locations like <!--del_lnk--> Livermore. The highest temperature ever recorded in San Francisco was 103&nbsp;&deg;F (39&nbsp;&deg;C) on <!--del_lnk--> June 14, 2000. Winters are mild, with daytime highs near 60&nbsp;&deg;F (15&nbsp;&deg;C). Lows almost never reach freezing temperatures, though the lowest temperature ever recorded in San Francisco was 27&nbsp;&deg;F (-3&nbsp;&deg;C) on <!--del_lnk--> December 11, 1932. May through September are quite dry, and rain is a common occurrence from November through March. Snow is extraordinarily rare, with only 10 instances recorded since 1852. The last measurable snowfall in San Francisco was on <!--del_lnk--> February 5, 1976, when parts of the city experienced as much as five inches.<p>The combination of cold ocean water and the high heat of the California mainland creates the city&#39;s characteristic <!--del_lnk--> fog that can cover the western half of the city all day during the summer and early fall. The fog is less pronounced in eastern neighborhoods, in late spring, and during September and October, which are the warmest months of the year. Due to its sharp topography and maritime influences, San Francisco exhibits a multitude of distinct <!--del_lnk--> microclimates. The high hills in the geographic centre of the city are responsible for a 20% variance in annual rainfall between different parts of the city. They also protect neighborhoods directly to their east from the foggy and cool conditions experienced in the <!--del_lnk--> Sunset District; for those who live on the eastern side of the city, San Francisco is fairly sunny, with an average of 160 clear days, and only 105 cloudy days per year.<table class="wikitable">

      <p>The historic centre of San Francisco is the northeast quadrant of the city bordered by <!--del_lnk--> Market Street to the south. It is here that the <!--del_lnk--> Financial District is centered, with <!--del_lnk--> Union Square, the principal shopping and hotel district, nearby. <!--del_lnk--> Cable cars carry residents and tourists alike up steep inclines to the summit of <!--del_lnk--> Nob Hill, once the home of the city&#39;s business tycoons, and down to <!--del_lnk--> Fisherman&#39;s Wharf, a tourist playground featuring <!--del_lnk--> Dungeness crab from a still-active fishing industry. Also in this quadrant are <!--del_lnk--> Russian Hill, a residential neighbourhood with the famously crooked <!--del_lnk--> Lombard Street, <!--del_lnk--> North Beach, the city&#39;s version of <!--del_lnk--> Little Italy, and <!--del_lnk--> Telegraph Hill, which features <!--del_lnk--> Coit Tower, a landmark dedicated to San Francisco&#39;s firefighters. Nearby is San Francisco&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Chinatown, established in the 1860s. The <!--del_lnk--> Tenderloin is often portrayed as the crime-infested underbelly of the city.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Mission District is predominantly working-class and populated by immigrants from <!--del_lnk--> Mexico and Central America, but is also gentrifying. <!--del_lnk--> Haight-Ashbury, though heavily gentrified, still has some <!--del_lnk--> bohemian character. The <!--del_lnk--> Castro is the centre of gay life in the city, having recovered from the devastation it suffered during the <!--del_lnk--> AIDS epidemic.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The city&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Japantown district suffered when its <!--del_lnk--> residents were <!--del_lnk--> forcibly removed during the second world war, while the nearby <!--del_lnk--> Western Addition became established with a large <!--del_lnk--> African American population at the same time. The &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Painted Ladies&quot;, a row of well-restored <!--del_lnk--> Victorian homes, stand alongside <!--del_lnk--> Alamo Square, and the mansions built by the San Francisco business elite in the wake of the <!--del_lnk--> 1906 earthquake can be found in <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Heights. The <!--del_lnk--> Marina to the north is a lively area with many young urban professionals.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Richmond, the vast region north of Golden Gate Park that extends to the Pacific Ocean, today has a portion called &quot;New Chinatown&quot;, but also attracts immigrants from other parts of Asia and <!--del_lnk--> Russia. South of Golden Gate Park lies the <!--del_lnk--> Sunset with an Asian majority population. The Richmond and the Sunset are largely middle class and, together, are known as <!--del_lnk--> The Avenues. The southern neighborhoods of the city are ethnically diverse and populated primarily with students and working class San Franciscans.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> South of Market, once filled with decaying remnants of San Francisco&#39;s industrial past, has seen significant redevelopment. The locus of the <!--del_lnk--> dot-com boom during the late 1990s, by 2004 South of Market began to see <!--del_lnk--> skyscrapers and <!--del_lnk--> condominiums dot the area. Following the success of nearby <!--del_lnk--> South Beach, another neighbourhood, <!--del_lnk--> Mission Bay, underwent redevelopment, anchored by a second campus of <!--del_lnk--> UCSF.<p><a id="Beaches_and_parks" name="Beaches_and_parks"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Beaches and parks</span></h3>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Ocean Beach runs along the Pacific Ocean shoreline, and <!--del_lnk--> Baker Beach occupies a picturesque setting just west of the Golden Gate Bridge. They are not suitable for swimming because the waters off the coast are cold and have deadly <!--del_lnk--> rip currents.

Few of San Francisco&#39;s residents have lived there their whole lives. Only 35% of its residents were born in California; 39% were born outside the United States.<p>San Francisco has the highest percentage of same-sex households of any American county, with the Bay Area having a higher concentration than any other metropolitan area. Gay men outnumber lesbians; it has been estimated that one in five males over the age of 15 is gay.<p>The San Francisco median household income, at $57,496 in 2005, is the fifth-highest for any large city in the nation. Following a national trend, an out-migration of middle class families is contributing to widening income disparity and has left the city with a lower proportion of children, 14.5%, than any other large city in the United States. Nevertheless, the <!--del_lnk--> poverty rate, at 7.8%, is lower than the national average and among the lowest for cities ranked by the U.S. Census Department.<p><!--del_lnk--> Homelessness has been a chronic and controversial problem for San Francisco since the early 1980s. The city is believed to have the highest number of homeless inhabitants per capita of any major city in the United States. The <!--del_lnk--> rates of violent and property crime, reported for 2003 as 742 and 4943 incidents per 100,000 residents respectively, are higher than the national average. Among the 50 largest U.S. cities by population, San Francisco ranks 32nd and 38th in each of those categories.<p><a id="Government" name="Government"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Government</span></h2>
      <p>The City and County of San Francisco is a <!--del_lnk--> consolidated city-county, a status it has had since 1856. It is the only such consolidation in California. The <!--del_lnk--> mayor is also the county executive and the county <!--del_lnk--> board of supervisors acts as the <!--del_lnk--> city council. Because of its unique status, it exercises jurisdiction over property that would otherwise be located outside of its corporation limit. <!--del_lnk--> San Francisco International Airport, though located in <!--del_lnk--> San Mateo County, is owned and operated by the City and County of San Francisco. San Francisco was also granted a perpetual leasehold over the <!--del_lnk--> Hetch Hetchy Valley and <!--del_lnk--> watershed in <!--del_lnk--> Yosemite National Park by the <!--del_lnk--> Raker Act in 1913.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Under the city charter, the Government of San Francisco is constituted of two co-equal branches. The executive branch is headed by the mayor and includes other city-wide elected and appointed officials, and the civil service. The 11-member <!--del_lnk--> Board of Supervisors, the legislative branch, is headed by a President (<!--del_lnk--> Aaron Peskin, as of 2006) and is responsible for passing laws and budgets, though San Franciscans also make use of <!--del_lnk--> direct ballot initiatives to pass legislation. The members of the Board of Supervisors are elected as representatives of specific districts within the city. If the mayor dies or resigns, the President of the Board of Supervisors assumes the office, as <!--del_lnk--> Dianne Feinstein did after the assassination of <!--del_lnk--> George Moscone in 1978. The municipal budget in 2006 was greater than $5 billion.<p>The federal government utilizes San Francisco as the regional hub for many arms of the federal bureaucracy, including the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Court of Appeals, the <!--del_lnk--> Federal Reserve Bank, and the <!--del_lnk--> United States Mint. Until decommissioning in the early 1990s, the city had three major military installations - the <!--del_lnk--> Presidio, <!--del_lnk--> Treasure Island, and <!--del_lnk--> Hunters Point - a legacy still reflected in the annual celebration of <i><!--del_lnk--> Fleet Week</i>. The State of California uses San Francisco as the home of the state <!--del_lnk--> Supreme Court and other state agencies. Foreign governments have located in excess of thirty foreign <!--del_lnk--> consulates in San Francisco.<br clear="all" />

The Small Business Commission supports local merchants in an effort to keep a larger share of retail dollars in the local economy. Small businesses with fewer than ten employees and self-employed firms make up 85 percent of city establishments.

      <p>San Francisco is characterized by a high standard of living. The great wealth and opportunity generated by the internet revolution drew many highly educated and high income workers and residents to San Francisco. Poorer neighborhoods have become <!--del_lnk--> gentrified. The downtown has seen a renaissance driven by the redevelopment of the <!--del_lnk--> Embarcadero, including the neighborhoods <!--del_lnk--> South Beach and <!--del_lnk--> Mission Bay. Property values and household income have escalated to among the highest in the nation, allowing the city to support a large restaurant and entertainment infrastructure. Because the cost of living in San Francisco is exceptionally high, many middle class families have decided they can no longer afford to live within the city and have left to the suburbs of the San Francisco Bay Area.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Although the centralized commerce and shopping districts downtown, including the <!--del_lnk--> Financial District and the area around <!--del_lnk--> Union Square, are well-known, San Francisco is also characterized by a rich street environment featuring many <!--del_lnk--> mixed-use neighborhoods anchored around central commercial corridors to which residents and visitors alike can walk.

Some are highly gentrified, dotted with boutiques, cafes and nightlife, such as <!--del_lnk--> Union Street in <!--del_lnk--> Cow Hollow, and <!--del_lnk--> 24th Street in <!--del_lnk--> Noe Valley. Others are less so, including <!--del_lnk--> Irving Street in the <!--del_lnk--> Sunset, or <!--del_lnk--> Mission Street in the <!--del_lnk--> Mission.

With 39% of its residents born overseas, San Francisco has numerous neighborhoods filled with businesses and civic institutions catering to new arrivals. In particular, the arrival of many ethnic Chinese, which accelerated beginning in the 1970s, complemented the already-established community based in <!--del_lnk--> Chinatown and has transformed the annual <!--del_lnk--> Chinese New Year Parade into the largest cultural event of its kind.<p>Following the arrival of writers and artists of the 1950s, who established the modern <!--del_lnk--> coffeehouse culture, and the social upheavals of the 1960s, San Francisco became one of the hypocenters of <a href="../../wp/l/Liberalism.htm" title="Liberalism">liberal</a> activism, with <!--del_lnk--> Democrats, <!--del_lnk--> Greens, and <!--del_lnk--> progressives dominating city politics. Indeed, San Francisco has not given the <!--del_lnk--> Republican candidate for president greater than 20% of the vote since <!--del_lnk--> 1988. The gay rights contributions and leadership the city has shown since the 1970s has resulted in the powerful presence gays and lesbians have in civic life.

Northbound, 101 uses arterial streets <!--del_lnk--> Van Ness Avenue and <!--del_lnk--> Lombard Street to the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Gate Bridge, the only direct road access from San Francisco to <!--del_lnk--> Marin County and points north. <!--del_lnk--> Highway 1 also enters San Francisco at the Golden Gate Bridge, but diverts away from 101, bisecting the west side of the city as the <!--del_lnk--> 19th Avenue arterial thoroughfare, and joining with <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 280 at the city&#39;s southern border. Interstate 280 continues this route along the central portion of the Peninsula south to <a href="../../wp/s/San_Jose%252C_California.htm" title="San Jose, California">San Jose</a>. Northbound, 280 turns north and east and terminates in the South of Market area. <!--del_lnk--> Highway 35, which traverses the majority of the Peninsula along the ridge of the <!--del_lnk--> Santa Cruz Mountains, enters the city from the south as <!--del_lnk--> Skyline Boulevard, following city streets until it terminates at its intersection with Highway 1. Major east-west thoroughfares include <!--del_lnk--> Geary Boulevard, the <!--del_lnk--> Lincoln Way/<!--del_lnk--> Fell Street corridor, and <!--del_lnk--> Market Street/<!--del_lnk--> Portola Drive.<p><a id="Public_transportation" name="Public_transportation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Public transportation</span></h3>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Public transit solely within the city of San Francisco is provided predominantly by the <!--del_lnk--> San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni). The city-owned system operates both a combined light rail/subway system (the <!--del_lnk--> Muni Metro) and a bus network that includes both <!--del_lnk--> trolleybuses and standard diesel buses. Additionally, Muni runs the <!--del_lnk--> F Market historic streetcar line and the iconic <!--del_lnk--> San Francisco cable car system.<p>Commuter rail is provided by two complementary agencies. <a href="../../wp/b/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit.htm" title="Bay Area Rapid Transit">Bay Area Rapid Transit</a> (BART) is the regional rapid transit system which connects San Francisco with the <!--del_lnk--> East Bay through the <!--del_lnk--> Transbay Tube. It also extends south of the city through northern <!--del_lnk--> San Mateo County, to the <!--del_lnk--> San Francisco International Airport, and <!--del_lnk--> Millbrae. The <!--del_lnk--> Caltrain rail system runs from San Francisco along the <!--del_lnk--> Peninsula down to <a href="../../wp/s/San_Jose%252C_California.htm" title="San Jose, California">San Jose</a>.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Transbay Terminal serves as the terminus for long range bus service (such as <!--del_lnk--> Greyhound) and as a hub for regional bus systems <!--del_lnk--> AC Transit (to <!--del_lnk--> Alameda County), <!--del_lnk--> SamTrans (San Mateo County), and <!--del_lnk--> Golden Gate Transit (Marin and <!--del_lnk--> Sonoma Counties). <a href="../../wp/a/Amtrak.htm" title="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> also runs a shuttle bus from San Francisco to its rail station in <!--del_lnk--> Emeryville.<p>A small fleet of commuter and tourist <!--del_lnk--> ferries operate from the <!--del_lnk--> Ferry Building and <!--del_lnk--> Pier 39 to points in <!--del_lnk--> Marin County, <!--del_lnk--> Oakland, and north to <!--del_lnk--> Vallejo in <!--del_lnk--> Solano County.<p><a id="Airports" name="Airports"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Airports</span></h3>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> San Francisco International Airport (SFO), though located 13 miles (21 km) south of the city in <!--del_lnk--> San Mateo County, is under the jurisdiction of the City and County of San Francisco. It is a hub for <!--del_lnk--> United Airlines, its largest tenant, and the decision by <!--del_lnk--> Virgin America to base its future operations out of SFO reverses the trend of <!--del_lnk--> low-cost carriers opting to bypass SFO for <!--del_lnk--> Oakland and <!--del_lnk--> San Jose. SFO is an international gateway, with the largest international terminal in North America. The airport is built on a landfill extension into the <!--del_lnk--> San Francisco Bay. During the economic boom of the late 1990s, when traffic saturation led to frequent delays, it became difficult to respond to calls to relieve the pressure by constructing an additional runway as that would have required additional landfill. Such calls subsided in the early 2000s as traffic declined, and, in 2005, SFO was the 14th busiest airport in the United States and 23rd largest in the world, handling 32.8 million passengers.<p><a id="Seaports" name="Seaports"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Seaports</span></h3>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Port of San Francisco was once the largest and busiest seaport on the west coast. It featured rows of <!--del_lnk--> piers perpendicular to the shore, where cargo from the moored ships was handled by cranes and manual labor and transported to nearby warehouses. The port handled cargo to and from trans-Pacific and Atlantic destinations, and was the west coast centre of the <!--del_lnk--> lumber trade. The <!--del_lnk--> 1934 West Coast Longshore Strike, an important episode in the history of the <!--del_lnk--> American labor movement, brought the port to a standstill. The advent of <!--del_lnk--> container shipping made pier-based ports obsolete and most commercial berths moved to the <!--del_lnk--> Port of Oakland.<p>Many piers remained derelict for years until the demolition of the <!--del_lnk--> Embarcadero Freeway reopened the downtown waterfront, allowing for redevelopment. The centerpiece of the port, the <!--del_lnk--> Ferry Building, while still receiving <!--del_lnk--> commuter ferry traffic, has been restored and redeveloped as a gourmet marketplace. The port&#39;s other activities now focus on developing waterside assets to support recreation and tourism.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco%2C_California&quot;</div>
