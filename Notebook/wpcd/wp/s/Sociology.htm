      <p><b>Sociology</b> is the study of society and human social action. A <b>sociologist</b> studies the <!--del_lnk--> social rules and <!--del_lnk--> processes that organize people in society as <!--del_lnk--> individuals and as members of <!--del_lnk--> associations, <!--del_lnk--> groups, and <!--del_lnk--> institutions, as well as how these rules and processes develop. Sociological research ranges from the analysis of short <!--del_lnk--> contacts between anonymous individuals on the street to the study of <a href="../../wp/g/Globalization.htm" title="Globalization">global social processes</a>. Most sociologists work in one or more <!--del_lnk--> specialties or subfields. Additionally, sociology tends to deal with the how and why of society, while still looking at the when and where.<p>The word sociology comes from the suffix &quot;-logy&quot; which means &quot;study of,&quot; derived from Greek, and the stem &quot;socio-&quot; which is from the Latin word socius, meaning member, friend, or ally, thus referring to people in general. It is a <!--del_lnk--> social science involving the study of the <!--del_lnk--> social <a href="../../wp/l/Life.htm" title="Life">lives</a> of <a href="../../wp/h/Human.htm" title="Human">people</a>, <!--del_lnk--> groups, and <a href="../../wp/s/Society.htm" title="Society">societies</a>, sometimes defined as the study of <!--del_lnk--> social interactions. As an <!--del_lnk--> academic discipline, sociology is relatively young, having evolved in the early 19th century.<p>Because sociology is such a broad discipline, it can be difficult to define, even for professional sociologists. One useful way to describe the discipline is as a cluster of sub-fields that examine different dimensions of society. For example, <!--del_lnk--> social stratification studies inequality and class structure; <!--del_lnk--> demography studies changes in a population size or type; <!--del_lnk--> criminology examines criminal behaviour and deviance; <!--del_lnk--> political sociology studies government and laws; and the <!--del_lnk--> sociology of race and <!--del_lnk--> sociology of gender examine the social construction of race and gender as well as race and gender inequality in society. New sociological sub-fields continue to appear&mdash;such as <!--del_lnk--> network analysis&mdash;many of which are cross-disciplinary in nature.<p>Many sociologists perform research useful outside the academy. Their findings aid educators, lawmakers, administrators, developers, business leaders and people interested in resolving social problems and formulating <!--del_lnk--> public policy.<p>

      <p>Sociology is a relatively new academic discipline among other <!--del_lnk--> social sciences including <a href="../../wp/e/Economics.htm" title="Economics">economics</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Political_science.htm" title="Political science">political science</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Anthropology.htm" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a>, <a href="../../wp/h/History.htm" title="History">history</a>, and <a href="../../wp/p/Psychology.htm" title="Psychology">psychology</a>. The ideas behind it, however, have a long history and can trace their origins to a mixture of common human <!--del_lnk--> knowledge and <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>.<p>Sociology emerged as a scientific discipline in the early 19th century as an academic response to the challenge of <!--del_lnk--> modernity: as the world was becoming smaller and more integrated, people&#39;s experience of the world was increasingly atomized and dispersed. Sociologists hoped not only to understand what held social groups together, but also to develop an antidote to <!--del_lnk--> social disintegration.<p>The word sociology was coined by <!--del_lnk--> Auguste Comte in 1838 from <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>Socius</i> (companion, associate) and <!--del_lnk--> Greek <i>l&oacute;gos</i> (speech). Comte hoped to unify all studies of humankind--including history, psychology and economics. His own sociological scheme was typical of the 19th century; he believed all human life had passed through the same distinct historical stages (theology, metaphysics, positive science) and that, if one could grasp this progress, one could prescribe the remedies for social ills. Sociology was to be the &#39;queen of sciences&#39;.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The first book with the term &#39;sociology&#39; in its title was <b>The Study of Sociology</b> (1874) by the English philosopher <!--del_lnk--> Herbert Spencer. In the United States, <!--del_lnk--> Lester Frank Ward, described by some as the father of American sociology, published <b>Dynamic Sociology</b> in 1883 and the discipline was taught by its own name for the first time at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Kansas, <!--del_lnk--> Lawrence in 1890 under the course title <i>Elements of Sociology</i> (the oldest continuing sociology course in America). The <i>Department of History and Sociology</i> at the University of Kansas was established in 1891 <!--del_lnk--> ,<!--del_lnk--> , and the first full fledged independent university department of sociology was established in 1892 at the <a href="../../wp/u/University_of_Chicago.htm" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a> by <!--del_lnk--> Albion W. Small, who in 1895 founded the <!--del_lnk--> American Journal of Sociology <!--del_lnk--> . The first European department of sociology was founded in 1895 at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Bordeaux by <!--del_lnk--> &Eacute;mile Durkheim, founder of <!--del_lnk--> L&#39;Ann&eacute;e Sociologique (1896). The first sociology department to be established in the United Kingdom was at the <!--del_lnk--> London School of Economics and Political Science (home of the British Journal of Sociology) <!--del_lnk-->  in 1904. In 1919 a sociology department was established in Germany at the <!--del_lnk--> Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich by <a href="../../wp/m/Max_Weber.htm" title="Max Weber">Max Weber</a> and in 1920 in <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Poland</a> by <!--del_lnk--> Florian Znaniecki.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>International cooperation in sociology began in 1893 when <!--del_lnk--> Ren&eacute; Worms founded the small <!--del_lnk--> Institut International de Sociologie that was eclipsed by the much larger <!--del_lnk--> International Sociological Association <!--del_lnk-->  starting in 1949 (ISA). In 1905 the <!--del_lnk--> American Sociological Association, the world&#39;s largest <!--del_lnk--> association of professional sociologists, was founded.<p>Other &quot;classical&quot; theorists of sociology from the late 19th and early 20th centuries include <a href="../../wp/k/Karl_Marx.htm" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Ferdinand T&ouml;nnies, <!--del_lnk--> &Eacute;mile Durkheim, <!--del_lnk--> Vilfredo Pareto, and <a href="../../wp/m/Max_Weber.htm" title="Max Weber">Max Weber</a>.

      <p>One shift in the discipline away from scientific explanation had philosophical roots. Early theorists&#39; approach to sociology, led by Comte, was to treat it in the same manner as natural science, applying the same methods and <!--del_lnk--> methodology used in the natural sciences to study social phenomena. The emphasis on <a href="../../wp/e/Empiricism.htm" title="Empiricism">empiricism</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> scientific method sought to provide an incontestable foundation for any sociological claims or findings, and to distinguish sociology from less empirical fields like <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>. This methodological approach, called <!--del_lnk--> positivism, became a source of contention between sociologists and other scientists, and eventually a point of divergence within the field itself. Thus, while most sciences evolved from <!--del_lnk--> deterministic, <!--del_lnk--> Newtonian models to <!--del_lnk--> probabilistic models which accept and even incorporate <!--del_lnk--> uncertainty, sociology began to cleave into those who believed in a deterministic approach (attributing variation to <!--del_lnk--> structure, interactions, or other forces) and those who rejected the very possibility of explanation and prediction.<p>A second push away from scientific explanation was cultural, even sociological, itself. As early as the 19th century, positivist and naturalist approaches to studying social life were questioned by scientists like <!--del_lnk--> Wilhelm Dilthey and <!--del_lnk--> Heinrich Rickert, who argued that the natural world differs from the social world because of unique aspects of human society such as <!--del_lnk--> meanings, <!--del_lnk--> symbols, <!--del_lnk--> rules, <!--del_lnk--> norms, and <!--del_lnk--> values. These elements of society both result in and generate human <a href="../../wp/c/Culture.htm" title="Culture">cultures</a>. This view was further developed by Max Weber, who introduced <!--del_lnk--> antipositivism (<!--del_lnk--> humanistic sociology). According to this view, which is closely related to <!--del_lnk--> antinaturalism, sociological research must concentrate on humans&#39; cultural values. This has led to some controversy on how one can draw the line between <!--del_lnk--> subjective and <!--del_lnk--> objective research and has also influenced <!--del_lnk--> hermeneutical studies. Similar disputes, especially in the era of the <a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">Internet</a>, have led to variations in sociology such as <!--del_lnk--> public sociology, which emphasizes the usefulness of sociological expertise to abstracted audiences.<p><a id="Social_theory" name="Social_theory"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Social theory</span></h2>
      <p>Social theory refers to the use of <!--del_lnk--> abstract and often complex <!--del_lnk--> theoretical frameworks to explain and analyze <!--del_lnk--> social patterns and <!--del_lnk--> macro <!--del_lnk--> social structures in <!--del_lnk--> social life, rather than explaining patterns of social life. Social theory always had an uneasy relationship to the more classic <!--del_lnk--> academic disciplines; many of its key thinkers never held a university position. While social theory is sometimes considered a branch of sociology, it is inherently <!--del_lnk--> interdisciplinary, as it deals with multiple fields including <a href="../../wp/a/Anthropology.htm" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Economics.htm" title="Economics">economics</a>, <!--del_lnk--> theology, <a href="../../wp/h/History.htm" title="History">history</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>, and many others. First social theories developed almost simultaneously with the birth of the sociology science itself. <!--del_lnk--> Auguste Comte, known as &#39;father of sociology&#39;, also laid the groundwork for one of the first social theories - <!--del_lnk--> social evolutionism. In the 19th century three great, classical theories of social and historical change were created: the <!--del_lnk--> social evolutionism theory (of which <!--del_lnk--> social darwinism is a part of), the <!--del_lnk--> social cycle theory and the <a href="../../wp/m/Marxism.htm" title="Marxism">Marxist</a> <!--del_lnk--> historical materialism theory. Although the majority of 19th century social theories are now considered obsolete they have spawned new, modern social theories. Modern social theories represent some advanced version of the classical theories, like <!--del_lnk--> Multilineal theories of evolution (<!--del_lnk--> neoevolutionism, <!--del_lnk--> sociobiology, <!--del_lnk--> theory of modernisation, <!--del_lnk--> theory of post-industrial society) or the general <!--del_lnk--> historical sociology and the <!--del_lnk--> theory of subjectivity and creation of the society.<p>Unlike disciplines within the <!--del_lnk--> natural sciences -- such as <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physics</a> or <a href="../../wp/c/Chemistry.htm" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a> -- social theorists may be less committed to use the <!--del_lnk--> scientific method to vindicate their theories. Instead, they tackle very large-scale social trends and structures using <!--del_lnk--> hypotheses that cannot be easily proved, except by historical and psychological interpretation, which is often the basis of criticism from opponents of social theories. Extremely critical theorists, such as <!--del_lnk--> deconstructionists or <!--del_lnk--> postmodernists, may argue that any systematic type of research or method is inherently flawed. Many times, however, &quot;social theory&quot; is defined without reference to science because the social reality it describes is so overarching as to be unprovable. The social theories of <!--del_lnk--> modernity or <!--del_lnk--> anarchy might be two examples of this.<p>However, social theories are a major part of the science of sociology. Objective science-based research can often provide support for explanations given by social theorists. Statistical research grounded in the scientific method, for instance, that finds a severe <a href="../../wp/i/Income_disparity.htm" title="Income disparity">income disparity</a> between women and men performing the same occupation can complement the underlying premise of the complex social theories of <!--del_lnk--> feminism or <!--del_lnk--> patriarchy. In general, and particularly among adherents to <!--del_lnk--> pure sociology, social theory has an appeal because it takes the focus away from the individual (which is how most humans look at the world) and focuses it on the society itself and the social forces which control our lives. This sociological insight (or <!--del_lnk--> sociological imagination) has through the years appealed to students and others dissatisfied with the status quo because it carries the assumption that societal structures and patterns are either random, arbitrary or controlled by specific powerful groups -- thus implying the possibility of change. This has a particular appeal to champions of the underdog, the dispossessed, and/or those at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder because it implies that their position in society is undeserved and/or the result of oppression.<p><a id="Science_and_mathematics" name="Science_and_mathematics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Science and mathematics</span></h2>

      <p>Sociologists study society and social behaviour by examining the groups and <!--del_lnk--> social institutions people form, as well as various social, religious, political, and business organizations. They also study the <!--del_lnk--> behaviour of, and <!--del_lnk--> social interaction among, groups, trace their origin and growth, and analyze the influence of group <!--del_lnk--> activities on individual members. Sociologists are concerned with the characteristics of <!--del_lnk--> social groups, organizations, and institutions; the ways individuals are affected by each other and by the groups to which they belong; and the effect of social traits such as sex, age, or race on a person&rsquo;s daily life. The results of sociological research aid educators, lawmakers, administrators, and others interested in resolving social problems and formulating public policy. Most sociologists work in one or more specialties, such as social organization, <!--del_lnk--> social stratification, and <!--del_lnk--> social mobility; <!--del_lnk--> racial and ethnic relations; <a href="../../wp/e/Education.htm" title="Education">education</a>; <!--del_lnk--> family; <!--del_lnk--> social psychology; <!--del_lnk--> urban, <!--del_lnk--> rural, <!--del_lnk--> political, and <!--del_lnk--> comparative sociology; <!--del_lnk--> sex roles and <!--del_lnk--> relationships; <!--del_lnk--> demography; <!--del_lnk--> gerontology; <!--del_lnk--> criminology; and <!--del_lnk--> sociological practice.<p>Although sociology emerged in large part from Comte&#39;s conviction that sociology eventually would subsume all other areas of scientific inquiry, in the end, sociology did not replace the other sciences. Instead, sociology came to be identified with the other social sciences (<a href="../../wp/p/Psychology.htm" title="Psychology">psychology</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Economics.htm" title="Economics">economics</a>, etc.). Today, sociology studies humankind&#39;s <a href="../../wp/o/Organization.htm" title="Organization">organizations</a>, <!--del_lnk--> social institutions and their <!--del_lnk--> social interactions, largely employing a <!--del_lnk--> comparative method. The discipline has concentrated particularly on the organization of complex <!--del_lnk--> industrial societies. Recent sociologists, taking cues from anthropologists, have noted the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Western emphasis&quot; of the field. In response, many sociology departments around the world are encouraging multi-cultural and multi-national studies.<p>Today, sociologists research micro-<!--del_lnk--> structures that organize society, such as <a href="../../wp/r/Race.htm" title="Race">race</a> or <!--del_lnk--> ethnicity, <!--del_lnk--> social class, <!--del_lnk--> gender roles, and institutions such as the <a href="../../wp/f/Family.htm" title="Family">family</a>; social processes that represent <!--del_lnk--> deviation from, or the breakdown of, these structures, including <a href="../../wp/c/Crime.htm" title="Crime">crime</a> and <!--del_lnk--> divorce; and micro-processes such as interpersonal interactions and the <!--del_lnk--> socialization of individuals.<p>Sociologists often rely on <!--del_lnk--> quantitative methods of <!--del_lnk--> social research to describe large patterns in social relationships and in order to develop models that can help predict social <!--del_lnk--> change. Other branches of sociology believe that <!--del_lnk--> qualitative methods - such as focused <!--del_lnk--> interviews, group discussions and <!--del_lnk--> ethnographic methods - allow for a better understanding of social processes. Some sociologists argue for a middle ground that sees quantitative and qualitative approaches as complementary. Results from one approach can fill gaps in the other approach. For example, quantitative methods could describe large or general <!--del_lnk--> patterns while qualitative approaches could help to understand how individuals understand those patterns.<p><a id="Social_research_methods" name="Social_research_methods"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Social research methods</span></h3>
      <dl>

      <p>There are several main methods that sociologists use to gather <!--del_lnk--> empirical evidence, which include <!--del_lnk--> questionnaires or Sociological methods <!--del_lnk--> survey research, <!--del_lnk--> interviews, <!--del_lnk--> participant observation, <!--del_lnk--> statistical research <!--del_lnk--> evaluation research and <!--del_lnk--> assessment, .<p>The problem with all of these approaches is that they are all based on what theoretical position the researcher adopts to explain and understand the society the researcher sees in front of themselves. If one is a functionalist like <!--del_lnk--> &Eacute;mile Durkheim, one is likely to interpret everything in terms of large-scale social structures. A <!--del_lnk--> symbolic interactionist is likely to concentrate on the way people understand one another. A researcher who is a <!--del_lnk--> Marxist or a <!--del_lnk--> neo-Marxist is likely to interpret everything through the grid of class struggle and economics. <!--del_lnk--> Phenomenologists tend to think that there is only the way in which people construct their meanings of reality, and nothing else. One of the real problems is that many sociologists argue that only one theoretical approach is the &quot;right&quot; one, and it is theirs. In practice, sociologists often tend to mix and match different approaches and methods, since each method produces particular types of data.<p>The <a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">Internet</a> is of interest for sociologists in three ways: as a tool for <!--del_lnk--> research, for example, in using <!--del_lnk--> online <!--del_lnk--> questionnaires instead of paper ones, as a discussion platform, and as a research topic. Sociology of the Internet in the last sense includes analysis of <!--del_lnk--> online communities (e.g. as found in <!--del_lnk--> newsgroups), <!--del_lnk--> virtual communities and <!--del_lnk--> virtual worlds, organisational change catalysed through new media like the Internet, and societal change at-large in the transformation from <!--del_lnk--> industrial to <!--del_lnk--> informational society (or to <!--del_lnk--> information society).<p><a id="Other_social_sciences" name="Other_social_sciences"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other social sciences</span></h3>
      <p>In the early 20th century, sociologists and psychologists who conducted research in industrial societies contributed to the development of <a href="../../wp/a/Anthropology.htm" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a>. Anthropologists also conducted research in industrial societies. Today sociology and anthropology are better contrasted according to different theoretical concerns and methods rather than objects of study.<p><!--del_lnk--> Sociobiology is a relatively new field to branch from both the sociology and <a href="../../wp/b/Biology.htm" title="Biology">biology</a> disciplines. Although the field once rapidly gained acceptance, it has remained highly controversial as it attempts to find ways in which social behavior and structures can be explained by evolutionary and biological processes. Sociobiologists are often criticized for depending too greatly on the effects of genes in defining behaviour. Sociobiologists often respond, however, by citing a complex relationship between nature and nurture. In this regard, sociobiology is closely related to <!--del_lnk--> physical anthropology, <!--del_lnk--> zoology, <!--del_lnk--> evolutionary psychology, <!--del_lnk--> human behavioural ecology, and <!--del_lnk--> dual inheritance theory. Nonetheless, for most in the discipline, its ideas are unacceptable.<p>Sociology has some links with <!--del_lnk--> social psychology, but the former is more interested in social structures and the latter in social behaviors. A distinction should be made between these and <!--del_lnk--> forensic studies within these disciplines, particularly where <a href="../../wp/a/Anatomy.htm" title="Anatomy">anatomy</a> is involved. These latter studies might be better named as <!--del_lnk--> Forensic psychology. As shown by the work of Marx and others, <a href="../../wp/e/Economics.htm" title="Economics">economics</a> has influenced sociological theories.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology&quot;</div>
