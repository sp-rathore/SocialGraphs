      <p>The word <i>Scotia</i> was used by the <!--del_lnk--> Romans as the name of one of the tribes in what is now Scotland as early as the 1st Century AD. The Romans also used Scotia to refer to the Irish.<p>The Venerable <a href="../../wp/b/Bede.htm" title="Bede">Bede</a> (c. 672 or 673 &ndash; May 27, 735) uses the word &quot;Scottorum&quot; as the name of a nation from <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> who settled part of the <!--del_lnk--> Pictish lands. &quot;Scottorum nationem in Pictorum parte recipit.&quot; This we can infer to be the arrival of the people, also known as the <!--del_lnk--> Gaels, in the Kingdom of D&aacute;l Riata, in the Western edge of Scotland. It is of note that Bede used the word &quot;nationem&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> nation) where he often refers to other peoples, such as the Picts, as &quot;gens&quot; (<a href="../../wp/r/Race.htm" title="Race">race</a>).<p>In the 10th century <!--del_lnk--> Anglo Saxon Chronicle, the word <i>Scot</i> is mentioned as a reference to the &#39;Land of the Gaels&#39;. Word <i>Scottorum</i> was again used, by an <!--del_lnk--> Irish King, in 1005. The phrase <i>Imperator Scottorum</i>, was used after the name of <!--del_lnk--> Brian B&oacute;ruma, by his notary Mael Suthain, in the Book of Armagh. It is thought to imply that Brian B&oacute;ruma was overlord of the Scots.<p>The style was subsequently copied by the Scottish kings. <i><!--del_lnk--> Basileus Scottorum</i> is attributed to the great seal of <!--del_lnk--> King Edgar (1074 &ndash; 1107). <!--del_lnk--> Alexander I (c. 1078 &ndash; 1124) used the words <i><!--del_lnk--> Rex Scottorum</i> on his great seal; So to did many of his successors up to and including <!--del_lnk--> James II..<p>In modern times the words &quot;Scot&quot; and &quot;Scottish&quot; are applied mainly to inhabitants of Scotland. The ancient Irish connotations are largely forgotten. The language known as <i><!--del_lnk--> Ulster Scots</i>, spoken in parts of North East Ireland, arose through 17th and 18th century immigrations from Scotland to Ireland.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>Prior to the <!--del_lnk--> Mesolithic period, Scotland was repeatedly glaciated. The ice covered the entire land mass of Scotland and so has destroyed any evidence of early human habitation. The earliest Scottish human settlement, dated to around 8500 BC, was found at <!--del_lnk--> Cramond, near Edinburgh.<p>A well preserved <!--del_lnk--> Neolithic farmstead can been seen at <!--del_lnk--> Knap of Howar on <a href="../../wp/o/Orkney.htm" title="Orkney">Orkney</a>. The building, dated to around 3500 BC, is claimed to be the oldest standing house in the country. An example of a complete Neolithic village can be seen nearby at the village of <!--del_lnk--> Skara Brae, on the Mainland of <a href="../../wp/o/Orkney.htm" title="Orkney">Orkney</a>. There are many other Neolithic habitation, burial and ritual sites across the Northern and Western Isles such as <!--del_lnk--> Callanish on <!--del_lnk--> Lewis, <!--del_lnk--> Maeshowe and The <!--del_lnk--> Ring of Brodgar on Orkney. In southern, <!--del_lnk--> crannogs were a common form of dwelling.<p>After the 8th century BC, Brythonic Celtic culture and language spread into Scotland. The <a href="../../wp/i/Iron_Age.htm" title="Iron age">Iron age</a> brought numerous <!--del_lnk--> hill forts, <!--del_lnk--> brochs, crannogs and fortified settlements which support the image of quarrelsome tribes and petty kingdoms later recorded by the Romans, though evidence that at times occupants neglected the defences might suggest that symbolic power had as much significance as warfare.<p>The written histories of Scotland began with the arrival of the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>. The Romans occupied what is now <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> and <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a>.

      <p>In 1603, Elizabeth I of England died. Thus <!--del_lnk--> James VI King of Scotland also became King James I of England. With the exception of a short period under <!--del_lnk--> The Protectorate, Scotland remained a separate <!--del_lnk--> state. There was considerable conflict between the crown and the <!--del_lnk--> Covenanters over the form of <!--del_lnk--> church government. After the <a href="../../wp/g/Glorious_Revolution.htm" title="Glorious Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a> and the overthrow of the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic <!--del_lnk--> James VII by <a href="../../wp/w/William_and_Mary.htm" title="William and Mary">William and Mary</a>, Scotland briefly threatened to select a different <!--del_lnk--> Protestant monarch from that of England. The <!--del_lnk--> Alien Act of 1705 was a law passed by the <!--del_lnk--> Parliament of England, in <!--del_lnk--> 1705, as a response to the <!--del_lnk--> Parliament of Scotland&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Act of Security of <!--del_lnk--> 1704, which in turn was a response to the English <!--del_lnk--> Act of Settlement 1701.<p>The Alien Act provided that estates held by <!--del_lnk--> Scottish nationals in England were to be treated as alien property, making inheritance much less certain. It also had an <!--del_lnk--> embargo on the import of <!--del_lnk--> Scottish products into England and English colonies - about half of Scotland&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> trade, covering sectors such as <!--del_lnk--> linen, <a href="../../wp/c/Cattle.htm" title="Cattle">cattle</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a>.<p>The Act contained a provision that it would be suspended if the Scots entered into negotiations on the dispute between the two parliaments. Combined with English financial offers to refund Scottish losses on the <!--del_lnk--> Dari&eacute;n scheme, it achieved its aim, leading to the <!--del_lnk--> Act of Union 1707 uniting the two countries as the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Great Britain.<p><a id="Jacobites" name="Jacobites"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Jacobites</span></h3>
      <p>The deposed <!--del_lnk--> Jacobite Stuart claimants had remained popular in the Highlands and north-east, particularly amongst non-<!--del_lnk--> Presbyterians. Two major <!--del_lnk--> Jacobite risings launched from the Highlands of Scotland in 1715 and 1745. The latter uprising was lead by <!--del_lnk--> Bonnie Prince Charlie, aka &quot;The Young Pretender&quot;.

      <p>As one of the <!--del_lnk--> constituent countries of the United Kingdom, the <!--del_lnk--> head of state in Scotland is the <!--del_lnk--> British monarch, currently <a href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a> (since 1952). Constitutionally the United Kingdom is a <!--del_lnk--> unitary state with one sovereign parliament and government. Under a system of <!--del_lnk--> devolution (or <!--del_lnk--> home rule) adopted after Scottish and Welsh referendums on devolution proposals in 1997, most of the constituent countries within the United Kingdom were given limited <!--del_lnk--> self-government, (except England). The British Parliament in Westminster retains the ability to amend, change, broaden or abolish the devolved governmental systems at will. As such the Scottish Parliament is not <!--del_lnk--> sovereign. However, it is thought unlikely that any British parliament would unilaterally abolish a home rule parliament and government without consultation via a referendum with the voters of the constituent country.<p><!--del_lnk--> Executive power in the United Kingdom is vested in the <!--del_lnk--> Queen-in-Council, while legislative power is vested in the <!--del_lnk--> Queen-in-Parliament (the Crown and the <a href="../../wp/p/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">Parliament of the United Kingdom</a> at <a href="../../wp/p/Palace_of_Westminster.htm" title="Palace of Westminster">Westminster</a> in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>). Under devolution executive and legislative powers in certain areas have been constitutionally delegated to the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Executive and the Scottish Parliament at <!--del_lnk--> Holyrood in <a href="../../wp/e/Edinburgh.htm" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> respectively. The United Kingdom Parliament retains active power over Scotland&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> taxes, <!--del_lnk--> social security system, the <!--del_lnk--> military, <!--del_lnk--> international relations, <!--del_lnk--> broadcasting, and some other areas explicitly specified in the <!--del_lnk--> Scotland Act 1998 as <!--del_lnk--> reserved matters. The Scottish Parliament has <!--del_lnk--> legislative authority for all other areas relating to Scotland, and has limited power to vary <!--del_lnk--> income tax, but has never exercised this power. The Scottish Parliament can refer devolved matters back to Westminster to be considered as part of United Kingdom-wide legislation by passing a <!--del_lnk--> Legislative Consent Motion if United Kingdom-wide legislation is considered to be more appropriate for certain issues. The programmes of legislation enacted by the Scottish Parliament have seen a divergence in the provision of <!--del_lnk--> public services compared to the rest of the United Kingdom. For instance, the costs of a <a href="../../wp/u/University.htm" title="University">university</a> education, and care services for the elderly are free at point of use in Scotland, while fees are paid in the rest of the UK. Scotland is the first country in the UK to ban smoking in public places.<p>The Scottish Parliament is a <!--del_lnk--> unicameral <!--del_lnk--> legislature comprised of 129 <!--del_lnk--> Members, 73 of whom represent individual <!--del_lnk--> constituencies and are elected on a <!--del_lnk--> first past the post system; 56 are elected in eight different electoral regions by the <!--del_lnk--> additional member system, first elected on the 6th May 1999 and serving for a four year period. The Queen appoints one of the members of the Parliament, on the nomination of the Parliament, to be <!--del_lnk--> First Minister. Other Ministers are also appointed by the Queen on the nomination of the Parliament and together with the First Minister they make up <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Executive, the <!--del_lnk--> executive arm of <a href="../../wp/g/Government.htm" title="Government">government</a>. The current (since 2001) First Minister is <!--del_lnk--> Jack McConnell of the <!--del_lnk--> Labour Party, who forms the government on a <!--del_lnk--> coalition basis with the <a href="../../wp/l/Liberal_Democrats.htm" title="Liberal Democrats">Liberal Democrats</a>. The main <!--del_lnk--> opposition party is the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish National Party, which campaigns for <!--del_lnk--> Scottish independence.

      <p>Scotland is represented in the <a href="../../wp/b/British_House_of_Commons.htm" title="British House of Commons">British House of Commons</a> by 59 <!--del_lnk--> MPs elected from territory-based <!--del_lnk--> Scottish constituencies. The <!--del_lnk--> Scotland Office, a department of the United Kingdom government led by <!--del_lnk--> The Secretary of State for Scotland, is responsible for reserved matters. The Secretary of State for Scotland sits in the <!--del_lnk--> Cabinet of the United Kingdom and prior to devolution headed the system of government in Scotland. The current Secretary of State for Scotland is <!--del_lnk--> Douglas Alexander. Until 1999, <!--del_lnk--> Scottish peers were entitled to sit in the <a href="../../wp/h/House_of_Lords.htm" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a>.<p>Political debate in Scotland has revolved around the constitution and this dominated the Scottish political scene in the latter half of the 20th century. Under the pressure of growing support for <!--del_lnk--> Scottish independence all three UK-wide parties advocated a policy of <!--del_lnk--> devolution to some degree during their history (although Labour and the Conservatives have also at times opposed it). Now that devolution has occurred, debate continues over whether the Scottish Parliament should accrue additional powers (for example over <!--del_lnk--> fiscal policy), or seek to obtain full <!--del_lnk--> independence with full sovereign powers (either through independence, a federal United Kingdom or a confederal arrangement). It remains to be seen whether the current devolution system satisfies Scottish demands for self-government or will strengthen demands for full-blown independence.<p><a id="Law" name="Law"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Law</span></h2>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Scots law has a basis derived from <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_law.htm" title="Roman law">Roman law</a> combining features of both uncodified <!--del_lnk--> civil law, dating back to the <!--del_lnk--> Corpus Juris Civilis, and <!--del_lnk--> common law with <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Mediaeval">mediaeval</a> sources.

Various other systems derived from common <!--del_lnk--> Celtic or <!--del_lnk--> Brehon Laws survived in the Highlands until the 1800s.<p>Scots law provides for three types of <!--del_lnk--> courts responsible for the administration of <!--del_lnk--> justice in Scotland: <!--del_lnk--> civil, <!--del_lnk--> criminal and <a href="../../wp/h/Heraldry.htm" title="Heraldry">heraldic</a>. The supreme civil court is the <!--del_lnk--> Court of Session, although civil appeals can be taken to the House of Lords in London. The <!--del_lnk--> High Court of Justiciary is the supreme criminal court. Both courts are housed at <!--del_lnk--> Parliament House, Edinburgh which was the home of the pre-Union <!--del_lnk--> Parliament of Scotland. The <!--del_lnk--> sheriff court is the main criminal and civil court. There are 49 sheriff courts throughout the country. <!--del_lnk--> District courts were introduced in 1975 for minor offences. The <!--del_lnk--> Court of the Lord Lyon regulates heraldry in Scotland.<p>Scots law is also unique in that it allows three verdicts in criminal cases including the controversial &#39;<!--del_lnk--> not proven&#39; verdict.<p><a id="Subdivisions" name="Subdivisions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Subdivisions</span></h2>

The names of these areas are still used as geographical descriptors.<p>Modern Scotland is subdivided in different ways depending on the purpose. For <!--del_lnk--> local government, 32 <!--del_lnk--> council areas were set up in 1996. These are administered by 32 <!--del_lnk--> unitary authorities responsible for the provision of all local government services, including <!--del_lnk--> education, social work, environment and roads services. Some of the larger councils are further divided into <!--del_lnk--> area committees. <!--del_lnk--> Community councils are informal organisations that represent specific sub-divisions of a council area.<p>There are 35 <!--del_lnk--> lieutenancy areas, for which the Queen appoints a <!--del_lnk--> Lord Lieutenant to represent her (except for Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen &mdash; where the democratically elected <!--del_lnk--> Lord Provost is the Lord Lieutenant, <i>ex officio</i>). There are six <!--del_lnk--> sheriffdoms for administering <!--del_lnk--> justice. For the Scottish Parliament, there are 8 regions. These are then sub-divided into 73 <!--del_lnk--> constituencies. For the Parliament of the United Kingdom there are 59 <!--del_lnk--> constituencies. The Scottish fire brigades and police forces are still based on the system of regions introduced in 1975. For healthcare and postal districts, amongst others, Scotland is subdivided in various other ways.

      <p>Scotland comprises the northern third of the island of <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>, off the coast of north west <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>. The total land mass is around 78,772 <!--del_lnk--> square kilometres (30,414 <!--del_lnk--> mi&sup2;). Scotland&#39;s only land border is with <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, and runs for 96 <!--del_lnk--> kilometres (60 <!--del_lnk--> miles) between the <!--del_lnk--> River Tweed on the east coast and the <!--del_lnk--> Solway Firth in the west. The island of <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> lies around 30 kilometres (20 mi) off the south west tip of Scotland, <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a> is around 400 kilometres (250 mi) to the north east, and the <!--del_lnk--> Faroes and <a href="../../wp/i/Iceland.htm" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> lie to the north. Scotland lies between the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> and the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea.htm" title="North Sea">North Sea</a>.<p>The territorial extent of Scotland is generally that established by the <!--del_lnk--> 1237 <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of York between Scotland and <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> 1266 Treaty of Perth between Scotland and <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a>. Exceptions include the <a href="../../wp/i/Isle_of_Man.htm" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a>, which is now a <!--del_lnk--> crown dependency outside the United Kingdom, <a href="../../wp/o/Orkney.htm" title="Orkney">Orkney</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Shetland.htm" title="Shetland">Shetland</a>, which are Scottish rather than <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norwegian</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Berwick-upon-Tweed, which was defined as subject to the laws of England by the <!--del_lnk--> 1746 Wales and Berwick Act. <a href="../../wp/r/Rockall.htm" title="Rockall">Rockall</a> was annexed by the United Kingdom in 1972 and administratively made part of the <!--del_lnk--> Isle of Harris in Scotland, although this is disputed by the <a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_Ireland.htm" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Iceland.htm" title="Iceland">Iceland</a>, and <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>; both the UK (in 1997) and Ireland (in 1996) have since ratified the <!--del_lnk--> United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which excludes Rockall from qualifying as land from which various territorial limits can be measured although it is claimed by both the UK and Ireland that it lies within their territorial limits.<p>The country consists of a mainland area plus several island groups. The mainland can be divided into three areas: the <a href="../../wp/s/Scottish_Highlands.htm" title="Scottish Highlands">Highlands</a> in the north; the <!--del_lnk--> Central Belt and the <!--del_lnk--> Southern Uplands in the south. The Highlands are generally mountainous and are bisected by the <!--del_lnk--> Great Glen. The highest mountains in the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Isles.htm" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> are found here, including <a href="../../wp/b/Ben_Nevis.htm" title="Ben Nevis">Ben Nevis</a>, the highest peak at 1,344 <!--del_lnk--> metres (4,409<!--del_lnk--> ft). All mountains over 3,000 ft (914&nbsp;m) are known as <!--del_lnk--> Munros. The Central Belt of Scotland is generally flat and is where most of the population reside. The Central Belt is often divided into the West, which contains the areas around <a href="../../wp/g/Glasgow.htm" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>; and the East which includes the areas around the <a href="../../wp/c/Capital.htm" title="Capital">capital</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Edinburgh.htm" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>. The Southern Uplands are a range of hills and mountains almost 200&nbsp;km (125 miles) long, stretching from <!--del_lnk--> Stranraer by the <a href="../../wp/i/Irish_Sea.htm" title="Irish Sea">Irish Sea</a> to <!--del_lnk--> East Lothian and the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea.htm" title="North Sea">North Sea</a>.<p>Scotland has over 790 islands, divided into four main groups: <!--del_lnk--> Shetland, <a href="../../wp/o/Orkney.htm" title="Orkney Islands">Orkney</a>, and the <a href="../../wp/h/Hebrides.htm" title="Hebrides">Hebrides</a>, divided into the <a href="../../wp/i/Inner_Hebrides.htm" title="Inner Hebrides">Inner Hebrides</a> and <a href="../../wp/o/Outer_Hebrides.htm" title="Outer Hebrides">Outer Hebrides</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Firth of Clyde and the <!--del_lnk--> Firth of Forth also contain many islands. <!--del_lnk--> St. Kilda is the most remote of all the inhabitable Scottish islands, being over 160&nbsp;km (100 miles) from the mainland. Almost all the islands surrounding Scotland, no matter how small or remote, were formerly inhabited, as is shown by archaeological and documentary evidence. In general only the more accessible and larger islands retain human populations (though these are in some cases very small). Access to several islands in the Northern and Western groups was made easier in the course of the 20th century by the construction of bridges or causeways (e.g., the <!--del_lnk--> Churchill Barriers), installed for strategic reasons during the <!--del_lnk--> Second World War between several small islands on the east side of <!--del_lnk--> Scapa Flow in <a href="../../wp/o/Orkney.htm" title="Orkney">Orkney</a>. Plans, some controversial, for more links between islands continue to be drawn up.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h2>

      <p>The <a href="../../wp/c/Climate.htm" title="Climate">climate</a> of Scotland is <a href="../../wp/t/Temperate.htm" title="Temperate">temperate</a> and <!--del_lnk--> oceanic, and tends to be very changeable. It is warmed by the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf Stream from the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic</a>, and as such has much milder winters (but cooler, wetter summers) than areas on similar latitudes, for example <a href="../../wp/o/Oslo.htm" title="Oslo">Oslo</a> or <a href="../../wp/m/Moscow.htm" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>. However, temperatures are generally lower than in the rest of the UK, with the coldest ever UK temperature of -27.2&deg;<!--del_lnk--> C (-16.96&deg;<!--del_lnk--> F) recorded at <!--del_lnk--> Braemar in the <!--del_lnk--> Grampian Mountains, on <!--del_lnk--> 11 February <!--del_lnk--> 1895 and <!--del_lnk--> 10 January <!--del_lnk--> 1982 and also at <!--del_lnk--> Altnaharra, <!--del_lnk--> Highland, on <!--del_lnk--> 30 December <!--del_lnk--> 1995.  Winter maximums average 6&deg;C (42.8&deg;F) in the lowlands, with summer maximums averaging 18&deg;C (64.4&deg;F). The highest temperature recorded was 32.9&deg;C (91.22&deg;F) at <!--del_lnk--> Greycrook, <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Borders on <!--del_lnk--> 9 August <!--del_lnk--> 2003. <p>In general, the west of Scotland is usually warmer than the east, due to the influence of the Atlantic <!--del_lnk--> ocean currents, and the colder surface temperatures of the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea.htm" title="North Sea">North Sea</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Tiree, in the <a href="../../wp/i/Inner_Hebrides.htm" title="Inner Hebrides">Inner Hebrides</a>, is the sunniest place in the country: it had 300 days of sunshine in 1975. Rainfall varies widely across Scotland. The western highlands of Scotland are the wettest place, with annual rainfall exceeding 3,000&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mm (120 <!--del_lnk--> inches). In comparison, much of lowland Scotland receives less than 800&nbsp;mm (31 inches) annually. Heavy snowfall is not common in the lowlands, but becomes more common with altitude. <!--del_lnk--> Braemar experiences an average of 59 snow days per year, while coastal areas have an average of less than 10 days.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>

      <p>The Scottish <!--del_lnk--> economy is closely linked with that of the rest of Europe and the wider <!--del_lnk--> Western world, with a heavy emphasis on <!--del_lnk--> exporting. It is essentially a <!--del_lnk--> market economy with some <!--del_lnk--> government intervention. After the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, the Scottish economy concentrated on <!--del_lnk--> heavy industry, dominated by the <!--del_lnk--> shipbuilding, <!--del_lnk--> coal mining and <!--del_lnk--> steel industries. Scotland was an integral component of the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> which allowed the Scottish economy to export its output throughout the world.<p>Heavy industry declined, however, in the later part of the 20th century, leading to a remarkable shift in the economy of Scotland towards a <a href="../../wp/t/Technology.htm" title="Technology">technology</a> and <!--del_lnk--> service sector-based economy. The 1980s saw an <!--del_lnk--> economic boom in the <!--del_lnk--> Silicon Glen corridor between Glasgow and Edinburgh, with many large technology firms relocating to Scotland. The discovery of <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea_oil.htm" title="North Sea oil">North Sea oil</a> in the 1970s also helped to transform the Scottish economy.<p>Edinburgh is the financial services centre of Scotland and the sixth largest financial centre in Europe, with many large finance firms based there, including: the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Bank of Scotland Group (the second largest bank in Europe); <!--del_lnk--> HBOS (owners of the <!--del_lnk--> Bank of Scotland); <!--del_lnk--> Standard Life; and <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Widows.<p>Glasgow is Scotland&#39;s leading seaport and is the fourth largest manufacturing centre in the UK, accounting for well over 60% of Scotland&#39;s manufactured exports. Shipbuilding, although significantly diminished from its heights in the early 20th century, still forms a large part of the city&#39;s manufacturing base. The city also has Scotland&#39;s largest and most economically important commerce and <!--del_lnk--> retail district. Glasgow is also one of Europe&#39;s top 20 financial centres and is home to many of the UK&#39;s leading companies.<p><a href="../../wp/a/Aberdeen.htm" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, sometimes referred to as the Oil Capital of Europe, is the centre of the North Sea oil industry. Other important industries include <a href="../../wp/t/Textile.htm" title="Textile">textile</a> production, <!--del_lnk--> chemicals, <!--del_lnk--> distilling, <!--del_lnk--> brewing, <!--del_lnk--> fishing and <!--del_lnk--> tourism.<p>Only about one quarter of the land is under cultivation (principally in <!--del_lnk--> cereals and <!--del_lnk--> vegetables), but <!--del_lnk--> sheep <!--del_lnk--> farming is important in the less <!--del_lnk--> arable highland and island regions. Most land is concentrated in relatively few hands (some 350 people own about half the land). As a result, in 2003, the Scottish Parliament passed a <!--del_lnk--> Land Reform Act that empowered <!--del_lnk--> tenant farmers and local communities to purchase land even if the landlord did not want to sell.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In 2004, total Scottish <!--del_lnk--> exports (excluding intra-UK trade) were provisionally estimated to be &pound;16.7 billion, of which 73% (&pound;12.19 billion) were attributable to manufacturing. The largest export products for Scotland are niche products such as <!--del_lnk--> whisky, electronics and financial services. The largest markets were the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> The Netherlands.

      <p>Although Scotland has a long military tradition that predates the <a href="../../wp/a/Acts_of_Union_1707.htm" title="Acts of Union 1707">Act of Union</a> with England, its <!--del_lnk--> armed forces now form part of the <!--del_lnk--> British Armed Forces. In 2006, the <!--del_lnk--> regiments of the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Division were amalgamated to form the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Regiment of Scotland.<p>Due to their <!--del_lnk--> topography and perceived remoteness, parts of Scotland have housed many sensitive defence establishments, with mixed public feelings. Between 1960 and 1991, the <!--del_lnk--> Holy Loch was a base for the U.S. fleet of <!--del_lnk--> Polaris <!--del_lnk--> ballistic missile submarines. Today, <!--del_lnk--> Her Majesty&#39;s Naval Base <!--del_lnk--> Clyde, 25 miles (40 km) west of Glasgow, is the base for the four <!--del_lnk--> Trident-armed <!--del_lnk--> <i>Vanguard</i> class <!--del_lnk--> ballistic missile submarines that comprise the <!--del_lnk--> UK&#39;s nuclear deterrent. HMS Caledonia at <!--del_lnk--> Rosyth in <!--del_lnk--> Fife is the support base for navy operations in Scotland and also serves as the Naval Regional Office (NRO Scotland and <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>). The <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Navy.htm" title="Royal Navy&#39;s">Royal Navy&#39;s</a> <!--del_lnk--> submarine nuclear reactor development establishment, is located at <!--del_lnk--> Dounreay, which was also the site of the UK&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> fast breeder <!--del_lnk--> nuclear reactor programme. <!--del_lnk--> HMS Gannet is a search and rescue station based at <!--del_lnk--> Prestwick Airport in <!--del_lnk--> Ayrshire and operates three Sea King Mk 5 helicopters. RM Condor at <!--del_lnk--> Arbroath, <!--del_lnk--> Angus is home to 45 <!--del_lnk--> Commando, <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Marines.htm" title="Royal Marines">Royal Marines</a>.<p>Three important <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Air_Force.htm" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a> bases are in Scotland today. These are <!--del_lnk--> RAF Lossiemouth, the <!--del_lnk--> RAF&#39;s primary base for the <!--del_lnk--> Panavia Tornado <!--del_lnk--> GR4 <!--del_lnk--> strike aircraft, <!--del_lnk--> RAF Kinloss, home to the <!--del_lnk--> Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft and <!--del_lnk--> RAF Leuchars, the most northerly air defence <!--del_lnk--> fighter base in the United Kingdom. The only open air live <!--del_lnk--> depleted uranium weapons test range in the British Isles is located near <!--del_lnk--> Dundrennan. As a result, over 7000 radioactive munitions lie on the seabed of the <!--del_lnk--> Solway Firth. This has led to many environmental concerns. The large amount of military bases in Scotland has led some to use the euphemism &quot;Fortress Scotland&quot;. In 2004, the <!--del_lnk--> MoD land holdings in Scotland (owned, leased or with legal rights) was 115,200 hectares representing around 31% of the MoD&#39;s UK estate.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

The <!--del_lnk--> General Register Office for Scotland estimates that 30% of the population are <!--del_lnk--> fluent in <a href="../../wp/s/Scots_language.htm" title="Scots language">Scots</a>, a <!--del_lnk--> West Germanic sister language to <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a>.<p>Scots and Gaelic were recognised under the <!--del_lnk--> European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages ratified by the UK in 2001, and the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Executive is committed, based on the UK&#39;s undertakings, to providing support for both Under the <!--del_lnk--> Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005 which was passed by the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Parliament to provide a <!--del_lnk--> statutory basis for a limited range of Gaelic language service provision, English and Gaelic receive &quot;equal respect&quot; but do not have equal legal status. State support for Scots is slowly growing with the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Executive providing some funding to various Scots language projects and bodies, including the <!--del_lnk--> Dictionary of the Scots Language.<p><a id="Religion" name="Religion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h3>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Church of Scotland, also sometimes popularly known as The <!--del_lnk--> Kirk, is the <!--del_lnk--> national church and has a <!--del_lnk--> Presbyterian system of church government. It is not subject to <!--del_lnk--> state control nor is it &quot;<!--del_lnk--> established&quot; as is the <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_England.htm" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> within <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>. It was formally recognised as independent of the <!--del_lnk--> UK Parliament by the <!--del_lnk--> Church of Scotland Act 1921, settling centuries of dispute between church and state over <!--del_lnk--> jurisdiction in spiritual matters.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Reformation, initiated in 1560 and led by <!--del_lnk--> John Knox, was <!--del_lnk--> Calvinist, and throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the <!--del_lnk--> Church of Scotland maintained this <!--del_lnk--> theology and kept a tight control over the <!--del_lnk--> morality of much of the population. The Church had a significant influence on the cultural development of Scotland in early modern times. Other <!--del_lnk--> Christian denominations in Scotland include the <!--del_lnk--> Free Church of Scotland, an off-shoot from the Church of Scotland adhering to a more <!--del_lnk--> conservative style of Calvinism, the <a href="../../wp/s/Scottish_Episcopal_Church.htm" title="Scottish Episcopal Church">Scottish Episcopal Church</a>, which forms part of the <!--del_lnk--> Anglican Communion, the <!--del_lnk--> Methodists, the <!--del_lnk--> Congregationalists, and <!--del_lnk--> The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<p><!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholicism in Scotland survived the <!--del_lnk--> Reformation, especially on islands like <!--del_lnk--> Uist and <!--del_lnk--> Barra, despite the suppression of the 16th to the late 18th centuries. Roman Catholicism was strengthened particularly in the west of Scotland during the 19th century by <!--del_lnk--> immigration from <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. This continued for much of the 20th century, during which significant numbers of Catholics from <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Poland</a> also migrated to Scotland. Much of Scotland (particularly the West <!--del_lnk--> Central Belt around <a href="../../wp/g/Glasgow.htm" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>) has experienced problems caused by <!--del_lnk--> sectarianism, particularly <a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Soccer">football</a> rivalry between the traditionally <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic team, <a href="../../wp/c/Celtic_F.C..htm" title="Celtic F.C.">Celtic</a>, and the traditionally <!--del_lnk--> Protestant team, <!--del_lnk--> Rangers.<p><a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> is the largest non-Christian <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religion</a> in Scotland (estimated population, 50,000) despite accounting for less than 1% of the population. There are also significant <!--del_lnk--> Jewish and <!--del_lnk--> Sikh communities, especially in Glasgow. At 28% of the population, Scotland has a relatively high proportion of persons who regard themselves as belonging to &#39;no religion&#39;.

      <p>The <a href="../../wp/e/Education.htm" title="Education">education</a> system in Scotland is distinct from the rest of the United Kingdom and was the first country since <!--del_lnk--> Sparta in <!--del_lnk--> classical Greece to implement a system of general <!--del_lnk--> public education. The early roots were in the <!--del_lnk--> Education Act of 1496 which first introduced compulsory education for the eldest sons of nobles. Then, in 1561, the principle of general public education was set with the <!--del_lnk--> Reformation establishment of the national <!--del_lnk--> Kirk which set out a national programme for spiritual reform, including a school in every <!--del_lnk--> parish. Education finally came under the control of the <!--del_lnk--> state rather than the Church and became compulsory for all children from the implementation of the <!--del_lnk--> Education Act of 1872 onwards. As a result, for over two hundred years Scotland had a higher percentage of its population educated at primary, secondary and tertiary levels than any other country in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>. The differences in education have manifested themselves in different ways, but most noticeably in the number of Scots who went on to become <!--del_lnk--> leaders in their fields and at the forefront of <!--del_lnk--> innovation and discovery leading to many <!--del_lnk--> Scottish inventions during the 18th and 19th centuries.<p>Today, children in Scotland sit <!--del_lnk--> Standard Grade exams at the age of 15 or 16, sometimes earlier, for up to eight subjects (although some schools study for nine) including compulsory exams in <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>, a <!--del_lnk--> foreign language, a <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">science</a> subject and a social subject. Each school may vary these compulsory combinations. The school leaving age is 16, after which students may choose to remain at school and study for <!--del_lnk--> Access, <!--del_lnk--> Intermediate or <!--del_lnk--> Higher Grade and <!--del_lnk--> Advanced Higher exams. A small number of students at certain private, <!--del_lnk--> independent schools may follow the <!--del_lnk--> English system and study towards <!--del_lnk--> GCSEs instead of Standard Grades, and towards <!--del_lnk--> A and <!--del_lnk--> AS-Levels instead of Higher Grade and Advanced Higher exams.<div class="thumb tright">

Unlike the rest of the United Kingdom, Scottish students studying at a Scottish university do not have to pay for tuition fees. The <!--del_lnk--> Students Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) pay course fees for all Scottish students domiciled in Scotland and offer bursaries to eligible students. Scottish students have the option of accepting a loan from the <!--del_lnk--> Student Loans Company (SLC), and if eligible, this is paid back after graduation. Scottish students studying outside of Scotland but within the UK have to pay for tuition, but at a reduced rate depending upon how much their chosen institution charges.

      <p>Scottish cuisine has much in common with others in the UK, but has distinctive attributes and recipes of its own, thanks to foreign and local influences both ancient and modern. Traditional dishes exist alongside international foods brought by immigration and a Scottish public eager to try new dishes.

Pheasant is also attributed to Scotland along with many other types of game.<p>Scottish cuisine is enjoying a renaissance, with a number of <!--del_lnk--> Michelin star restaurants operating in the country, serving traditional or fusion Scottish cuisine made with local ingredients. In most towns, <!--del_lnk--> Chinese and <!--del_lnk--> Indian <!--del_lnk--> take-away restaurants exist side-by-side with traditional <!--del_lnk--> fish and chip shops; larger towns and cities offer cuisine ranging from <!--del_lnk--> Thai and <!--del_lnk--> Japanese to <!--del_lnk--> Mexican.<p><a id="Music" name="Music"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Music</span></h3>

Some of the earliest literature known to have been composed in Scotland dates from the 6th century and includes <i><!--del_lnk--> Y Gododdin</i> written in <!--del_lnk--> Brythonic (Old Welsh) and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Elegy for St Columba</i> by Dallan Forgaill written in <!--del_lnk--> Middle Irish. <i><!--del_lnk--> Vita Columbae</i> by Adomn&aacute;n, the ninth Abbot of Iona, was written in Latin during the 7th century. In the 13th century, <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a> flourished as a <!--del_lnk--> literary language long before <!--del_lnk--> Early Scots texts appeared in the fourteenth century.

The poet and songwriter <!--del_lnk--> Robert Burns wrote in the <a href="../../wp/s/Scots_language.htm" title="Scots language">Scots language</a>, although much of his writing is also in English and in a &quot;light&quot; Scots dialect which would have been accessible to a wider audience than simply Scottish people.<p>The introduction of the movement known as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> kailyard tradition&quot; at the end of the 19th century, brought elements of <!--del_lnk--> fantasy and <a href="../../wp/f/Folklore.htm" title="Folklore">folklore</a> back into fashion. <!--del_lnk--> J.
