      <p><b>S. A. Andr&eacute;e&#39;s Arctic balloon expedition of 1897</b> was an ill-fated effort to reach the <!--del_lnk--> North Pole in which all three expedition members perished. <!--del_lnk--> S.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Andr&eacute;e (1854&ndash;97), the first <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Swedish</a> <!--del_lnk--> balloonist, proposed a voyage by <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> <!--del_lnk--> balloon from <a href="../../wp/s/Svalbard.htm" title="Svalbard">Svalbard</a> to either Russia or Canada, which was to pass, with luck, straight over the North Pole on the way. The scheme was received with patriotic enthusiasm in Sweden, a northern nation that had fallen behind in the race for the North Pole.<p>Andr&eacute;e neglected many early signs of the dangers associated with his balloon plan. Being able to steer the balloon to some extent was essential for a safe journey, and there was plenty of evidence that the drag-rope steering technique he had invented was ineffective; yet he staked the fate of the expedition on drag ropes. Worse, the polar balloon <i>&Ouml;rnen</i> (<i>Eagle</i>) was delivered directly to Svalbard from its manufacturer in Paris without being tested; when measurements showed it to be leaking more than expected, Andr&eacute;e refused to acknowledge the alarming implications of this. Most modern students of the expedition see Andr&eacute;e&#39;s optimism, faith in the power of technology, and disregard for the forces of nature as the main factors in the series of events that led to his death and the deaths of his two companions <!--del_lnk--> Nils Strindberg (1872&ndash;97) and <!--del_lnk--> Knut Fr&aelig;nkel (1870&ndash;97).<p>After Andr&eacute;e, Strindberg, and Fr&aelig;nkel lifted off from Svalbard in July 1897, the balloon lost hydrogen quickly and crashed on the <!--del_lnk--> pack ice after only two days. The explorers were unhurt but faced a grueling trek back south across the drifting icescape. Inadequately clothed, equipped, and prepared, and shocked by the difficulty of the terrain, they did not make it to safety. As the <a href="../../wp/a/Arctic.htm" title="Arctic">Arctic</a> winter closed in on them in October, the group ended up exhausted on the deserted <!--del_lnk--> Kvit&oslash;ya (White Island) in Svalbard and died there. For 33 years the fate of the Andr&eacute;e expedition remained one of the unsolved riddles of the Arctic. The chance discovery in 1930 of the expedition&#39;s last camp created a media sensation in Sweden, where the dead men were mourned and idolized. Andr&eacute;e&#39;s motives have later been re-evaluated, along with the role of the polar areas as the proving-ground of <!--del_lnk--> masculinity and <!--del_lnk--> patriotism. An early example is <!--del_lnk--> Per Olof Sundman&#39;s fictionalized bestseller novel of 1967, <i>The Flight of the Eagle</i> (later filmed as <i><!--del_lnk--> Flight of the Eagle</i>), which portrays Andr&eacute;e as weak and cynical, at the mercy of his sponsors and the media. The verdict on Andr&eacute;e by modern writers for virtually sacrificing the lives of his two younger companions varies in harshness, depending on whether he is seen as the manipulator or the victim of Swedish <a href="../../wp/n/Nationalism.htm" title="Nationalism">nationalist</a> fervor around the turn of the 20th century.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The second half of the 19th century has often been called the heroic age of <!--del_lnk--> polar exploration. The inhospitable and dangerous Arctic and <!--del_lnk--> Antarctic regions spoke powerfully to the imagination of the age, not as lands with their own <a href="../../wp/e/Ecology.htm" title="Ecology">ecologies</a> and cultures, but as challenges to technological ingenuity and manly daring.<p>The Swede S. A. Andr&eacute;e shared these enthusiasms, and proposed a plan for letting the wind propel a hydrogen balloon from <a href="../../wp/s/Svalbard.htm" title="Svalbard">Svalbard</a> across the <!--del_lnk--> Arctic Sea to the <!--del_lnk--> Bering Strait, to fetch up in Alaska, Canada, or Russia, and passing near or even right over the North Pole on the way. Andr&eacute;e was an <!--del_lnk--> engineer at the <!--del_lnk--> patent office in <a href="../../wp/s/Stockholm.htm" title="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, with a passion for ballooning. He bought his own balloon, the <i>Svea</i>, in 1893 and made nine journeys with it, starting from <a href="../../wp/g/Gothenburg.htm" title="Gothenburg">Gothenburg</a> or Stockholm and travelling a combined distance of 1,500&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> kilometers (900&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> miles). In the prevailing westerly winds, the <i>Svea</i> flights had a strong tendency to carry him uncontrollably out to the <a href="../../wp/b/Baltic_Sea.htm" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic Sea</a> and drag his basket perilously along the surface of the water and/or slam it into one of the many rocky islets in the <!--del_lnk--> Stockholm archipelago (see artist&#39;s impression, right). On one occasion he was blown clear across the Baltic to <a href="../../wp/f/Finland.htm" title="Finland">Finland</a>. His longest trip was due east from Gothenburg, across the breadth of Sweden and out over the Baltic to <!--del_lnk--> Gotland. Even though he actually saw a <!--del_lnk--> lighthouse and heard breakers off <!--del_lnk--> &Ouml;land, he remained convinced that he was travelling over land and merely seeing lakes.<p>During a couple of the <i>Svea</i> flights, Andr&eacute;e tested and tried out the drag-rope steering technique that he had invented and wanted to use on his projected North Pole expedition. Drag ropes, which hang from the balloon basket and drag part of their length on the ground, are designed to counteract the tendency of <!--del_lnk--> lighter-than-air craft to travel at the same speed as the wind, a situation that makes steering by <!--del_lnk--> sails impossible. The friction of the ropes was intended to slow the balloon to the point where the sails would have an effect (beyond that of making the balloon rotate on its axis). Andr&eacute;e claimed that, with the drag rope/sails steering, his <i>Svea</i> had essentially become a <a href="../../wp/a/Airship.htm" title="Airship">dirigible</a>, but this notion is rejected by modern balloonists. The Swedish Ballooning Association ascribes Andr&eacute;e&#39;s conviction entirely to wishful thinking, capricious winds, and the fact that much of the time Andr&eacute;e was inside clouds and had little idea where he was or which way he was moving. Moreover, his drag ropes would persistently snap, fall off, become entangled with each other, or get stuck to the ground, which could result in pulling the often low-flying balloon down into a dangerous bounce. No modern Andr&eacute;e researcher has expressed any faith in drag ropes as a balloon steering technique.<p><a id="Promotion_and_fundraising" name="Promotion_and_fundraising"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Promotion and fundraising</span></h2>

      <p>The Arctic ambitions of the northern European nation of Sweden were still unrealized in the late 19th century, while neighboring and <!--del_lnk--> politically subordinate <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a> was a world power in Arctic exploration through such pioneers as <!--del_lnk--> Fridtjof Nansen. The Swedish political and scientific elite were eager to see Sweden take that lead among the Scandinavian countries which seemed her due, and Andr&eacute;e, a persuasive speaker and fundraiser, found it easy to gain support for his ideas. At a lecture in 1895 to the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Andr&eacute;e thrilled the audience of <!--del_lnk--> geographers and <!--del_lnk--> meteorologists. A polar exploration balloon, he explained, would need to fulfill four conditions:<ul>
       <li>It must have enough lifting power to carry three people and all their scientific equipment, advanced <!--del_lnk--> cameras for <!--del_lnk--> aerial photography, provisions for four months, and <!--del_lnk--> ballast, altogether about 3000&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> kilograms (3 <!--del_lnk--> metric tons; approximately 3.5&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> short tons).<li>It must retain the gas well enough to stay aloft for 30&nbsp;days.<li>The hydrogen gas must be manufactured, and the balloon filled, at the Arctic launch site.<li>It must be at least somewhat steerable.</ul>
      <p>Andr&eacute;e gave a glowingly optimistic account of the ease with which these requirements could be met. Larger balloons had been constructed in France, he claimed, and more airtight, too. Some French balloons had remained hydrogen-filled for over a year without appreciable loss of <!--del_lnk--> buoyancy. As for the hydrogen, filling the balloon at the launch site could easily be done with the help of mobile hydrogen manufacturing units; for the steering he referred to his own drag-rope experiments with the <i>Svea</i>, stating that a deviation of 27&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> degrees from the wind direction could be routinely achieved.<p>Andr&eacute;e assured the audience that Arctic summer weather was uniquely suitable for ballooning. The <!--del_lnk--> midnight sun would enable observations round the clock, halving the voyage time required, and do away with all need for anchoring at night, which might otherwise be a dangerous business. Neither would the balloon&#39;s buoyancy be adversely affected by the cold of night. The drag-rope steering technique was particularly well adapted for a region where the ground, consisting of ice, was &quot;low in friction and free of vegetation&quot;. The minimal <!--del_lnk--> precipitation in the area posed no threat of weighing down the balloon; if, against expectation, some rain or snow did fall on the balloon, Andr&eacute;e argued, &quot;precipitation at above-zero temperatures will melt, and precipitation at below-zero temperatures will blow off, for the balloon will be travelling more slowly than the wind.&quot; The audience was convinced by these arguments, so disconnected from the realities of the Arctic summer storms, fogs, high <!--del_lnk--> humidity, and ever-present threat of ice formation. The academy approved Andr&eacute;e&#39;s expense calculation of 130,800&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> kronor in all, corresponding in today&#39;s money to just under a million <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">U.S. dollars</a>, of which the single largest sum, 36,000&nbsp;kronor, was for the balloon itself. With this endorsement there was a rush to support his project, headed by King <!--del_lnk--> Oscar II, who personally contributed 30,000&nbsp;kronor, and <a href="../../wp/a/Alfred_Nobel.htm" title="Alfred Nobel">Alfred Nobel</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> dynamite magnate and founder of the <!--del_lnk--> Nobel Prize.<p>There was also considerable international interest, and the European and American newspaper-reading publics were curious about a project that seemed as modern and scientific as the books of contemporary author <!--del_lnk--> Jules Verne. The press fanned the interest with a wide range of predictions, from certain death for the explorers to a safe and comfortable &quot;guidance&quot; of the balloon (upgraded by the reporter to an &quot;<a href="../../wp/a/Airship.htm" title="Airship">airship</a>&quot;) to the North Pole in a manner planned by Parisian experts and Swedish scientists.<div class="thumb tleft">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>&quot;In these days, the construction and guidance of airships have been improved greatly&quot;, wrote <i><!--del_lnk--> The Providence Journal</i>, &quot;and it is supposed, both by the Parisian experts and by the Swedish scientists who have been assisting M. Andree, that the question of a sustained flight in this case will be very satisfactorily answered by the character of the balloon, by its careful guidance and, providing it gets into a Polar current of air, by the elements themselves.&quot; Faith in the experts and in science was common in the popular press, but with international attention came also for the first time informed criticism. Andr&eacute;e being Sweden&#39;s first balloonist, nobody at home had the requisite knowledge to second-guess him about buoyancy or drag ropes; but in Germany and France there were long ballooning traditions and many far more experienced balloonists than Andr&eacute;e, several of whom expressed scepticism of his methods and inventions. However, just as with the <i>Svea</i> mishaps, all objections failed to dampen Andr&eacute;e&#39;s optimism. Eagerly followed by national and international media, he began negotiations with the well-known <!--del_lnk--> aeronaut and balloon builder <!--del_lnk--> Henri Lachambre in Paris, world capital of ballooning, and ordered a varnished three-layer <!--del_lnk--> silk balloon, 20.5&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> meters (67&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ft) in <!--del_lnk--> diameter, from his workshop. The balloon, originally called <i>Le P&ocirc;le Nord</i> (<a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a> for &quot;The North Pole&quot;), was to be renamed <i>&Ouml;rnen</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Swedish for &quot;The Eagle&quot;).<p><a id="The_1896_fiasco" name="The_1896_fiasco"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The 1896 fiasco</span></h2>

      <p>For his 1896 attempt to launch the balloon, Andr&eacute;e had many eager volunteers to choose from. He picked an experienced Arctic <a href="../../wp/m/Meteorology.htm" title="Meteorology">meteorological</a> researcher, <!--del_lnk--> Nils Gustaf Ekholm (1848&ndash;1923), formerly his boss during an 1882&ndash;83 <!--del_lnk--> geophysical expedition to <!--del_lnk--> Spitsbergen, and <!--del_lnk--> Nils Strindberg (1872&ndash;97), a brilliant student who was doing original research in physics and chemistry. The main scientific purpose of the expedition was to map the area by means of <!--del_lnk--> aerial photography, and Strindberg was both a devoted amateur photographer and a skilled constructor of advanced cameras. This was a team with many useful scientific and technical skills, but lacking any particular physical prowess or training for survival under extreme conditions. All three were indoor types, and only one of them, Strindberg, was young. Andr&eacute;e expected a sedentary voyage in a balloon basket, and strength and <!--del_lnk--> survival skills were far down on his list.<p>Modern writers all agree that Andr&eacute;e&#39;s North Pole scheme was unrealistic. He relied on the winds blowing more or less in the direction he wanted to go, on being able to fine-tune his direction with the drag ropes, on the balloon being sealed tight enough to stay airborne for 30 days, and on no ice or snow sticking to the balloon to weigh it down. In the attempt of 1896, the wind immediately refuted his optimism by blowing steadily from the north, straight at the balloon hangar at <!--del_lnk--> Dansk&oslash;ya, until the expedition had to pack up, let the hydrogen out of the balloon, and go home. It is now known that northerly winds are to be expected at Dansk&oslash;ya; but in the late 19th century, information on Arctic airflow and precipitation existed only as contested academic hypotheses. Even Ekholm, an Arctic <a href="../../wp/c/Climate.htm" title="Climate">climate</a> researcher, had no objection to Andr&eacute;e&#39;s theory of where the wind was likely to take them. The observational data simply did not exist.<p>On the other hand, Ekholm was critical of the balloon&#39;s ability to retain hydrogen, from his own measurements. Ekholm&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> buoyancy checks in the summer of 1896, during the process of producing the hydrogen and pumping it into the balloon, convinced him that the balloon leaked too much ever to reach the Pole, let alone go on to Russia or Canada. The worst leakage came from the approximately eight million tiny stitching holes along the seams, which no amount of glued-on strips of silk or applications of special secret-formula <!--del_lnk--> varnish seemed to seal. The balloon was losing 68&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> kilograms (150&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> lb) of lift force a day, and, taking into account its heavy load, Ekholm estimated that it would be able to stay airborne for 17 days at most, not 30. When it was time to go home, he warned Andr&eacute;e that he himself would not be on board for the next attempt, scheduled for summer 1897, unless a stronger, better-sealed balloon was bought.<p>Andr&eacute;e resisted Ekholm&#39;s criticisms to the point of deception. On the boat back from Svalbard, Ekholm learned from the chief engineer of the hydrogen plant the explanation of some anomalies he had noticed in his measurements: Andr&eacute;e had from time to time secretly ordered extra topping-up of the hydrogen in the balloon. Andr&eacute;e&#39;s motives for such self-destructive behaviour are not known. Several modern writers, following Sundman&#39;s Andr&eacute;e portrait in the semidocumentary novel <i>The Flight of the Eagle</i> (1967), have speculated that Andr&eacute;e had by this time become the prisoner of his own successful funding campaign.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The sponsors and the media followed every delay and reported on every setback, and were clamoring for results. Andr&eacute;e, Strindberg, and Ekholm had been seen off by cheering crowds in Stockholm and Gothenburg (see image from <i><!--del_lnk--> Aftonbladet</i>, right), and now all the expectations were coming to nothing with the long wait for southerly winds at Dansk&oslash;ya. Especially pointed was the contrast between Nansen&#39;s simultaneous return, covered in polar glory from his daring yet well-planned expedition on the ship <i><!--del_lnk--> Fram</i>, and Andr&eacute;e&#39;s failure even to launch his own much-hyped conveyance. Andr&eacute;e, theorizes Sundman, could not at this point face letting the press relay the message that besides not knowing which way the wind would blow he had also miscalculated in ordering the balloon, and would like another one.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>After the 1896 launch was called off, enthusiasm for joining the expedition for a second attempt in 1897 did not run quite so high. There were still candidates, however, and Andr&eacute;e picked out the 27-year-old engineer <!--del_lnk--> Knut Fr&aelig;nkel to replace Ekholm. Fr&aelig;nkel was a <!--del_lnk--> civil engineer from the north of Sweden, an athlete and fond of long mountain hikes. He was enrolled specifically to take over Ekholm&#39;s meteorological observations, and, without any of Ekholm&#39;s theoretical and scientific knowledge, nevertheless handled this task efficiently. His meteorological journal has allowed the movements of the three men during their last few months to be reconstructed with considerable exactness.<p><a id="The_1897_disaster" name="The_1897_disaster"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The 1897 disaster</span></h2>

      <p>Returning to Dansk&oslash;ya in the summer of 1897, the expedition found that the balloon hangar built the year before had weathered the winter storms well. The winds were more favorable, too, and Andr&eacute;e&#39;s leadership more absolute, now that the critical Ekholm, an authority in his field and older than Andr&eacute;e, had been replaced by the 27-year-old enthusiast Knut Fr&aelig;nkel. On <!--del_lnk--> July 11, in a steady wind from the south-west, the top of the plank hangar was dismantled, the three explorers climbed into the already heavy basket, and Andr&eacute;e dictated one last-minute telegram to King Oscar and another to the paper <i>Aftonbladet</i>, holder of press rights to the expedition. The large support team cut away the last ropes holding the balloon and it rose slowly. Moving out over the water at low height, it was pulled so far down by the friction of the several-hundred-meter-long drag ropes against the ground as to dip the basket into the water. The friction also twisted the ropes round, detaching them from their screw holds. These holds were a new safety feature that Andr&eacute;e had reluctantly been persuaded to add, whereby ropes that got caught on the ground could be more easily dropped. Now most of them unscrewed at once and 530&nbsp;kilograms (1170&nbsp;lb) of rope were lost, while the three explorers could simultaneously be seen to dump 210&nbsp;kilograms of sand overboard to get the basket clear of the water. 740&nbsp;kilograms (1630&nbsp;lb) of essential weight was thus lost in the first few minutes. Before it was well clear of the launch site, the <i>Eagle</i> had turned from a supposedly steerable craft into an ordinary hydrogen balloon with a few ropes hanging from it, at the mercy of the wind, with no ability to aim at any particular goal and too little ballast. Lightened, it rose to 700&nbsp;meters (2300&nbsp;ft), a quite unforeseen height in any of the calculations made, where the lower air pressure made the hydrogen escape all the faster through the eight million little holes.<p>The balloon had two means of communication with the outside world, <!--del_lnk--> buoys and <!--del_lnk--> homing pigeons. The buoys, steel cylinders encased in <!--del_lnk--> cork, were intended to be dropped from the balloon into the water or onto the ice, to be carried to civilization by the currents. Only two buoy messages have ever been found. One was dispatched by Andr&eacute;e on July 11, a few hours after takeoff, and reads &quot;Our journey goes well so far. We sail at an altitude of about 250&nbsp;m, at first N&nbsp;10&deg; east, but later N 45&deg; east. [&hellip;] Weather delightful. Spirits high.&quot; The second had been dropped an hour later and gave the height as 600&nbsp;meters. <i>Aftonbladet</i> had supplied the pigeons, bred in northern Norway with the optimistic hope that they would manage to return there, and their message cylinders contained pre-printed instructions in Norwegian asking the finder to pass the messages on to the newspaper&#39;s address in Stockholm. Andr&eacute;e released at least four pigeons, but only one was ever retrieved, by a Norwegian steamer where the pigeon had alighted and been promptly shot. Its message is dated <!--del_lnk--> July 13 and gives the travel direction at that point as East by 10&deg; <i>South</i>, adding &quot;All well on board&quot;. Lundstr&ouml;m and others note that all three messages fail to mention the accident at takeoff, or the increasingly desperate situation, which was being detailed in Andr&eacute;e&#39;s main diary: the balloon was out of equilibrium, sailing much too high and thereby losing hydrogen at a faster rate than even Nils Ekholm had feared, then repeatedly threatening to crash on the ice. It was weighed down by being rain-soaked (&quot;dripping wet&quot; writes Andr&eacute;e in the diary), and all the sand and some of the <!--del_lnk--> payload were being thrown overboard to keep it airborne.<p>Free flight lasted for 10 hours and 29 minutes and was followed by another 41 hours of bumpy ride with frequent ground contact before the inevitable final crash. The <i>Eagle</i> thus traveled for 2 days and 3&frac12; hours altogether, during which time according to Andr&eacute;e nobody on board got any sleep. The definitive landing appears to have been gentle. Everybody was unhurt, including the homing pigeons in their <!--del_lnk--> wicker cages, and all the equipment was undamaged, even the delicate optical instruments and Strindberg&#39;s two cameras.<p><a id="On_foot_on_the_ice" name="On_foot_on_the_ice"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">On foot on the ice</span></h3>

      <p>From the moment they were grounded, Strindberg&#39;s highly specialized <!--del_lnk--> cartographic camera, which had been brought to map the region from the air, became instead a means of recording daily life in the icescape and the constant danger and drudgery of the trek. Strindberg took about 200 photos with his seven-kilogram (15&nbsp;lb) camera over the course of the three months they spent on the pack ice, one of the most famous being his picture of Andr&eacute;e and Fr&aelig;nkel contemplating the fallen <i>Eagle</i> (see image above). Andr&eacute;e and Fr&aelig;nkel also kept meticulous records of their experiences and geographical positions, Andr&eacute;e in his &quot;main diary&quot;, Fr&aelig;nkel in his meteorological journal. Strindberg&#39;s own <!--del_lnk--> stenographic diary was much more personal in content, and included his own general reflections on the expedition, as well as several messages to his <!--del_lnk--> fianc&eacute;e Anna.<p>The <i>Eagle</i> had been stocked with safety equipment such as guns, <!--del_lnk--> snowshoes, sleds, skis, a tent, a small boat (in the form of a bundle of bent sticks, to be assembled and covered with balloon silk), most of it stored not in the basket but in the storage space arranged above the balloon ring. It had not been put together with great care, nor with any thought of the indigenous peoples&#39; techniques for adapting to the extreme environment. In this, Andr&eacute;e contrasted not only with later but also with many earlier explorers. Sven Lundstr&ouml;m points to the agonizing extra efforts that became necessary simply because the sleds Andr&eacute;e had designed, of a rigid construction which owed nothing to <!--del_lnk--> Inuit sleds, were so impractical for the difficult terrain &mdash; &quot;dreadful terrain&quot;, Andr&eacute;e calls it &mdash; with its channels separating the ice floes, high ridges, and partially iced-over <!--del_lnk--> melt ponds. Their clothes did not include furs but consisted of woollen coats and trousers plus <!--del_lnk--> oilskins. The oilskins were worn, but the explorers still seemed to be always damp or wet from the half-frozen pools of water on the ice and the typically foggy, humid Arctic summer air, and always preoccupied with drying their clothes, mainly by wearing them. Danger was everywhere, as it would have meant certain death to lose the provisions lashed to one of the inconvenient sleds into one of the many channels that had to be laboriously crossed.<p>Before starting the march over the dreadful terrain, the three men spent a week in a tent at the crash site, packing up and making decisions about what and how much to bring and where to go. The far-off North Pole was not mentioned as an option; the choice lay between two depots of food and ammunition laid down for their safety, one at <!--del_lnk--> Cape Flora in <!--del_lnk--> Franz Josef Land and one at <!--del_lnk--> Seven Islands in <a href="../../wp/s/Svalbard.htm" title="Svalbard">Svalbard</a> (see map). Thinking the distances to each about equal, from the faulty maps of the day, they decided to try for the bigger depot at Cape Flora. Strindberg took more pictures during this week than he would at any later point, including 12 frames that make up a 360-degree <!--del_lnk--> panorama of the crash site.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The balloon had carried a lot of food, of a kind more adapted for a balloon voyage than for travels on foot. Andr&eacute;e had reasoned that they might as well throw excess food overboard as sand, if losing weight was necessary; and if it was not, the food would serve if wintering in the Arctic desert did after all become an issue. There was therefore less ballast and large amounts of heavy-type provisions, 767&nbsp;kg (1690&nbsp;lb) altogether, including 200&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> liters of water and some crates of <!--del_lnk--> champagne, <!--del_lnk--> port, <a href="../../wp/b/Beer.htm" title="Beer">beer</a>, etc., donated by sponsors and/or manufacturers. There was also <!--del_lnk--> lemon juice, though not as much of this precaution against <a href="../../wp/s/Scurvy.htm" title="Scurvy">scurvy</a> as other polar explorers usually thought necessary. Much of the food was in the form of cans of <!--del_lnk--> pemmican, meat, sausages, cheese, and <!--del_lnk--> condensed milk. Some of it had in fact been thrown overboard. The three men took most of the rest with them on leaving the crash site, along with other necessities such as guns, tent, ammunition, and cooking utensils, making a load on each sled of more than 200&nbsp;kg (440&nbsp;lb). This was not realistic, as it broke the sleds and wore out the men, and after one week a big pile of food and non-essential equipment was left behind, bringing the loads down to 130&nbsp;kg per sled. It became then more necessary than ever to hunt for food. <!--del_lnk--> Seals, <a href="../../wp/w/Walrus.htm" title="Walrus">walruses</a>, and especially <!--del_lnk--> polar bears were shot and eaten throughout the march.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Starting out for Franz Josef Land to the south-east on <!--del_lnk--> July 22, they soon found that their struggle across the ice with its two-story-high ridges was hardly bringing the goal any nearer: the drift of the ice was in the opposite direction, moving them backwards. On <!--del_lnk--> August 4 they decided, after a long discussion, to aim for Seven Islands in the southwest instead, hoping to reach the depot there after a six- to seven-week march, with the help of the current. The terrain in that direction was mostly extremely difficult, sometimes necessitating a crawl on all fours, but there was occasional relief in the form of open water &mdash; the little boat (not designed by Andr&eacute;e) was apparently a functional and safe conveyance &mdash; and smooth, flat ice floes. &quot;Paradise!&quot; wrote Andr&eacute;e. &quot;Large even ice floes with pools of sweet drinking water and here and there a tender-fleshed young polar bear!&quot; They made fair apparent headway, but the wind turned almost as soon as they did and they were again being moved backwards, away from Seven Islands. The wind varied between southwest and northwest over the coming weeks, which they tried in vain to overcome by turning their own course more and more westward, but it was becoming clear that Seven Islands was out of their reach.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> September 12, the explorers resigned themselves to wintering on the ice and camped on a large floe, letting the ice take them where it would, &quot;which&quot;, writes Kjellstr&ouml;m, &quot;it had really been doing all along&quot; (p.&nbsp;47). Drifting rapidly due south towards Kvit&oslash;ya, they hurriedly built a winter &quot;home&quot; on the floe against the increasing cold, with walls made of water-reinforced snow to Strindberg&#39;s design (see plan, below, left). Observing the rapidity of their drift, Andr&eacute;e recorded his hopes that they might get far enough south to feed themselves entirely from the sea. However, the floe began to break up directly under the hut on <!--del_lnk--> October 2 from the stresses of pressing against Kvit&oslash;ya, and they were forced to bring their stores on to the island itself, which took a couple of days. &quot;Morale remains good&quot;, reports Andr&eacute;e at the very end of the coherent part of his diary, which ends with the sentence: &quot;With such comrades as these, one ought to be able to manage under practically any circumstances whatsoever.&quot; It is believed, on the basis of the incoherent and badly damaged last pages of Andr&eacute;e&#39;s diary, that the three men were all dead within a few days of moving onto the island.<p><a id="Speculation_and_recovery" name="Speculation_and_recovery"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Speculation and recovery</span></h2>

      <p>For the next 33 years, the fate of the expedition was shrouded in mystery and its disappearance part of cultural lore in Sweden and to a certain extent elsewhere. It was actively sought for a couple of years and remained the subject of myth and rumor, with frequent international newspaper reports of possible findings. An extensive archive of American newspaper reports from the first few years, 1896&ndash;99, entitled &quot;The Mystery of Andree&quot;, shows a much richer media interest in the expedition after it disappeared than before, and a great variety of suggested fates for it, inspired by finds, or reported finds, of remnants of what might be a balloon basket, or great amounts of balloon silk, or by stories of men falling from the sky, or visions by <!--del_lnk--> psychics, all of which would typically locate the stranded balloon far from Dansk&oslash;ya and Svalbard. Lundstr&ouml;m points out (p. 134) that some of the international and national reports take on the features of <!--del_lnk--> urban legends and reflect a prevailing disrespect for the indigenous peoples of the Arctic, who frequently appear in the newspapers as uncomprehending savages and kill the three men or show a deadly indifference to their plight. These speculations were refuted in 1930, upon the discovery of the expedition&#39;s final resting place on Kvit&oslash;ya by the crews of two ships, the <i>Bratvaag</i> and the <i>Isbj&oslash;rn</i>.<p>The <i>Bratvaag</i>, a Norwegian <!--del_lnk--> sealing vessel from <!--del_lnk--> &Aring;lesund, was hunting in the vicinity of Kvit&oslash;ya on <!--del_lnk--> August 5, <!--del_lnk--> 1930. Additionally, it was carrying a scientific expedition, led by Dr. Gunnar Horn, with the purpose of studying the glaciers and seas of the Svalbard <!--del_lnk--> archipelago. Kvit&oslash;ya was usually inaccessible to the sealing or whaling ships of the time, as it is typically surrounded by a wide belt of thick polar ice and often hidden by thick ice fogs. However, summer in 1930 had been particularly warm, and the surrounding sea was practically free of ice. As Kvit&oslash;ya was known to be a prime hunting ground for <a href="../../wp/w/Walrus.htm" title="Walrus">walrus</a> and the fogs over the island on that day were comparatively thin, some of the crew of the <i>Bratvaag</i> took this rare opportunity to land on what they called the &quot;inaccessible island&quot;. Two of the sealers in search of water, Olav Salen and Karl Tusvick, discovered Andr&eacute;e&#39;s boat near a small stream, frozen under a mound of snow and full of equipment, including a boathook engraved with the words &quot;Andr&eacute;e&#39;s Polar Expedition, 1896&quot;. Being presented with this hook, the <i>Bratvaag&#39;</i>s captain, Peder Eliassen, had the crew search the site together with the expedition members. Among other finds, a journal and two skeletons were uncovered, identified as Andr&eacute;e&#39;s and Strindberg&#39;s remains by <!--del_lnk--> monograms found on their clothing.<p>The <i>Bratvaag</i> left the island to continue its scheduled hunting and observations, with the intent of coming back later to see if the ice had melted further and uncovered more items. In the meantime, they notified the press and the Norwegian authorities by means of another seal hunting ship. When the <i>Bratvaag</i> returned on August 26, it was unable to approach the island due to rough seas. Further discoveries were made by the M/K <i>Isbj&oslash;rn</i> of <!--del_lnk--> Troms&oslash;, <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a>, a sealing <!--del_lnk--> sloop chartered by news reporters to waylay the <i>Bratvaag</i>. Unsuccessful in this, the reporters and the <i>Isbj&oslash;rn</i> crew made instead for Kvit&oslash;ya themselves. They landed on the island on September 5 in fine weather, finding even less ice than the <i>Bratvaag</i> on the site. After photographing the area, they searched for and found the third body, that of Fr&aelig;nkel, and further artifacts, including a tin box containing Strindberg&#39;s photographic film and Strindberg&#39;s logbook and maps.<p>The crews of both the <i>Bratvaag</i> and the <i>Isbj&oslash;rn</i> turned over their finds to a scientific commission of the Swedish and Norwegian governments in <!--del_lnk--> Troms&oslash; on September 2 and 16, respectively. The bodies of the three explorers were transported to Stockholm, arriving on October 5.<p><a id="Cause_of_deaths" name="Cause_of_deaths"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Cause of deaths</span></h2>

      <p>The bodies of the three dead men were <!--del_lnk--> cremated without further examination upon being returned to Sweden in 1930. The question of what, exactly, killed them has attracted both interest and controversy among scholars, and several medical practitioners and amateur historians have read the extensive diaries with a detective&#39;s eye, looking for clues in the diet, for telltale complaints of symptoms, and for suggestive details at the death site. The main factors extracted are these: they mostly ate scanty amounts of canned and dry goods from the balloon stores, plus huge portions of half-cooked meat of polar bears and occasionally seals; they suffered often from foot pains and <!--del_lnk--> diarrhea, and were always tired, cold, and wet; and, when they moved on to Kvit&oslash;ya from the ice, they left much of their valuable equipment and stores outside the tent, and even down by the water&#39;s edge, as if they were too exhausted, indifferent, or ill to carry it further. Strindberg, the youngest, had died first and been &quot;buried&quot; (wedged into a cliff aperture) by the others.<p>The best-known and most widely credited suggestion was made by Ernst Tryde, a medical practitioner, in his book <i>De d&ouml;da p&aring; Vit&ouml;n</i> (&quot;The Dead on Kvit&oslash;ya&quot;) in 1952: that the men succumbed to <a href="../../wp/t/Trichinosis.htm" title="Trichinosis">trichinosis</a> that they got from eating undercooked polar bear meat. <!--del_lnk--> Larvae of <i><!--del_lnk--> Trichinella spiralis</i> were found in parts of a polar bear carcass at the site. Lundstr&ouml;m and Sundman both favour this explanation, while critics point out that the diarrhea which is Tryde&#39;s main symptomatic evidence hardly needs an explanation beyond the general poor diet and physical misery, whereas some more specific symptoms of trichinosis are missing. Also, <!--del_lnk--> Fridtjof Nansen and his companion <!--del_lnk--> Hjalmar Johansen had lived largely on polar bear meat in exactly the same area for 15 months without any ill effects. Other suggestions include <!--del_lnk--> vitamin A poisoning from eating polar bear <!--del_lnk--> liver (however, the diary shows Andr&eacute;e to have been aware of this danger), <!--del_lnk--> carbon monoxide poisoning (this theory has found few adherents as their <!--del_lnk--> primus stove was turned off when found, with kerosene still in the tank), <!--del_lnk--> lead poisoning from the cans in which their food was stored, <a href="../../wp/s/Scurvy.htm" title="Scurvy">scurvy</a>, <!--del_lnk--> botulism, <!--del_lnk--> suicide (they had plenty of <!--del_lnk--> opium), polar bear attack, cold and <!--del_lnk--> exposure as the Arctic winter closed in, and <!--del_lnk--> dehydration in combination with general <!--del_lnk--> exhaustion, <!--del_lnk--> apathy, and disappointment. The last explanation is favored by Kjellstr&ouml;m, who comments that Tryde never takes the nature of their daily life into account, and especially the crowning blow of the ice breaking up under their promisingly mobile home, with the enforced move onto a <a href="../../wp/g/Glacier.htm" title="Glacier">glacier</a> island. &quot;Posterity has expressed surprise that they died on Kvit&oslash;ya, surrounded by food,&quot; writes Kjellstr&ouml;m (p. 54). &quot;The surprise is rather that they found the strength to live so long&quot;.<p><a id="Legacy" name="Legacy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Legacy</span></h2>

      <p>In 1897, Andr&eacute;e&#39;s daring or foolhardy undertaking nourished Swedish patriotic pride and Swedish dreams of taking the scientific lead in the Arctic. The title of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Engineer&quot; &mdash; &quot;Ingenj&ouml;r Andr&eacute;e&quot; &mdash; was generally and reverentially used in speaking of him, and expressed high esteem for the late 19th-century ideal of the engineer as a representative of social improvement through <!--del_lnk--> technological progress. The three explorers were f&ecirc;ted when they departed and mourned by the nation when they disappeared. When they were found, they were celebrated for the heroism of their doomed two-month struggle to reach populated areas and were seen as having selflessly perished for the ideals of science and progress. The home-bringing of their mortal remains to Stockholm on <!--del_lnk--> October 5, <!--del_lnk--> 1930, writes Swedish historian of ideas Sverker S&ouml;rlin, &quot;must be one of the most solemn and grandiose manifestations of national mourning that has ever occurred in Sweden. One of the rare comparable events is the national mourning that followed the <i><!--del_lnk--> Estonia</i> disaster in the Baltic Sea in September 1994&quot; (p.&nbsp;100).<p>More recently, Andr&eacute;e&#39;s heroic motives have been questioned, beginning with <!--del_lnk--> Per Olof Sundman&#39;s bestselling semi-documentary novel of 1967, <i>The Flight of the Eagle</i>, where Andr&eacute;e is portrayed as the victim of the demands of the media and the Swedish scientific and political establishment, and as ultimately motivated by fear rather than courage. Sundman&#39;s interpretation of the personalities involved, the blind spots of the Swedish national culture, and the role of the press carries over into the Oscar-nominated film by <!--del_lnk--> Jan Troell, <i><!--del_lnk--> Flight of the Eagle</i> (1982), which is based on Sundman&#39;s novel.<p>Appreciation of Nils Strindberg&#39;s role seems to be growing, both for the fortitude with which the untrained and unprepared student kept photographing at all in what must have been a more or less permanent state of near-collapse from exhaustion and exposure, and for the artistic quality of the result. Out of the 240 exposed frames that were found on Kvit&oslash;ya in waterlogged containers, 93 were saved by John Hertzberg at Strindberg&#39;s own workplace, the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. In his article &quot;Recovering the visual history of the Andr&eacute;e expedition&quot; (2004), Tyrone Martinsson has lamented the traditional focus by previous researchers on the written records &mdash; the diaries &mdash; as primary sources of information, and made a renewed claim for the historical significance of the photographs.<p>In 1983, American composer <!--del_lnk--> Dominick Argento created a <!--del_lnk--> song cycle for baritone and piano entitled &quot;The Andr&eacute;e Expedition&quot;. This cycle sets to music texts from the diaries and letters.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._A._Andr%C3%A9e%27s_Arctic_balloon_expedition_of_1897&quot;</div>
