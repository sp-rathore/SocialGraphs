      <p><b>Steel</b> is a <a href="../../wp/m/Metal.htm" title="Metal">metal</a> <!--del_lnk--> alloy whose major component is <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a>, with <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon.htm" title="Carbon">carbon</a> content between 0.02% and 1.7% by weight. Carbon is the most cost effective alloying material for iron, but many other alloying elements are also used. Carbon and other elements act as a hardening agent, preventing <!--del_lnk--> dislocations in the iron atom <!--del_lnk--> crystal lattice from sliding past one another. Varying the amount of alloying elements and their distribution in the steel controls qualities such as the <!--del_lnk--> hardness, <!--del_lnk--> elasticity, <!--del_lnk--> ductility, and <!--del_lnk--> tensile strength of the resulting steel. Steel with increased carbon content can be made harder and stronger than iron, but is also more <!--del_lnk--> brittle. The maximum solubility of carbon in iron is 1.7% by weight, occurring at 1130&deg; Celsius; higher concentrations of carbon or lower temperatures will produce <!--del_lnk--> cementite which will reduce the material&#39;s strength. Alloys with higher carbon content than this are known as <!--del_lnk--> cast iron because of their lower melting point. Steel is also to be distinguished from <!--del_lnk--> wrought iron with little or no carbon, usually less than 0.035%. It is common today to talk about &#39;the iron and steel industry&#39; as if it were a single thing; it is today, but historically they were separate products.<p>Currently there are several classes of steels in which carbon is replaced with other alloying materials, and carbon, if present, is undesired. A more recent definition is that steels are iron-based alloys that can be <!--del_lnk--> plastically formed (pounded, rolled, etc.).<p>

      <p><a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">Iron</a>, like most metals, is not found in the <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> crust in an elemental state. Iron can be found in the crust only in combination with <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> or <a href="../../wp/s/Sulfur.htm" title="Sulfur">sulfur</a>. Typically Fe<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>&mdash;the form of <!--del_lnk--> iron oxide (rust) found as the <a href="../../wp/m/Mineral.htm" title="Mineral">mineral</a> <!--del_lnk--> hematite, and FeS<small><sub>2</sub></small>&mdash;<a href="../../wp/p/Pyrite.htm" title="Pyrite">Pyrite</a> (fool&#39;s gold). Iron oxide is a soft <!--del_lnk--> sandstone-like material with limited uses on its own. Iron is extracted from <!--del_lnk--> ore by removing the oxygen by combining it with a preferred chemical partner such as carbon. This process, known as <!--del_lnk--> smelting, was first applied to metals with lower <!--del_lnk--> melting points. <a href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper">Copper</a> melts at just over 1000 <!--del_lnk--> &deg;C, while <a href="../../wp/t/Tin.htm" title="Tin">tin</a> melts around 250 &deg;C. Steel melts at around 1370 &deg;C. Both temperatures could be reached with ancient methods that have been used for at least 6000 years (since the <a href="../../wp/b/Bronze_Age.htm" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a>). Since the oxidation rate itself increases rapidly beyond 800 &deg;C, it is important that smelting take place in a low-oxygen environment. Unlike copper and tin, liquid iron dissolves carbon quite readily, so that smelting results in an alloy containing too much carbon to be called steel.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Even in the narrow range of concentrations that make up steel, mixtures of carbon and iron can form into a number of different structures, or <!--del_lnk--> allotropes, with very different properties; understanding these is essential to making quality steel. At room temperature, the most stable form of iron is the <!--del_lnk--> body-centered cubic (BCC) structure <!--del_lnk--> ferrite or &alpha;-iron, a fairly soft metallic material that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021 wt% at 910 &deg;C). Above 910 &deg;C ferrite undergoes a <!--del_lnk--> phase transition from <!--del_lnk--> body-centered cubic to a <!--del_lnk--> face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, called <!--del_lnk--> austenite or &gamma;-iron, which is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.03 wt% carbon at 1154 &deg;C). As carbon-rich austenite cools, the mixture attempts to revert to the ferrite phase, resulting in an excess of carbon. One way for carbon to leave the austenite is for <!--del_lnk--> cementite to <!--del_lnk--> precipitate out of the mix, leaving behind iron that is pure enough to take the form of ferrite, and resulting in a cementite-ferrite mixture. Cementite is a <!--del_lnk--> stoichiometric phase with the chemical formula of Fe<sub>3</sub>C. Cementite forms in regions of higher carbon content while other areas revert to ferrite around it. Self-reinforcing patterns often emerge during this process, leading to a patterned layering known as <!--del_lnk--> pearlite due to its <a href="../../wp/p/Pearl.htm" title="Pearl">pearl</a>-like appearance, or the similar but less beautiful <!--del_lnk--> bainite.<p>Perhaps the most important allotrope is <!--del_lnk--> martensite, a chemically <!--del_lnk--> metastable substance with about four to five times the strength of ferrite. A minimum of 0.4 wt% of carbon is needed in order to form martensite. When the austenite is quenched to form martensite, the carbon is &quot;frozen&quot; in place when the cell structure changes from FCC to BCC. The carbon atoms are much too large to fit in the interstitial vaccancies and thus distort the cell structure into a Body Centered Tetragonal (BCT) structure. Martensite and austenite have an identical chemical composition. As such, it requires extremely little thermal <!--del_lnk--> activation energy to form.<p>The heat treatment process for most steels involves heating the alloy until austenite forms, then <!--del_lnk--> quenching the hot metal in <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a> or <!--del_lnk--> oil, cooling it so rapidly that the transformation to ferrite or pearlite does not have time to take place. The transformation into martensite, by contrast, occurs almost immediately, due to a lower activation energy.<p>Martensite has a lower density than austenite, so that the transformation between them results in a change of volume. In this case, expansion occurs. Internal stresses from this expansion generally take the form of <!--del_lnk--> compression on the crystals of martensite and <!--del_lnk--> tension on the remaining ferrite, with a fair amount of <!--del_lnk--> shear on both constituents. If quenching is done improperly, these internal stresses can cause a part to shatter as it cools; at the very least, they cause internal <!--del_lnk--> work hardening and other microscopic imperfections. It is common for quench cracks to form when water quenched, although they may not always be visible.<p>At this point, if the carbon content is high enough to produce a significant concentration of martensite, the result is an extremely hard but very brittle material. Often, steel undergoes further heat treatment at a lower temperature to destroy some of the martensite (by allowing enough time for cementite, etc., to form) and help settle the internal stresses and defects. This softens the steel, producing a more ductile and fracture-resistant metal. Because time is so critical to the end result, this process is known as <!--del_lnk--> tempering, which forms tempered steel.<p>Other materials are often added to the iron-carbon mixture to tailor the resulting properties. <a href="../../wp/n/Nickel.htm" title="Nickel">Nickel</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Manganese.htm" title="Manganese">manganese</a> in steel add to its tensile strength and make austenite more chemically stable, <a href="../../wp/c/Chromium.htm" title="Chromium">chromium</a> increases the hardness and melting temperature, and <a href="../../wp/v/Vanadium.htm" title="Vanadium">vanadium</a> also increases the <!--del_lnk--> hardness while reducing the effects of <!--del_lnk--> metal fatigue. Large amounts of chromium and nickel (often 18% and 8%, respectively) are added to <!--del_lnk--> stainless steel so that a hard <!--del_lnk--> oxide forms on the metal surface to inhibit corrosion. <a href="../../wp/t/Tungsten.htm" title="Tungsten">Tungsten</a> interferes with the formation of cementite, allowing martensite to form with slower quench rates, resulting in <!--del_lnk--> high speed steel. On the other hand <a href="../../wp/s/Sulfur.htm" title="Sulfur">sulfur</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen.htm" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, and <a href="../../wp/p/Phosphorus.htm" title="Phosphorus">phosphorus</a> make steel more brittle, so these commonly found elements must be removed from the ore during processing.<p>When iron is smelted from its ore by commercial processes, it contains more carbon than is desirable. To become steel, it must be melted and reprocessed to remove the correct amount of carbon, at which point other elements can be added. Once this liquid is cast into ingots, it usually must be &quot;worked&quot; at high temperature to remove any cracks or poorly mixed regions from the solidification process, and to produce shapes such as plate, sheet, wire, etc. It is then heat-treated to produce a desirable crystal structure, and often &quot;cold worked&quot; to produce the final shape. In modern steelmaking these processes are often combined, with ore going in one end of the <!--del_lnk--> assembly line and finished steel coming out the other. These can be streamlined by a deft control of the interaction between <!--del_lnk--> work hardening and tempering.<p><a id="History_of_iron_and_steelmaking" name="History_of_iron_and_steelmaking"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History of iron and steelmaking</span></h2>
      <p><a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">Iron</a> was in limited use long before it became possible to smelt it. The first signs of iron use come from <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Sumer.htm" title="Sumer">Sumer</a>, where around <!--del_lnk--> 4000 BC small items, such as the tips of <!--del_lnk--> spears and ornaments, were being fashioned from iron recovered from <!--del_lnk--> meteorites (see <!--del_lnk--> Iron: History). About 6% of <!--del_lnk--> meteorites are composed of an iron-<a href="../../wp/n/Nickel.htm" title="Nickel">nickel</a> alloy, and iron recovered from meteorite falls allowed ancient peoples to manufacture small numbers of iron artifacts.<p>Meteoric iron was also fashioned into tools in precontact <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>. Beginning around the year <!--del_lnk--> 1000, the <!--del_lnk--> Thule people of <a href="../../wp/g/Greenland.htm" title="Greenland">Greenland</a> began making <!--del_lnk--> harpoons and other edged tools from pieces of the <!--del_lnk--> Cape York meteorite. These artifacts were also used as trade goods with other Arctic peoples: tools made from the Cape York meteorite have been found in archaeological sites more than 1000 miles (1600 km) away. When the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">American</a> polar explorer <!--del_lnk--> Robert Peary shipped the largest piece of the meteorite to the <!--del_lnk--> American Museum of Natural History in <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1897, it still weighed over 33&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> tons.<p>The name for iron in several ancient languages means &quot;sky metal&quot; or something similar.

      <p><a id="The_Iron_Age" name="The_Iron_Age"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Iron Age</span></h3>
      <p>Beginning between <!--del_lnk--> 3000 BC to <!--del_lnk--> 2000 BC increasing numbers of <!--del_lnk--> smelted iron objects (distinguishable from meteoric iron by their lack of <a href="../../wp/n/Nickel.htm" title="Nickel">nickel</a>) appear in <!--del_lnk--> Anatolia, <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Mesopotamia.htm" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> (see <!--del_lnk--> Iron: History). The oldest known samples of iron that appear to have been smelted from <!--del_lnk--> iron oxides are small lumps found at copper-smelting sites on the <!--del_lnk--> Sinai Peninsula, dated to about 3000 BC. Some iron oxides are effective fluxes for copper smelting; it is possible that small amounts of metallic iron were made as a by-product of copper and bronze production throughout the Bronze Age.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> Anatolia, smelted iron was occasionally used for ornamental weapons: an iron-bladed dagger with a bronze hilt has been recovered from a <!--del_lnk--> Hattic tomb dating from <!--del_lnk--> 2500 BC. Also, the <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egyptian</a> ruler <!--del_lnk--> Tutankhamun died in <!--del_lnk--> 1323 BC and was buried with an iron dagger with a golden hilt. An <!--del_lnk--> Ancient Egyptian <!--del_lnk--> sword bearing the name of <!--del_lnk--> pharaoh <!--del_lnk--> Merneptah as well as a <!--del_lnk--> battle axe with an iron blade and gold-decorated bronze haft were both found in the excavation of <!--del_lnk--> Ugarit (see <!--del_lnk--> Ugarit). The early <!--del_lnk--> Hittites are known to have <!--del_lnk--> bartered iron for <a href="../../wp/s/Silver.htm" title="Silver">silver</a>, at a rate of 40 times the iron&#39;s weight, with <a href="../../wp/a/Assyria.htm" title="Assyria">Assyria</a>.<p>Iron did not, however, replace bronze as the chief metal used for weapons and tools for several centuries, despite some attempts. Working iron required more fuel and significantly more labor than working bronze, and the quality of iron produced by early smiths may have been inferior to bronze as a material for tools. Then, between <!--del_lnk--> 1200 and <!--del_lnk--> 1000 BC, iron tools and weapons displaced bronze ones throughout the near east. This process appears to have begun in the <!--del_lnk--> Hittite Empire around <!--del_lnk--> 1300 BC, or in <a href="../../wp/c/Cyprus.htm" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> and southern <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greece</a>, where iron artifacts dominate the archaeological record after <!--del_lnk--> 1050 BC. <a href="../../wp/m/Mesopotamia.htm" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> was fully into the Iron Age by <!--del_lnk--> 900 BC, central Europe by <!--del_lnk--> 800 BC. The reason for this sudden adoption of iron remains a topic of debate among archaeologists. One prominent theory is that warfare and mass migrations beginning around 1200 BC disrupted the regional tin trade, forcing a switch from bronze to iron. <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, on the other hand, did not experience such a rapid transition from the bronze to iron ages: although Egyptian smiths did produce iron artifacts, bronze remained in widespread use there until after Egypt&#39;s conquest by <a href="../../wp/a/Assyria.htm" title="Assyria">Assyria</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 663 BC.<p>Iron smelting at this time was based on the <!--del_lnk--> bloomery, a furnace where <!--del_lnk--> bellows were used to force air through a pile of iron ore and burning <!--del_lnk--> charcoal. The <!--del_lnk--> carbon monoxide produced by the charcoal reduced the iron oxides to metallic iron, but the bloomery was not hot enough to melt the iron. Instead, the iron collected in the bottom of the furnace as a spongy mass, or <i>bloom</i>, whose pores were filled with ash and slag. The bloom then had to be reheated to soften the iron and melt the slag, and then repeatedly beaten and folded to force the molten slag out of it. The result of this time-consuming and laborious process was <!--del_lnk--> wrought iron, a malleable but fairly soft alloy containing little carbon.<p>Wrought iron can be <i><!--del_lnk--> carburized</i> into a mild steel by holding it in a charcoal fire for prolonged periods of time. By the beginning of the Iron Age, smiths had discovered that iron that was repeatedly reforged produced a higher quality of metal. <!--del_lnk--> Quench-hardening was also known by this time. The oldest quench-hardened steel artifact is a knife found on <a href="../../wp/c/Cyprus.htm" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> at a site dated to <!--del_lnk--> 1100 BC.<p><a id="Developments_in_China" name="Developments_in_China"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Developments in China</span></h3>
      <p>Archaeologists and historians debate whether bloomery-based ironworking ever spread to China from the Middle East. Around <!--del_lnk--> 500 BC, however, metalworkers in the southern state of <!--del_lnk--> Wu developed an iron smelting technology that would not be practiced in Europe until late medieval times. In Wu, iron smelters achieved a temperature of 1130&deg;C, hot enough to be considered a <!--del_lnk--> blast furnace. At this temperature, iron combines with 4.3% carbon and melts. As a liquid, iron can be <!--del_lnk--> cast into <!--del_lnk--> molds, a method far less laborious than individually forging each piece of iron from a bloom.<p>Cast iron is rather brittle and unsuitable for striking implements. It can, however, be <i>decarburized</i> to steel or wrought iron by heating it in air for several days. In China, these ironworking methods spread northward, and by <!--del_lnk--> 300 BC, iron was the material of choice throughout China for most tools and weapons. A mass grave in <!--del_lnk--> Hebei province, dated to the early third century BC, contains several soldiers buried with their weapons and other equipment. The artifacts recovered from this grave are variously made of wrought iron, cast iron, malleabilized cast iron, and quench-hardened steel, with only a few, probably ornamental, bronze weapons.<p>During the <!--del_lnk--> Han Dynasty (<!--del_lnk--> 202 BC&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> AD 220), Chinese ironworking achieved a scale and sophistication not reached in the West until the eighteenth century. In the first century, the Han government established ironworking as a state monopoly and built a series of large blast furnaces in <!--del_lnk--> Henan province, each capable of producing several tons of iron per day. By this time, Chinese metallurgists had discovered how to <i><!--del_lnk--> puddle</i> molten pig iron, stirring it in the open air until it lost its carbon and became wrought iron. (In <a href="../../wp/c/Chinese_language.htm" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a>, the process was called <i>chao</i>, literally, <!--del_lnk--> stir frying.)<p>Also during this time, Chinese metallurgists had found that wrought iron and cast iron could be melted together to yield an alloy of intermediate carbon content, that is, steel. According to legend, the sword of <!--del_lnk--> Liu Bang, the first Han emperor, was made in this fashion. Some texts of the era mention &quot;harmonizing the hard and the soft&quot; in the context of ironworking; the phrase may refer to this process.<p><a id="Steelmaking_in_India_and_Sri_Lanka" name="Steelmaking_in_India_and_Sri_Lanka"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Steelmaking in India and Sri Lanka</span></h3>
      <p>Perhaps as early as <!--del_lnk--> 300 BC, although certainly by <!--del_lnk--> AD 200, high quality steel was being produced in southern <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> also by what Europeans would later call the <!--del_lnk--> crucible technique. In this system, high-purity wrought iron, charcoal, and glass were mixed in crucibles and heated until the iron melted and absorbed the carbon. One of the earliest evidence of steel making comes to us from Samanalawewa area in <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> where thousands of sites were found. (Juleff, 1996).<p><a id="Steelmaking_in_early_modern_Europe" name="Steelmaking_in_early_modern_Europe"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Steelmaking in early modern Europe</span></h3>
      <p>In the early <a href="../../wp/1/17th_century.htm" title="17th century">17th century</a>, ironworkers in western Europe had found a means (called <i>cementation</i>) to carburize wrought iron. Wrought iron bars and charcoal were packed into stone boxes, then held at a red heat for up to a week. During this time, carbon diffused into the iron, producing a product called <i>cement steel</i> or <i>blister steel</i> (see <!--del_lnk--> cementation process). One of the earliest places where this was used in England was at <!--del_lnk--> Coalbrookdale, where Sir Basil Brooke had two cementation furnaces (recently excavated). For a time in the 1610s, he owned a patent on the process, but had to surrender this in 1619. He probably used <!--del_lnk--> Forest of Dean iron as his raw material.<p>

      <p>From the <a href="../../wp/1/16th_century.htm" title="16th century">16th century</a> to the <a href="../../wp/1/18th_century.htm" title="18th century">18th century</a>, most iron was made by a two-stage process involving a <!--del_lnk--> blast furnace and <!--del_lnk--> finery forge, using charcoal as fuel. Production was however limited by the supply of wood for making charcoal.<p>By the 18th century, <!--del_lnk--> deforestation in western Europe was making ironworking and its charcoal-hungry processes increasingly expensive. In <!--del_lnk--> 1709 <!--del_lnk--> Abraham Darby began smelting iron using <!--del_lnk--> coke, a refined <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a> product, in place of charcoal at his <!--del_lnk--> ironworks at <!--del_lnk--> Coalbrookdale in <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>. Although coke could be produced less expensively than charcoal, coke-fired iron was initially of inferior quality compared to charcoal-fired iron. It was not until the <!--del_lnk--> 1750s, when Darby&#39;s son, also called <!--del_lnk--> Abraham, managed to start selling coke-smelted <!--del_lnk--> pig iron for the production of wrought iron in <!--del_lnk--> finery forges.<p>Another 18th century European development was the invention of the <!--del_lnk--> puddling furnace. In particular, the form of coal-fired puddling furnace developed by the British ironmaster <!--del_lnk--> Henry Cort in <!--del_lnk--> 1784 made it possible to convert cast iron into wrought iron in large batches (without charcoal), rendering the ancient <!--del_lnk--> finery forge obsolescent. Wrought iron produced using this method became a major raw material in the English midlands&#39; iron manufacturing trades.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The problem of mass-producing steel was solved in <!--del_lnk--> 1855 by <!--del_lnk--> Henry Bessemer, with the introduction of the <!--del_lnk--> Bessemer converter at his steelworks in <a href="../../wp/s/Sheffield.htm" title="Sheffield">Sheffield</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>. (An early converter can still be seen at the city&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Kelham Island Museum). In the Bessemer process, molten pig iron from the blast furnace was charged into a large crucible, and then air was blown through the molten iron from below, igniting the dissolved carbon from the <!--del_lnk--> coke. As the carbon burned off, the melting point of the mixture increased, but the heat from the burning carbon provided the extra energy needed to keep the mixture molten. After the carbon content in the melt had dropped to the desired level, the air draft was cut off: a typical Bessemer converter could convert a 25-ton batch of pig iron to steel in half an hour.<p>
       <br /> Finally, the <!--del_lnk--> basic oxygen process was introduced at the Voest-Alpine works in 1952; a modification of the basic Bessemer process, it lances oxygen from above the steel (instead of bubbling air from below), reducing the amount of nitrogen uptake into the steel. The basic oxygen process is used in all modern steelworks; the last Bessemer converter in the U.S. was retired in 1968. Furthermore, the last three decades have seen a massive increase in the mini-mill business, where scrap steel only is melted with an <!--del_lnk--> electric arc furnace. These mills only produced bar products at first, but have since expanded into flat and heavy products, once the exclusive domain of the integrated steelworks.<p>

      <p>Until these <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a> developments, steel was an expensive commodity and only used for a limited number of purposes where a particularly hard or flexible metal was needed, as in the cutting edges of tools and springs. The widespread availability of inexpensive steel powered the <!--del_lnk--> second industrial revolution and modern society as we know it. Mild steel ultimately replaced <!--del_lnk--> wrought iron for almost all purposes, and <!--del_lnk--> wrought iron is not now (or is hardly now) made. With minor exceptions, alloy steels only began to be made in the late 19th century. <!--del_lnk--> Stainless steel was only developed on the eve of the <!--del_lnk--> First World War and only began to come into widespread use in the <!--del_lnk--> 1920s. These alloy steels are all dependent on the wide availability of inexpensive iron and steel and the ability to alloy it at will.<p>Steel is currently the most recycled material in the world, the industry estimates that of new metal produced each year some 42.3% is recycled material. All steel that is available is currently recycled, the long service life of steel in applications such as construction means that there is a vast &#39;store&#39; of steel in use that is recycled as it becomes available. But new metal derived from raw materials is also necessary to make up demand.<p><a id="Types_of_steel" name="Types_of_steel"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Types of steel</span></h2>
      <p>Alloy steels were known from antiquity, being <a href="../../wp/n/Nickel.htm" title="Nickel">nickel</a>-rich iron from <!--del_lnk--> meteorites hot-worked into useful products.

The steel manufacturing process is improved and thereby the properties of this steel to suit to the RCC Construction work has been achieved. The steel wires are passed through cold water just after drawing from the extruder. This helps in rapid cooling of the skin and heat starts flowing from the centre to the skin once the wire is out of the water. This acts as a heat treatment. The relatively soft core helps in ductility of the steel while the treated skin has good weldability to suit construction requirements.</ul>
