      <p>Star Trek originated as a television series in 1966, although it had been in the planning stages for at least six years prior to that. Although <i>The Original Series</i> was canceled after its third season due to low ratings, it has served as the foundation for five additional Star Trek television series. Altogether, the six series comprise a total of 726 <!--del_lnk--> episodes and ten theatrical films (with an 11th in the works) across twenty-two different <!--del_lnk--> television seasons (twenty-nine, if one separately counts seasons running concurrently), making it the second most prolific science-fiction franchise in history after <i><a href="../../wp/d/Doctor_Who.htm" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a></i>. See <!--del_lnk--> Lengths of science fiction film and television series for more on comparative series lengths.<p><a id="Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series_.281966.E2.80.931969.29" name="Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series_.281966.E2.80.931969.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Star Trek: The Original Series</i> (1966&ndash;1969)</span></h3>

      <p><i><b>Star Trek</b></i> debuted in the United States on <!--del_lnk--> NBC on <!--del_lnk--> September 8, <!--del_lnk--> 1966. The show, starring <!--del_lnk--> William Shatner as Captain <!--del_lnk--> James T. Kirk (originally James R. Kirk), told the tale of the crew of the <!--del_lnk--> starship <i><!--del_lnk--> Enterprise</i> and that crew&#39;s five-year mission &quot;to boldly go <!--del_lnk--> where no man has gone before.&quot; In its first two seasons it was nominated for <!--del_lnk--> Emmy Awards as Best Dramatic Series. After only three seasons, the show was canceled and the last episode aired on <!--del_lnk--> June 3, <!--del_lnk--> 1969. The series subsequently became <a href="#Cultural_impact" title="">popular</a> in reruns, and a cult following developed, complete with fan conventions. Originally aired as simply <i>Star Trek</i>, it has in recent years become known as <i>Star Trek: The Original Series</i> or as &quot;Classic Trek&quot; &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> retronyms that distinguish it from its sequels and the franchise as a whole. All subsequent films and television series, except the animated series of the <!--del_lnk--> 1970s, have had secondary titles included as part of their official names. The series was re-released in <!--del_lnk--> September 2006 with <!--del_lnk--> CGI enhancements as a high-definition &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Re-mastered&quot; edition. The first season of <i>Star Trek</i> also is available for download from <!--del_lnk--> Apple&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> iTunes Store. Most of the episodes offered by iTunes are in their original forms. However, a handful are the recently remastered versions, except <!--del_lnk--> Where No Man Has Gone Before, despite having been remastered and aired. Currently airs on <!--del_lnk--> TV Land, <!--del_lnk--> BBC2 and <!--del_lnk--> The Sci-Fi Channel in the UK.<p><a id="Star_Trek:_The_Animated_Series_.281973.E2.80.931974.29" name="Star_Trek:_The_Animated_Series_.281973.E2.80.931974.29"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Star Trek: The Animated Series</i> (1973&ndash;1974)</span></h4>

      <p><i><b>Star Trek: The Animated Series</b></i> was produced by <!--del_lnk--> Filmation and ran for two seasons. Most of the original cast performed the voices of their characters from <i>The Original Series</i> (the character of <!--del_lnk--> Chekov did not appear) as well as many of the original series&#39; writers like <!--del_lnk--> DC Fontana. Larger and more exotic alien landscapes and lifeforms were featured, however animation and soundtrack quality, with the liberal re-use of shots and musical cues as well as occasional animation errors, has detracted from the reputation of the series. Although originally sanctioned by <!--del_lnk--> Paramount (who became the owners of the Star Trek franchise following its acquisition of <!--del_lnk--> Desilu in <!--del_lnk--> 1967), the series is not considered to be <!--del_lnk--> canon (see <!--del_lnk--> Star Trek canon). Even so, elements of the animated series have been used by writers in later live-action series and movies (e.g. Kirk&#39;s middle name, Tiberius, made official in <i><!--del_lnk--> Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country</i>), and elements thus incorporated are canon. <i>TAS</i> came back to television in the mid-<!--del_lnk--> 1980s on the children&#39;s cable network <!--del_lnk--> Nickelodeon, and in the early <!--del_lnk--> 1990s on cable network <!--del_lnk--> Sci-Fi Channel and was released to <a href="../../wp/d/DVD.htm" title="DVD">DVD</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 2006.<p><a id="Star_Trek:_Phase_II" name="Star_Trek:_Phase_II"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Star Trek: Phase II</i></span></h4>

      <p><i><b>Star Trek: Phase II</b></i> was set to air in <!--del_lnk--> 1978 as the flagship series of a proposed Paramount television network, and 12 episode scripts were written before production was due to begin. The series would have put most of the original crew back aboard the <i><!--del_lnk--> Enterprise</i> for a second five-year mission, except for <!--del_lnk--> Leonard Nimoy as <!--del_lnk--> Spock, who did not agree to return. A younger, full-blooded <!--del_lnk--> Vulcan named Xon was planned as a replacement, although it was still hoped that Nimoy would make guest appearances. Sets were constructed and several minutes of test footage were filmed. However, the risks of launching a fourth network and the popularity of the then-recently released film <i><a href="../../wp/s/Star_Wars_Episode_IV__A_New_Hope.htm" title="Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope">Star Wars</a></i> led Paramount to make a Star Trek film instead of a weekly television series. The first script of this aborted series formed the basis of <i><!--del_lnk--> Star Trek: The Motion Picture</i>, while two others were eventually adapted as episodes of <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>.<p><a id="Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation_.281987.E2.80.931994.29" name="Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation_.281987.E2.80.931994.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i> (1987&ndash;1994)</span></h3>

      <p><i><b>Star Trek: The Next Generation</b></i> is set nearly a <!--del_lnk--> century after <i>The Original Series</i> and features a new starship, the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Enterprise</i>-D, and a new crew led by Captain <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Luc Picard, played by <!--del_lnk--> Patrick Stewart.

The show premiered on <!--del_lnk--> September 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1987 and ran for seven seasons, ending on <!--del_lnk--> May 23, <!--del_lnk--> 1994. <i>The Next Generation</i> had the highest ratings of all the Star Trek series and was the #1 syndicated show during the last few years of its original run. It was nominated for an <!--del_lnk--> Emmy for Best Dramatic Series during its final season in 1994. It also received a <!--del_lnk--> Peabody Award for Outstanding Television Programming.

      <p><i><b>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</b></i> is set during the same timeframe as <i>The Next Generation</i> and ran for seven seasons, debuting in 1993. It is the only Star Trek series to take place primarily on a space station, rather than aboard a starship. The show chronicles the events of the station&#39;s crew, led by Commander (later Captain) <!--del_lnk--> Benjamin Sisko, played by <!--del_lnk--> Avery Brooks, living on the <!--del_lnk--> Cardassian-built <!--del_lnk--> Bajoran <!--del_lnk--> spacestation <!--del_lnk--> Deep Space Nine, which initially orbited the planet <!--del_lnk--> Bajor but was moved to a nearby, newly-discovered, uniquely stable <!--del_lnk--> wormhole that provides immediate access to the distant <!--del_lnk--> Gamma Quadrant. Recurring plots include the repercussions of the lengthy and brutal <!--del_lnk--> occupation of the nearby planet Bajor by the <!--del_lnk--> Cardassians, Sisko&#39;s unique spiritual role for the <!--del_lnk--> Bajorans as the Emissary of the <!--del_lnk--> Prophets, and a major war with the <!--del_lnk--> Dominion of the Gamma Quadrant. Deep Space Nine stands apart from other Trek series for its lengthy serialized storytelling and conflict within the crew &ndash; things that Roddenberry had forbidden in earlier Trek series.<p><a id="Star_Trek:_Voyager_.281995.E2.80.932001.29" name="Star_Trek:_Voyager_.281995.E2.80.932001.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Star Trek: Voyager</i> (1995&ndash;2001)</span></h3>

      <p><i><b>Star Trek: Voyager</b></i> was produced for seven seasons from 1995 to 2001 and is the only Star Trek series to feature a woman as the commanding officer: Captain <!--del_lnk--> Kathryn Janeway, played by <!--del_lnk--> Kate Mulgrew. <i>Voyager</i> takes place at about the same time as <i>Deep Space Nine</i>.

Given a 70-year voyage back to Earth, the crew must avoid conflict and defeat challenges on its long and perilous journey home. <i>Voyager</i> was originally isolated from many of the familiar aspects and races of the Star Trek franchise (with the exception of the individual races amongst the crew). This allowed for the creation of new races and original plotlines within the series; however, later seasons saw an influx of characters and races from prior shows, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Borg, <!--del_lnk--> Q, the Ferengi, Romulans, Klingons, Cardassians, and even multiple instances where members of the <i>Next Generation</i> crew appear in the series. The series is currently airing on <!--del_lnk--> Space: The Imagination Station in Canada, <!--del_lnk--> Spike TV in the United States, and <!--del_lnk--> Sky One in the United Kingdom.<p><a id="Star_Trek:_Enterprise_.282001.E2.80.932005.29" name="Star_Trek:_Enterprise_.282001.E2.80.932005.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Star Trek: Enterprise</i> (2001&ndash;2005)</span></h3>

Commanded by Captain <!--del_lnk--> Jonathan Archer (<!--del_lnk--> Scott Bakula), <i>Enterprise</i> is able to go farther and faster than any human vessel had previously gone. <i>Enterprise</i> showed the origins of several features that would become common in the sequel series, such as the inventing of new technologies, primarily the <!--del_lnk--> static warp bubble, and first contact with new species, such as the Klingons. For the first two seasons <i>Enterprise</i> was episodic, like the original series and <i>The Next Generation</i>. During the third and fourth seasons, the series used long story arcs spanning several episodes at a time. Ratings for <i>Enterprise</i> started strong, but declined rapidly. The show continued to lose ratings during the third season, and Paramount cancelled the show in early 2005. It is currently airing on HDNet, Sky Two and The Sci-Fi Channel.<p><a id="Feature_films" name="Feature_films"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Feature films</span></h2>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Paramount Pictures has produced ten Star Trek feature films, with an eleventh in pre-production:<ul>
       <li><i><!--del_lnk--> Star Trek: The Motion Picture</i> (1979)<li><i><!--del_lnk--> Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</i> (1982)<li><i><!--del_lnk--> Star Trek III: The Search for Spock</i> (1984)<li><i><!--del_lnk--> Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home</i> (1986)<li><i><!--del_lnk--> Star Trek V: The Final Frontier</i> (1989)<li><i><!--del_lnk--> Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country</i> (1991)<li><i><!--del_lnk--> Star Trek: Generations</i> (1994)<li><i><!--del_lnk--> Star Trek: First Contact</i> (1996)<li><i><!--del_lnk--> Star Trek: Insurrection</i> (1998)<li><i><!--del_lnk--> Star Trek: Nemesis</i> (2002)<li><i><!--del_lnk--> Star Trek</i> (2008)</ul>
      <p>The first six continue the adventures of the <i>The Original Series</i> cast, while the next four feature <i>The Next Generation&#39;</i>s cast. Although North American and UK releases of the films were no longer numbered following the sixth film, European releases continued numbering the films.<p>A common sentiment among fans is that the even-numbered Star Trek films are superior to the odd-numbered Star Trek films (the so-called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> <i>Star Trek</i> movie curse&quot;); the <!--del_lnk--> second, <!--del_lnk--> fourth, <!--del_lnk--> sixth, and <!--del_lnk--> eighth films are considered fan favorites, whereas the <!--del_lnk--> first and <!--del_lnk--> fifth are often called the worst films.<p>An eleventh film, simply titled <i><!--del_lnk--> Star Trek</i>, has been announced for release on Christmas Day, 2008, to be written by <!--del_lnk--> Roberto Orci and <!--del_lnk--> Alex Kurtzman and produced and directed by <i><a href="../../wp/l/Lost_%2528TV_series%2529.htm" title="Lost (TV series)">Lost</a></i> creator <!--del_lnk--> J.J. Abrams. The film has been rumoured to focus on the early lives of Captain James T Kirk and Mr Spock.<p><a id="Other_storylines_and_canonicity" name="Other_storylines_and_canonicity"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Other storylines and canonicity</span></h2>

      <p>The Star Trek <!--del_lnk--> canon comprises the five live-action television series and ten motion pictures. The animated series, novels, comic books, video games, and other materials based on Star Trek, though licensed by <!--del_lnk--> CBS Paramount, are generally considered non-canon, as are fan-made (or &quot;<!--del_lnk--> fanon&quot;) productions set within the Star Trek universe.<p>The Star Trek novels typically fill &quot;holes&quot; in the Star Trek story and timeline, with explanations of events that have never been thoroughly explained through live action productions. Many have been accepted by Trek fans as part of the <!--del_lnk--> Star Trek canon, even though CBS, owners of the Star Trek franchise, say otherwise. Several authors have created spin-off series that are self-contained within their novels.<p>Outside of the television series and motion pictures produced by Paramount pictures, the Star Trek franchise has been officially expanded and elaborated by various authors and artists, despite the fact that CBS does not consider these derivative works canon. These works&#39; creators are generally free to tell their own stories set in the Star Trek universe, and are free either to keep an existing continuity, or to use their own. (Similarly, writers for TV and film are under no obligation to pay heed to any of the derivative works.) These works often expand the back stories of characters, species, planets, etc., already seen in the official live-action productions. For example, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Voyager</i> novels <i>Mosaic</i> and <i>Pathways</i> give background information for characters in the <i>Voyager</i> live-action series. These are usually in the printed form, usually in the form of novels and reference manuals, but also <!--del_lnk--> manga.<p>The Star Trek series have also inspired many unofficial fan-made productions. For example, in recent years, Star Trek <!--del_lnk--> fan films have been created for distribution over the Internet. Currently, <i><!--del_lnk--> Star Trek: Hidden Frontier</i>, which is a continuation of the time line after the <!--del_lnk--> Dominion War from the perspective of a station and fleet in the <!--del_lnk--> Briar Patch, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Star Trek: New Voyages</i>, a &quot;continuation&quot; of the original <i>Star Trek</i>, are prominent fan series. While none of these projects are licensed by CBS, some have attracted participation from television and film series&#39; cast and crew. One fan production, <i><!--del_lnk--> Star Trek: Of Gods and Men,</i> features several veteran Trek actors, with <i>Voyager</i> star <!--del_lnk--> Tim Russ directing and reprising his role of <!--del_lnk--> Tuvok.<p><a id="Cultural_impact" name="Cultural_impact"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Cultural impact</span></h2>

      <p>The Star Trek franchise is a multi-billion dollar industry, currently owned by CBS. <!--del_lnk--> Gene Roddenberry sold <i>Star Trek</i> to <!--del_lnk--> NBC as a classic adventure drama; he pitched the show as &quot;<i><!--del_lnk--> Wagon Train</i> to the stars&quot; and as <!--del_lnk--> Horatio Hornblower in space. Though set on a fictional <!--del_lnk--> starship, Roddenberry wanted to tell more sophisticated stories using <!--del_lnk--> futuristic situations as <!--del_lnk--> analogies to current problems on Earth and rectifying them through <a href="../../wp/h/Humanism.htm" title="Humanism">humanism</a> and <!--del_lnk--> optimism. The opening line, &quot;to boldly go <!--del_lnk--> where no man has gone before&quot;, was taken almost verbatim from a <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">US</a> <!--del_lnk--> White House booklet on space produced after the <i><!--del_lnk--> Sputnik</i> flight in 1957. The central trio of <!--del_lnk--> Kirk, <!--del_lnk--> Spock, and <!--del_lnk--> McCoy was modeled on <!--del_lnk--> classical mythological storytelling. Harking of human diversity and contemporaneous political circumstances, Roddenberry included a multi-ethnic <!--del_lnk--> crew.<p><i>Star Trek</i> and its spin-offs have proved highly popular in television repeats, and are currently shown on TV stations worldwide. The show&rsquo;s cultural impact goes far beyond its longevity and profitability. Star Trek <!--del_lnk--> conventions have become popular, though now are often merged with conventions of other genres and series, and fans have coined the term &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Trekkies&quot; to describe themselves. An entire subculture has grown up around the show.<p>The Star Trek franchise is believed to have motivated the design of many current technologies, including the <!--del_lnk--> Tablet PC, the <!--del_lnk--> PDA, <!--del_lnk--> mobile phones, and the MRI (based on Dr. McCoy&#39;s diagnostic table). It has also brought to popular attention the concept of <!--del_lnk--> teleportation with its classic depiction of &quot;matter-energy transport&quot;. Phrases such as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Beam me up, Scotty&quot; have entered the public vernacular. In 1976, following a letter-writing campaign, <!--del_lnk--> NASA named one of its <a href="../../wp/s/Space_Shuttle_program.htm" title="Space Shuttle program">space shuttles</a> <!--del_lnk--> <i>Enterprise</i>, after the <!--del_lnk--> fictional starship.<p>The city of Garland, Texas has the only known official place name of the TV series: Star Trek Lane, located off of Apollo Road and east of North Jupiter Road.<p><!--del_lnk--> Parodies of Star Trek include the internet-based cartoon series <i><!--del_lnk--> Stone Trek</i> and the song &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Star Trekkin&#39;&quot;.<p><a id="Current_status_and_future" name="Current_status_and_future"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Current status and future</span></h2>
      <p>After <i>Enterprise</i> was canceled in 2005, the Star Trek franchise found itself for the first time in over 25 years without a series or film in production or development. In April 2006, the official announcement of <!--del_lnk--> an eleventh feature film made it probable that the franchise has not yet ended.<p>In 2006, <!--del_lnk--> CBS Paramount Domestic Television began syndicating an enhanced version of the original 79 <i>Star Trek</i> episodes. State-of-the-art visual effects replaced those in the series (created in-house by <!--del_lnk--> CBS), the original theme music has been re-recorded, and the show was transferred from the original negatives in high definition. The show will eventually be syndicated in HD.<p>Also in 2006, CBS has announced that it is considering a new animated series that will likely debut as several 6-minute episodes available online. The series is to be set 150 years after the <!--del_lnk--> Star Trek: The Next Generation time line, during a time of upheaval and strife in the Federation. The Romulans have used several &quot;Omega Particle&quot; explosions to render much of Federation space impassable by traditional Federation vessels. Many Federation worlds have been isolated, and some races, including the Vulcans, have withdrawn from the Federation altogether. The series is, as yet, untitled and there has been no full confirmation.<p>On January 19, 2007, CBS announced that its newly-formed home entertainment unit would begin releasing the remastered episodes on <!--del_lnk--> Blu-Ray Disc and <!--del_lnk--> HD-DVD before the end of 2007.<p><!--del_lnk--> Perpetual Entertainment is also developing a <!--del_lnk--> MMOG based on Star Trek called <!--del_lnk--> Star Trek Online. <!--del_lnk--> IDW Publishing have also bought the rights to the comic book. The original series&#39; characters are also featured in a <!--del_lnk--> manga.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek&quot;</div>
