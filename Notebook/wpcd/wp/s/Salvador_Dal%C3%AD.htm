      <p><b>Salvador Felipe Jacinto Dal&iacute; Dom&egrave;nech, Marquis of Pubol</b> or <b>Salvador Felip Jacint Dal&iacute; Dom&egrave;nech</b> (<!--del_lnk--> May 11, <!--del_lnk--> 1904 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> January 23, <!--del_lnk--> 1989), known popularly as <b>Salvador Dal&iacute;</b>, was a <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spanish</a> <a href="../../wp/a/Art.htm" title="Art">artist</a> and one of the most important <!--del_lnk--> painters of the 20th century. He was a skilled <!--del_lnk--> draftsman, best known for the striking, bizarre, and beautiful images in his <!--del_lnk--> surrealist work. His <!--del_lnk--> painterly skills are often attributed to the influence of <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> masters. His best known work, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Persistence of Memory</i>, was completed in 1931. Salvador Dal&iacute;&#39;s artistic repertoire also includes film, sculpture, and photography. He collaborated with <a href="../../wp/w/Walt_Disney.htm" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney</a> on the <!--del_lnk--> Academy Award-nominated short cartoon <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><i><!--del_lnk--> Destino</i></span>, which was released posthumously in 2003. Born in <!--del_lnk--> Catalonia, <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>, Dal&iacute; insisted on his &quot;Arab lineage,&quot; claiming that his ancestors descended from the <!--del_lnk--> Moors who invaded Spain in <!--del_lnk--> 711, and attributed to these origins, &quot;my love of everything that is gilded and excessive, my passion for luxury and my love of oriental clothes.&quot;<p>Widely considered to be greatly imaginative, Dal&iacute; had an affinity for doing unusual things to draw attention to himself. This sometimes irked those who loved his art as much as it annoyed his critics, since his <!--del_lnk--> eccentric manner sometimes drew more public attention than his artwork. The purposefully sought notoriety led to broad public recognition and many purchases of his works by people from all walks of life.<p>

</script><a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
      <p>Dal&iacute; was born on <!--del_lnk--> May 11, <!--del_lnk--> 1904, at 8.45 am local time  in the town of <!--del_lnk--> Figueres, in the <!--del_lnk--> Empord&agrave; <!--del_lnk--> region close to the <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> border in <!--del_lnk--> Catalonia, <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>.  Dal&iacute;&#39;s older brother, also named Salvador, had died of <a href="../../wp/m/Meningitis.htm" title="Meningitis">meningitis</a> three years earlier at the age of 7. His father, Salvador Dal&iacute; i Cus&iacute;, was a middle-class lawyer and notary whose strict disciplinarian approach was tempered by his wife, Felipa Domenech Ferres, who encouraged her son&#39;s artistic endeavors. When he was five, Dal&iacute; was taken to his brother&#39;s grave and told by his parents that he was his brother&#39;s reincarnation, which he came to believe. Of his brother, Dal&iacute; said: <i>&quot;my brother died at the age of seven from an attack of meningitis, three years before I was born...[we] resembled each other like two drops of water, but we had different reflections.&quot;</i> He <i>&quot;was probably a first version of myself but conceived too much in the absolute.&quot;</i><p>Dal&iacute; also had a sister, Ana Mar&iacute;a, who was three years his junior. In 1949 she published a book about her brother, <i>Dal&iacute; As Seen By His Sister</i>.<p>Dal&iacute; attended <!--del_lnk--> drawing school, where he first received formal art training. In 1916, Dal&iacute; discovered modern painting on a summer vacation to <!--del_lnk--> Cadaqu&eacute;s (in the nearby <!--del_lnk--> Costa Brava) with the family of <!--del_lnk--> Ramon Pichot, a local artist who made regular trips to <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>. The next year, Dal&iacute;&#39;s father organized an exhibition of his charcoal drawings in their family home. He had his first public exhibition at the Municipal Theatre in Figueres in 1919.<p>In 1921, Dal&iacute;&rsquo;s mother died of breast cancer when he was sixteen years old. His mother&#39;s death <i>&quot;was the greatest blow I had experienced in my life. I worshipped her...I could not resign myself to the loss of a being on whom I counted to make invisible the unavoidable blemishes of my soul.&quot;</i> After her death, Dal&iacute;&rsquo;s father married the sister of his deceased wife; Dal&iacute; somewhat resented this marriage.<p><a id="Madrid_and_Paris" name="Madrid_and_Paris"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Madrid and Paris</span></h2>
      <p>In 1922, Dal&iacute; moved into the <!--del_lnk--> Residencia de estudiantes (Students&#39; Residence) in <a href="../../wp/m/Madrid.htm" title="Madrid">Madrid</a> and there studied at the San Fernando School of Fine Arts. Dal&iacute; already drew attention as an eccentric, wearing long hair and sideburns, coat, stockings and knee breeches in the fashion style of a century earlier. But his paintings, where he experimented with <a href="../../wp/c/Cubism.htm" title="Cubism">Cubism</a>, earned him the most attention from his fellow students. In these earliest Cubist works, he probably did not completely understand the movement, since his only information on Cubist art came from a few magazine articles and a catalogue given to him by Pichot, and there were no Cubist artists in Madrid at the time.<div class="thumb tright">

      </div>
      <p>Dal&iacute; also experimented with <a href="../../wp/d/Dada.htm" title="Dada">Dada</a>, which influenced his work throughout his life. At the San Fernando School of Fine Arts, he became close friends with the <!--del_lnk--> poet <!--del_lnk--> Federico Garc&iacute;a Lorca, with whom he might have become romantically involved, and <!--del_lnk--> filmmaker <!--del_lnk--> Luis Bu&ntilde;uel.<p>Dal&iacute; was expelled from the academy in 1926 shortly before his final exams when he stated that no one on the faculty was competent enough to examine him. His mastery of painting skills is well documented by that time in his flawlessly realistic <i>Basket of Bread</i>, which was painted in 1926. That same year he made his first visit to Paris where he met with <a href="../../wp/p/Pablo_Picasso.htm" title="Pablo Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a>, whom young Dal&iacute; revered; Picasso had already heard favorable things about Dal&iacute; from <!--del_lnk--> Joan Mir&oacute;. Dal&iacute; did a number of works heavily influenced by Picasso and Mir&oacute; over the next few years as he moved toward developing his own style.<p>Some trends in Dal&iacute;&#39;s work that would continue throughout his life were already evident in the 1920s, however. Dal&iacute; devoured influences of all styles of art he could find and then produced works ranging from the most academically classic to the most cutting-edge <!--del_lnk--> avant-garde, sometimes in separate works and sometimes combined. Exhibitions of his works in <a href="../../wp/b/Barcelona.htm" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> attracted much attention and mixtures of praise and puzzled debate from critics.<p>Dal&iacute; grew a flamboyant <!--del_lnk--> moustache, which became iconic of him; it was influenced by that of seventeenth century Spanish master painter <a href="../../wp/d/Diego_Vel%25C3%25A1zquez.htm" title="Diego Vel&aacute;zquez">Diego Vel&aacute;zquez</a>.<p><a name="1929_until_World_War_II"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">1929 until World War II</span></h2>
      <p>Dal&iacute; collaborated with the surrealistic film director <!--del_lnk--> Luis Bu&ntilde;uel in 1929 on the short <a href="../../wp/f/Film.htm" title="Film">film</a> <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i><!--del_lnk--> Un chien andalou</i></span> (<a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a> for &quot;<i>An Andalusian Dog</i>&quot;) and met his muse, inspiration, and future wife <!--del_lnk--> Gala, born Helena Dmitrievna Deluvina Diakonova, a <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russian</a> <!--del_lnk--> immigrant eleven years his senior who was then married to the <!--del_lnk--> surrealist poet <!--del_lnk--> Paul &Eacute;luard. He was mainly responsible for helping Bu&ntilde;uel write the script for the film. Dal&iacute; later claimed to have been more heavily involved in the filming of the project, but this is not substantiated by contemporary accounts. In the same year, Dal&iacute; had important professional exhibitions and officially joined the surrealist group in the <!--del_lnk--> Montparnasse quarter of <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a> (although his work had already been heavily influenced by surrealism for two years). The surrealists hailed what Dal&iacute; called the <!--del_lnk--> Paranoiac-critical method of accessing the <!--del_lnk--> subconscious for greater artistic <!--del_lnk--> creativity.<p>In 1931, Dal&iacute; painted one of his most famous works, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Persistence of Memory</i>. Sometimes called <i>Soft Watches</i> or <i>Melting Clocks</i>, the work introduced the surrealistic image of the soft, melting <!--del_lnk--> pocket watch. The general interpretation of the work is that the soft watches debunk the assumption that time is rigid or deterministic, and this sense is supported by other images in the work, including the ants and fly devouring the other watches.<p>Dal&iacute; and Gala, having lived together since 1929, were married in 1934 in a civil ceremony. They remarried in a <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic ceremony in 1958.<p>In 1936, Dal&iacute; took part in the <!--del_lnk--> London International Surrealist Exhibition. His lecture entitled <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Fantomes paranoiaques authentiques</i></span> was delivered wearing a deep-sea diving suit. When <!--del_lnk--> Francisco Franco came to power in the aftermath of the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish Civil War, Dal&iacute; was one of the few Spanish intellectuals supportive of the new regime, which put him at odds with his predominantly <a href="../../wp/m/Marxism.htm" title="Marxism">Marxist</a> surrealist fellows over politics, eventually resulting in his official expulsion from this group. At this, Dali retorted, &quot;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le surr&eacute;alisme, c&#39;est moi.</span>&quot; <!--del_lnk--> Andr&eacute; Breton coined the <!--del_lnk--> anagram &quot;avida dollars&quot; (for <i>Salvador Dal&iacute;</i>), which more or less translates to &quot;eager for dollars,&quot; by which he referred to Dal&iacute; after the period of his expulsion; the surrealists henceforth spoke of Dal&iacute; in the past tense, as if he were dead. The surrealist movement and various members thereof (such as <!--del_lnk--> Ted Joans) would continue to issue extremely harsh polemics against Dal&iacute; until the time of his death and beyond. As <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> started in Europe, Dal&iacute; and Gala moved to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> in 1940, where they lived for eight years. In 1942, he published his autobiography, <i>The Secret Life of Salvador Dal&iacute;</i>.<p><a id="Later_years_in_Catalonia" name="Later_years_in_Catalonia"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Later years in Catalonia</span></h2>
      <p>Dal&iacute; spent his remaining years back in his beloved Catalonia starting in 1949. The fact that he chose to live in Spain while it was ruled by Franco drew criticism from progressives and many other artists. As such, probably at least some of the common dismissal of Dal&iacute;&#39;s later works had more to do with politics than the actual merits of the works themselves. In 1959, <!--del_lnk--> Andr&eacute; Breton organized an exhibit called, <i>Homage to Surrealism</i>, celebrating the Fortieth Anniversary of Surrealism, which contained works by Salvador Dal&iacute;, <!--del_lnk--> Joan Mir&oacute;, <!--del_lnk--> Enrique T&aacute;bara, and <!--del_lnk--> Eugenio Granell. Breton vehemently fought against the inclusion of Dal&iacute;&#39;s <i>Sistine Madonna</i> in the International Surrealism Exhibition in New York the following year.<p>Late in his career, Dal&iacute; did not confine himself to painting but experimented with many unusual or novel media and processes: he made <!--del_lnk--> bulletist works and was among the first artists to employ <!--del_lnk--> holography in an artistic manner. Several of his works incorporate <!--del_lnk--> optical illusions. In his later years, young artists like <a href="../../wp/a/Andy_Warhol.htm" title="Andy Warhol">Andy Warhol</a> proclaimed Dal&iacute; an important influence on <!--del_lnk--> pop art. Dal&iacute; also had a keen interest in natural science and mathematics. This is manifested in several of his paintings, notably in the 1950s when he painted his subjects as composed of rhinoceros horns, signifying divine geometry (as the rhinoceros horn grows according to a logarithmic spiral) and chastity (as Dal&iacute; linked the rhinoceros to the Virgin Mary). Dal&iacute; was also fascinated by <a href="../../wp/d/DNA.htm" title="DNA">DNA</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> hypercube; the latter, a 4-dimensional cube, is featured in the painting <i>Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)</i>.<p>In 1960, Dal&iacute; began work on the <!--del_lnk--> Dal&iacute; Theatre and Museum in his home town of <!--del_lnk--> Figueres; it was his largest single project and the main focus of his energy through 1974. He continued to make additions through the mid-1980s. He found time, however, to design the <!--del_lnk--> Chupa Chups logo in 1969. Also in <!--del_lnk--> 1969, He was responsible for creating the advertising aspect of the <!--del_lnk--> 1969 Eurovision Song Contest, and created a large metal sculpture, which stood on the stage at the Teatro Real in Madrid.<p>In 1982, King <!--del_lnk--> Juan Carlos of Spain bestowed on Dal&iacute; the title <!--del_lnk--> Marquis of <!--del_lnk--> Pubol, for which Dal&iacute; later paid him back by giving him a drawing (<i>Head of Europa</i>, which would turn out to be Dal&iacute;&#39;s final drawing) after the king visited him on his deathbed.<p>Gala died on <!--del_lnk--> June 10, <!--del_lnk--> 1982. After Gala&#39;s death, Dal&iacute; lost much of his will to live. He deliberately dehydrated himself&mdash;possibly as a suicide attempt, possibly in an attempt to put himself into a state of suspended animation, as he had read that some <!--del_lnk--> microorganisms could do. He moved from Figueres to the castle in <!--del_lnk--> Pubol which he had bought for Gala and was the site of her death. In 1984, a fire broke out in his bedroom under unclear circumstances&mdash;possibly a suicide attempt by Dal&iacute;, possibly simple negligence by his staff. In any case, Dal&iacute; was rescued and returned to Figueres where a group of his friends, patrons, and fellow artists saw to it that he was comfortable living in his <!--del_lnk--> Theatre-Museum for his final years.<p>There have been allegations that his guardians forced Dal&iacute; to sign blank canvasses that would later (even after his death) be used and sold as originals. As a result, art dealers tend to be wary of late works attributed to Dal&iacute;. He died of heart failure at Figueres on <!--del_lnk--> January 23, <!--del_lnk--> 1989 at the age of 84, and he is buried in the crypt of his Teatro Museo in Figueres.<p><a id="Symbolism" name="Symbolism"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Symbolism</span></h2>
      <p>Dal&iacute; employed extensive symbolism in his work. For instance, the hallmark soft watches that first appear in <i>The Persistence of Memory</i> suggest <a href="../../wp/a/Albert_Einstein.htm" title="Albert Einstein">Einstein</a>&#39;s theory that <a href="../../wp/s/Special_relativity.htm" title="Special Relativity">time is relative</a> and not fixed. The idea for clocks functioning symbolically in this way came to Dal&iacute; when he was staring at a runny piece of <!--del_lnk--> Camembert cheese during a hot day in August.<p>The elephant is also a recurring image in Dal&iacute;&#39;s works, appearing first in his 1944 work <i><!--del_lnk--> Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening</i>. The elephants, inspired by <!--del_lnk--> Gian Lorenzo Bernini&#39;s sculpture <!--del_lnk--> base in Rome of an <!--del_lnk--> elephant to carry an ancient obelisk, are portrayed &quot;with long, multi-jointed, almost invisible legs of desire&quot; along with obelisks on their backs. Coupled with the image of their brittle legs, these encumbrances, noted for their phallic overtones, create a sense of phantom reality. &quot;The elephant is a distortion in space,&quot; one analysis explains, &quot;its spindly legs contrasting the idea of weightlessness with structure.&quot;...I am painting pictures which make me die for joy, I am creating with an absolute naturalness, without the slightest aesthetic concern, I am making things that inspire me with a profound emotion and I am trying to paint them honestly. -- Salvador Dal&iacute;, in Dawn Ades, <i>Dal&iacute; and Surrealism</i>.<p>The egg is another common Dal&iacute;esque image. He connects the egg to the prenatal and intrauterine, thus using it to symbolize hope and love; it appears in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Great Masturbator</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Metamorphosis of Narcissus</i>. Various animals appear throughout his work as well: ants point to death, decay, and immense sexual desire; the snail is connected to the human head (he saw a snail on a bicycle outside Freud&rsquo;s house when he first met <a href="../../wp/s/Sigmund_Freud.htm" title="Sigmund Freud">Sigmund Freud</a>); and locusts are a symbol of waste and fear.<p>His fascination with ants has a strange explanation. When Dal&iacute; was a young boy he had a pet bat. One day he discovered his bat dead, covered in ants. He thus developed a fascination with and fear of ants.<p><a id="Endeavors_outside_painting" name="Endeavors_outside_painting"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Dal%C3%AD&quot;</div>
