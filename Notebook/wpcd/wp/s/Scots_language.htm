      <p><b>Scots</b> refers to the <!--del_lnk--> Anglic <!--del_lnk--> varieties spoken in parts of <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>. In Scotland it is sometimes called <i>Lowland Scots</i> to distinguish it from <a href="../../wp/s/Scottish_Gaelic_language.htm" title="Scottish Gaelic language">Scottish Gaelic</a> spoken by some in the <!--del_lnk--> Highlands and Islands (especially the <a href="../../wp/h/Hebrides.htm" title="Hebrides">Hebrides</a>). Scots is also spoken in parts of <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> and border areas of the <a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_Ireland.htm" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>, where it is known in official circles as <i><!--del_lnk--> Ulster Scots</i> or <i>Ullans</i>.<p>Since there are no universally accepted criteria for distinguishing <a href="../../wp/l/Language.htm" title="Language">languages</a> from <!--del_lnk--> dialects, scholars and other interested parties often disagree about the linguistic, historical and social status of Scots. Although a number of paradigms for distinguishing between languages and dialects do exist these often render contradictory results (See <!--del_lnk--> Dialect). Consequently Scots has, on the one hand, been traditionally regarded as one of the ancient dialects of <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> but with its own ancient and distinct dialects. Scots has often been treated as part of English as spoken in Scotland but differs significantly from the <!--del_lnk--> Standard Scottish English taught in schools. On the other hand, it has been regarded as a distinct <!--del_lnk--> Germanic language the way <!--del_lnk--> Swedish is distinct from <!--del_lnk--> Danish. Its subordination to Anglo-English has also been compared to the subordination of <!--del_lnk--> Frisian to <a href="../../wp/d/Dutch_language.htm" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a> in the Netherlands. Thus <i>Scots</i> can be interpreted as a collective term for the dialects of English spoken or originating in Scotland, or it can be interpreted as the <!--del_lnk--> autochthonous language of Lowland Scotland. See <!--del_lnk--> Status below for further discussion.<p><!--del_lnk--> Native speakers in Scotland and Ireland usually refer to their <!--del_lnk--> idiom as (braid) Scots (Eng: <i>Broad Scots</i>) or use a dialect name such as <i>the Doric</i> or <i>the Buchan Claik</i>. The old fashioned <i><!--del_lnk--> Scotch</i> occurs occasionally, especially in Ireland. Some literary forms are often referred to as <!--del_lnk--> Lallans (<i>Lowlands</i>).<p>

      <p>The word Scot was borrowed from <!--del_lnk--> Latin to refer to <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> and dates from at least the first half of the 10th century. Up to the <a href="../../wp/1/15th_century.htm" title="15th century">15th century</a> <i>Scottis</i> (modern form: <i>Scots</i>) referred to <!--del_lnk--> Gaelic (a <!--del_lnk--> Celtic language and tongue of the <!--del_lnk--> ancient Scots, introduced from <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> perhaps from the <a href="../../wp/4/4th_century.htm" title="4th century">4th century</a> onwards). Since the late 15th century , Anglic speakers in Scotland also started occasionally referring to their <!--del_lnk--> vernacular as <i>Scottis</i> and increasingly called Gaelic <i>Erse</i> (from Erisch, or &quot;Irish&quot;), now often considered pejorative.<p><!--del_lnk--> Northumbrian <!--del_lnk--> Old English had been established in southeastern Scotland as far as the <!--del_lnk--> River Forth by the 7th century. It remained largely confined to this area until the 13th century, continuing in common use while Gaelic was the court language. English then spread further into Scotland via the <!--del_lnk--> burghs, proto-urban institutions which were first established by King <!--del_lnk--> David I. The growth in prestige of English in the 14th century, and the complementary decline of French in Scotland, made English the <!--del_lnk--> prestige language of most of eastern Scotland.<p>Modern Scots thus grew out of the early northern form of <!--del_lnk--> Middle English spoken by the people of southeastern Scotland and northern England. Scots, or more accurately, <!--del_lnk--> Middle English, made its first literary appearance in Scotland in the mid-14th century, when its form differed little from other northern Anglic dialects, and so Scots shared many Northumbrian borrowings from <!--del_lnk--> Old Norse and <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Norman French. Later influences include <a href="../../wp/d/Dutch_language.htm" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Middle Low German through trade with and immigration from the low countries, as well as <!--del_lnk--> Romance via ecclesiastical and legal <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> and French owing to the <!--del_lnk--> Auld Alliance. Scots has loan words resulting from contact with Gaelic. Early medieval legal documents show a language peppered with Gaelic legal and administrative loans. Today Gaelic loans are mainly for geographical and cultural features, such as <i>ceilidh</i>, <i>loch</i> and <i>clan</i>. Many Scots words have also <!--del_lnk--> become part of English: <i>flit</i>, &#39;to move home&#39;, <i>greed</i>, <i>eerie</i>, <i>cuddle</i>, <i>clan</i>, <i>stob</i>, &#39;a post&#39;.<p><a id="Status" name="Status"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Status</span></h2>

      <p>Before the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Union 1707, when Scotland and England joined to form the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Great Britain, there is ample evidence that Scots was widely held to be an independent language as part of a <!--del_lnk--> pluricentric <!--del_lnk--> diasystem.<p>Today, in Scotland, most people&#39;s speech is somewhere on a continuum ranging from traditional broad Scots to <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Standard English. Many speakers are either <!--del_lnk--> diglossic and/or able to <!--del_lnk--> code-switch along the continuum depending on the situation in which they find themselves. Where on this continuum English-influenced Scots becomes Scots-influenced English is difficult to determine. (see <!--del_lnk--> language change below). Consequently it is often disputed whether or not the varieties of Scots are dialects of Scottish English or constitute a separate language in their own right.<p>The British government now accepts Scots as a <!--del_lnk--> regional language and has recognised it as such under the <!--del_lnk--> European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Evidence for its existence as a separate language lies in the extensive body of Scots literature, its independent &mdash; if somewhat fluid &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> orthographic conventions and in its former use as the language of the original <!--del_lnk--> Parliament of Scotland. Since Scotland retained distinct political, legal and religious systems after the Union, many Scots terms passed into Scottish English. For instance, <!--del_lnk--> libel and slander, separate in <!--del_lnk--> English law, are bundled together as <i>defamation</i> in <!--del_lnk--> Scots law.<p>After the Union and the shift of political power to England, the use of Scots was discouraged by many in authority and education, as was the notion of Scottishness itself. Many leading Scots of the period, such as <a href="../../wp/d/David_Hume.htm" title="David Hume">David Hume</a>, considered themselves Northern British rather than Scottish. They attempted to rid themselves of their Scots in a bid to establish standard English as the official language of the newly formed Union. Enthusiasm for this new Britishness waned over time, and the use of Scots as a <!--del_lnk--> literary language was revived by several prominent Scotsmen such as <!--del_lnk--> Robert Burns. There is no current institutionalised standard literary form. During the second half of the <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a>, enthusiasts developed regularised cross-dialect forms following historical orthographic conventions, but these have had a limited impact. In the <!--del_lnk--> written Scots language, local loyalties often prevail, and the written form usually contains some Standard English adapted to represent the local pronunciation. However, many Scots words (which do not appear in Standard English) are still used in everyday speech.<p>No education takes place through the <!--del_lnk--> medium of Scots, though English lessons may cover it superficially, which usually entails reading some Scots literature and observing local dialect. Much of the material used is often Standard English disguised as Scots, which has upset both proponents of Standard English and proponents of Scots alike. One example of the educational establishment&#39;s approach to Scots is &quot;<i>Write a poem in Scots. (It is important not to be worried about spelling in this &ndash; write as you hear the sounds in your head.)</i>&quot;, whereas guidelines for English require teaching pupils to be &quot;<i>writing fluently and legibly with accurate spelling and punctuation.</i>&quot; . On the one hand, this can be seen as revealing the institutionalised disregard for the idea of treating Scots as a language on a par with English. On the other hand, it can be seen as a teaching method to get around the fact that the pupils, the teachers, and the teachers&#39; parents alike have been taught in school that Scots is &#39;bad spelling&#39;, and thus that pupils will self-censor any Scots that they do know. Scots can also be studied at university level. The educational system often fails to further the objective to produce people able to read, write, and speak Scots as an autonomous alternative to English, thus contributing to its perceived status by non-Scots speakers as a series of local dialects of English.<p>The use of Scots in the media is scant and is usually reserved for niches where local dialect is deemed acceptable, e.g. comedy, <!--del_lnk--> Burns Night, or representations of traditions and times gone by. Serious use for news, encyclopaedias, documentaries, etc. rarely occurs in Scots, although the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Parliament website offers some information on it. Attitudes towards Scots in the media vary widely, as may be seen by contrasting this sober <!--del_lnk--> official BBC Ulster article with this satirical <!--del_lnk--> H2G2 entry.<p>It is often held that, had Scotland remained independent, Scots would have remained and been regarded as a separate language from English. This has happened in <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>, where two independent countries developed <!--del_lnk--> standardised languages, <a href="../../wp/p/Portuguese_language.htm" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a> originating from a common Galician-Portuguese language, which itself originated from a common <!--del_lnk--> Iberian Romance language shared with Castilian <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_language.htm" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>. On the other hand a situation similar to that of <!--del_lnk--> Swiss German and <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">standard German</a> might have occurred. Equally, the present situation might have occurred, where the social elites and the upwardly mobile adopted <!--del_lnk--> Standard English, causing institutional language shift. A model of <!--del_lnk--> language revival to which many enthusiasts aspire is that of the <!--del_lnk--> Catalan language in areas spanning parts of Spain, France, Andorra and Italy, particularly as regards the situation of Catalan in <!--del_lnk--> Catalonia.<p><a id="Language_change" name="Language_change"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Language change</span></h2>
      <p>After the Union of Scotland and England, the issue of language became topical, and foremost was the question of whether Scottish people should speak English or Scots. Gaelic was never considered an option; at the time, it was mostly relegated to the Highlands and Islands. Scots became considered to have a <!--del_lnk--> substratal relationship to English, as opposed to an <!--del_lnk--> adstratal relationship.<p>On one hand, well-off Scots took to learning English through such activities as those of the Irishman <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Sheridan (father of <!--del_lnk--> Richard Sheridan), who in <!--del_lnk--> 1761 gave a series of lectures on English <!--del_lnk--> elocution. Charging a guinea at a time (about &pound;65 in today&#39;s money), they were attended by over 300 men, and he was made a <!--del_lnk--> freeman of the City of <a href="../../wp/e/Edinburgh.htm" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>. Following this, some of the city&#39;s intellectuals formed the <i>Select Society for Promoting the Reading and Speaking of the English Language in Scotland</i>. This was not universally welcomed, as was illustrated by the summary by F. Pottle, <!--del_lnk--> James Boswell&#39;s 20th century biographer, concerning James&#39; view of his father <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Boswell&#39;s speech habits: <i>He scorned modern literature, spoke broad Scots from the bench, and even in writing took no pains to avoid the Scotticisms which most of his colleagues were coming to regard as vulgar</i>.<p>On the other hand, the education system also became increasingly geared to teaching English, though this was initially impaired by the teachers&#39; and students&#39; lack of knowledge of English pronunciation through lack of contact with English speakers. Aspects of English <!--del_lnk--> grammar and <!--del_lnk--> lexis could be accessed through printed texts. By the <!--del_lnk--> 1840s the Scottish Education Department&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> language policy was that Scots had no value <i>&quot;...it is not the language of &#39;educated&#39; people anywhere, and could not be described as a suitable medium of education or culture&quot;</i>. Students, of course, reverted to Scots outside the classroom, but the reversion was not complete. What occurred, and has been occurring ever since, is a process of <!--del_lnk--> language attrition, whereby successive generations have adopted more and more features from English. This process has accelerated rapidly since wide-spread access to <a href="../../wp/m/Mass_media.htm" title="Mass media">mass media</a> in English, and increased population mobility, became available after the <!--del_lnk--> Second World War. It has recently taken on the nature of wholesale <!--del_lnk--> language shift. These processes are often erroneously referred to as language <!--del_lnk--> change, <!--del_lnk--> convergence or <!--del_lnk--> merger.<p>A rather more positive take on this is that, rather than reject English culture, the Scots mastered and conquered it, becoming <!--del_lnk--> bilingual and writing some of the greatest works of the time, such as <a href="../../wp/a/Adam_Smith.htm" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a>&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Wealth of Nations</i>, in what was still a foreign language. However, most younger Scots today see a Scottish <!--del_lnk--> accent, that is, Scottish English, as a sufficient marker of their Scottishness, and are generally not interested in retaining bilingualism in a language they consider old-fashioned, parochial, or simply <i>uncool</i>. Residual features of Scots are often regarded as <!--del_lnk--> slang.<p><a id="Literature" name="Literature"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Literature</span></h2>
      <p>Examples of the first English literature include <!--del_lnk--> Christ&#39;s Prayer in <!--del_lnk--> Northumbrian Anglo-Saxon from c. 650, which begins &quot;Faeder ure, Thu the eart on heofonum,&quot;. Some Scottish and Northumbrian folk still say &quot;oor faither&quot; and &quot;thoo art&quot;. <i>The Genesis Poem</i> attributed to <a href="../../wp/c/C%25C3%25A6dmon.htm" title="C&aelig;dmon">C&aelig;dmon</a> of <!--del_lnk--> Whitby in <!--del_lnk--> Northumbria opens with the words &quot;Us is riht mikel&quot; which is translated as &quot;We are mighty great&quot;, but in Scots could appear as &quot;Us is richt muckle&quot;. The words were written around 675 by a monk trained by the <!--del_lnk--> Celtic church of <!--del_lnk--> Iona taking dictation from the illiterate herdsman Caedmon singing in Northumbrian Anglo-Saxon in a monastery then known by the Gaelic name of <i>Streaneshalch</i>. C&aelig;dmon&#39;s name is <!--del_lnk--> Brythonic, and some scholars think that he may have been bilingual.<p>Among the earliest Scots literature is <!--del_lnk--> John Barbour&#39;s <i>Brus</i> (fourteenth century), Whyntoun&#39;s <i>Kronykil</i> and <!--del_lnk--> Blind Harry&#39;s <i>Wallace</i> (fifteenth century). From the fifteenth century, much literature based around the Royal Court in Edinburgh and the <!--del_lnk--> University of St Andrews was produced by writers such as <!--del_lnk--> Robert Henryson, <!--del_lnk--> William Dunbar, Douglas and <!--del_lnk--> David Lyndsay. <i><!--del_lnk--> The Complaynt of Scotland</i> was an early printed work in Scots.<p>After the seventeenth century, anglicisation increased, though Scots was still spoken by the vast majority of the population. At the time, many of the oral ballads from the <!--del_lnk--> borders and the North East were written down. Writers of the period were <!--del_lnk--> Robert Sempill, <!--del_lnk--> Robert Sempill the younger, <!--del_lnk--> Francis Sempill, Lady Wardlaw and Lady <!--del_lnk--> Grizel Baillie.<p>In the eighteenth century, writers such as Alan Ramsay, <!--del_lnk--> Robert Burns, <!--del_lnk--> Robert Fergusson and <a href="../../wp/w/Walter_Scott.htm" title="Walter Scott">Walter Scott</a> continued to use Scots. Scott introduced vernacular dialogue to his novels.<p>Following their example, such well-known authors as <!--del_lnk--> Robert Louis Stevenson, William Alexander, <!--del_lnk--> George MacDonald and <!--del_lnk--> J. M. Barrie also wrote in Scots or used it in dialogue.<p>In the <!--del_lnk--> Victorian era popular Scottish newspapers regularly included articles and commentary in the vernacular, often of unprecedented proportions.<p>In the early twentieth century, a <!--del_lnk--> renaissance in the use of Scots occurred, its most vocal figure being <!--del_lnk--> Hugh MacDiarmid. Other contemporaries were Douglas Young, Sidney Goodsir Smith, <!--del_lnk--> Robert Garioch and Robert McLellan. However, the revival was largely limited to verse and other literature.<p>In 1983 <!--del_lnk--> William Laughton Lorimer&#39;s translation of the New Testament from the original Greek was published.<p>Highly anglicised Scots is often used in contemporary fiction, for example, the Edinburgh dialect of Scots in <i><!--del_lnk--> Trainspotting</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Irvine Welsh (later made into a motion picture of the same name, though with language allegedly anglicised even more to make it suitable for an international audience).<p><i>But&#39;n&#39;Ben A-Go-Go</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Matthew Fitt is a <a href="../../wp/c/Cyberpunk.htm" title="Cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a> novel written entirely in what <!--del_lnk--> Wir Ain Leid (Our Own Language) calls &quot;General Scots&quot;.

       <li><!--del_lnk--> Northern Scots, spoken north of Dundee, often split into North Northern, Mid Northern&mdash;also known as North East Scots and referred to as &quot;the <!--del_lnk--> Doric&quot;&mdash;and South Northern.<li><!--del_lnk--> Central Scots, spoken from Fife and Perthshire to the Lothians and Wigtownshire, often split into North East and South East Central, West Central and South West Central Scots.<li><!--del_lnk--> South Scots or simply &quot;Border Tongue&quot; or &quot;Borders&#39; Dialect&quot; spoken in the <!--del_lnk--> Border areas.<li><!--del_lnk--> Insular Scots, spoken in the <a href="../../wp/o/Orkney.htm" title="Orkney Islands">Orkney Islands</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Shetland Islands.<li><!--del_lnk--> Ulster Scots, spoken by the descendants of Scottish settlers (and also many of Irish and English descent) in littoral <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> and <!--del_lnk--> County Donegal in the Irish Republic, and sometimes described by the <!--del_lnk--> neologism &quot;Ullans&quot;, a conflation of <!--del_lnk--> Ulster and <!--del_lnk--> Lallans.

      <p>Many writers now strictly avoid apostrophes where they <!--del_lnk--> supposedly represent &quot;missing&quot; English letters. Such letters were never actually missing in Scots. For example, in the <a href="../../wp/1/14th_century.htm" title="14th century">14th century</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Barbour spelt the Scots <!--del_lnk--> cognate of &#39;taken&#39; as <i>tane</i>. Since there has been no <i>k</i> in the word for over 700 years, representing its omission with an apostrophe seems pointless. The current spelling is usually <i>taen</i>. The following is more a guide for readers. How the spellings are applied in practice is beyond the scope of such a short description.

      <p><i>The</i> is used before the names of seasons, days of the week, many nouns, diseases, trades, occupations, sciences and academic subjects. It is also often used in place of the indefinite article and instead of a possessive pronoun: <i>the hairst</i> (autumn), <i>the Wadensday</i> (Wednesday), <i>awa til the kirk</i> (off to church), <i>the nou</i> (at the moment), <i>the day</i> (today), <i>the haingles</i> (influenza), <i>the Laitin</i> (Latin), <i>The deuk ett the bit breid</i> (The duck ate a piece of bread), <i>the wife</i> (my wife) etc.<p><a id="Nouns" name="Nouns"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Nouns</span></h3>

The usage with <i>no</i> is preferred to that with -<i>na</i> with contractable auxiliary verbs like -<i>ll</i> for <i>will</i>, or in yes no questions with any auxiliary <i>He&#39;ll no come</i> and <i>Did he no come?</i><p><a id="Relative_pronoun" name="Relative_pronoun"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Relative pronoun</span></h3>
      <p>The relative pronoun is <i>that</i> (<i>&#39;at</i> is an alternative form borrowed from Norse but can also be arrived at by contraction) for all persons and numbers, but may be left out <i>Thare&#39;s no mony fowk</i> (<i>that</i>) <i>leeves in that glen</i> (There aren&#39;t many people who live in that glen). The anglicised forms <i>wha</i>, <i>wham</i>, <i>whase</i> &#39;who, whom, whose&#39;, and the older <i>whilk</i> &#39;which&#39; are literary affectations; <i>whilk</i> is only used after a statement <i>He said he&#39;d tint it, whilk wis no whit we wantit tae hear</i>. The possessive is formed by adding &#39;<i>s</i> or by using an appropriate pronoun <i>The wifie that&#39;s hoose gat burnt</i>, <i>the wumman that her dochter gat mairit</i>; <i>the men that thair boat wis tint</i>.<p>A third adjective/adverb <i>yon</i>/<i>yonder</i>, <i>thon</i>/<i>thonder</i> indicating something at some distance <i>D&#39;ye see yon</i>/<i>thon hoose ower yonder</i>/<i>thonder?</i> Also <i>thae</i> (those) and <i>thir</i> (these), the plurals of <i>this</i> and <i>that</i>.<p>In Northern Scots <i>this</i> and <i>that</i> are also used where &quot;these&quot; and &quot;those&quot; would be in Standard English.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_language&quot;</div>
