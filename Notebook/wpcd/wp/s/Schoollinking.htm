<h2>School Linking and Village Sponsorship</h2><p><strong>09/06/2006</strong></p>
<p><strong> Are you interested in sponsoring a village and school linking? </strong></p><p>By sponsoring an SOS Children's Village, your school can develop a lasting partnership with an SOS Nursery, Primary or Secondary School. You could explore similarities and differences in everyday life, share resources and exchange experiences. This very tangible link serves to fully engage the interest of pupils and teachers alike. Sponsorship is &pound;240 a year. All money raised goes directly to the SOS Children's Village you are supporting. This fundraising opportunity encourages pupils to become active and responsible citizen's, through the development of organisational and leadership skills.</p><img src="../../wp/b/Boysplayinggame.jpg" width="284" height="213" alt="Boys Playing a Traditional Game" class="right" /><p><em> What can you expect from your school link? </em><br /><ul><li><p>You will receive an introductory pack with a profile of the SOS Children's Village and link School. </p></li><li><p>A copy of A World of Learning.
