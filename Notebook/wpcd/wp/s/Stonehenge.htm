      <p><b>Stonehenge</b> is a <!--del_lnk--> Neolithic and <a href="../../wp/b/Bronze_Age.htm" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a> <!--del_lnk--> megalithic <!--del_lnk--> monument located near <!--del_lnk--> Amesbury in the <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a> county of <!--del_lnk--> Wiltshire, about 8 miles (13 km) north of <!--del_lnk--> Salisbury. Its geographical location is 51&deg;10&prime;44,85&Prime;N, 1&deg;49&prime;35,13&Prime;W <!--del_lnk--> . It is composed of <!--del_lnk--> earthworks surrounding a circular setting of large <!--del_lnk--> standing stones and is one of the most famous <!--del_lnk--> prehistoric sites in the world. <a href="../../wp/a/Archaeology.htm" title="Archaeology">Archaeologists</a> think that the standing stones were erected between <!--del_lnk--> 2500 BCE and <!--del_lnk--> 2000 BCE although the surrounding circular earth bank and ditch, which constitute the earliest phase of the monument, have been dated to about <!--del_lnk--> 3100 BC. The site and its surroundings were added to the <!--del_lnk--> UNESCO&#39;s list of <!--del_lnk--> World Heritage Sites in <!--del_lnk--> 1986 in a co-listing with <!--del_lnk--> Avebury henge monument, and it is also a legally protected <!--del_lnk--> Scheduled Ancient Monument. Stonehenge itself is owned and managed by <!--del_lnk--> English Heritage whilst the surrounding <!--del_lnk--> downland is owned by the <!--del_lnk--> National Trust.<p>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Christopher Chippendale&#39;s <i>Stonehenge Complete</i> gives the derivation of Stonehenge as coming from the <a href="../../wp/o/Old_English_language.htm" title="Old English language">Old English</a> words &quot;st&#x101;n&quot; meaning &quot;stone&quot;, and either &quot;hencg&quot; meaning &quot;<!--del_lnk--> hinge&quot; (because the stone lintels hinge on the upright stones) or &quot;hen(c)en&quot; meaning &quot;<!--del_lnk--> gallows&quot; or &quot;instrument of torture&quot;. Medieval gallows consisted of two uprights with a lintel joining them, resembling Stonehenge&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> trilithons, rather than looking like the inverted L-shape more familiar today.<p>The &quot;henge&quot; portion has given its name to a class of monuments known as <!--del_lnk--> henges. Archaeologists define henges as earthworks consisting of a circular banked enclosure with an internal ditch. As often happens in archaeological terminology, this is a holdover from <!--del_lnk--> antiquarian usage, and Stonehenge cannot in fact be truly classified as a henge site as its bank is inside its ditch. Despite being contemporary with true Neolithic henges and <!--del_lnk--> stone circles, Stonehenge is in many ways atypical. For example, its extant trilithons make it unique. Stonehenge is only distantly related to the other stones circles in the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Isles.htm" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Ring of Brodgar.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The Stonehenge complex was built in several construction phases spanning 2,000 years, although there is evidence for activity both before and afterwards on the site.<p>Dating and understanding the various phases of activity at Stonehenge is not a simple task; it is complicated by poorly-kept early <!--del_lnk--> excavation records, surprisingly few accurate scientific dates and the disturbance of the natural <!--del_lnk--> chalk by <!--del_lnk--> periglacial effects and animal burrowing. The modern phasing most generally agreed by archaeologists is detailed below. Features mentioned in the text are numbered and shown on the plan, right, which illustrates the site as of <!--del_lnk--> 2004. The plan omits the trilithon lintels for clarity. Holes that no longer, or never, contained stones are shown as open circles and stones visible today are shown coloured.<p><a id="Before_the_monument" name="Before_the_monument"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Before the monument</span></h3>
      <p>Archaeologists have found four (or possibly five, although one may have been a natural <!--del_lnk--> tree throw) large <!--del_lnk--> Mesolithic <!--del_lnk--> postholes which date to around <!--del_lnk--> 8000 BC nearby, beneath the modern tourist car-park. These held <!--del_lnk--> pine posts around 0.75m (2.4ft) in diameter which were erected and left to rot <i>in situ</i>. Three of the posts (and possibly four) were in an east-west alignment and may have had <!--del_lnk--> ritual significance; no parallels are known from Britain at the time but similar sites have been found in <!--del_lnk--> Scandinavia. At this time, <!--del_lnk--> Salisbury Plain was still wooded but four thousand years later, during the earlier Neolithic, a <!--del_lnk--> cursus monument was built 600m north of the site as the first farmers began to clear the forest and exploit the area. Several other early Neolithic sites, a <!--del_lnk--> causewayed enclosure at <!--del_lnk--> Robin Hood&#39;s Ball and <!--del_lnk--> long barrow tombs were built in the surrounding landscape.<p><a id="Stonehenge_1" name="Stonehenge_1"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Stonehenge 1</span></h3>

      </div>
      <p>The first monument consisted of a circular bank and ditch enclosure <i>(7 and 8)</i> measuring around 110 m (360 feet) in diameter with a large entrance to the north east and a smaller one to the south <i>(14)</i>. It stood in open <!--del_lnk--> grassland on a slightly sloping but not especially remarkable spot. The builders placed the bones of <!--del_lnk--> deer and <!--del_lnk--> oxen in the bottom of the ditch as well as some worked <!--del_lnk--> flint tools. The bones were considerably older than the antler picks used to dig the ditch and the people who buried them had looked after them for some time prior to burial. The ditch itself was continuous but had been dug in sections, like the ditches of the earlier causewayed enclosures in the area. The chalk dug from the ditch was piled up to form the bank. This first stage is dated to around <!--del_lnk--> 3100 BC after which the ditch began to silt up naturally and was not cleared out by the builders. Within the outer edge of the enclosed area was dug a circle of 56 pits, each around 1m in diameter <i>(13)</i>, known as the <!--del_lnk--> Aubrey holes after <!--del_lnk--> John Aubrey, the seventeenth century <!--del_lnk--> antiquarian who was thought to have first identified them. The pits may have contained standing timbers, creating a <!--del_lnk--> timber circle although there is no excavated evidence of them. A small outer bank beyond the ditch could also date to this period <i>(9)</i>..<p><a id="Stonehenge_2" name="Stonehenge_2"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Stonehenge 2</span></h3>
      <p>Evidence of the second phase is no longer visible. It appears from the number of postholes dating to this period that some form of timber structure was built within the enclosure during the early <!--del_lnk--> 3rd millennium BC. Further standing timbers were placed at the northeast entrance and a parallel alignment of posts ran inwards from the southern entrance. The postholes are smaller than the Aubrey Holes, being only around 0.4m in diameter and are much less regularly spaced. The bank was purposely reduced in height and the ditch continued to silt up. At least twenty-five of the Aubrey Holes are known to have contained later, intrusive, <!--del_lnk--> cremation burials dating to the two centuries after the monument&#39;s inception. It seems that whatever the holes&#39; initial function, it changed to become a funerary one during Phase 2. Thirty further cremations were placed in the enclosure&#39;s ditch and at other points within the monument, mostly in the eastern half. Stonehenge is therefore interpreted as functioning as an <!--del_lnk--> enclosed cremation cemetery at this time, the earliest known cremation <!--del_lnk--> cemetery in the British Isles. Fragments of unburnt human bone have also been found in the ditch fill. Late Neolithic <!--del_lnk--> grooved ware pottery has been found in connection with the features from this phase providing dating evidence.<p><a id="Stonehenge_3_I" name="Stonehenge_3_I"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Stonehenge 3 I</span></h3>
      <p>Archaeological excavation has indicated that around <!--del_lnk--> 2600 BC, timber was abandoned in favour of stone and two concentric crescents of holes (called the Q and R Holes) were dug in the centre of the site. Again, there is little firm dating evidence for this phase. The holes held up to 80 standing stones (shown blue on the plan) 43 of which were derived from the <!--del_lnk--> Preseli Hills, 250 km away in modern day <!--del_lnk--> Pembrokeshire in <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a>. Other standing stones may well have been small sarsens, used later as lintels. The far-travelled stones, which weighed about four tons, consisted mostly of spotted <!--del_lnk--> dolerite but included examples of <!--del_lnk--> rhyolite, <!--del_lnk--> tuff and volcanic and calcareous ash. Each measures around 2m in height, between 1m and 1.5m wide and around 0.8m thick. What was to become known as the <!--del_lnk--> Altar Stone <i>(1)</i>, a six-ton specimen of green micaceous <!--del_lnk--> sandstone, twice the height of the bluestones, is derived from either South Pembrokeshire or the <!--del_lnk--> Brecon Beacons and may have stood as a single large <!--del_lnk--> monolith.<p>The north eastern entrance was also widened at this time with the result that it precisely matched the direction of the <!--del_lnk--> midsummer <!--del_lnk--> sunrise and <!--del_lnk--> midwinter <!--del_lnk--> sunset of the period. This phase of the monument was abandoned unfinished however, the small standing stones were apparently removed and the Q and R holes purposefully backfilled. Even so, the monument appears to have eclipsed the site at <!--del_lnk--> Avebury in importance towards the end of this phase and the <!--del_lnk--> Amesbury Archer, found in <!--del_lnk--> 2002 three miles (5 km) to the south, would have seen the site in this state.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Heelstone <i>(5)</i> may also have been erected outside the north eastern entrance during this period although it cannot be securely dated and may have been installed at any time in phase 3. At first, a second stone, now no longer visible, joined it. Two, or possibly three, large portal stones were set up just inside the northeastern entrance of which only one, the fallen Slaughter Stone <i>(4)</i>, 16&nbsp;ft (4.9&nbsp;m) long, now remains. Other features loosely dated to phase 3 include the four <!--del_lnk--> Station Stones <i>(6)</i>, two of which stood atop mounds <i>(2 and 3)</i>. The mounds are known as &#39;barrows&#39; although they do not contain burials. The <!--del_lnk--> Avenue, <i>(10)</i>, a parallel pair of ditches and banks leading 3 km to the <!--del_lnk--> River Avon was also added. Ditches were later dug around the Station Stones and the Heelstone, which was by then reduced to a single monolith.<p><a id="Stonehenge_3_II" name="Stonehenge_3_II"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Stonehenge 3 II</span></h3>
      <p>The next major phase of activity at the tail end of the <!--del_lnk--> 3rd millennium BC saw 30 enormous <!--del_lnk--> sarsen stones <i>(shown grey on the plan)</i> brought from a quarry around 24 miles (40 km) north to the site on the <!--del_lnk--> Marlborough Downs. The stones were dressed and fashioned with <!--del_lnk--> mortise and tenon joints before 30 were erected as a 33 m (108 ft) diameter circle of standing stones with a &#39;lintel&#39; of 30 stones resting on top. The lintels were joined to one another using another woodworking method, the <!--del_lnk--> tongue in groove joint. Each standing stone was around 4.1 m (13.5 feet) high, 2.1 m (7.5 feet) wide and weighed around 25 tons. Each had clearly been worked with the final effect in mind; the <!--del_lnk--> orthostats widen slightly towards the top in order that their perspective remains constant as they rise up from the ground whilst the lintel stones curve slightly to continue the circular appearance of the earlier monument. The sides of the stones that face inwards are smoother and more finely worked than the sides that face outwards. The average thickness of these stones is 1.1 m (3.75 feet) and the average distance between them is 1 m (3.5 feet). A total of 74 stones would have been needed to complete the circle and unless some of the sarsens were removed from the site, it would seem that the ring was left incomplete. Of the lintel stones, they are each around 3.2 m long (10.5 feet), 1 m (3.5 feet) wide and 0.8 m (2.75 feet) thick. The tops of the lintels are 4.9 m (16 feet) above the ground.<p>Within this circle stood five <!--del_lnk--> trilithons of dressed <!--del_lnk--> sarsen stone arranged in a horseshoe shape 13.7 m (45 feet) across with its open end facing north east. These huge stones, ten uprights and five lintels, weigh up to 50 tons each and were again linked using complex jointings. They are arranged symmetrically; the smallest pair of trilithons were around 6 m (20 feet) tall, the next pair a little higher and the largest, single trilithon in the south west corner would have been 7.3 m (24 feet) tall. Only one upright from the Great Trilithon still stands; 6.7 m (22 ft) is visible and a further 2.4 m (8 feet) is below ground.<p>The images of a &#39;dagger&#39; and 14 &#39;axe-heads&#39; have been recorded carved on one of the sarsens, known as stone 53. Further axe-head carvings have been seen on the outer faces of stones known as numbers 3, 4, and 5. They are difficult to date but are morphologically similar to later Bronze Age weapons; <!--del_lnk--> recent laser scanning work on the carvings supports this interpretation. The pair of trilithons in north east are smallest, measuring around 6 m (20 feet) in height and the largest is the trilithon in the south west of the horseshoe is almost 7.5 m (24 feet) tall.<p>This ambitious phase is <!--del_lnk--> radiocarbon dated to between <!--del_lnk--> 2440 and <!--del_lnk--> 2100 BC.<p><a id="Stonehenge_3_III" name="Stonehenge_3_III"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Stonehenge 3 III</span></h3>
      <p>Later in the Bronze Age, the bluestones appear to have been re-erected for the first time, although the precise details of this period are still unclear. They were placed within the outer sarsen circle and at this time may have been trimmed in some way. A few have timber working-style cuts in them like the sarsens themselves, suggesting they may have been linked with lintels and part of a larger structure during this phase.<p><a id="Stonehenge_3_IV" name="Stonehenge_3_IV"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Stonehenge 3 IV</span></h3>
      <p>This phase saw further rearrangement of the bluestones as they were placed in a circle between the two settings of sarsens and in an oval in the very centre. Some archaeologists argue that some of the bluestones in this period were part of a second group brought from Wales. All the stones were well-spaced uprights without any of the linking lintels inferred in Stonehenge 3 III. The Altar Stone may have been moved within the oval and stood vertically. Although this would seem the most impressive phase of work, Stonehenge 3 IV was rather shabbily built compared to its immediate predecessors, the newly re-installed bluestones were not at all well founded and began to fall over. However, only minor changes were made after this phase. Stonehenge 3 IV dates from <!--del_lnk--> 2280 to <!--del_lnk--> 1930 BC.<p><a id="Stonehenge_3_V" name="Stonehenge_3_V"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Stonehenge 3 V</span></h3>
      <p>Soon afterwards, the north eastern section of the Phase 3 IV Bluestone circle was removed, creating a horseshoe-shaped setting termed the Bluestone Horseshoe. This mirrored the shape of the central sarsen Trilithons and dates from <!--del_lnk--> 2270 to <!--del_lnk--> 1930 BC. This phase is contemporary with the famous <!--del_lnk--> Seahenge site in <a href="../../wp/n/Norfolk.htm" title="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>.<p><a id="Stonehenge_3_VI" name="Stonehenge_3_VI"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Stonehenge 3 VI</span></h3>
      <p>Two further rings of pits were dug outside the outermost sarsen circle, called the Y and Z Holes <i>(11 and 12)</i>. The Z holes were about 2m outside the outermost sarsen circle and the Y holes about 5m further out. These were each of thirty pits and each seems to match with one of the uprights in the outer sarsen circle. They were never filled with stones however and were permitted to silt up over the next few centuries; their upper fills contain <a href="../../wp/i/Iron_Age.htm" title="Iron Age">Iron Age</a> and <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Britain.htm" title="Roman Britain">Roman</a> material. Monument building at Stonehenge appears to have ended around <!--del_lnk--> 1600 BC.<p><a id="After_the_monument" name="After_the_monument"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">After the monument</span></h3>
      <p>Even though the last known construction of Stonehenge was about <!--del_lnk--> 1600 BC, and the last known usage of Stonehenge was during the <a href="../../wp/i/Iron_Age.htm" title="Iron Age">Iron Age</a> (if not as late as the <a href="../../wp/7/7th_century.htm" title="7th century">7th century</a>), where Roman coins, prehistoric pottery, an unusual bone point and a skeleton of a young male (780-410 cal BC) were found, we have no idea if Stonehenge was in continuous use or exactly how it was used. The burial of a decapitated <!--del_lnk--> Saxon man has also been excavated from Stonehenge, dated to the 7th century. The site was known by scholars during the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> and since then it has been studied and adopted by numerous different groups.

      <p>Many early historians were influenced by supernatural <!--del_lnk--> folktales in their explanations. Some legends held that <!--del_lnk--> Merlin the wizard had a giant build the structure for him or that he had magically transported it from <!--del_lnk--> Mount Killaraus in <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, while others held the <!--del_lnk--> Devil responsible. <!--del_lnk--> Henry of Huntingdon was the first to write of the monument around 1130 soon followed by <!--del_lnk--> Geoffrey of Monmouth who was the first to record fanciful associations with <a href="../../wp/k/King_Arthur.htm" title="King Arthur">King Arthur</a> which led the monument to be incorporated into the wider cycle of European medieval romance.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1615, <!--del_lnk--> Inigo Jones argued that Stonehenge was a <!--del_lnk--> Roman temple, dedicated to <!--del_lnk--> Caelus, (a Latin name for the Greek sky-god <!--del_lnk--> Ouranos), and built following the <!--del_lnk--> Tuscan order. Later commentators maintained that the <!--del_lnk--> Danes erected it. Indeed, up until the late nineteenth century, the site was commonly attributed to the Saxons or other relatively recent societies.<p>The first academic effort to survey and understand the monument was made around <!--del_lnk--> 1640 by <!--del_lnk--> John Aubrey. He declared Stonehenge the work of <!--del_lnk--> Druids. This view was greatly popularised by <!--del_lnk--> William Stukeley. Aubrey also contributed the first measured drawings of the site, which permitted greater analysis of its form and significance. From this work, he was able to demonstrate an astronomical or calendrical role in the stones&#39; placement.<p>By the turn of the nineteenth century, <!--del_lnk--> John Lubbock was able to attribute the site to the <a href="../../wp/b/Bronze_Age.htm" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a> based on the bronze objects found in the nearby <!--del_lnk--> barrows.<p>The early attempts to figure out the people who had undertaken this colossal project have since been debunked. While there have been precious few in the way of real theories to explain who built the site, or why, there can be an assessment of what we know to be fact and what has been proven false.<p>First there is the matter of radio carbon dating the construction of the site itself. As has been already stated in the construction outlines above, the monument building of the site began around the year 3100 BC and ended around the year 1600 BC. This allows the elimination of a few of the theories that have been presented. The original theory that the Druids were the ones who built the site can be discounted first since it is the more popular one. The Celtic society that spawned the Druid priesthood came into being only after the year 300 BC. In addition to this, the theory that the Druids using the site for sacrifices is thin, considering that the Druids were pagans and performed the majority of their rituals in the woods or mountains, areas better suited for &ldquo;earth rituals&rdquo; than an open field. As to the other theory relating to the Romans, this is more ludicrous yet. The Romans never even came to the British Isles until they conquered the land in 43 AD. The theories of Inigo Jones and others that Stonehenge was built as a Roman temple have been long dismissed. They were early theories, and when the actual dates of construction came out, any talk of merely early Saxon or Roman workers building the site are no longer considered. Other popular notions mentioned, aliens coming to Earth to build primitive man a map to the stars were dismissed out of hand, since besides being utterly impractical (why would aliens give a species that could barely write such a gift?), there is absolutely no physical evidence to back it up, save unsupported supposition about the frequency of these sites in the area. The problem with this is that who we do not know who originally started building it or the purpose behind it. It is difficult to imagine it being built for uses only one or two days in the year. And since it appears that it was built in three or four distinct stages, it is virtually impossible to tell what the purpose might have been since it was obviously worked on by a number of different cultures.<p>Other theories that have been taken out of consideration were the idea that Egyptian or Mycenaean or even Greek cultures, which coincided with the popular belief that these cultures infused Europe with Bronze Age culture. After the testing showed that the megalithic structures in both England and France predate these cultures, they were removed. Also mentioned on this site are the findings of John Lubbock at the turn of the 19th century that point to this site being a Bronze Age creation, based on axe heads and daggers and other artifacts that have been found. However, a number of carvings that were also thought to point to Bronze Age origin have since been refuted as being put in later, raising the serious question of whether or not the artifacts were used in the site or buried there at a later date in some sort of funerary rites.<p>The question that dominates the debate as to what Stonehenge was used for can be easily divided into those that believe it to be a religious or a scientific observatory. The scientific idea carries more weight. As outlined in the theories section below, Gerald Hawkins noted 165 key sites that he stated correlated very strongly with the rising and setting points of the sun and moon. He believed that because of this, the site could be used to anticipate interstellar phenomena. There have been odd occurrences, like the Hale-Bopp comet passing directly over this site at the turn of the millennium to support this theory. This has sparked the idea that the site was created in order to help commemorate the solstices, as the alignment with the sun and moon would seem to indicate.<p>Further supporting this line of evidence is the fact that the site&rsquo;s alignment is focused along the lunar lines in a way that increases the accuracy of procession, which is the amount that the Earth&rsquo;s slight tilt on its axis, or &ldquo;wobble&rdquo; will eventually change the timing of lunar events. In short, this site could have been set up to more accurately predict events taking place in the heavens above. While there is still no conclusive evidence that this site was indeed intended for use as an observatory, the fact also that much of the support for the religious use for this has come from a purely political standpoint. The modern Celts, who were for a long time believed to be the creators of the site, have moved quickly to claim the site as their own. They now hold festivals and ceremonies at different times during the year. The problem with this has been outlined above, with the carbon dating refuting their hand in the site&rsquo;s creation. There are a number of assumptions that have supported this theory, however. It is known that on the longest day of the year, the summer solstice, the sun shines directly through the centre of the structure, which given many of the cultural attitudes of sun worship that were rampant at the time, seems to indicate a religious purpose. In addition, much of what survives from the distant past, buildings, etc., have all been religious in nature.<p>Again, much of the early interpretations as to the nature of this site and the reason for its construction can be theorized and speculated upon, but there is no bulk of hard evidence to point us in one direction or the other. There are portions of the site that have not been excavated, such as the West portion, so there remain possible hard facts out there. All we can say for certain at this point is when it was built and the mathematical facts stated above that go along with it.<p><a id="Archaeoastronomy_and_Stonehenge" name="Archaeoastronomy_and_Stonehenge"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Archaeoastronomy and Stonehenge</span></h3>

      <p>Stonehenge is aligned northeast&ndash;southwest, and it has been suggested that particular significance was placed by its builders on the <!--del_lnk--> solstice and <!--del_lnk--> equinox points, so for example on a midsummer&#39;s morning, the sun rose close to the Heelstone, and the sun&#39;s first rays went directly into the centre of the monument between the horseshoe arrangement. It is unlikely that such an alignment could have been merely accidental.<p>A huge debate was triggered by the <!--del_lnk--> 1963 publication of <i>Stonehenge Decoded</i>, by British born astronomer <!--del_lnk--> Gerald Hawkins, who claimed to see a large number of astronomical alignments, both lunar and solar, at the site and argued that Stonehenge could have been used to predict <!--del_lnk--> eclipses. Hawkins&#39; book received wide publicity, partly because he used a computer in his calculations, then a rarity. Further contributions to the debate came from British astronomer C. A. Newham and Sir <!--del_lnk--> Fred Hoyle, the famous Cambridge cosmologist, as well as by <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Thom, a retired professor of engineering, who had been studying stone circles for more than 20 years. Their theories have faced criticism in recent decades from <!--del_lnk--> Richard Atkinson and others who have suggested impracticalities in the &#39;Stone Age calculator&#39; interpretative approach. Today, the consensus is that most of the astronomical case, although not all, was overstated.<p><a id="The_bluestones" name="The_bluestones"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The bluestones</span></h3>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Roger Mercer has observed that the bluestones are incongruously finely worked and has suggested that they were transferred to Salisbury Plain from an as yet unlocated earlier monument in <!--del_lnk--> Pembrokeshire. <!--del_lnk--> J. F. S. Stone felt that a Bluestone monument had earlier stood near the nearby Stonehenge cursus and been moved to their current site from there. If Mercer&#39;s theory is correct then the bluestones may have been transplanted to cement an alliance or display superiority over a conquered enemy although this can only be speculation. Oval shaped settings of bluestones similar to those at Stonehenge 3iv are also known at the sites of <!--del_lnk--> Bedd Arthur in the Preseli Hills and at <!--del_lnk--> Skomer Island off the southwest coast of Pembrokeshire. Some archaeologists have suggested that the <!--del_lnk--> igneous bluestones and <!--del_lnk--> sedimentary sarsens had some symbolism, of a union between two cultures from different landscapes and therefore from different backgrounds.<p>Recent analysis of contemporary burials found nearby known as the <!--del_lnk--> Boscombe Bowmen, has indicated that at least some of the individuals associated with Stonehenge 3 came either from Wales or from some other European area of ancient rocks. <!--del_lnk--> Petrological analysis of the stones themselves has verified that they could only have come from the Preseli Hills and it is tempting to connect the two.<p>The main source of the bluestones is now identified with the dolerite outcrops around <!--del_lnk--> Carn Menyn although work led by Olwen Williams-Thorpe of the <!--del_lnk--> Open University has shown that other bluestones came from outcrops up to 10 km away.<p><!--del_lnk--> Aubrey Burl and a number of geologists and geomorphologists contend that the bluestones were not transported by human agency at all and were instead brought by <a href="../../wp/g/Glacier.htm" title="Glacier">glaciers</a> at least part of the way from Wales during the <!--del_lnk--> Pleistocene. There is good <a href="../../wp/g/Geology.htm" title="Geology">geological</a> and glaciological evidence that glacier ice did move across Preseli and did reach the Somerset coast. However, it is uncertain that it reached Salisbury Plain, and no further specimens of the unusual dolerite stone have so far been found in the vicinity. One current view is that glacier ice transported the stones as far as Somerset, and that they were collected from there by the builders of Stonehenge.<!--del_lnk--> .<p><a id="Stonehenge_as_part_of_a_ritual_landscape" name="Stonehenge_as_part_of_a_ritual_landscape"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Stonehenge as part of a ritual landscape</span></h3>

      <p>Many archaeologists believe Stonehenge was an attempt to render in permanent stone the more common timber structures that dotted Salisbury Plain at the time, such as those that stood at <!--del_lnk--> Durrington Walls. Modern <a href="../../wp/a/Anthropology.htm" title="Anthropology">anthropological</a> evidence has been used by <!--del_lnk--> Mike Parker Pearson and the <a href="../../wp/m/Madagascar.htm" title="Madagascar">Malagasy</a> archaeologist <!--del_lnk--> Ramilisonina to suggest that timber was associated with the living and stone with the ancestral dead amongst prehistoric peoples. They have argued that Stonehenge was the terminus of a long, ritualised funerary procession for treating the dead, which began in the east, during sunrise at <!--del_lnk--> Woodhenge and <!--del_lnk--> Durrington Walls, moved down the Avon and then along the Avenue reaching Stonehenge in the west at sunset. The journey from wood to stone via water was, they consider, a symbolic journey from life to death. There is no satisfactory evidence to suggest that Stonehenge&#39;s astronomical alignments were anything more than symbolic and current interpretations favour a ritual role for the monument that takes into account its numerous burials and its presence within a wider landscape of <!--del_lnk--> sacred sites. Many also believe that the site may have had <!--del_lnk--> astrological/<!--del_lnk--> spiritual significance attached to it.<p><a id="Construction_techniques_and_design" name="Construction_techniques_and_design"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Construction techniques and design</span></h3>

      <p>Much speculation has surrounded the <a href="../../wp/e/Engineering.htm" title="Engineering">engineering</a> feats required to build Stonehenge. Assuming the bluestones were brought from Wales by hand, and not transported by glaciers as Aubrey Burl has claimed, various methods of moving them relying only on timber and <!--del_lnk--> rope have been suggested. In a <!--del_lnk--> 2001 exercise in <!--del_lnk--> experimental archaeology, an attempt was made to transport a large stone along a land and sea route from Wales to Stonehenge. Volunteers pulled it for some miles (with great difficulty) on a wooden sledge over land, using modern roads and low-friction netting to assist sliding, but once transferred to a replica prehistoric boat, the stone sank in <!--del_lnk--> Milford Haven, before it even reached the rough seas of the <!--del_lnk--> Bristol Channel.<p>As far as positioning the stones, it has been suggested that timber <!--del_lnk--> A-frames were erected to raise the stones, and that teams of people then hauled them upright using ropes. The topmost stones may have been raised up incrementally on timber platforms and slid into place or pushed up ramps. The carpentry-type joints used on the stones imply a people well skilled in woodworking and they could easily have had the knowledge to erect the monument using such methods. In <!--del_lnk--> 2003 retired construction worker <!--del_lnk--> Wally Wallington demonstrated ingenious techniques based on fundamental principles of levers, fulcrums and counterweights to show that a single man can rotate, walk, lift and tip a ten-ton cast-concrete monolith into an upright position. He is progressing with his plan to construct a simulated Stonehenge comprising of eight uprights and two lintels.<p><!--del_lnk--> Alexander Thom was of the opinion that the site was laid out with the necessary precision using his <!--del_lnk--> megalithic yard.<p>The engraved weapons on the sarsens are unique in megalithic art in the British Isles, where more abstract designs were invariably favoured. Similarly, the horseshoe arrangements of stones are unusual in a culture that otherwise arranged stones in circles. The axe motif is, however, common to the peoples of <!--del_lnk--> Brittany at the time, and it has been suggested at least two stages of Stonehenge were built under continental influence. This would go some way towards explaining the monument&#39;s atypical design, but overall, Stonehenge is still inexplicably unusual in the context of any prehistoric European culture.<p>Estimates of the manpower needed to build Stonehenge put the total effort involved at millions of hours of work. Stonehenge 1 probably needed around 11,000 <!--del_lnk--> man-hours (or 460 <!--del_lnk--> man-days) of work, Stonehenge 2 around 360,000 (15,000 man-days or 41 years) and the various parts of Stonehenge 3 may have involved up to 1.75 million hours (73 000 days or 200 years) of work. The working of the stones is estimated to have required around 20 million hours (830 000 days or 2300 years) of work using the primitive tools available at the time. Certainly, the will to produce such a site must have been strong, and it is considered that advanced social organisation would have been necessary to build and maintain it.<p><a id="Alternative_views" name="Alternative_views"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Alternative views</span></h3>
      <p>Stonehenge&#39;s fame comes not only from its archaeological significance or potential early astronomical role but also in its less tangible effect on visitors, what <!--del_lnk--> Christopher Chippindale describes as &quot;the physical sensation of the place&quot;, something that transcends the rational, scientific view of the monument. This manifests itself in the spiritual role of the site for many different groups and a belief that no single scientific explanation can do justice to it as a symbol of the great achievement of the ancient Britons and as a symbol of something that continues to confound mainstream archaeology.<p>Some people claim to have seen <!--del_lnk--> UFOs in the area, perhaps connected with the military installations around <!--del_lnk--> Warminster, that has led to ideas over it being an <!--del_lnk--> extraterrestrial landing site. <!--del_lnk--> Alfred Watkins found three <!--del_lnk--> ley lines running through the site and others have employed <!--del_lnk--> numerology <!--del_lnk--> dowsing or <!--del_lnk--> geomancy to reach diverse conclusions regarding the site&#39;s power and purpose. <!--del_lnk--> New Age and <!--del_lnk--> neo-pagan beliefs might see Stonehenge as a sacred place of worship which can conflict with its more mainstream role as an <!--del_lnk--> archaeological site, tourist attraction, or marketing tool. <!--del_lnk--> Post-processualist archaeologists might consider that treating Stonehenge as a computer or <!--del_lnk--> observatory is to apply modern concepts from our own technology-driven era back into the past. Even the role of <!--del_lnk--> indigenous peoples in archaeology, rarely applied in Western Europe, has created a new function for the site as a symbol of <!--del_lnk--> Welsh nationalism.<p>The significance of the &#39;ownership&#39; of Stonehenge in terms of the differing meanings and interpretations held by the many orthodox and unorthodox <!--del_lnk--> stakeholders in the site has been increasingly apparent in recent decades. Researchers Jenny Blain and Robert J. Wallis (<i>Sacred Sites, Contested Rites/Rights</i> project, <!--del_lnk--> http://www.sacredsites.org.uk) have pointed to the huge variety of views which show the continued and growing importance of Stonehenge today, as symbol and &#39;Icon of Britishness&#39;; and indicate also the increased awareness of pasts by many people with no training in archaeology or heritage. For many, Stonehenge and other ancient monuments form part of the &#39;living landscape&#39; which holds its own stories and which is there to be engaged with as people mark the seasons of the year. Today&#39;s mythology around Stonehenge includes the recent history of the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Beanfield and the previous <!--del_lnk--> Free festivals. Stonehenge has not one meaning but many. Today, curators <!--del_lnk--> English Heritage facilitate &#39;managed open access&#39; at <!--del_lnk--> solstices and <!--del_lnk--> equinoxes, with some disputes over the days on which these fall. Blain and Wallis argue that issues over access relate not only to physical presence at the stones but to interpretations of past and validity of &#39;new-indigenous&#39; and pagan usages in the present and such &#39;alternative&#39; views have been central in alerting public awareness to the issues of roads, tunnels and landscape, noted below.<p><a id="Excavations_at_Stonehenge" name="Excavations_at_Stonehenge"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Excavations at Stonehenge</span></h2>

      <p>The first recorded excavations at Stonehenge were carried out by <!--del_lnk--> William Cunnington and <!--del_lnk--> Richard Colt Hoare. In 1798, Cunnington investigated the pit beneath a recently fallen trilithon and in 1810, both men dug beneath the fallen Slaughter Stone and concluded that it had once stood up. They may have also excavated one of the Aubrey Holes beneath it. In 1900 <!--del_lnk--> William Gowland undertook the first extensive work, establishing that antler picks had been used to dig the stone holes and that the stones themselves had been worked to shape on site.<p>The largest excavation at Stonehenge was undertaken by Lieutenant-Colonel <!--del_lnk--> William Hawley and <!--del_lnk--> Robert S. Newall after the site had come into state hands. Their work, initially focusing on righting fallen stones, began in <!--del_lnk--> 1919 following the transfer of land and continued until <!--del_lnk--> 1926. It was funded by the <!--del_lnk--> Office of Works. The two men excavated many portions of the features at Stonehenge and were the first to establish that it was a multi-phase site.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1950 the <!--del_lnk--> Society of Antiquaries commissioned <!--del_lnk--> Richard Atkinson, <!--del_lnk--> Stuart Piggott and <!--del_lnk--> John FS Stone to carry out further excavations. They recovered many cremations and developed the phasing that still dominates much of what is written about Stonehenge. In <!--del_lnk--> 1979 and <!--del_lnk--> 1980 Mike Pitts led two smaller investigations as part of service trenching, close by the <!--del_lnk--> Heelstone, finding <!--del_lnk--> cryoturbated chalk and evidence for its neighbour.<p><a id="Myths_and_legends" name="Myths_and_legends"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Myths and legends</span></h2>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> <i>Heel Stone</i> was once known as &quot;Friar&#39;s Heel.&quot; A folk tale, which cannot be dated earlier than the seventeenth century, relates the origin of the name of this stone:<p><i>The <!--del_lnk--> Devil bought the stones from a woman in Ireland, wrapped them up, and brought them to Salisbury plain. One of the stones fell into the <!--del_lnk--> Avon, the rest were carried to the plain.

The stone stuck in the ground and is still there.</i><p>Some claim &quot;Friar&#39;s Heel&quot; is a corruption of &quot;Freyja&#39;s He-ol&quot; or &quot;Freyja Sul&quot;, from the Nordic goddess <!--del_lnk--> Freyja and (allegedly) the Welsh words for &quot;way&quot; and &quot;Friday&quot; respectively.<p><a id="Arthurian_legend" name="Arthurian_legend"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Arthurian legend</span></h3>
      <p>Stonehenge is also mentioned within <a href="../../wp/k/King_Arthur.htm" title="King Arthur">Arthurian legend</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Geoffrey of Monmouth said that <!--del_lnk--> Merlin the wizard directed its removal from <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, where it had been constructed on <!--del_lnk--> Mount Killaraus by <!--del_lnk--> Giants, who brought the stones from <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>. After it had been rebuilt near Amesbury, Geoffrey further narrates how first <!--del_lnk--> Ambrosius Aurelianus, then <!--del_lnk--> Uther Pendragon, and finally <!--del_lnk--> Constantine III, were buried inside the ring of stones. In many places in his <i><!--del_lnk--> Historia Regum Britanniae</i> Geoffrey mixes British legend and his own imagination; it is intriguing that he connects Ambrosius Aurelianus with this prehistoric monument, seeing how there is place-name evidence to connect Ambrosius with nearby Amesbury.<p>In <i>World Mythology: An Anthology of the Great Myths and Epics</i> (3rd ed.), by Donna Rosenburg, on pp. 428-30, she summarizes the Stonehenge story of the definitive Arthur legend. By this the reader learns that, according to the legend of King Arthur, the rocks of Stonehenge were paganistic healing rocks from Africa. Giants brought them from Africa to Ireland for their demonic healing properties. The second King of Britain, Aurelius Ambrosias (5th Century), wished to erect a memorial to the nobles who had died in battle with the Saxons. Those nobles were buried near Salisbury. With the help of Merlin, Aurelius made Stonehenge that monument. So the King sent Merlin, Uther Pendragon (Arthur&#39;s father), and 15,000 knights to Ireland to retrieve the rocks. They slew 7,000 Irish. As the knights tried to move the rocks with ropes and force, they failed. Then Merlin whispered witchcraft incantations over the rocks and they became as light as pebbles. Then Stonehenge was dedicated in Britain. Shortly after, Aurelius died and was buried within the Stonehenge monument, or &quot;The Giants&#39; Ring of Stonehenge&quot;.<p><a id="Recent_history" name="Recent_history"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Recent history</span></h2>

      <p>By the beginning of the <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a> a number of the stones had fallen or were leaning precariously, probably due to the increase in curious visitors clambering on them during the nineteenth century. Three phases of conservation work were undertaken which righted some unstable or fallen stones and carefully replaced them in their original positions using information from antiquarian drawings.<p>Stonehenge is a place of pilgrimage for <!--del_lnk--> neo-druids and those following <!--del_lnk--> pagan or <!--del_lnk--> neo-pagan beliefs. The midsummer sunrise began attracting modern visitors in 1870s, with the first record of recreated Druidic practices dating to 1905 when the <!--del_lnk--> Ancient Order of Druids enacted a ceremony. Despite efforts by archaeologists and historians to stress the differences between the Iron Age Druidic religion, the much older monument and modern Druidry, Stonehenge has become increasingly, almost inextricably, associated with British Druidism, Neo Paganism and New Age philosophy.<p>The earlier rituals were augmented by the <!--del_lnk--> Stonehenge free festival, held between <!--del_lnk--> 1972 and <!--del_lnk--> 1984, and loosely organised by the <!--del_lnk--> Politantric Circle. However, in <!--del_lnk--> 1985 the site was closed to festivalgoers by English Heritage and the National Trust by which time the number of midsummer visitors had risen from 500 to 30,000. A consequence of the end of the festival was the violent confrontation between the police and new age travellers that became known as the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Beanfield when police blockaded a convoy of travellers to prevent them from approaching Stonehenge. There was then no midsummer access for almost fifteen years until limited opening was negotiated in 2000.<p>In more recent years, the setting of the monument has been affected by the proximity of the <!--del_lnk--> A303 road between Amesbury and Winterbourne Stoke, and the <!--del_lnk--> A344. In early <!--del_lnk--> 2003, the <!--del_lnk--> Department for Transport announced that the A303 would be upgraded, including the construction of the <!--del_lnk--> Stonehenge road tunnel. The controversial plans have not yet been finalised by the government.<p>Also announced has been a new heritage centre, which was intended to be open in <!--del_lnk--> 2006. Current provision for visitors has often been criticised; in <!--del_lnk--> 1993 Stonehenge&#39;s presentation was condemned by the Public Accounts Committee of the <a href="../../wp/b/British_House_of_Commons.htm" title="British House of Commons">British House of Commons</a> as &#39;a national disgrace&#39;. English Heritage proposes a new purpose-built facility 3km from the stones at Countess Road in Amesbury, on the edge of the World Heritage Site boundary. Locals in Amesbury have complained that the scheme would shift traffic congestion from Stonehenge to their own village. They have also suggested that the necessary time that the public would now have to spend travelling to and from Stonehenge would likely dissuade many visitors, especially <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">American</a> and <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japanese</a> tourists on whistle-stop tours of England, from visiting at all.<p>In July 2005 the plans were thrown into uncertainty following refusal of planning permission for the visitors&#39; centre by Salisbury District Council whilst the British government placed the rising costs of the road scheme under review.<p><a id="Replicas_and_derivative_names" name="Replicas_and_derivative_names"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Replicas and derivative names</span></h2>

      <p>There is a full-size replica of Stonehenge as it would have been before decay at <!--del_lnk--> Maryhill in <!--del_lnk--> Washington state, built by <!--del_lnk--> Sam Hill as a war memorial. <!--del_lnk--> Stonehenge Aotearoa in the <!--del_lnk--> Wairarapa region of <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> is a modern adaptation aligned with the astronomy seen from the <!--del_lnk--> Antipodes; it was built by the <!--del_lnk--> Phoenix Astronomical Society from wood and sprayed concrete. The <!--del_lnk--> University of Missouri at <!--del_lnk--> Rolla has a half-scale replica located on campus, <!--del_lnk--> UMR Stonehenge. <!--del_lnk--> East Stroudsburg University, in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, has a small replica on its campus dubbed <!--del_lnk--> &quot;Stroudhenge&quot;.<p><!--del_lnk--> Carhenge was constructed from vintage American cars near <!--del_lnk--> Alliance, Nebraska by the artist Jim Reynolds in 1987. Another replica, called <!--del_lnk--> Stonehenge II, in <!--del_lnk--> Texas is constructed from an adobe-like material. Tankhenge existed in the border zone of <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin.htm" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> in the early 1990s after the collapse of the <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin_Wall.htm" title="Berlin Wall">Wall</a>. Tankhenge was constructed from three ex-Soviet armoured personnel carriers.<p>A full-size Stonehenge made out of <!--del_lnk--> foam &mdash; and inevitably called <!--del_lnk--> Foamhenge &mdash; stands near <!--del_lnk--> Natural Bridge, Virginia <!--del_lnk--> .<p>Another modern take on Stonehenge exists outside of Sante Fe, New Mexico, constructed out of junked refrigerators, known as &#39;Fridgehenge&#39;. The site was created by the artist Adam Jonas Horowitz. <!--del_lnk--> <p>Another full-size exact replica of what Stonehenge would have looked like 4000 years ago, also made of foam, was constructed and erected just 10 mi (16&nbsp;km) southwest of the actual Stonehenge. It was used for scientific and archaeological studies and was removed after.<p>The rock band <!--del_lnk--> Black Sabbath featured a Stonehenge stage set for the 1983-1984 Born Again tour that ended up being too large to fit in most venues. This was parodied in the movie <i><!--del_lnk--> This is Spinal Tap</i>, when the band orders a Stonehenge set but it arrives in miniature due to a confusion between feet and inches. There was also a Chicago based heavy metal band named Stonehenge that actually owned the trademark to the name. Stonehenge met with underground success in the 1990&#39;s - 2000&#39;s performing with acts such as Pantera, Iced Earth, Trouble and Manowar.<p>In the MMORPG Runescape, there is a Stonehenge look-alike sometimes refered to as &quot;Runehenge (rune being taken from the name of the game)<p>Aside from modern replicas, several other <!--del_lnk--> archaeological sites have had Stonehenge&#39;s name partially or fully incorporated into their own names. <!--del_lnk--> America&#39;s Stonehenge is an unusual and controversial site in <!--del_lnk--> New Hampshire. A henge near Stonehenge containing concentric rings of postholes for standing timbers, discovered in 1922, was named <!--del_lnk--> Woodhenge by its excavators because of similarities with Stonehenge.
