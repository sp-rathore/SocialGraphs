      <p>The island was discovered on <!--del_lnk--> 21 May <!--del_lnk--> 1502 by the <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> navigator <!--del_lnk--> Jo&atilde;o da Nova and named after <!--del_lnk--> Helena of Constantinople. The Portuguese found it uninhabited, and over time built a chapel and some houses, although no permanent settlement was founded. The Portuguese introduced <!--del_lnk--> goats as a source of meat for future ship crews.<p><!--del_lnk--> Thomas Cavendish became the first Englishman to visit the island, on his ill-fated expedition of <!--del_lnk--> 1591.<p>From about <!--del_lnk--> 1600 the island was well-known by captains from Portugal, England, France and Holland. The island was used for collecting food and as a rendez-vous point but at homebound voyages from Asia only. Sometimes ships waited near the island, when their captains were hoping to pirate hostile richly-loaded ships.<p>The Dutch claimed the island between <!--del_lnk--> 1645 and <!--del_lnk--> 1659, when it was settled by the <!--del_lnk--> English East India Company under a charter granted by <!--del_lnk--> Richard Cromwell.<p>The Dutch retook the Island in <!--del_lnk--> 1673, but were ejected by the English Navy after two months occupation, and the island was re-granted to the East India Company by <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_II_of_England.htm" title="Charles II of England">Charles II</a>. The English East India Company used the Island as a stop off on the long voyage to India via the <!--del_lnk--> Cape of Good Hope. A permanent settlement - of British colonists and black slaves - was founded at <!--del_lnk--> Jamestown, named after <a href="../../wp/j/James_II_of_England.htm" title="James II of England">James, Duke of York (later King James II)</a>.<p>In 1815 the British government selected Saint Helena as the place of detention of <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleon_I_of_France.htm" title="Napoleon I of France">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>. He was brought to the island in October of that year and lodged at The Briars, outside Jamestown. In December he was moved to <!--del_lnk--> Longwood where he died in May 1821. During this period the island was strongly garrisoned by regular troops, and the governor, Sir <!--del_lnk--> Hudson Lowe, was nominated by the Crown. The British also took control of <!--del_lnk--> Ascension Island and <!--del_lnk--> Tristan da Cunha at this time, to prevent any French attempts to free Napoleon from being launched from these nearby territories. After Napoleon&#39;s death the East India Company resumed full control of Saint Helena until April 22 1834, on which date it was, in virtue of an act passed in 1833, vested in the British Crown. Napoleon&#39;s body was returned to France in 1840.<p>During the <a href="../../wp/s/Second_Boer_War.htm" title="Second Boer War">Second Boer War</a> (1899-1902), the British military, fearing that <!--del_lnk--> Boer prisoners of war might be freed by sympathizers in <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, detained around 5,000 <!--del_lnk--> POWs on the island.<p>As a port of call on the long route to the <!--del_lnk--> Cape Colonies and <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, the Island enjoyed an increased prosperity, until the construction of the <a href="../../wp/s/Suez_Canal.htm" title="Suez Canal">Suez Canal</a> reduced the need for long voyages via the Cape of Good Hope. During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Ascension Island was leased to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, where a large airbase was constructed.<p>After World War II, the prosperity of the Island and its dependencies decreased. A visit by <!--del_lnk--> the Duke of Edinburgh to Ascension, Saint Helena and Tristan da Cunha for a time raised the profile of the islands. A volcanic eruption on Tristan da Cunha in <!--del_lnk--> 1961 forced the evacuation of the entire population to the UK, although they were able to return in <!--del_lnk--> 1963.<p>In more recent times, the British Government has announced plans to construct an airport on Saint Helena to bolster the Island&#39;s economy, and reduce the dependence on boats to supply the Island.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>Saint Helena has a total area of <!--del_lnk--> 410 km&sup2;, and consists of three island groups: Saint Helena itself, <!--del_lnk--> Ascension Island and <!--del_lnk--> Tristan da Cunha. Each Island group has its own distinct geography.<p>Saint Helena has a rugged, volcanic terrain. There are several rocks and islets off the coast, including: Castle Rock, Speery Island, The Needle, Lower Black Rock, Upper Black Rock (South), Bird Island (Southwest), Black Rock, Thompson&#39;s Valley Island, Peaked Island, Egg Island, Lady&#39;s Chair, Lighter Rock (West), Long Ledge (Northwest), Shore Island, George Island, Rough Rock Island, Flat Rock (East), The Buoys, Sandy Bay Island, The Chimney, White Bird Island and Frightus Rock (Southeast), all of which are within one kilometre of the shore. The centre of Saint Helena is covered by forest, of which some have been planted, including the new Millenium Forest Project. The temperature is also 2-3 degrees cooler in the highlands, and it has a few inches a year more rainfall than the rest of the island. It is more tropical in nature, and contains most of the island&#39;s endemic flora, fauna, insects and birds. The coastal areas are barren, covered in volcanic rock and are warmer and drier than the centre of the island.<p>When the island was discovered it was covered with unique (indigenous) vegetation, including the remarkable <!--del_lnk--> cabbage tree species of St Helena. The <!--del_lnk--> flora of St Helena contains a high proportion of <!--del_lnk--> endemic species, i.e. those found nowhere else. The island&#39;s interior must have been a dense subtropical forest but the coastal areas were probably quite green as well. The modern landscape is very different, with a lot of naked rock in the lower areas, and a high interior that is green - but mainly of <i>imported</i> vegetation. The dramatic change in landscape must be attributed to the introduction of goats and the introduction of new vegetation. As a result, the string tree (<i><!--del_lnk--> Acalypha rubrinervis</i>) and the St Helena olive (<i><!--del_lnk--> Nesiota elliptica</i>) are now extinct, and many of the other endemic plants are threatened with <a href="../../wp/e/Extinction.htm" title="Extinction">extinction</a>.<p>Ascension Island includes the main island and several uninhabited tiny satellite islands and rocks such as <!--del_lnk--> Boatswain Bird Island, Boatswain Bird Rock (East), White Rocks (South), and Tartar Rock. The main island has an area of approximately 35 square miles and is formed by volcanic peak rising from just west of the mid-Atlantic Ridge known as <!--del_lnk--> Green Mountain. Most of the island is a moonscape of rugged black lava flows and red windwhipped cinder cones. Where lava has penetrated to the ocean a striking seashore is dotted with white sand. The climate is subtropical, with temperatures at the coast ranging from about 68 to 88 degrees Fahrenheit (20 - 31 Celsius).<p>Tristan da Cunha includes the main Tristan da Cunha Island, the world&#39;s most remote inhabited island and several other uninhabited islands: Gough Island, Inaccessible Island, and the three Nightingale Islands. The islands are all mountainous and volcanic. <!--del_lnk--> Queen Mary&#39;s Peak on Tristan da Cunha at 2,060 m is the highest peak.<p>Saint Helena is one of the most isolated places in the world, located more than 2000km (nearly 1,000 miles) from the nearest major landmass. As there is currently has no airport on Saint Helena, travel to the island is by ship only. The <!--del_lnk--> RMS Saint Helena berths in James Bay approximately 30 times per year. The ship calls on such other ports as <!--del_lnk--> Capetown, <!--del_lnk--> Ascension Island, <!--del_lnk--> Tenerife, <!--del_lnk--> Vigo, and <!--del_lnk--> Walvis Bay. <!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Administrative_divisions" name="Administrative_divisions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Administrative divisions</span></h2>

      <p>Executive authority in Saint Helena is invested in <a href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Queen Elizabeth II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> and is exercised on her behalf by the <!--del_lnk--> Governor of Saint Helena. The Governor is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the <!--del_lnk--> British Government. Defence and Foreign Affairs remain the responsibility of the United Kingdom.<p>There are 15 seats in the Legislative Council, a <!--del_lnk--> unicameral legislature. 12 of the 15 members are elected in elections held every four years. The other three members are the Governor and two <i>ex officio</i> officers. The Executive Council consists of the Governor, two <i>ex officio</i> officers, and six elected members of the Legislative Council appointed by the Governor. There is no elected Chief Minister, and the Governor acts as the head of government. The current Governor is <!--del_lnk--> Michael Clancy (since October 2004).<p>Both Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha have an Administrator appointed to represent the Governor of Saint Helena.<p><a id="Transport" name="Transport"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transport</span></h2>
      <p>Saint Helena and its dependencies are among some of the most remote islands in the world. Although a large airfield is based in Ascension Island, with weekly flights to <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, Saint Helena and Tristan da Cunha can only be reached by boat. The <!--del_lnk--> RMS <i>Saint Helena</i> runs between the United Kingdom, Ascension, St Helena and <a href="../../wp/c/Cape_Town.htm" title="Cape Town">Cape Town</a>. It no longer calls at Tristan da Cunha.<p>The British Government announced plans to <!--del_lnk--> construct an airport in Saint Helena in March 2005. The airport is expected to be completed by <!--del_lnk--> 2010.<p>There is also a bus, really a van, that goes around the island and down to Jamestown to pick up people from the major neighborhoods, mostly Half Tree Hollow.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Helena&quot;</div>
