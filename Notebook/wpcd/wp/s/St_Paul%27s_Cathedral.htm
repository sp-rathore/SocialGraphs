       <li>The first, <!--del_lnk--> Saxon cathedral was built, in wood, and dedicated to <a href="../../wp/p/Paul_of_Tarsus.htm" title="Paul of Tarsus">Saint Paul</a>, probably by <!--del_lnk--> Mellitus or another of <!--del_lnk--> the Augustinian missionaries on the re-foundation (there had been a late-Roman see in the city) of the <!--del_lnk--> See of London in AD 604, on <!--del_lnk--> Ludgate Hill in the western part of the old Roman city (it was these missionaries&#39; habit, also done on the continent, to build cathedrals within old Roman city-walls) and the eastern part of <!--del_lnk--> Lundenwic. This building was traditionally said to be on the site of an ancient <!--del_lnk--> megalith, or stone circle. and a temple dedicated to the goddess <!--del_lnk--> Diana, in alignment with the <a href="../../wp/a/Apollo.htm" title="Apollo">Apollo Temple</a> which once stood at <!--del_lnk--> Westminster (although <a href="../../wp/c/Christopher_Wren.htm" title="Christopher Wren">Christopher Wren</a> found no evidence of this). <!--del_lnk--> Template:Kruger, 1943. This would have only been a modest chapel at first and may well have been destroyed after he was briefly expelled from the city by Saeberht&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> pagan successors. It burned down in <!--del_lnk--> 675.<li>The cathedral was rebuilt, in stone, in 685. In it was buried King or Saint <!--del_lnk--> Sebbi of Essex. It was sacked by the <a href="../../wp/v/Viking.htm" title="Viking">Vikings</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 961 as is cited by the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.<li>The third cathedral was begun in 962, again in stone. In it was buried <!--del_lnk--> Ethelred the Unready. It burnt, with the whole city, in a fire of <!--del_lnk--> 1087 (in Anglo-Saxon Chronicle).</ol>

      <p>The fourth St Paul&#39;s (known as <i>Old St Paul&#39;s</i>, a nineteenth century coinage, or <i>the pre-Great Fire St Paul&#39;s</i>), was begun by the <!--del_lnk--> Normans after the 1087 fire. Work took over two hundred years, and a great deal was lost in a fire in <!--del_lnk--> 1136. Nonetheless the roof was once more built of wood, which was ultimately to doom the building. The church was consecrated in <!--del_lnk--> 1240, but a change of heart soon led to the commencement of an enlargement programme in 1256. This &#39;New Work&#39; was completed in 1314. The cathedral was however consecrated in <!--del_lnk--> 1300. It was the third longest church in Europe. Excavations in 1878, by Francis Penrose showed it had been at 585 feet long, 100 feet wide (290 feet across the <!--del_lnk--> transepts and <!--del_lnk--> crossing), and had one of Europe&#39;s tallest spires at some 489 feet (149 metres).<p>By the <a href="../../wp/1/16th_century.htm" title="16th century">16th century</a> the building was decaying. Under <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_VIII_of_England.htm" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_VI_of_England.htm" title="Edward VI of England">Edward VI</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Dissolution of the Monasteries and <!--del_lnk--> Chantries Acts led to the destruction of interior ornamentation in the cathedral as well as the <!--del_lnk--> cloisters, <!--del_lnk--> charnels, <!--del_lnk--> crypts, <!--del_lnk--> chapels, <!--del_lnk--> shrines, <!--del_lnk--> chantries and various other buildings in the churchyard. Many of these former religious sites in St Paul&#39;s Churchyard, having been seized by the crown, were sold as shops and rental properties, especially to printers and booksellers who were often <!--del_lnk--> evangelical <!--del_lnk--> Protestants. Buildings that were razed often supplied ready-dressed building material for new construction projects, such as the Lord Protector&#39;s city palace, <!--del_lnk--> Somerset House.<p>Crowds were drawn to the northeast corner of the Churchyard, <!--del_lnk--> St Paul&#39;s Cross, where open air preaching took place. It was there in the Cross Yard in <!--del_lnk--> 1549 that radical Protestant preachers incited a mob to destroy many of the cathedral&#39;s interior decorations. In <!--del_lnk--> 1561 the spire was destroyed by lightning and it was not replaced; this event was taken by Protestants and Catholics alike as a sign of God&#39;s displeasure of the other faction&#39;s actions.<p>England&#39;s first <!--del_lnk--> classical architect Sir <!--del_lnk--> Inigo Jones added the cathedral&#39;s new west front in the <!--del_lnk--> 1630s, but there was much defacement and mistreatment of the building by Parliamentarian forces during the <!--del_lnk--> English Civil War, when the old documents and charters were dispersed and destroyed (Kelly 2004). &quot;Old St Paul&#39;s&quot; was finally gutted in the <!--del_lnk--> Great Fire of London of <!--del_lnk--> 1666. While it might have been salvageable, albeit with almost complete reconstruction, a decision was taken to build a new cathedral in a modern style instead. Indeed this had been contemplated even before the fire.<p><a id="Wren.27s_St_Paul.27s" name="Wren.27s_St_Paul.27s"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Wren&#39;s St Paul&#39;s</span></h2>

      <p>The task of designing a replacement structure was assigned to <a href="../../wp/c/Christopher_Wren.htm" title="Christopher Wren">Christopher Wren</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1668, along with over fifty other City churches. His first design (to build a replacement on the foundations of the old cathedral) was rejected in <!--del_lnk--> 1669. The second design, in the shape of a <!--del_lnk--> Greek cross (circa <!--del_lnk--> 1670-<!--del_lnk--> 1672) was rejected as too radical, as was a revised design which resulted in the 1:24 scale &quot;Great Model&quot;, currently on display in the crypt of the cathedral. The &#39;warrant&#39; design was accepted in <!--del_lnk--> 1675 and building work began in June. This design included a smaller dome with a spire on top, however <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_II_of_England.htm" title="Charles II of England">King Charles II</a> had given Wren permission to make &quot;ornamental&quot; changes to the approved design, and Wren took the liberty to radically rework the design to the current form, including the large central dome and the towers at the West end. The cathedral was completed on <!--del_lnk--> October 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1708, Wren&#39;s 76th birthday (although the first service was held on <!--del_lnk--> December 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1697).<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The cathedral is built of <!--del_lnk--> Portland stone in a late <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> style that is England&#39;s sober <a href="../../wp/b/Baroque.htm" title="Baroque">Baroque</a>. Its impressive dome was inspired by <!--del_lnk--> St Peter&#39;s Basilica in <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a>. It rises 108 metres (365 feet) to the cross at its summit, making it a famous London landmark. Wren achieved a pleasing appearance by actually building three domes: the tall outer dome is non-structural but impressive to view, the lower inner dome provides an artistically balanced interior, and between the two is a structural cone which supports the apex structure and the outer dome panelling. During the building of its later stages, Wren was said to have been hauled up to the rafters in a basket to inspect the progress of the work.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> cathedral is to the east from the Great West Door. The <!--del_lnk--> nave has three small chapels in the two adjoining <!--del_lnk--> aisles &ndash; <i>All Souls</i> and <i>St Dunstan&#39;s</i> in the north aisle and the <i>Chapel of the <!--del_lnk--> Order of St Michael and St George</i> in the south aisle. The main space of the cathedral is centred under the Dome; it rises 108.4 metres from the cathedral floor and holds three circular galleries &ndash; the internal <i>Whispering Gallery</i>, the external <i>Stone Gallery</i>, and the external <i>Golden Gallery</i>.<p>The <i><!--del_lnk--> Whispering Gallery</i> runs around the interior of the Dome and is 259 steps up from ground-level. It gets its name from a serendipitious quirk of dome construction: a whisper against its wall at any point is audible to a listener with their ear held to the point diametrically opposite.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Quire extends to the east of the dome and holds the stalls for the <!--del_lnk--> clergy and the choir as well as the cathedral&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> organ. The organ was first commissioned in <!--del_lnk--> 1694 and the current instrument is the third biggest in Britain with 7,189 pipes and 138 stops; it is enclosed in an impressive case built by <!--del_lnk--> Grinling Gibbons. To the north and south of the dome are the transepts of the North Choir and the South Choir.<p>The north west tower contains 13 bells, while the south west tower contains 4 bells including Great Paul, which was cast in 1881, and Great Tom (the hour bell), which has been recast twice, after being moved from the old <a href="../../wp/p/Palace_of_Westminster.htm" title="Palace of Westminster">Palace of Westminster</a>.<p><a id="Post-Wren_history" name="Post-Wren_history"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Post-Wren history</span></h3>
      <p>This cathedral has survived until the present day, despite being targeted during <a href="../../wp/t/The_Blitz.htm" title="The Blitz">the Blitz</a> (it was struck by bombs on <!--del_lnk--> October 10, <!--del_lnk--> 1940 and <!--del_lnk--> April 17, <!--del_lnk--> 1941 but survived) On <!--del_lnk--> September 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1940 a time delayed bomb which had struck the Cathedral was successfully defused and removed by a <!--del_lnk--> Bomb Disposal detachment of <!--del_lnk--> Royal Engineers under the command of Temporary Lieutenant Robert Davies. Had this bomb detonated it would have totally destroyed the Cathedral, as it left a 100 foot crater when it was later remotely detonated in a secure location. As a result of this action Robert Davies was awarded the <!--del_lnk--> George Cross (<!--del_lnk--> Gazetted <!--del_lnk--> September 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1940).

      <p>The cathedral has a very substantial crypt holding over 200 memorials as well as the <!--del_lnk--> Order of the British Empire Chapel and the Treasury (the cathedral has very few treasures: Many have been lost, and in <!--del_lnk--> 1810 a major robbery took almost all of the remaining precious artefacts). <a href="../../wp/c/Christopher_Wren.htm" title="Christopher Wren">Christopher Wren</a> was the first person to be interred (in <!--del_lnk--> 1723): on the wall above his tomb in the crypt is simply written, &quot;Lector, si monumentum requiris, circumspice&quot; (<i>Reader, if you seek a monument, look around you</i>).<p>St Paul&#39;s is home to other plaques, carvings, statues, <!--del_lnk--> memorials and tombs of famous <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> figures including:<ul>
       <li><a href="../../wp/i/Isaac_Brock.htm" title="Isaac Brock">General Sir Isaac Brock</a><li><!--del_lnk--> Sir Edwin Lutyens<li><!--del_lnk--> John Donne, whose funeral effigy (portraying him in a shroud), but not tomb, survives from Old St Paul&#39;s.<li><!--del_lnk--> Lord Kitchener<li><!--del_lnk--> The Duke of Wellington<li><a href="../../wp/h/Horatio_Nelson%252C_1st_Viscount_Nelson.htm" title="Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson">Admiral Nelson</a><li><a href="../../wp/h/Henry_Moore.htm" title="Henry Moore">Henry Moore</a><li><a href="../../wp/w/Winston_Churchill.htm" title="Winston Churchill">Sir Winston Churchill</a><li><!--del_lnk--> T.E.

      <p>Most of the memorials commemorate the British military, including several lists of servicemen who died in action, the most recent being the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf War. There are special monuments to <a href="../../wp/h/Horatio_Nelson%252C_1st_Viscount_Nelson.htm" title="Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson">Admiral Nelson</a> in the south transept and to the <a href="../../wp/a/Arthur_Wellesley%252C_1st_Duke_of_Wellington.htm" title="Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington">Duke of Wellington</a> in the north aisle; both are buried here. Also remembered are poets, painters, clergy and residents of the local parish. There are also lists of the <!--del_lnk--> Bishops and cathedral Deans for the last thousand years.<p>The cathedral has been the site for many famous funerals, including those of Nelson, Wellington and <a href="../../wp/w/Winston_Churchill.htm" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>.<p><a id="Modern-day" name="Modern-day"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Modern-day</span></h4>

      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 2001, Britain&#39;s memorial service to honour the victims of the <a href="../../wp/s/September_11%252C_2001_attacks.htm" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a> was held at St Paul&#39;s Cathedral, which the British Royal Family and then-U.S. ambassador William Farish attended. He spoke, as did <!--del_lnk--> Prince Philip. Farish said just before he resigned as ambassador in <!--del_lnk--> 2004 in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Times</i> that this service showed the strong relationship between the US and Britain. It also held, on November 1st 2005, a memorial service for <!--del_lnk--> the July 7th bombings.<p>The cathedral is open to the public, though there is a charge for non-worshipping visitors. In <!--del_lnk--> 2000, the cathedral began a major <!--del_lnk--> restoration programme, scheduled for completion in <!--del_lnk--> 2008, to celebrate the 300th anniversary of its opening. A ceremony to celebrate the anniversary was directed by <!--del_lnk--> Patrick Garland. The restoration programme is expected to cost &pound;40 million, and involves not only repair and cleaning of the building, but also improvement of visitor facilities - such as accessibility for the disabled, and provision of additional educational facilities.<p><a id="In_popular_culture" name="In_popular_culture"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">In popular culture</span></h4>
