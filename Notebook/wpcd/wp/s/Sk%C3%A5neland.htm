      <p><b>Sk&aring;neland</b> or <i>Scania</i> is a denomination for the historical region in southern and southwestern <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, once making up the eastern part of <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>. It was permanently ceded to <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> under the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Roskilde (<!--del_lnk--> 1658). Another name for it is <i>Sk&aring;nelandskapen</i>, which translates to <i>the Provinces of Sk&aring;ne</i>; sometimes the Latin names <i>terra Scania</i> or <i>terra Scani&aelig;</i> are used.<p>Sk&aring;neland consists of the provinces <!--del_lnk--> Sk&aring;ne, <!--del_lnk--> Halland, and <!--del_lnk--> Blekinge. Sometimes, the term only refers to Sk&aring;ne. The area is almost coterminous with <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Denmark, except that the islands of <!--del_lnk--> Bornholm and <!--del_lnk--> Anholt have remained Danish. Sk&aring;neland borders the provinces of <!--del_lnk--> V&auml;sterg&ouml;tland and <!--del_lnk--> Sm&aring;land. In some rare contexts, this region has been referred to as &quot;Southern <!--del_lnk--> G&ouml;taland&quot;. The region is accepted by the <!--del_lnk--> Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation under the name of <i>Scania</i>, although this is also the Latin and English name for Sk&aring;ne proper.<p>

      <p>Sk&aring;neland is the Swedish equivalent to the Danish term <i>Sk&aring;nelandene</i>, a term used in official contexts in Denmark. In Sweden, the term is seldom used in official context. Because some <!--del_lnk--> regionalists advocate independence for Scania proper, or a Swedish <!--del_lnk--> republic where regions like Sk&aring;neland have more autonomy, the term is unpopular with many Swedes. Such <!--del_lnk--> separatist movements often have a basis in <a href="../../wp/n/Nationalism.htm" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a>; frequently a sense of political under-representation and a perception of economic disadvantage play important roles. The relatively long amalgamation of <i>Sk&aring;neland</i> with Sweden would suggest that the area is generally &quot;Swedified&quot; and that separatism represents a minority viewpoint.<p>When defining the region in a more general context, the names of the individual provinces are used, or Sk&aring;neland is simply considered as being a late addition to the historic <!--del_lnk--> G&ouml;taland. As such, some contexts have used the term &quot;Southern G&ouml;taland&quot; (S&ouml;dra G&ouml;taland).<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The Swedish term &quot;Sk&aring;neland&quot; was introduced by the Swedish historian and <!--del_lnk--> Scandinavist <!--del_lnk--> Martin Weibull in his political appeal <i>Samlingar till Sk&aring;nes historia</i> in 1868 to illuminate the common pre-Swedish history of Sk&aring;ne, Blekinge, and Halland. The term was basically a translation from the medieval <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>terra Scani&aelig;</i> (&quot;land of Sk&aring;ne&quot;). Weibull used the term as a combined term for the three provinces where <!--del_lnk--> Sk&aring;nelagen (&quot;The Scanian law&quot;, the oldest provincial law of the <!--del_lnk--> Nordic countries) had its jurisdiction, as well as the area of the <!--del_lnk--> archdiocese of <!--del_lnk--> Lund until the <!--del_lnk--> Reformation in <!--del_lnk--> 1536, later the Danish <!--del_lnk--> Lutheran <!--del_lnk--> diocese of Lund. This form of Sk&aring;neland was then used in the regional historical periodical <i>Historisk tidskrift f&ouml;r Sk&aring;neland</i>, beginning in 1901, published by Martin&#39;s son, <!--del_lnk--> Lauritz Weibull.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Early_history" name="Early_history"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early history</span></h3>
      <p>The <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> name <i>terra Scani&aelig;</i> was used in the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> as a denomination for the easternmost parts of Denmark. At that time, dense forests and <a href="../../wp/b/Bog.htm" title="Bog">boggy</a> ground blocked the southern provinces of Sweden from Sk&aring;neland, in comparison to the relative ease of travel by sea. It was therefore natural to draw the national borders on land. This is documented by <!--del_lnk--> Adam of Bremen in the 11th century when he visited <!--del_lnk--> Scania and Scandinavia and called it the richest and most important part of Denmark. Even in later periods as the roads gradually improved, some parts were still difficult to travel through, even through the 19th century. From 1104 the Danish archbishop had his residence in Lund; and it was also here the first Danish university was founded, the Lund Academy (1425-1536).<p>The earliest Danish historians, writing in the 12th and 13th century, believed that the Danish Kingdom had existed since king <!--del_lnk--> Dan, in a distant past. Eighth century sources mention the existence of Denmark as a kingdom. According to ninth century Frankish sources, by the early 9th century many of the chieftains in the south of Scandinavia acknowledged Danish kings as their overlords, though kingdom(s) were very loose confederations of lords until the last couple medieval centuries saw some increased centralization. The west and south coast of modern Sweden was so effectively under Danish control that the said area (and not the today Denmark) was known as &quot;Denmark&quot; (literally the frontier of the <!--del_lnk--> Daner).<p>In the loose conditions of medieval kingdom-building, some historians have argued that in 10th and 11th centuries, Scania was more or sometimes attached to the Swedish kingdom instead of the Danish, and that <!--del_lnk--> Svend Estridsen and his dynasty were the ones to establish Scania as an integral, and sometimes the more important, part of Denmark - king Svend seems to have been from Scania himself.<p>In 1330s-1360s, Scania was held, even as the &quot;third kingdom&quot;, by <!--del_lnk--> Magnus VII of Norway and Sweden, as result of temporary dossolution of Danish central government. He was, since 1335, titled &quot;rex Suecie, Norwegie et Scanie&quot; or &quot;regnorum svechie et norwegie terreque scanie rex&quot;.<p><a id="From_the_Kalmar_Union_to_Denmark.27s_Loss_of_Sk.C3.A5ne.2C_Blekinge_and_Halland" name="From_the_Kalmar_Union_to_Denmark.27s_Loss_of_Sk.C3.A5ne.2C_Blekinge_and_Halland"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">From the Kalmar Union to Denmark&#39;s Loss of Sk&aring;ne, Blekinge and Halland</span></h3>

      <p>By the end of the fourteenth century, the Finnish coast was under Swedish control, but Denmark was the most powerful of Scandinavian states. As a result, when the <!--del_lnk--> Kalmar Union was formed in 1397, the union was administered from Copenhagen. By 1471 Sweden had tired of Danish domination and rebelled under <!--del_lnk--> Sture family leadership. In 1503, when <!--del_lnk--> Sten Sture the Elder died, eastern Sweden&rsquo;s independence from Denmark had been established. <p>In 1600 Denmark controlled virtually all land bordering on the <!--del_lnk--> Skagerrak, <!--del_lnk--> Kattegat, and the restricted Sound (<!--del_lnk--> &Oslash;resund). The current Swedish provinces of <!--del_lnk--> Sk&aring;ne, <!--del_lnk--> Blekinge and <!--del_lnk--> Halland were still Danish and the province of <!--del_lnk--> B&aring;huslen was still Norwegian. Sk&aring;neland became the site of bitter battles, especially in the 16th and 17th century, as Denmark and Sweden confronted each other for control of the Baltic and of Swedish access to western trade. Danish historians often represent this as a period of unending Swedish aggression during which Sweden was continuously at war, while Swedish historians often represent this as &quot;Sweden&#39;s Age of Greatness&quot;.    <p>Sweden interevend in the Danish civil war known as the <!--del_lnk--> Count&#39;s Feud (1534-1536), launching a highly destructive invasion of Sk&aring;neland as the ally of King <!--del_lnk--> Christian III. Subsequently, in the period between the breakup of the Kalmar Union and 1814, Denmark and Sweden fought 11 times in Sk&aring;neland and other border provinces: 1563-70, 1611-1613, 1644-1645, 1657-1658; 1659-1661, 1674-1678, 1700, 1710-1721, 1788, 1808-1809, and 1814. <ul>
       <li>During the Northern Seven Years&#39; War, attacks were launched on Sweden from Danish <!--del_lnk--> Halland in <!--del_lnk--> 1563, and Swedish counterattacks were launched against Danish provinces of <!--del_lnk--> Halland and <!--del_lnk--> Sk&aring;ne in <!--del_lnk--> 1565 and <!--del_lnk--> 1569. In 1570 peace was finally agreed when the Swedish king withdrew the claims to Danish Sk&aring;ne, Halland, Blekinge and <!--del_lnk--> Gotland, while the Danes withdrew their claims to Sweden as a whole.   <li>During the Thirty Years&#39; War extensive combat took place in the Danish provinces of Sk&aring;ne, Halland, and Blekinge. By the <!--del_lnk--> Peace of Br&ouml;msebro (<!--del_lnk--> 1645) Denmark ceded the Norwegian provinces of <!--del_lnk--> J&auml;mtland and <!--del_lnk--> H&auml;rjedalen and agreed Sweden was to occupy the Danish province of <!--del_lnk--> Halland for 30 years as a guarantee of the treaty provisions.  <li>During what has been described as the Northern War (<!--del_lnk--> 1655&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 1658), Danish attempts to recover control of <!--del_lnk--> Halland ended in a serious defeat administered by Sweden. As a result, in the Treaty of Roskilde (<!--del_lnk--> 1658) Denmark ceded the provinces of Sk&aring;ne, Blekinge and Halland (i.e., Sk&aring;neland). </ul>
      <p>Vilhelm Moberg, in his history of the Swedish people, provides a thoughtful discussion of the atrocities which were committed by both sides in the struggle over the border provinces, and identified them as the source of propaganda to inflame the peoples&rsquo; passions to continue the struggle. These lopsided representations were incorporated into history text books on the respective sides. As an example, <!--del_lnk--> Moberg compares the history texts he grew up with in Sweden which represented the Swedish soldier as ever pure and honorable to a letter written by <!--del_lnk--> Gustavus Adolphus celebrating the 24 Sk&aring;nian parishes he&rsquo;d helped level by fire, with the troops encouraged to rape and murder the population at will. One must infer that this Swedish behaviour was mirrored equally on the Danish side. Sk&aring;neland was a rather unpleasant place to dwell for an extended period.<p><a id="Assimilation_with_Sweden" name="Assimilation_with_Sweden"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Assimilation with Sweden</span></h3>
      <p>Following on the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Roskilde in 1658 - but in direct contradiction of its terms - the Swedish government forcefully demanded Sk&aring;neland adopt Swedish customs and laws. Swedish became the only permitted language in the Church liturgy and in schools, books in Danish were not allowed to be printed, and all appointed politicians and priests were required to be Swedish. To promote further Swedish assimilation the <!--del_lnk--> University of Lund was inaugurated in 1666, and the inhabitants of Scania were not allowed to enroll in <!--del_lnk--> Copenhagen University until the 19th century.<p>The population was initially opposed to the Swedish reforms, as can be ascertained from church records and court transcripts. The Swedes did encounter severe civil revolts in some areas, perhaps most notably in the <!--del_lnk--> G&ouml;inge district, in dense forest regions, and in northern Scania. Against 17th Century rebels known as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> snapphanar&quot;, the Swedish authorities resorted to the use of <!--del_lnk--> impalement, where the stake was inserted between the spine and the skin of the victim. In that way, it could take four to five days before the victim died.<p>The last civil revolts in Sk&aring;neland were peasant revolts early in the 19th century, but during that period the region was so integrated that, at the end of the century, Sk&aring;neland was declared to have been &quot;fully incorporated with Swedish habits, customs and history&quot;. <p>The transformation of age-old customs, commerce and administration to the Swedish model could not be effected quickly or easily. In the first fifty years of the transition, the treatment of the population was rather ruthless, but thereafter it softened. Denmark, on the other hand, made several attempts to recapture the territories -- the last attempt in 1710, during which they almost recaptured the entire Sk&aring;neland until they were beaten back by Swedish armies and forced to withdraw. <p><a id="Recent_history" name="Recent_history"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Recent history</span></h3>

      <p>The complete history of Sk&aring;neland was not taught for a long time in schools in Sk&aring;neland, especially during periods with the immediate threat of revolt. Instead a Swedish-centric history was taught, and the Scanian history before 1658, for instance concerning the list of monarchs, was disregarded as a component of Danish history. In reaction, a movement began in the late 19th century to revive awareness of the history and culture of Sk&aring;neland. The renewed focus resulted in the publication of several books about Scanian history. <p>It is still disputed whether children of the Scanian Provinces should learn the local Danish-era history or the Swedish history for the period before 1658.<p><a id="Administration" name="Administration"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Administration</span></h2>
      <p>Before 1658, Sk&aring;neland had consisted of four counties: the counties of Malm&ouml;hus, Landskrona, Helsingborg and Kristianstad.<p>When the area was annexed by Sweden, Blekinge County was merged with Kristianstad County, to form at total of three counties of the area. In addition, Sweden also appointed a <!--del_lnk--> Governor General, who in addition of having the highest authority of the government, also was the highest military officer. The first to hold the post of Governor General was <!--del_lnk--> Gustaf Otto Stenbock, between <!--del_lnk--> 1658 to <!--del_lnk--> 1664. His residence was in the largest city, <!--del_lnk--> Malm&ouml;.<p>The office of Governor General was abandoned in 1669, deemed unnecessary. However, when the <!--del_lnk--> Scanian War erupted in 1675, the office was reinstated, and <!--del_lnk--> Fabian von Fersen held the office between <!--del_lnk--> 1675 to <!--del_lnk--> 1677, when he died in the defence of <!--del_lnk--> Malm&ouml;.<p>Replacing him was <!--del_lnk--> Rutger von Ascheberg, in <!--del_lnk--> 1680. He came to hold it to his death in <!--del_lnk--> 1693. It was during Ascheberg&#39;s time in office that the stricter policy of Swedenfication was initiated, as a reaction to the threats of war and possible Danish repossession.<p>Following the death of Ascheberg, the Governor General was dismantled into separate generals, governing the separate provinces Sk&aring;ne, Blekinge and Halland.<p>Sources: Terra Scania website <p><a id="Modern_usage" name="Modern_usage"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Modern usage</span></h2>
      <p>The term <i>Sk&aring;neland</i> (Scania) is today mostly used to denote the area accepted as an unrepresented nation and in order to differentiate it from the historical, pre-1658 Sk&aring;ne proper (Scania), the now Swedish province <!--del_lnk--> Sk&aring;ne (Scania) and from the administrative county <!--del_lnk--> Sk&aring;ne (Scania), a county recently established after having been split into Malm&ouml;hus County and Kristianstad County between 1719 and 1997. <i>Sk&aring;neland</i> is based on the Danish term <i>Sk&aring;nelandene</i>, a term of historical significance as a common name for Bornholm and the formerly Danish, now Swedish, provinces of Sk&aring;ne, Blekinge and Halland. It is a term which translates to &quot;Terra Scaniae&quot; in Latin, the term preferred in medieval times. Both terms were in use after the area became Swedish, as noted by the Swedish Academy, which <!--del_lnk--> lists examples of the usage of Sk&aring;neland in documents from 1719, from 1759 (by <!--del_lnk--> Carl von Linn&eacute;), from 1901 and from 1937. In some examples of Swedish usage, Bornholm is not included. The collective term for the provinces is presently not in general use among Swedish historians or in government administration.
