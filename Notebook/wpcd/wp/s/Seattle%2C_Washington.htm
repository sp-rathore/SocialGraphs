      <p><b>Seattle</b> is the largest <a href="../../wp/c/City.htm" title="City">city</a> in the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Northwest region of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. It is located in the <a href="../../wp/u/U.S._state.htm" title="U.S. state">U.S. state</a> of <!--del_lnk--> Washington between <!--del_lnk--> Puget Sound and <!--del_lnk--> Lake Washington, nearly 108 miles (174 km) south of the <!--del_lnk--> United States&ndash;Canadian border in <!--del_lnk--> King County, of which it is the <!--del_lnk--> county seat.<p>Seattle was first settled <!--del_lnk--> November 13, 1851, by <!--del_lnk--> Arthur A. Denny and his crew, which would subsequently become known as the Denny party. Its first name was New York, then Duwamps, then finally it was renamed Seattle named after <!--del_lnk--> Chief Noah Sealth who was chief of the two tribes living in the area (&quot;Seattle&quot; is an anglicized rendition of his last name). <!--del_lnk--> As of 2005, the city had an estimated population of 573,911 and a <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan population of 3.8 million. Seattle is the hub for the <!--del_lnk--> Greater Puget Sound region. Its official <!--del_lnk--> nickname is the <i><!--del_lnk--> Emerald City</i>, the result of a contest by a civic-minded association in the early 1980s to designate a pleasant nickname for the city; the name alludes to the lush evergreen trees in the surrounding area. It is also referred to informally as the <i>Rainy City</i> (also <i>Rain City</i>), the <i>Gateway to <!--del_lnk--> Alaska</i>, <i>Queen City</i>, and <i>Jet City</i>, due to the local influence of <!--del_lnk--> Boeing. Seattle residents are known as <i><!--del_lnk--> Seattleites</i>.<p>Seattle is often regarded as the birthplace of <!--del_lnk--> grunge music, and has a reputation for heavy <a href="../../wp/c/Coffee.htm" title="Coffee">coffee</a> consumption; coffee companies founded in Seattle include <!--del_lnk--> Starbucks, <!--del_lnk--> Seattle&#39;s Best Coffee, and <!--del_lnk--> Tully&#39;s. There are also many successful independent artisanal espresso roasters and cafes. Seattle was the site of the <!--del_lnk--> 1999 meeting of the <a href="../../wp/w/World_Trade_Organization.htm" title="World Trade Organization">World Trade Organization</a>, and the <!--del_lnk--> attendant demonstrations by <!--del_lnk--> anti-globalization activists, which were in keeping with Seattle&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> left-leaning history and reputation. Researchers at <!--del_lnk--> Central Connecticut State University ranked Seattle the most literate city in America in 2005. Moreover, a <!--del_lnk--> United States Census Bureau survey showed that Seattle has the highest percentage of college graduates of any major U.S. city. Based on <!--del_lnk--> per capita income, Seattle ranks 36th of 522 studied areas in the state of Washington.<p>

      <p>What is now Seattle has been inhabited since the end of the last <!--del_lnk--> glacial period (c. 8,000 B.C.E.&mdash;10,000 years ago). <!--del_lnk--> Archaeological excavations at <!--del_lnk--> West Point in <!--del_lnk--> Discovery Park, <!--del_lnk--> Magnolia confirm that the Seattle area has been inhabited by humans for at least 4,000 years and probably much longer. <i>tohl-AHL-too</i> (&quot;<!--del_lnk--> herring house&quot;) and later <i>hah-AH-poos</i> (&quot;where there are horse clams&quot;) at the then-mouth of the <!--del_lnk--> Duwamish River in what is now the <!--del_lnk--> Industrial District had been inhabited since the 6th entury C.E. The <i>Dkhw&#39;Duw&#39;Absh</i> and <i>Xachua&#39;Bsh</i> people (now called the <!--del_lnk--> Duwamish Tribe) occupied at least 17 villages in the mid-1850s, living in some 93 permanent <!--del_lnk--> longhouses (<i>khwaac&#39;&aacute;l&#39;al</i>) along <!--del_lnk--> Elliott Bay, <!--del_lnk--> Salmon Bay, <!--del_lnk--> Portage Bay, <!--del_lnk--> Lake Washington, <!--del_lnk--> Lake Sammamish, and the lower <!--del_lnk--> Duwamish, <!--del_lnk--> Black, and <!--del_lnk--> Cedar Rivers.<p>Most of the <!--del_lnk--> Denny Party, the most prominent of the area&#39;s early <!--del_lnk--> Caucasian settlers (and historians), arrived at <!--del_lnk--> Alki Point on <!--del_lnk--> November 13 1851. They called the spot &quot;New York&quot; at first to reflect their aspirations to create a great trading port, later appending <i>Alki</i>, a <!--del_lnk--> Chinook Jargon word meaning, roughly, <i>by and by</i> or <i>someday</i>, literally or ironically. They relocated their settlement to <!--del_lnk--> Elliott Bay in April 1852. The first <!--del_lnk--> plats for the Town of Seattle were filed on <!--del_lnk--> May 23 1853. Nominal legal land settlement was established in 1855. The city was incorporated in 1865 and again in 1869, after having existed as an unincorporated town from 1867 to 1869.<p>Seattle was named after <!--del_lnk--> Chief Sealth, (<i>si&#39;&aacute;b Si&#39;ahl</i>, Noah Sealth), high-status man (appointed chief by the territorial governor) of the <!--del_lnk--> Duwamish and <!--del_lnk--> Suquamish tribes. <!--del_lnk--> David Swinson (&quot;Doc&quot;) Maynard, one of the city founders, was the primary advocate for naming the city after Chief Seattle. The name &quot;Duwamish&quot; is an Anglicization of <i>D<u>kh</u><sup>w</sup>&#39;Duw&#39;Absh</i>, &quot;the People of the Inside&quot;, and a variation of that name is preserved in the name of the <!--del_lnk--> Duwamish River. Previously, the city had been known as Duwamps (or Duwumps), an earlier name settlers used for the river.<p><a id="Major_events" name="Major_events"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Major events</span></h3>

      <p>Major events in Seattle&#39;s history include the <!--del_lnk--> Great Seattle Fire of 1889, which destroyed the central business district (but took no lives); the <!--del_lnk--> Klondike gold rush, which made Seattle a major transportation centre; the <!--del_lnk--> Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition of 1909, which is largely responsible for the current layout of the <!--del_lnk--> University of Washington campus; the <!--del_lnk--> Seattle General Strike of 1919, the first <!--del_lnk--> general strike in the country; the 1962 <!--del_lnk--> Century 21 Exposition, a <!--del_lnk--> World&#39;s Fair; the 1990 <!--del_lnk--> Goodwill Games; and the <!--del_lnk--> WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999, marked by <!--del_lnk--> street protests and a series of riots.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> February 28 2001, a <!--del_lnk--> state of emergency was declared after the <!--del_lnk--> magnitude 6.8 <!--del_lnk--> Nisqually earthquake rocked the region. Damage was moderate, but served as a reminder that the coastal Pacific Northwest &mdash; and the area around the <!--del_lnk--> Seattle Fault, in particular &mdash; is under a constant threat of earthquakes.<p>Seattle suffered its worst mass-killing since the 1983 <!--del_lnk--> Wah Mee massacre when a 28-year-old man named Kyle Aaron Huff committed the <!--del_lnk--> Capitol Hill massacre on <!--del_lnk--> March 25 2006, followed by <!--del_lnk--> an attempted spree killing by Naveed Afzal Haq that left one dead at the <!--del_lnk--> Jewish Federation building in July. Seattle is relatively safe for a city its size. Its murder rate peaked in 1994 with 69 homicides. In 2004, Seattle&#39;s murder rate hit a 40-year low with 24 homicides. Seattle&#39;s crime rate has seen an increase in 2006, as have the crime rates in <!--del_lnk--> Tacoma and <!--del_lnk--> Lakewood, Washington.<p><a id="Economic_history" name="Economic_history"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Economic history</span></h3>
      <p>Seattle has a history of <!--del_lnk--> boom and bust cycles historically common in cities of its size. Seattle has been sent into precipitous decline by the aftermaths of its worst periods as a <!--del_lnk--> company town, but has typically used those periods to successfully rebuild infrastructure.<div class="thumb tleft">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>The first such boom, covering the early years of the city, was fueled by the <!--del_lnk--> lumber industry. (It was during this period that the road now known as Yesler Way was nicknamed &quot;Skid Road&quot; after the timber skidding down the street to <!--del_lnk--> Henry Yesler&#39;s sawmill. The term later entered the wider American vocabulary as <i><!--del_lnk--> Skid Row</i>.) This boom was followed by the construction of an <!--del_lnk--> Olmsted-designed park system.<p>The second and largest boom was the direct result of the <!--del_lnk--> Klondike Gold Rush of 1896, which ended the national depression that had begun with the <!--del_lnk--> Panic of 1893. On <!--del_lnk--> July 14 1897, the <i>S.S. Portland</i> docked with its famed &quot;ton of gold&quot;, and Seattle became the main transport and supply point for those heading north. It was during this economic boom that Seattle surpassed nearby Tacoma as the largest city on the Puget Sound. The boom lasted well into the early part of the 20th century and funded the start-up of many new companies and products. In 1907, 19-year-old <!--del_lnk--> James E. Casey founded the <!--del_lnk--> American Messenger Company in Seattle with $100 borrowed from a friend which later became <!--del_lnk--> UPS. Like UPS, other companies such as <!--del_lnk--> Nordstrom and <!--del_lnk--> Eddie Bauer, exist to this day.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Next came the <!--del_lnk--> shipbuilding boom in the early part of the 20th century, followed by the unused city development plan of <!--del_lnk--> Virgil Bogue. Seattle was the major point of departure during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> for troops heading to the north Pacific, and <!--del_lnk--> Boeing manufactured many of the fighters and bombers.<p>After the war, the local economy dipped but rose again with the expansion of Boeing, fueled by the growth of the commercial aviation industry. When this particular cycle went into a major downturn in the late 1960s and early 1970s, many left the area to look for work elsewhere, and two local <!--del_lnk--> real estate agents put up a <!--del_lnk--> billboard reading &quot;Will the last person leaving Seattle &mdash; Turn out the lights.&quot;<p>Seattle remained the corporate headquarters of Boeing until 2001, when the company announced a desire to separate its headquarters from its major production facilities. Following a bidding war among a number of major cities, Boeing moved its corporate headquarters to <a href="../../wp/c/Chicago.htm" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>. The Seattle area is still home to Boeing&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Renton narrow-body plant (where the <!--del_lnk--> 707, 720, <!--del_lnk--> 727, and <!--del_lnk--> 757 were assembled, and the <!--del_lnk--> 737 is assembled today), and <!--del_lnk--> Everett wide-body plant (assembly plant for the <a href="../../wp/b/Boeing_747.htm" title="Boeing 747">747</a>, <!--del_lnk--> 767, <!--del_lnk--> 777 and the upcoming <!--del_lnk--> 787 Dreamliner); and <!--del_lnk--> BECU, formerly the Boeing Employees Credit Union.<p>The most recent boom centered around the development of software technology. <a href="../../wp/m/Microsoft.htm" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>; companies involved with <a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">Internet</a> development, <!--del_lnk--> telecommunications companies such as <!--del_lnk--> Amazon.com, <!--del_lnk--> RealNetworks, <!--del_lnk--> McCaw Communications (later acquired by <!--del_lnk--> AT&amp;T Corp. and renamed <!--del_lnk--> AT&amp;T Wireless and then again acquired by Cingular Wireless and renamed Cingular), and VoiceStream (later acquired by <!--del_lnk--> Deutsche Telekom and renamed <!--del_lnk--> T-Mobile USA), and <!--del_lnk--> biomedical corporations such as <!--del_lnk--> Philips, <!--del_lnk--> Boston Scientific, and <!--del_lnk--> ZymoGenetics found homes in Seattle and its suburbs. Even locally-headquartered <!--del_lnk--> Starbucks held investments in numerous Internet and software interests. This success brought an influx of new citizens and saw Seattle&#39;s real estate become some of the most expensive in the country, along with that of <a href="../../wp/s/San_Francisco%252C_California.htm" title="San Francisco, California">San Francisco</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a>, and <a href="../../wp/l/Los_Angeles%252C_California.htm" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a>.

      <p>Seattle is located between <!--del_lnk--> Puget Sound, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean, and <!--del_lnk--> Lake Washington. West beyond the Sound are the <!--del_lnk--> Olympic Mountains; east beyond Lake Washington and the <!--del_lnk--> Eastside suburbs are <!--del_lnk--> Lake Sammamish, the <!--del_lnk--> Newcastle Hills, and the <!--del_lnk--> Cascade Range. The rivers, forests, lakes, and fields were once rich enough to support one of the world&#39;s few sedentary hunter-gatherer societies. Opportunities for <!--del_lnk--> sailing, <a href="../../wp/s/Skiing.htm" title="Skiing">skiing</a>, <!--del_lnk--> bicycling, <!--del_lnk--> camping, and <!--del_lnk--> hiking are nearby and accessible almost all the year.<p>The city itself, somewhat like San Francisco, is <!--del_lnk--> hilly, though not uniformly so. Like Rome, the city lies on seven hills: <!--del_lnk--> First Hill, <!--del_lnk--> Capitol Hill, <!--del_lnk--> Queen Anne Hill, <!--del_lnk--> Magnolia, <!--del_lnk--> Beacon Hill, <!--del_lnk--> Mount Baker, and <!--del_lnk--> Crown Hill. <!--del_lnk--> West Seattle allegedly forms an eighth hill, since the highest point in the city rises 520 feet out of the ocean there in the High Point neighbourhood. The hilliest areas are near an <!--del_lnk--> isthmus in the city centre, where Downtown rises dramatically away from the chief harbour, an inlet of Puget Sound called <!--del_lnk--> Elliott Bay. The geography of Downtown and its immediate environs has been significantly altered by <!--del_lnk--> regrading projects, a <!--del_lnk--> seawall, and the construction of an <!--del_lnk--> artificial island, <!--del_lnk--> Harbour Island, at the mouth of the city&#39;s industrial <!--del_lnk--> Duwamish Waterway.<p>The man-made <!--del_lnk--> Lake Washington Ship Canal bisects the city, incorporating four natural bodies of water: <!--del_lnk--> Lake Union, <!--del_lnk--> Salmon Bay, <!--del_lnk--> Portage Bay, and <!--del_lnk--> Union Bay. The canal connects Puget Sound to Lake Washington, the <!--del_lnk--> Chittenden Locks (Ballard Locks) forming the juncture where saltwater meets freshwater.<p>An active <!--del_lnk--> geological fault, the <!--del_lnk--> Seattle Fault, runs under the city. Although neither the Seattle Fault nor the <!--del_lnk--> Cascadia Subduction Zone have caused an earthquake since the city&rsquo;s founding, the city has been hit by four major earthquakes: <!--del_lnk--> December 14 1872 (<!--del_lnk--> magnitude 7.3); <!--del_lnk--> April 13 1949 (7.1); <!--del_lnk--> April 29 1965 (6.5); and the <!--del_lnk--> Nisqually Earthquake of <!--del_lnk--> February 28 2001 (6.8). The Cascadia subduction zone poses the even greater threat of an earthquake of magnitude 9.0 or greater, capable of seriously damaging the city and collapsing many buildings, particularly Downtown and in the <!--del_lnk--> Industrial District, which is built on fill.<p>According to the <!--del_lnk--> United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 369.2 <!--del_lnk--> km&sup2; (142.5 <!--del_lnk--> mi&sup2;)<sup id="fn_GR1_back"><!--del_lnk--> GR1</sup>, 217.2 km&sup2; (83.9 mi&sup2;) of which is land and 152.0 km&sup2; (58.7 mi&sup2;) water.

      <p>Seattle has a cool mild <a href="../../wp/c/Climate.htm" title="Climate">temperate marine</a> climate, since the temperature is moderated by the <a href="../../wp/o/Ocean.htm" title="Ocean">sea</a>, and the area is protected from harsh winds and large storms by the Cascade and Olympic mountain ranges. Despite being partially in the <!--del_lnk--> rain shadow of the Olympic Mountains, the city of Seattle has a reputation for frequent rain. In reality, the so-called &quot;rainy city&quot; receives an unremarkable 38 <!--del_lnk--> inches (1016 mm) of <!--del_lnk--> precipitation a year, which is much less precipitation than <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Atlanta%252C_Georgia.htm" title="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Houston and most cities of the <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Seaboard of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. Seattle&#39;s worldwide reputation for rain derives from the fact that it is cloudy (not rainy) an average of 226 days per year (vs. 132 in New York City). Most of the precipitation falls as drizzle or light rain, with snow typically falling within the city limits about four times a year. The winters are filled with days on which rain does fall, and on days when it does not rain it usually looks as if it may because of overcast skies. As for temperature, average annual temperatures range from a low of mid-upper 30s&deg;F (around 2 or 3 &deg;C) on winter nights to a high of mid-upper 70s&deg;F (lower-mid 20 &deg;C) on summer days. Seattle&#39;s hottest official recorded temperature was 100 &deg;F (38.9 &deg;C) on <!--del_lnk--> July 20, 1994; the coldest recorded temperature was 0 &deg;F (-17.7 &deg;C) on <!--del_lnk--> January 31, 1950. However, record maximum and minimum temperatures of 102 F and -4 F, have been unofficially observed, on July 21, 1994, and on January 3, 1864, respectively.<p>To the west 80 miles (130 km), the <!--del_lnk--> Hoh Rain Forest, in <!--del_lnk--> Olympic National Park on the western flank of the Olympic Mountains, receives an annual average rainfall of 142 inches (3600 mm), and the state capital, Olympia, south of the rain shadow, receives an annual average rainfall of 52 inches (1320 mm). Snowfall is infrequent, especially at lower altitudes and near the coast, and is usually light and fleeting, lasting only a few days. On <!--del_lnk--> January 13, 1950, Seattle&#39;s record for snowfall was set at 20 inches (508 mm). Sunnier and drier &quot;<!--del_lnk--> California weather&quot; typically dominates from mid-July to mid-September. An average of 1.0 inches (26.4 mm) of rain falls in July and an average of 0.8 inches (19.3 mm) falls in August.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Puget Sound Convergence Zone is an important feature of Seattle&#39;s weather. In the convergence zone, air arriving in the area from the north meets air flowing in from the south. Both streams of air originate over the Pacific Ocean; airflow is split by the Olympic Mountains to Seattle&#39;s west, then reunited by the Cascade Mountains to the east. When the air currents meet, they are forced upward, resulting in convection.<p>Thunderstorms caused by this activity can occur north and south of town, but Seattle itself rarely receives worse weather than occasional thunder and ice pellet showers. Thunderstorms in the Cascades sometimes produce frequent lightning, which makes for a brilliant light show for those in town.<p>An exception to Seattle&#39;s dampness often occurs in <a href="../../wp/e/El_Ni%25C3%25B1o-Southern_Oscillation.htm" title="El Ni&ntilde;o">El Ni&ntilde;o</a> years, when the marine weather systems track as far south as California and little precipitation falls in the Puget Sound area. Since the region&#39;s water comes from mountain snowpacks during the drier summer months, El Ni&ntilde;o winters not only produce substandard <a href="../../wp/s/Skiing.htm" title="Skiing">skiing</a> but can result in water <!--del_lnk--> rationing and a shortage of <!--del_lnk--> hydro-electric power the following summer.<table class="wikitable">

      <p>As of the <!--del_lnk--> census<sup id="fn_GR2_back"><!--del_lnk--> GR2</sup> of 2000, there were 563,374 people, 258,499 households, and 113,400 families residing in Seattle. The racial makeup of the city was 70.09% <!--del_lnk--> White, 8.44% <!--del_lnk--> African American, 13.12% <!--del_lnk--> Asian, 1.00% <!--del_lnk--> Native American, 0.50% <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Islander, 2.38% from <!--del_lnk--> other races, and 4.46% from two or more races. <!--del_lnk--> Hispanic or <!--del_lnk--> Latino of any race were 5.28% of the population. Seattle has seen a major increase in legal and illegal immigration in recent decades. The foreign-born population increased 40% between the 1990 and 2000 censuses. Hispanics are believed to be the most rapidly growing ethnic group in Washington, with an estimated increase of 10% just from 2000 to 2002, though they have tended to settle outside the city, in rural areas where agricultural jobs are abundant. The percentage of Seattle&#39;s population that identifies as gay or lesbian is estimated to be 12.9 percent, the second highest among the largest 50 cities in the U.S. behind <a href="../../wp/s/San_Francisco%252C_California.htm" title="San Francisco, California">San Francisco, California</a>.<p>The median income for a household in the city is $45,736, and the median income for a family is $62,195. Males have a median income of $40,929 versus $35,134 for females. The per capita income for the city is $30,306. 11.8% of the population and 6.9% of families are below the poverty line. Out of the total people living in poverty, 13.8% are under the age of 18 and 10.2% are 65 or older.<p>It is estimated that 1.25% of the population is <!--del_lnk--> homeless, and that up to 14% of Seattle&#39;s homeless are children and young adults. Despite many blemishes in Seattle&#39;s treatment of homeless citizens, local charities have made attempts to lower the ballooning homeless population of some 8,000. Local <!--del_lnk--> non-profit organizations dealing with poverty and related issues include the Fremont Public Association, the Asian Counseling and Referral Service, Peace for the Streets by Kids from the Streets, and the Seattle Indian Centre. In September 2005, King County adopted a &quot;Ten-Year Plan to End Homelessness&quot;, one of the near-term results of which is a shift of funding from <!--del_lnk--> homeless shelter beds to permanent housing.<p>In 2006, after growing by 4,000 citizens per year for the previous 16 years, regional planners expect the population of Seattle to grow by 200,000 people by 2040. However, Mayor Nickels supports plans that would increase the population by 60 percent, or 350,000 people, by 2040 and is currently working on ways to accommodate this growth while keeping Seattle&#39;s single-family housing zoning laws. In 2006, the Seattle City Council voted to relax height limits on buildings in the greater part of Downtown, partly with the aim of increasing residential density in the city centre.<p>In 2005, <i><!--del_lnk--> Men&#39;s Fitness</i> magazine named Seattle the <!--del_lnk--> fittest city in the United States.<p><a id="Government_and_politics" name="Government_and_politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Government and politics</span></h2>

      <p>Seattle is a charter city, with a <!--del_lnk--> Mayor-Council form of government, unlike many of its neighbors that use the <!--del_lnk--> Council-Manager form. Seattle&#39;s mayor and nine <!--del_lnk--> city council members are elected at large, rather than by geographic subdivisions. The only other elected office is the <!--del_lnk--> city attorney. All offices are <!--del_lnk--> non-partisan.<p>The city government provides more utilities than many cities &ndash; either by running the whole operation, such as the water, sewer, and electricity services, or by handling the billing and administration, but contracting out the rest of the operations such as trash and recycling collection. In most neighboring cities, for example, electricity is provided by either a private company such as <!--del_lnk--> Puget Sound Energy, or a county <!--del_lnk--> public utility district. See the <!--del_lnk--> Utilities section for more details.<p>As with most U.S. cities, the county judicial system handles felony crimes &mdash; the Seattle Municipal Court deals with parking tickets, traffic infractions, and misdemeanors. Seattle does not have its own jail, contracting out inmates it convicts to either the King County Jail (which is located downtown), the <!--del_lnk--> Yakima County Jail, or (for short-term holdings) the <!--del_lnk--> Renton City Jail. In 2004, there were only twenty-four murders in Seattle, the fewest since 1965. Violent crime has declined by nearly 42% since 1994, to a rate of approximately seven per 1,000 people. Auto theft has increased about 44% in the same period; the Seattle Police Department has responded by nearly doubling the number of auto theft detail detectives, and is starting a &quot;bait car&quot; program. A <!--del_lnk--> <i>Money</i> magazine table, using 2001 statistics, ranked Seattle 18th highest in crime rate in the U.S., with 80.5 crimes per 1,000 citizens.<p>Seattle&#39;s politics have leaned to the left in the last few decades compared to the United States as a whole, although there is a small <a href="../../wp/l/Libertarianism.htm" title="Libertarianism">libertarian</a> movement within the metro area. Only two precincts in Seattle&mdash;one located in the famously exclusive <!--del_lnk--> Broadmoor community, and one encompassing condos within neighboring <!--del_lnk--> Madison Park&mdash;voted for <!--del_lnk--> Republican <a href="../../wp/g/George_W._Bush.htm" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> in the <!--del_lnk--> 2004 presidential election. Bush won the Broadmoor precinct by a moderate margin, although much smaller than in the <!--del_lnk--> 2000 presidential election. Madison Park was very close, also much closer than in 2000.

      <p>In 1981, Seattle held a contest to come up with a new official <!--del_lnk--> nickname to replace &quot;the Queen City.&quot; &quot;Queen City&quot; had been devised by real estate promoters and used since 1869, but was also the nickname of: <!--del_lnk--> Cincinnati; <!--del_lnk--> Denver; <a href="../../wp/t/Toronto.htm" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>; <!--del_lnk--> Buffalo; <!--del_lnk--> Bangor, Maine; <!--del_lnk--> Helena, Montana; <!--del_lnk--> Burlington, Vermont and <!--del_lnk--> Charlotte, North Carolina. The winner of this contest, selected in 1982, was &quot;the Emerald City&quot;. Submitted by Californian Sarah Sterling-Franklin, it referred to the lush surroundings of Seattle that were the result of frequent <a href="../../wp/r/Rain.htm" title="Rain">rain</a>. Seattle has also been known in the past as &quot;the Jet City&quot;&mdash;though this nickname, related to Boeing, was entirely unofficial. (This nickname is the origin of the title of the song &quot;Jet City Woman&quot; by Seattle <!--del_lnk--> progressive metal band <!--del_lnk--> Queensr&yuml;che). <!--del_lnk--> Rat City, a nickname originally earned by the <!--del_lnk--> White Centre area, is also occasionally used by locals.<p>Seattle&#39;s official <a href="../../wp/f/Flower.htm" title="Flower">flower</a> has been the <!--del_lnk--> dahlia since 1913. Its official song has been &quot;Seattle the Peerless City&quot; since 1909. In 1942, its official slogan was &quot;The City of Flowers&quot;; 48 years later, in 1990, it was &quot;The City of Goodwill&quot;, for the <!--del_lnk--> Goodwill Games held that year in Seattle. On <!--del_lnk--> October 20 2006, the <!--del_lnk--> Space Needle was adorned with the new slogan &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Metronatural.&quot; The slogan is a result of a 16-month, $200,000 effort by the Seattle Convention and Visitor&#39;s Bureau. <!--del_lnk-->  The official bird of Seattle is the <!--del_lnk--> Great Blue Heron, named by the City Council in 2003.<p><a id="Seattle_mayors_of_note" name="Seattle_mayors_of_note"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Seattle mayors of note</span></h3>

      <p>Like most urban American <!--del_lnk--> public school systems, <!--del_lnk--> Seattle Public Schools has been subject to numerous controversies. Seattle&#39;s schools <!--del_lnk--> desegregated without a court order but continue to struggle to achieve racial balance in a somewhat ethnically divided city (the south part of town having more ethnic minorities than the north). The schools have maintained high enough educational standards to keep <!--del_lnk--> white flight (and middle-class flight in general) to a minimum, but some of the area&#39;s suburban public school systems &mdash; not all of them in wealthy suburbs &mdash; have consistently higher test scores. Notably, Seattle schools seem to be failing their minority students, as high academic standards are not realized uniformly by all racial groups in many of the city&#39;s secondary schools. In 2006, Seattle&#39;s often trademarked racial tie-breaking system was ruled by the <!--del_lnk--> Supreme Court unconstitutional. And in 2002, <!--del_lnk--> West Seattle&#39;s West Seattle High School made headlines in the midst of protests of the school&#39;s &quot;Indian&quot; mascot. Despite bitter battles between SPS and Alumni Association President/Attorney Robert Zoffel, the school would later change its mascot to the &quot;Wildcats&quot;.<p>The public school system is supplemented by a moderate number of private schools: five of the high schools are <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic</a>, one is <!--del_lnk--> Lutheran, and six are secular.<p>Post-secondary education in Seattle is dominated by the <!--del_lnk--> University of Washington. With over 40,000 under-graduates and post-graduates, it is the largest school in the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Northwest and is ranked among the top research universities in the United States. Most prominent of the city&#39;s other universities are <!--del_lnk--> Seattle University, a <!--del_lnk--> Jesuit university, and <!--del_lnk--> Seattle Pacific University, founded by the <!--del_lnk--> Free Methodists. There are also a handful of smaller schools, such as <!--del_lnk--> City University, a private secular school; <!--del_lnk--> Antioch University Seattle <!--del_lnk--> , which provides graduate and undergraduate degrees for working adults; and others mainly in the <!--del_lnk--> fine arts, <a href="../../wp/b/Business.htm" title="Business">business</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Psychology.htm" title="Psychology">psychology</a>. The venerable <!--del_lnk--> Cornish College of the Arts offers bachelor&#39;s degrees in such disciplines as dance, music, and theatre.

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Space Needle is Seattle&#39;s most recognizable landmark, having been featured in the logo of the television show <i><!--del_lnk--> Frasier</i> and the backgrounds of the television series <i><!--del_lnk--> Grey&#39;s Anatomy</i>, not to mention several films. &quot;The Needle&quot;, dates from the 1962 <!--del_lnk--> Century 21 Exposition. Contrary to popular belief, the Space Needle is neither the tallest structure in Seattle nor is it in <!--del_lnk--> Downtown. This misconception results from the Space Needle often being photographed from <!--del_lnk--> Queen Anne Hill, where it is closer to the viewer than are the downtown skyscrapers. The fairgrounds surrounding the Needle have been converted into <!--del_lnk--> Seattle Centre, which remains the site of many local civic and cultural events, such as <!--del_lnk--> Bumbershoot, <!--del_lnk--> Folklife, and the <!--del_lnk--> Bite of Seattle. The <!--del_lnk--> Seattle Centre Monorail runs from Seattle Centre to <!--del_lnk--> Westlake Centre, a downtown shopping mall: a distance of about a mile.<p>Other notable Seattle landmarks include the <!--del_lnk--> Smith Tower, <!--del_lnk--> Pike Place Market, the <!--del_lnk--> Fremont Troll, the <!--del_lnk--> Experience Music Project (which is at Seattle Centre), the new <!--del_lnk--> Seattle Central Library, the <!--del_lnk--> Washington Mutual Tower, Broadway, a street made famous by the Sir Mix-A-Lot song <!--del_lnk--> Posse On Broadway, and the <!--del_lnk--> Columbia Centre, which is the fourth tallest <!--del_lnk--> skyscraper west of the <a href="../../wp/m/Mississippi_River.htm" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</a> and the twelfth tallest in the nation.

      <p>Seattle has been known as a significant centre for regional <!--del_lnk--> performing arts for many years. The century-old <!--del_lnk--> Seattle Symphony Orchestra is among the world&#39;s most recorded orchestras and performs primarily at <!--del_lnk--> Benaroya Hall. The <!--del_lnk--> Seattle Opera and <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Northwest Ballet, which perform at <!--del_lnk--> McCaw Hall (which opened 2003 on the site of the former Seattle Opera House at <!--del_lnk--> Seattle Centre), are comparably distinguished, with the Opera being particularly known for its performances of the works of <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_Wagner.htm" title="Richard Wagner">Richard Wagner</a> and the PNB School (founded in 1974) ranking as one of the top three <!--del_lnk--> ballet training institutions in the United States. The <!--del_lnk--> Seattle Youth Symphony is the largest symphonic youth organization in the United States, and among the most distinguished.<p>The historic <!--del_lnk--> 5th Avenue Theatre, built in 1926, has continued to stage Broadway quality musical shows featuring both local talent and international stars. The theatre&#39;s &quot;Chinese Timber Architecture&quot; is based on The Forbidden City&#39;s Imperial and Summer Palaces. In addition, Seattle has about twenty other live theatre venues, a slim majority of them being associated with <!--del_lnk--> fringe theatre. It has a strong local scene for <!--del_lnk--> poetry slams and other <!--del_lnk--> performance poetry, and several venues that routinely present public lectures or readings. The largest of these is Seattle&#39;s 900-seat, <!--del_lnk--> Romanesque Revival <!--del_lnk--> Town Hall on <!--del_lnk--> First Hill.<p>Seattle is often thought of as the home of <!--del_lnk--> grunge rock musicians like <a href="../../wp/n/Nirvana_%2528band%2529.htm" title="Nirvana (band)">Nirvana</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Pearl Jam, <!--del_lnk--> Soundgarden, <!--del_lnk--> Alice in Chains, <!--del_lnk--> Green River, and <!--del_lnk--> Mudhoney, all of whom reached vast audiences in the early 1990s. The city is also home to such varied musicians as <!--del_lnk--> avant-garde <a href="../../wp/j/Jazz.htm" title="Jazz">jazz</a> musicians <!--del_lnk--> Bill Frisell and <!--del_lnk--> Wayne Horvitz, <!--del_lnk--> rapper <!--del_lnk--> Sir Mix-a-Lot, <!--del_lnk--> smooth jazz <!--del_lnk--> saxophonist <!--del_lnk--> Kenny G, <!--del_lnk--> heavy metal band <!--del_lnk--> Nevermore, industrial rockers <!--del_lnk--> KMFDM, and such <!--del_lnk--> poppier rock bands as <!--del_lnk--> Goodness and the <!--del_lnk--> Presidents of the United States of America. Such musicians as <!--del_lnk--> Jimi Hendrix, <!--del_lnk--> Duff McKagan, <!--del_lnk--> Nikki Sixx, and <!--del_lnk--> Quincy Jones spent their formative years in Seattle. <!--del_lnk--> Ann and <!--del_lnk--> Nancy Wilson of the band <!--del_lnk--> Heart, often attributed to Seattle, were actually from neighboring <!--del_lnk--> Bellevue, as were <!--del_lnk--> progressive metal band <!--del_lnk--> Queensr&yuml;che.<p>Since the grunge era, the Seattle area has hosted a diverse and influential alternative music scene. The Seattle-based record label <!--del_lnk--> Sub Pop&mdash;the first to sign Nirvana&mdash;has signed such non-grunge bands as <!--del_lnk--> Murder City Devils, <!--del_lnk--> Sunny Day Real Estate, <!--del_lnk--> Skinny Puppy, <!--del_lnk--> The Postal Service, and <!--del_lnk--> The Shins. Other Seattle-area bands of note in this period include <!--del_lnk--> Death Cab for Cutie (<!--del_lnk--> Bellingham), <!--del_lnk--> Foo Fighters, <!--del_lnk--> Modest Mouse (Issaquah), and <!--del_lnk--> Sleater-Kinney (<!--del_lnk--> Olympia).<p>Earlier Seattle-based popular music acts include the collegiate folk group <!--del_lnk--> The Brothers Four; <!--del_lnk--> The Wailers, a 1960s garage band; the Allies and the Heaters (later &quot;the Heats&quot;), 1980s teen-pop bands; from that same era, the more sophisticated pop of the short-lived Visible Targets and the still-performing <!--del_lnk--> Young Fresh Fellows and <!--del_lnk--> Posies; and the pop-punk of <!--del_lnk--> The Fastbacks and the outright punk of the Fartz (later Ten Minute Warning), <!--del_lnk--> The Gits, and <!--del_lnk--> Seven Year Bitch.<p>Seattlites have also collaborated with innovative, experimental musicians from around the world, while the city has hosted their performances. French composer <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Jacques Perrey, who pioneered <!--del_lnk--> electronica in the 1960s, has worked with Seattle native Dana Countryman, best known for his work with the 1980s Seattle pop/humour group the Amazing Pink Things. Perrey performed the tracks resulting from his work with Countryman at his first American show, in Seattle in 2006.<p><!--del_lnk--> Spoken word and <a href="../../wp/p/Poetry.htm" title="Poetry">poetry</a> are also staples of the Seattle arts scene, paralleling the explosion of the <!--del_lnk--> independent music scene during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Seattle&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> performance poetry scene blossomed with the importation of the <!--del_lnk--> poetry slam from <a href="../../wp/c/Chicago.htm" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> (its origin) by transplant Paul Granert. This and the proliferation of weekly readings, open mics, and poetry-friendly club venues like the Weathered Wall, the OK Hotel, and the Ditto Tavern (all now defunct), allowed spoken-word/performance poetry to take off in a big way. The <!--del_lnk--> Seattle Poetry Slam is the city&#39;s longest running weekly show, now held at <!--del_lnk--> Tost in the Fremont Neighbourhood. Seattle annually sends a team of slammers to the National Poetry Slam and boasts as the home of some of the best performance poets in the world: <!--del_lnk--> Buddy Wakefield:two-time Individual World Poetry Slam Champ; Anis Mojgani: two-time National Poetry Slam Champ; Christa Bell: 2005 National Poetry Slam Finalist. Seattle has had such a wonderful reputation for poetry that is hosted the 2001 national poetry Slam Tournament. The Seattle Poetry Festival (launched first as the Poetry Circus in 1997) has featured local, regional, national, and international names in poetry such as <!--del_lnk--> Michael McClure, Anne Waldman, Ted Jones, <!--del_lnk--> Gwendolyn Brooks, Ismael Reed, Sekou Sundiata, and many others. Regionally famed poets like Bart Baxter, <!--del_lnk--> Tess Gallagher, and Rebecca Brown have also been featured at the Poetry Festival, as well as numerous other events such as the world-famous <!--del_lnk--> Bumbershoot Arts Festival.<p><a id="Museums_and_art_collections" name="Museums_and_art_collections"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Museums and art collections</span></h3>

      <p>Seattle&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> professional sports history began at the start of the 20th century with the <!--del_lnk--> PCHA&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Seattle Metropolitans, which in 1917 became the first <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_hockey.htm" title="Ice hockey">hockey</a> team to win the <!--del_lnk--> Stanley Cup. Today Seattle has teams in nearly every major professional sport. The four major professional teams are the <!--del_lnk--> NBA&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Seattle SuperSonics, the <!--del_lnk--> NFL&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Seattle Seahawks, the <!--del_lnk--> MLB&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Seattle Mariners, and the <!--del_lnk--> WNBA&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Seattle Storm. Seattle also boasts a strong history in <!--del_lnk--> collegiate sports, the <!--del_lnk--> NCAA <!--del_lnk--> Division I school <!--del_lnk--> University of Washington and the NCAA <!--del_lnk--> Division II schools <!--del_lnk--> Seattle Pacific University and <!--del_lnk--> Seattle University.<p><a id="Outdoor_activities" name="Outdoor_activities"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Outdoor activities</span></h3>
      <p>Seattle&#39;s cool mild climate helps a huge proportion of its population engage in outdoor recreation, including walking, bicycling, hiking, and swimming, among others. The downtown <!--del_lnk--> REI is that chain&#39;s flagship store, and carries gear for all those activities. In town many people walk around Green Lake, through the forests and along the bluffs and beaches of 535-acre Discovery Park (the largest park in the city) in Magnolia, along the shores of Myrtle Edwards Park on the Downtown waterfront, or along Alki Beach in West Seattle. Also popular are hikes and skiing in the nearby <!--del_lnk--> Cascade or <!--del_lnk--> Olympic Mountains and kayaking and sailing in the waters of Puget Sound, the <!--del_lnk--> Strait of Juan de Fuca, and the <!--del_lnk--> Strait of Georgia. The San Juan Islands, with their sunny climate and labyrinthine waterways, are especially popular among sailing enthusiasts and passengers aboard the <!--del_lnk--> Washington State Ferries on their way to Victoria.<p><a id="Infrastructure" name="Infrastructure"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Infrastructure</span></h2>

      <p>Even though Seattle is old enough that railways and streetcars once dominated its transportation system, the city is now largely dominated by automobiles. Seattle is also serviced by an extensive network of bus routes and two commuter rail routes connecting it to many of its suburbs.<p><a id="Public_transportation" name="Public_transportation"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Public transportation</span></h4>
      <p>The first streetcars appeared in 1889 and were instrumental in the creation of a relatively well-defined downtown and strong neighborhoods at the end of their lines. Unfortunately, the advent of the automobile proved to be the death knell for rail in Seattle. Tacoma-Seattle railway service ended in 1929 and the Everett-Seattle service came to an end in 1939, replaced by inexpensive automobiles running on the recently developed highway system. With the removal or paving over of the rails on city streets and the arrival of <!--del_lnk--> trolleybuses, 1941 brought the end of streetcars in Seattle. This left only an extensive network of buses to provide mass transit within the city and throughout the region.<p>Seattle is serviced by three transit authorities. <!--del_lnk--> King County Metro provides frequent stop bus service within the city and surrounding county. Like Vancouver and San Francisco, Seattle is one of the few cities in North America that use electric <!--del_lnk--> trolleybuses.<p>The second transit authority that services Seattle is <!--del_lnk--> Sound Transit, which provides express bus service between the suburbs and downtown Seattle. Beginning <!--del_lnk--> September 18, 2000, Sound Transit began operating &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Sounder&quot;, a commuter rail system that connects Seattle to <!--del_lnk--> Tacoma and a number of other suburbs to the south and <!--del_lnk--> Everett and other suburbs to the north. Sound Transit also began construction on the 15.7 mile Central Link <!--del_lnk--> Light Rail in November 2003 that will connect downtown Seattle to <!--del_lnk--> SeaTac Airport. Ultimately the Link Light Rail system will connect downtown to <!--del_lnk--> University of Washington and Northgate Mall to the north, <!--del_lnk--> Bellevue and <!--del_lnk--> Redmond to the east, and <!--del_lnk--> Federal Way, <!--del_lnk--> Des Moines, and possibly as far south as Tacoma.<div class="thumb tright">

      </div>
      <p>The third, and possibly most interesting, transit authority is the largest network of ferries in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, third largest in the world, that connects Seattle to <!--del_lnk--> Bainbridge Island and <!--del_lnk--> Vashon Island in <!--del_lnk--> Puget Sound and <!--del_lnk--> Bremerton and <!--del_lnk--> Southworth on the <!--del_lnk--> Kitsap Peninsula. This ferry system is operated by <!--del_lnk--> Washington State Ferries and consists of 10 routes (4 servicing Seattle), 20 terminals (2 in Seattle), and 28 vessels (8 servicing Seattle).<p>A <!--del_lnk--> monorail line constructed for the 1962 Exposition still exists today between <!--del_lnk--> Seattle Centre and downtown and is used by tourists and by commuters from the north, who often find it cheaper to park at Seattle Centre and take the 1 mile route to work rather than taking their car downtown. On <!--del_lnk--> November 26 2005 the monorail&#39;s two trains collided on a curve near Westlake Centre where a design flaw made it impossible to pass safely. Both trains are currently being repaired at an estimated cost of $3-4 million and are not expected to be in operation until summer 2006.<p>In the 1990s the city proposed building a longer monorail as a real commuter service replacing the existing tourist attraction, but nothing came of two voter approved initiatives in the 90s. Ultimately Seattle voters approved the creation of the 14 mile <!--del_lnk--> Green Line connecting West Seattle and Ballard to downtown in November 2002. Controversy over scope, governance, financial difficulties, and other issues led to two additional votes with the final vote, November 2005, bringing the Green Line to an end.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> South Lake Union line of the Seattle Streetcar passed full City Council on June 27, 2005. The streetcar is &quot;on track&quot; to be built and operating by 2007. The 2.6 mile (4.2 km) streetcar line will run between the <!--del_lnk--> Westlake Centre shopping mall in Downtown and the <!--del_lnk--> Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre in Eastlake. Property owners along the right-of-way will pay about $25 million of the $45 million total capital cost through a local improvement district.<p><a id="Airports" name="Airports"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Airports</span></h4>
      <p>Seattle&#39;s commercial airport is <!--del_lnk--> Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, locally known as Sea-Tac Airport and located in the city of <!--del_lnk--> SeaTac, which is named for the airport. It is operated by the <!--del_lnk--> Port of Seattle and provides service to many destinations throughout <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> East Asia. The airport is a hub for <!--del_lnk--> Alaska Airlines and its regional subsidiary <!--del_lnk--> Horizon Air. Seattle is also a focus city for <!--del_lnk--> Northwest Airlines. In 2005, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport was the 17th busiest in the U.S. and 30th busiest in the world, with 29,289,026 air passengers.<p>Seattle&#39;s general-aviation airport is <!--del_lnk--> Boeing Field. It is also used for cargo flights and testing/delivery of <!--del_lnk--> Boeing airliners. <!--del_lnk--> Southwest Airlines recently requested permission to move its services from Sea-Tac to Boeing Field but did not receive permission.<p><a id="Street_layout" name="Street_layout"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Street layout</span></h3>

      <p>Seattle&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> streets are laid out in a <!--del_lnk--> cardinal-direction <!--del_lnk--> grid pattern, except in the <!--del_lnk--> central business district: early city leaders <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Denny and <!--del_lnk--> Carson Boren insisted on orienting their <!--del_lnk--> plats relative to the shoreline rather than to <!--del_lnk--> true North, so streets meet at unusual angles where Denny&#39;s plat meets &quot;Doc&quot; Maynard&#39;s to the south and Boren&#39;s to the north. This inconsistency creates frequent confusion for visitors and newcomers when they attempt to navigate the streets at the edges of the business district. Largely as a result of Seattle&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> topography, only one street and one <!--del_lnk--> freeway run uninterrupted through the city from north to south.<p><a id="Utilities" name="Utilities"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Utilities</span></h3>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Group Health Cooperative is a leading proponent and developer of <!--del_lnk--> managed care in the northwest, and the University of Washington is consistently ranked among the country&#39;s top leading institutions in medical research. Seattle has seen local developments of modern <!--del_lnk--> paramedic services with the establishment of <!--del_lnk--> Medic One in 1970. In 1974, a <i><!--del_lnk--> 60 Minutes</i> story on the success of the then four-year-old Medic One paramedic system called Seattle &quot;the best place in the world to have a <a href="../../wp/m/Myocardial_infarction.htm" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a>&quot;.<p>Most of Seattle&#39;s hospitals are located on <!--del_lnk--> First Hill. <!--del_lnk--> Harborview Medical Centre, the public county hospital, is the only <!--del_lnk--> Level I <!--del_lnk--> trauma hospital serving Washington, <!--del_lnk--> Alaska, <!--del_lnk--> Montana, and <!--del_lnk--> Idaho. <!--del_lnk--> Swedish Medical Centre, Providence Medical Centre and <!--del_lnk--> Virginia Mason Medical Centre are also located in this part of Seattle. This concentration of hospitals resulted in the neighbourhood&#39;s nicknames &quot;Pill Hill&quot; and &quot;Hospital Hill&quot;.<p>Located in the <!--del_lnk--> Laurelhurst neighbourhood, <!--del_lnk--> Children&rsquo;s Hospital and Regional Medical Centre is the pediatric referral centre for Washington, <!--del_lnk--> Alaska, <!--del_lnk--> Montana, and <!--del_lnk--> Idaho. The <!--del_lnk--> Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre has a campus in the <!--del_lnk--> Eastlake neighborhood and also shares facilities with the University of Washington Medical Centre.
