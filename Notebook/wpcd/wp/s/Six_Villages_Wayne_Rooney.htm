<h2>Wayne Rooney becomes official Ambassador for SOS Children</h2><p><strong>01/02/2006</strong></p>
<img src="../../wp/r/Rooney_SOS_Ambassador_website.jpg" width="375" height="400" alt="FIFA/SOS Ambassador Wayne Rooney" class="left" /><p><strong>**NEWSFLASH**NEWSFLASH**</strong></p><p>Wayne Rooney and Andriy Shevchenko signed shirts are up for auction on SOS Children's auction pages - but hurry, the auction finishes 13 May 2007! </p><p><strong>**NEWSFLASH**NEWSFLASH**</strong></p><p>Wayne Rooney, PFA Young Player of the Year 2005 and top England and Manchester United striker, became an official &quot;FIFA for SOS Children's Villages&quot; ambassador in October 2005. Wayne also underlined his support for the FIFA 2006 World Cup charity campaign &quot;6 villages for 2006&quot;.</p><p>In February 2003 Wayne Rooney became the youngest footballer to play for England. In August 2004 he became the world's most expensive teenager when he signed for Manchester United, and his reputation as one of the world's most exciting young players was further enhanced by his hugely impressive performances for England at Euro 2004 Championships in Portugal. </p><p>Perhaps less well known is his very personal commitment to raising money for Claire House and Alder Hey Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Liverpool. Through his ambassadorial role for FIFA/SOS, Wayne hopes to use his internationally growing reputation to further give some of the most disadvantaged children around the world a family home in an SOS Children's Village, where they can grow up with brothers, sisters, an education and hope for the future. </p><p>Wayne Rooney said &quot;I was made up when FIFA for SOS Children's Charity asked me if I would get involved. The work they do is for kids who have suffered and have no families to help them. I know how much it means to have a family that supports you, so I am delighted I can give my support to these kids.&quot;</p><img src="../../wp/w/Wayne_Rooney_21.jpg" width="253" height="241" alt="Wayne Rooney ambassador for SOS Children" class="right" /><p>FIFA welcomed the appointment of Wayne Rooney as &ldquo;FIFA for SOS Children&rsquo;s Villages&rdquo; ambassador for England. FIFA President Joseph S. Blatter said of the England player&rsquo;s appointment: &ldquo;Rooney is one of the most exciting young talents of our days and it is encouraging to see that he is committing himself to support the cause of some of the most vulnerable and needy children around the world.&rdquo;</p><p>Wayne joins a list of leading world football stars in accepting this ambassadorial role. See more information about other FIFA/SOS Ambassadors <a href="../../wp/s/Six_Villages_Ambassadors.htm">here</a>. </p><p>Andrew Cates, Chief Executive, SOS Children&rsquo;s Villages UK commented &ldquo;We are really delighted that Wayne has become an ambassador for the campaign. Wayne follows footballing greats from around the world in recognising the needs of the world's rapidly increasing number of children who are alone with no one left to care for them. When someone of Wayne's public stature shows such strong support for our work, we are confident that England will follow his lead helping children with nowhere else to turn.&quot; </p><p>For more details phone Chrissy Davey on 01223 365589 or email <a href="mailto:chrissy@soschildren.org">chrissy@soschildren.org</a>.</p><p><strong>Relevant Countries:</strong> <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil_A.htm">Brazil</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico_A.htm">Mexico</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/Nigeria_A.htm">Nigeria</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa_A.htm">South Africa</a>, <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_A.htm">Vietnam</a>.</p>
