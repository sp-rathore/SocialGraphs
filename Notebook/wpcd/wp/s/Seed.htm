      <p>A <b>seed</b> is the ripened <!--del_lnk--> ovule of <!--del_lnk--> gymnosperm or <!--del_lnk--> angiosperm <a href="../../wp/p/Plant.htm" title="Plant">plants</a>. The importance of the seed relative to more primitive forms of reproduction and dispersal is attested to by the success of these two groups of plants in dominating the landscape.<p>

      <p>A seed contains the <b><!--del_lnk--> embryo</b> from which a new plant will grow under proper conditions. Seeds also usually contain a supply of stored food and is wrapped in the <b>seed coat</b> or testa. Seeds are very diverse in size. The dust-like orchid seeds are the smallest with about one million seeds per gram. Orchid seeds have immature embryos and no significant food reserves. They are <a href="../../wp/m/Myco-heterotrophy.htm" title="Myco-heterotrophy">myco-heterotrophs</a>, depending on <!--del_lnk--> mycorrhizal fungi for nutrition during germination. At over 20 kg, the largest seed is the <!--del_lnk--> coco de mer.<p>The embryo has one <!--del_lnk--> cotyledon or seed leaf in <!--del_lnk--> monocotyledons, two cotyledons in almost all <!--del_lnk--> dicotyledons and two or more in gymnosperms. The <!--del_lnk--> radicle is the embryonic root. The plumule is the embryonic shoot. The embryonic stem above the point of attachment of the cotyledon(s) is the <!--del_lnk--> epicotyl. The embryonic stem below the point of attachment is the <!--del_lnk--> hypocotyl.<p>In angiosperms, the stored food begins as a tissue called the <!--del_lnk--> endosperm, which is derived from the parent plant via <!--del_lnk--> double fertilization. The usually triploid endosperm is rich in <!--del_lnk--> oil or <!--del_lnk--> starch and <a href="../../wp/p/Protein.htm" title="Protein">protein</a>. In gymnosperms, such as <!--del_lnk--> conifers, the food storage tissue is part of the female gametophyte, a haploid tissue.<p>In some species, the embryo is embedded in the endosperm or female gametophyte, which the seedling will use upon <!--del_lnk--> germination. In others, the endosperm is absorbed by the embryo as the latter grows within the developing seed, and the cotyledons of the embryo become filled with this stored food. At maturity, seeds of these species have no endosperm and are termed exalbuminous seeds. Some exalbuminous seeds are <a href="../../wp/b/Bean.htm" title="Bean">bean</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Pea.htm" title="Pea">pea</a>, <!--del_lnk--> oak, <!--del_lnk--> walnut, <!--del_lnk--> squash, <a href="../../wp/s/Sunflower.htm" title="Sunflower">sunflower</a>, and <a href="../../wp/r/Radish.htm" title="Radish">radish</a>. Seeds with an endosperm at maturity are termed albuminous seeds. Most monocots (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> grasses and <a href="../../wp/a/Arecaceae.htm" title="Arecaceae">palms</a>) and many dicots (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> brazil nut and <!--del_lnk--> castor bean) have albuminous seeds. All gymnosperm seeds are albuminous.<p>The seed coat develops from the tissue, the integument, originally surrounding the ovule. The seed coat in the mature seed can be a paper-thin layer (e.g. <a href="../../wp/p/Peanut.htm" title="Peanut">peanut</a>) or something more substantial (e.g. thick and hard in <!--del_lnk--> honey locust and <a href="../../wp/c/Coconut.htm" title="Coconut">coconut</a>). The seed coat helps protect the embryo from mechanical injury and from drying out.<p>The seeds of angiosperms are contained in a hard or fleshy (or with layers of both) structure called a <a href="../../wp/f/Fruit.htm" title="Fruit">fruit</a>. Gymnosperm seeds begin their development &quot;naked&quot; on the bracts of cones, although the seeds do become covered by the <!--del_lnk--> cone scales as they develop. An example of a hard fruit layer surrounding the actual seed is that of the so-called <i><!--del_lnk--> stone</i> fruits (such as the <!--del_lnk--> peach).<p>Some seeds have an appendage on the seed coat such an <!--del_lnk--> aril (as in <!--del_lnk--> yew and <a href="../../wp/n/Nutmeg.htm" title="Nutmeg">nutmeg</a>) or an <!--del_lnk--> elaiosome (as in <!--del_lnk--> Corydalis) or hairs (as in <a href="../../wp/c/Cotton.htm" title="Cotton">cotton</a>). The hilum is the scar on the seed coat where the seed was attached to the ovary wall by the funiculus.<p>In order for the seed coat to split, the embryo must imbibe (soak up water), which causes it to swell, splitting the seed coat. However, the nature of the seed coat determines how rapidly water can penetrate and subsequently initiate <!--del_lnk--> germination. For seeds with a very thick coat, scarification of the seed coat may be necessary before water can reach the embryo. Examples of scarification include: gnawing by animals, freezing and thawing, battering on rocks in a stream bed, or passing through an animal&#39;s digestive tract. In the latter case, the seed coat protects the seed from <!--del_lnk--> digestion, while perhaps weakening the seed coat such that the embryo is ready to sprout when it gets deposited (along with a bit of fertilizer) far from the parent plant. In species with thin seed coats, <a href="../../wp/l/Light.htm" title="Light">light</a> may be able to penetrate into the dormant embryo. The presence of light or the absence of light may trigger the germination process, inhibiting germination in some seeds buried too deeply or in others not buried in the soil. <!--del_lnk--> Abscisic acid is usually the growth inhibitor in seeds.<p><a id="Seed_functions" name="Seed_functions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Seed functions</span></h2>
      <p>Seeds protect and nourish the embryo or baby plant. Seeds usually give a seedling a faster start than a sporling from a spore gets because of the larger food reserves in the seed.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Unlike animals, plants are limited in their ability to seek out favorable conditions for life and growth. As a consequence, plants have evolved many ways to <!--del_lnk--> disperse their population through their seeds (see also <!--del_lnk--> vegetative reproduction). A seed must somehow &quot;arrive&quot; at a location and be there at a time favorable for germination and growth. Seed dispersal is often attributed mainly to fruits, however many seeds aid in their own dispersal, for example:<ul>
       <li>Many seeds (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> maple, <!--del_lnk--> pine) have a wing that aids in wind dispersal.<li>The dustlike seeds of <!--del_lnk--> orchids are carried efficiently by the wind.<li>Some seeds, (e.g. <a href="../../wp/d/Dandelion.htm" title="Dandelion">dandelion</a>, <!--del_lnk--> milkweed, <!--del_lnk--> poplar) have hairs that aid in wind dispersal.<li>Seeds with a fleshy covering (e.g. <a href="../../wp/a/Apple.htm" title="Apple">apple</a>, <!--del_lnk--> cherry, <!--del_lnk--> juniper) which is eaten by animals (<a href="../../wp/b/Bird.htm" title="Bird">birds</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Mammal.htm" title="Mammal">mammals</a>) which then disperse the seeds in their <!--del_lnk--> droppings.<li>Seeds (<!--del_lnk--> nuts) which are an attractive long-term storable food resource for animals (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> acorns, <!--del_lnk--> hazelnut, <!--del_lnk--> walnut); the seeds are stored some distance from the parent plant, and some escape being eaten if the animal stores more than it needs, forgets where it has stored the seed, or dies.<li>Seeds (<!--del_lnk--> burrs) with barbs or hooks (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> acaena, <!--del_lnk--> burdock, <!--del_lnk--> dock) which attach to animal fur or feathers, and then drop off later.<li>Seeds of some <!--del_lnk--> mangroves are viviparous, they begin to germinate while still attached to the parent. The large, heavy root allows the seed to penetrate into the ground when it falls.<li>Some seeds have appendages called <!--del_lnk--> elaiosomes, e.g. <!--del_lnk--> bloodroot, <!--del_lnk--> trilliums and <!--del_lnk--> Acacias. Elaiosomes provide food for <a href="../../wp/a/Ant.htm" title="Ant">ants</a>, which usually disperse such seeds. <li>Some plants, such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Mucuna</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Dioclea</i>, produce buoyant seeds termed sea-beans or drift seeds because they float in rivers to the oceans and wash up on beaches <!--del_lnk--> .</ul>
      <p>For <!--del_lnk--> annuals, seeds are a way for the species to survive dry or cold seasons. Ephemeral plants are usually annuals that can go from seed to seed in as few as six weeks.<p>One important function of most seeds is delaying germination to allow time for dispersal and to prevent all seeds from germinating at once when conditions are favorable. Staggering germination prevents all seeds from germinating at once and being wiped out by bad weather or herbivores. <!--del_lnk--> Seed dormancy is defined as a seed failing to germinate under environmental conditions optimal for germination. It is often confused with seed quiescence, which is a seed failing to germinate because environmental conditions are inappropriate for germination. Many cultivated seeds lack dormancy but do not germinate in seed packets simply because there is insufficient moisture.<p><a id="Origin_and_evolution" name="Origin_and_evolution"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Origin and evolution</span></h2>
      <p>The origin of seed plants is a problem that still remains unsolved. However, more and more data tends to place this origin in the middle <a href="../../wp/d/Devonian.htm" title="Devonian">Devonian</a>. The description in 2004 of the proto-seed <i>Runcaria heinzelinii</i> in the <!--del_lnk--> Givetian of <a href="../../wp/b/Belgium.htm" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> is an indication of that ancient origin of seed-plants.<p>The first &quot;true&quot; seeds are described from the upper Devonian, which is probably the theatre of their true first evolutionary radiation. The seed plants progressively became one of the major elements of nearly all ecosystems.<p><a id="Economic_importance" name="Economic_importance"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economic importance</span></h2>

One of the deadliest poisons, <!--del_lnk--> ricin, comes from seeds of the <!--del_lnk--> castor bean. Another seed poison is <!--del_lnk--> strychnine.

       <li>There is a persistent myth that seeds from <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">Egyptian</a> tombs with ages of over 3,000 years were viable <!--del_lnk--> .
