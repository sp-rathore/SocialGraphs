      <p><i><b>Stargate SG-1</b></i> (often abbreviated as <b>SG-1</b>) is a <!--del_lnk--> science fiction <!--del_lnk--> television series based upon the <!--del_lnk--> 1994 <!--del_lnk--> science fiction film <i><!--del_lnk--> Stargate</i>. Both posit the existence of devices called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Stargates&quot; that use artificial <!--del_lnk--> wormholes to allow people and objects to cross vast distances of <!--del_lnk--> space in an instant. Although the show has referred to at least 20 SG teams, it focuses on a team called <!--del_lnk--> SG-1, who operate from a <!--del_lnk--> top-secret <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">U.S.</a> <!--del_lnk--> military base called the <!--del_lnk--> SGC (Stargate Command), use a Stargate found on Earth to explore <!--del_lnk--> other worlds, and defend Earth against <!--del_lnk--> alien threats instigated in the original film. Thus unlike many other science-fiction franchises with an interplanetary-exploration theme, <i>SG-1</i> is set in the present day, is based on Earth, and primarily involves <!--del_lnk--> humans.<p>

      <p>The original members of <!--del_lnk--> SG-1 were <!--del_lnk--> Col. Jack O&#39;Neill (<!--del_lnk--> Anderson), <!--del_lnk--> Dr. Daniel Jackson (<!--del_lnk--> Shanks), <!--del_lnk--> Capt. Samantha Carter (<!--del_lnk--> Tapping) and <!--del_lnk--> Teal&#39;c (<!--del_lnk--> Judge). For eight seasons, their primary antagonists were the <!--del_lnk--> Goa&#39;uld, a galaxy-dominating race of highly intelligent and ruthless snake-like alien creatures who invade and take control of the bodies of other species, including humans on various planets. The original arch-enemy from this race was the <!--del_lnk--> System Lord <!--del_lnk--> Apophis (<!--del_lnk--> Peter Williams).<p>In the pilot episode of <i>SG-1</i>, the primary goal of the <!--del_lnk--> SG teams is established: to travel to other worlds through the Stargate and procure alien technology to help defend Earth against the <!--del_lnk--> Goa&#39;uld. This forms the basis of nearly every episode after that point. It is common for episodes to begin already on another planet, where the viewer is meant to infer that the team is there, as usual, reconnoitering for potentially useful allies or technology. Aside from this, the <a href="../../wp/a/Archaeology.htm" title="Archaeology">archaeologist</a> and <a href="../../wp/h/History.htm" title="History">historian</a> character Daniel Jackson often takes further interest in <a href="../../wp/a/Anthropology.htm" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a>, alien <a href="../../wp/s/Society.htm" title="Society">society</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Culture.htm" title="Culture">culture</a>, and even <!--del_lnk--> moral issues encountered whilst offworld, allowing for more philosophical or thoughtful episodes. Nearly all alien planets are depicted as populated by humans that were displaced from ancient Earth, allowing the show to explore real-life ancient cultures such as those of the <a href="../../wp/a/Aztec.htm" title="Aztec">Aztecs</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Mayans, <!--del_lnk--> Britons, the <!--del_lnk--> Norse, <!--del_lnk--> Mongols, <!--del_lnk--> Greeks, <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a> and most prominently, <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egyptians</a>. Many famous mythical locations, such as Avalon, Camelot and Atlantis, have been found throughout the show. In addition, the show often gives fictional origins for real religions and mythologies.<p>The series often follows a direct formula in which major events, including the introduction of a villain, are the fault of human curiosity. Including:<ul>
       <li>After ignoring it for almost five thousand years, the <!--del_lnk--> Goa&#39;uld come to realize that Earth is a threat to them after humanity activates the <!--del_lnk--> Stargate and defeats the <!--del_lnk--> System Lord, <!--del_lnk--> Ra.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Replicators are a product of a humanoid <!--del_lnk--> android who was created by a human (most probably <!--del_lnk--> Alteran) scientist.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Ori became aware of the Milky Way galaxy after <!--del_lnk--> Daniel Jackson and <!--del_lnk--> Vala Mal Doran activate an <!--del_lnk--> Ancient communication device that sends their consciousnesses to the Ori galaxy.<li>See also <i><!--del_lnk--> Stargate Atlantis</i>.</ul>
      <p>The decade-old show remains popular; in 2004, <i><!--del_lnk--> TV Guide</i> suggested that its popularity may be exceeding that of the <i><a href="../../wp/s/Star_Trek.htm" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a></i> franchise. Testifying to its vigor, <i>Stargate SG-1</i> broke <!--del_lnk--> Nielsen Ratings records for the U.S. <!--del_lnk--> Sci-Fi Channel throughout its eighth season, whose two-part episode &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Reckoning&quot; was widely regarded by fans as one of the show&#39;s five best episodes,. Although Anderson departed as a regular after Season 8, he made guest appearances in several episodes of Seasons 9 and 10 of <i>SG-1</i> and Season 3 of <i>Stargate Atlantis</i>.<p><a id="Plot_summary" name="Plot_summary"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Plot summary</span></h2>

      <p>When <!--del_lnk--> Apophis attacks Earth at the beginning of the series, which is set one year after the events of the <!--del_lnk--> original film, the <!--del_lnk--> SGC military base is brought back into action, and <!--del_lnk--> SG teams are created, the prime of which is <!--del_lnk--> SG-1, to help defend Earth from the new threat. It is quickly revealed that Apophis is but one of many <!--del_lnk--> Goa&#39;uld <!--del_lnk--> System Lords who battle for power of the galaxy. It is also discovered that the Stargate is part of a large system of gates that leads to numerous planets.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Goa&#39;uld are portrayed as parasitic beings that take control of other bodies (usually humans, whom they transported across the galaxy in the distant past). System Lords are shown having vast armies of footsoldiers, the bulk of these forces consisting of modified humans known as <!--del_lnk--> Jaffa. Throughout the course of the show, some Jaffa &ndash; and then an increasing number &ndash; form a <!--del_lnk--> Jaffa Rebellion led by <!--del_lnk--> Bra&#39;tac and main character <!--del_lnk--> Teal&#39;c, a high-ranking Jaffa who defected to SG-1&#39;s cause in the first episode.<div class="notice metadata spoiler" id="spoiler">

      <p><!--del_lnk--> SG-1 and the <!--del_lnk--> SGC make several alliances with other races in the galaxy, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Tok&#39;ra. The Tok&#39;ra are the same species as the <!--del_lnk--> Goa&#39;uld, but they are opposed to the <!--del_lnk--> System Lords, and their hosts willingly <i>share</i> their bodies. Other races depicted include the <!--del_lnk--> Tollan and other advanced human civilizations. They also meet races that have been surviving in the galaxy for millennia, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Nox, the <!--del_lnk--> Asgard, and the remnants of an extinct race that come to be known as the <!--del_lnk--> Ancients. It is later discovered that the Ancients were the most advanced race ever, and were the builders of the Stargates.<p>In the background of the show, there is a constant attempt by forces on Earth to take control of the Stargate. In particular, rogue <!--del_lnk--> NID agents, which eventually become the elite syndicate known as <!--del_lnk--> The Trust, are constantly trying to steal the Stargate or use alien technology for their own ends. The political powers on Earth are often at loggerheads over the Stargate, particularly after the program is revealed to ambassadors from the other main powers of Earth.<div class="notice metadata spoiler" id="spoiler">

      <p>Besides the Goa&#39;uld, another threat arises in Season 3, namely a race of non-sentient machines called <!--del_lnk--> Replicators.

      <p>Engaging with Replicators in the premiere, the show begins to spread away from its Goa&#39;uld-orientated roots in Season 4, focusing on stand-alone episodes and alternative bases for episodes. Throughout the season, they encounter everything from genocidal civilizations, to advanced strength-enhancing gauntlets, to a newly recurring species, the <!--del_lnk--> Unas. The season ends with a large battle against the Goa&#39;uld System Lord <!--del_lnk--> Apophis.<div class="notice metadata spoiler" id="spoiler">

      <p>After Apophis is conquered in Season 5, another Goa&#39;uld System Lord takes his place as the show&#39;s main villain, <!--del_lnk--> Anubis. Anubis is considerably more evil than Apophis, and has much of the knowledge of the Ancients. The theme of <!--del_lnk--> Ascension is introduced fully, explaining that the Ancients survived extinction by Ascending to a higher plane of existence. Anubis tried to do this as well, to harvest the vast knowledge and power in that plane, but was cast down again, leaving him in a dangerous half-Ascended state. Anubis gains great power by using Ancient technology and stealing Asgard technology.<div class="notice metadata spoiler" id="spoiler">

      <p>Near the end of Season 5, <!--del_lnk--> Daniel Jackson dies, but Ascends with help from <!--del_lnk--> Oma Desala. In Season 6, his position is filled by <!--del_lnk--> Jonas Quinn; Jackson is now engaged in cosmic affairs on a higher plane. Occasionally, he appears to his friends to help them out, but is only visible to them alone, often causing them to think that they are hallucinating. However, in the Season 6 finale, Anubis threatens to destroy <!--del_lnk--> Abydos, the planet most dear to Daniel apart from Earth, and Daniel promises to stop Anubis.<div class="notice metadata spoiler" id="spoiler">

      <p>However, Daniel is ultimately unable to keep Anubis from destroying Abydos as the other Ascended beings have a rule against interfering in the affairs of mortal beings. His transgression causes him to be cast down by the Ancients to the human plane of existence allowing him to re-join SG-1 again. Soon after Daniel&#39;s return, Jonas Quinn is finally accepted back on his home world and leaves the SGC. Throughout Season 7, Anubis consolidates his power by wiping out other System Lords, whilst Daniel and the SGC search for the Lost City of the Ancients, where powerful technology will be found that can defeat Anubis. In the Season 7 finale, an Ancient Outpost is located in Antarctica, and Jack O&#39;Neill is able to use the weapon there to annihilate Anubis&#39;s entire fleet.<div class="notice metadata spoiler" id="spoiler">

      <p>In Season 8, the System Lord <!--del_lnk--> Ba&#39;al subsumes much of Anubis&#39;s power, but Anubis is discovered not to be dead due to his half-Ascended state. He eventually comes to rule secretly over Ba&#39;al as well. Alongside this, the <!--del_lnk--> Replicators escape and begin to conquer even the System Lords. A human-form Replicator (&quot;<!--del_lnk--> RepliCarter&quot;) is created in the image of <!--del_lnk--> Samantha Carter, and this Replicator becomes the most powerful force in the galaxy.<p>Towards the end of Season 8, Anubis seeks to destroy all life in the galaxy so he can remake it as he sees fit, and he seeks to do this using the <!--del_lnk--> Dakara Superweapon. However <!--del_lnk--> SG-1 reaches the weapon first and realigns it to destroy only the Replicators across the galaxy. They achieve this end, but not before Daniel is killed by RepliCarter. However he finds himself in the Ascended plane once more (again Oma has helped him), where Anubis is finally stopped in his plans by Oma. Daniel Jackson then is de-Ascended once more and arrives at the SGC. Ba&#39;al has to flee under the total success of the Jaffa Rebellion, as the System Lords were severely weakened in their battle against the Replicators and now that the Replicators are gone the Jaffa gain much of their lost strength.<div class="notice metadata spoiler" id="spoiler">

It is discovered that Ba&#39;al fled to Earth and is rebuilding his power from there, whilst many <!--del_lnk--> Goa&#39;uld have infected The Trust.<p>Due to an accidental visit to a distant galaxy, Daniel Jackson and <!--del_lnk--> Vala Mal Doran draw the attention of a cosmic group of evil Ascended beings, the <!--del_lnk--> Ori, to the Milky Way. The <!--del_lnk--> Ori influence the mortal world through commanding mortals that they evolve and enhance. These mortals are called <!--del_lnk--> Priors, and uphold a religion that worships the Ori, called <!--del_lnk--> Origin. Followers of this religion are falsely promised Ascension, and unknowingly enforce the power of the Ori, who begin to make incursions into the Milky Way, with the ultimate goal of converting all humans and destroying the Ancients.<p>When SG-1 learns that <!--del_lnk--> Merlin, a formerly Ascended Ancient and founder of the Arthurian legends, had been working on <!--del_lnk--> a weapon to incapacitate Ascended beings as a means of defense against the Ori, they head to the planet where he was said to have left it.

      <p>In Season 10, <!--del_lnk--> Vala joins SG-1 after it is revealed that her daughter, <!--del_lnk--> Adria, has been rapidly aged by the Ori and made the leader of their forces in the Milky Way. As the Ori continue to invade, SG-1 continues its search for Merlin&#39;s anti-ascended being weapon, the Sangraal (Holy Grail). However, they must now contend with <!--del_lnk--> Ba&#39;al and his <!--del_lnk--> clones, who are attempting to steal the weapon for their own purposes.<p>Following a visit to <!--del_lnk--> Atlantis, Daniel has been told of two planets that may contain the weapon. The information came to him via an ascended ancient known throughout history as <!--del_lnk--> Morgan Le Fay. But before she could help Daniel further, she was taken back by the Ancients, presumably to be punished for interfering in mortal affairs (It should also be pointed out that episode 3 of this season marks the first visit of SG-1 to the Pegasus galaxy and <!--del_lnk--> Atlantis... although <!--del_lnk--> Teal&#39;c didn&#39;t make this trip. It also features the first joint adventures between both shows). The 200th episode was aired during this season.<p><a id="Impending_cancellation" name="Impending_cancellation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Impending cancellation</span></h2>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> August 21, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, the <!--del_lnk--> Sci Fi Channel confirmed that <i>Stargate SG-1</i> has been canceled after ten seasons. However, Executive producer Robert C. Cooper told <!--del_lnk--> GateWorld that they are hard at work looking for a new outlet for the story to continue.<blockquote>
       <p>&quot;As far as the future, I can&#39;t comment yet because nothing has been confirmed&quot;, Cooper said. &quot;What we want to emphasize is that the franchise is not dying. <i>SG-1</i> will go on in some way. We&#39;re just not ready to announce how.&quot; Cooper also emphasizes that, though emotions are running high among Stargate fans who have just learned the news, it is important to keep the show&#39;s ratings strong throughout the remainder of its run on SciFi. &quot;What&#39;s most important is that fans don&#39;t take out their frustration with SciFi by not watching&quot;, he said. &quot;In fact, what they need to do is watch both <i>SG-1</i> and <i>Atlantis LIVE</i> and make sure the ratings stay strong. That helps prove to other outlets that might be interested in <i>SG-1</i> that the show is still as strong as we think it is.&quot;</blockquote>
      <p>Mark Stern, executive VP of original programming for the Sci Fi Channel stated that the cancellation &quot;was not a ratings-based decision&quot;, adding that the production staff have been given enough time to tie up all the loose ends and to create a good ending for the show. Stern has also said that SciFi plans to use some <i>SG-1</i> members on the still-continuing spin-off <i><!--del_lnk--> Stargate Atlantis</i>. However, the term &quot;<i>cancellation</i>&quot;, as applied by Sci Fi Channel, are orders for <i>SG-1</i> episodes from MGM/Sony. They have merely cancelled their order for new episodes. MGM, the rights holder, has expressed a desire to continue <i>SG-1</i> through another outlet, suggesting that another network may pick up the series. This means that the series is not actually cancelled, but simply on hold. MGM announced that they wish to continue the SG-1 series, either as a movie, mini-series or an eleventh season on some other network, suggesting that G4 and Showtime have presented interest in such an option. However, the Sci Fi Channel is attempting to block the action, citing their contract with MGM.. On Tuesday September 26 gateworld.net released news that IGN had reported that there will not be an eleventh season but rather that there will be a series of SG-1 TV Movies, the report cites unnamed cast member .<p>On Wednesday, October 11, 2006, Brad Wright confirmed that MGM had given the greenlight to produce two direct-to-dvd films for Stargate SG-1. The first film would serve as an end to the Ori storyline, while the second would deal with <!--del_lnk--> time travel. None of the cast have signed on for the films as of yet, but they are said to be &quot;very eager&quot;.<p><a id="Fictional_universe" name="Fictional_universe"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Fictional universe</span></h2>

      <p>Developed for television by <!--del_lnk--> Jonathan Glassner and <!--del_lnk--> Brad Wright, the <!--del_lnk--> series is produced by <!--del_lnk--> MGM and filmed at <!--del_lnk--> Bridge Studios in <!--del_lnk--> Vancouver, British Columbia, <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>. The first episode was broadcast on <!--del_lnk--> July 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1997 on <!--del_lnk--> Showtime in the US and <!--del_lnk--> December 3, <!--del_lnk--> 1997 on the <!--del_lnk--> Seven Network in Australia. Showtime produced and aired the series&#39; first five seasons. Since season six, it has been produced and aired by the <!--del_lnk--> Sci Fi Channel. <i>SG-1</i> recently became the longest-running North American science fiction series on television, surpassing <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_X-Files.htm" title="The X-Files">The X-Files</a>&#39;</i> 9 seasons and 202 episodes.

      <p>The original film did not develop as much of the setting&#39;s depth as would be needed in a television series. <!--del_lnk--> MGM, which owned the rights, took Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin&#39;s product and handed the reins to a new team of creators (Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner). This new team introduced many new concepts to make the Stargate universe into a workable weekly science fiction show. Also, certain details were changed.<p>For example, in the film:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Ra&#39;s species was not named, and Ra was presented as using a sort of incorporeal &quot;possession&quot; of a human host instead of direct biological parasitism.<li>A few names were spelled differently or changed, which has been a source of in-jokes and pedanticism ever since: <ul>
         <li>Colonel Jack O&#39;Neill&#39;s name was spelled <i>O&#39;Neil</i>.<li>Colonel Jack O&#39;Neill&#39;s wife/ex-wife was named <i>Sarah</i> rather than <i>Sara</i>.<li>Colonel Jack O&#39;Neil&#39;s son was named <i>Tyler</i> rather than <i>Charlie</i>. It is possible, though, that one is in fact his middle name.<li>Dr. Jackson&#39;s wife&#39;s name was <i>Sha&#39;uri</i>, rather than <i>Sha&#39;re</i>.</ul>
       <li>A Goa&#39;uld shown briefly in the movie as humanoid instead of snakelike. It is possible, however, that this is a Goa&#39;uld still in its original host, an Unas. (The <!--del_lnk--> Unas were the Goa&#39;uld&#39;s hosts before humans).<li>Ra was the last of a dying race rather than just one of many <!--del_lnk--> Goa&#39;uld. However, this may not be an actual contradiction since it would be rather easy for the Goa&#39;uld to have repopulated in the 10,000 years since Ra discovered humanity.<li>According to the film, Abydos was located in the <!--del_lnk--> Kaliem galaxy, &quot;on the far side of the known universe&quot;, but in the series it is one of the closest Stargates to Earth, in the <!--del_lnk--> Milky Way Galaxy.<li>The Air Force base was under Creek Mountain in the film, but in the series it is <!--del_lnk--> Cheyenne Mountain.<li>The first time Daniel Jackson sees the Stargate is after he figures out the seven-coordinate address system, but in the TV episode &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Lost City&quot;, he tells <!--del_lnk--> Elizabeth Weir that &quot;I remember when we were first trying to get the Stargate to work, I would just come here, and stare at it for hours.&quot; It is possible that he&#39;s referring to the cover-stones that the seven-symbols were printed upon, which he did stare at for hours on end. Another possibility is that he was simplifying his experience, so that he could impress upon her how long he had been at the SGC. Something which Weir catches and responds with, &quot;Is that a gentle reminder that you&#39;ve been an important part of this since the very beginning?&quot;.<li>In the episode &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The Torment of Tantalus&quot;, it was clearly stated <!--del_lnk--> Catherine Langford was twenty-one in 1945, which would make her about four years old in 1928. However, she is much older in the opening sequence of the film, which is set in that year.<li>In the episode &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Children of the Gods&quot;, O&#39;Neill told General Hammond that their &quot;first clue&quot; Ra was an alien was the fact that his eyes glowed. In the film, O&#39;Neill didn&#39;t encouter Ra until after Daniel Jackson had discovered he was an alien. It is likely that O&#39;Neill was merely using a figure of speech.<li>In the film and in early episodes of Stargate SG-1 frost would form on the faces of the characters as a result of travelling through the Stargate. The reason given for this was inaccuracies in gate addresses due to stellar drift. The effect was phased out in series 1 under the explanation of re-calculating the newer gate positions and adjusting the dialing accordingly. It can sometimes be seen in later episodes when the wormhole is affected during transit.</ul>
      <p>Several of these differences were simply ignored by the TV series, but others have been addressed in various episodes of <i>Stargate SG-1</i>. For example, it was sarcastically mentioned at one point that there is another Colonel named Jack O&#39;Neil whose name is often mixed up with Jack O&#39;Neil<b>l&#39;</b>s (and who &quot;has no sense of humor&quot;). Other changes have been explained as advances in technology, such as more precise &quot;aiming&quot; by Earth&#39;s dialing computer (to compensate for the drift of the planets in 10,000 years) that prevents the frost effect. Others are most likely just oversights.<p>Because of these differences, some fans of the film consider the television series as its own separate entity, rather than a proper sequel to the film. Using some of Emmerich&#39;s notes, Bill McCay wrote a <!--del_lnk--> series of five novels continuing the story the original creators had envisioned. However, recently Dean Devlin stated that there was an interest in creating the original sequels and that the McCay books were not correct. <!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="DVD_releases" name="DVD_releases"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">DVD releases</span></h2>
