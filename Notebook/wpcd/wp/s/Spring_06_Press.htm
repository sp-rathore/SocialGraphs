Children are receiving safe shelter, food, medical care and psychological support. Over one third of the children needed specialist treatment and were moved to the SOS Children's Villages Lahore.</p><img src="../../wp/2/20657_Boy_Under_Sofa.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="Time for play in Rawalpindi" class="left" /><p><strong>Philippines</strong></p><p>A devastating landslide on the island of Leyte engulfed hundred of homes and turned the village of Guinsaugon into a sea of mud. </p><p>A rescue operation was made difficult by the mud which was metres deep in places. Fortunately, the SOS Children's Villages at Tacloban and Calbayong, in the next province, were not affected. Working with the government and local communities, we have been preparing basic supplies such as water, tinned foods and clothes. In addition SOS Social Centres will act as a base for the relief supplies to be distributed to the areas affected. Further information about The Philippines is available in the sponsorship directory.</p><img src="../../wp/4/4873_Tacloban.jpg" width="400" height="267" alt="SOS Children's Villages at Tacloban" class="right" /><p><strong>Relevant Countries:</strong> <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan_A.htm">Pakistan</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines_A.htm">Philippines</a>.</p>
