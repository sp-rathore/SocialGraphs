      <p><b>Scotch College</b> is an <!--del_lnk--> independent school for boys, situated in <!--del_lnk--> Swanbourne, <!--del_lnk--> Western Australia, <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>. The school is a member of the <!--del_lnk--> Public Schools Association (PSA) and is now a <!--del_lnk--> Uniting Church school, although it was founded in 1897 by the <!--del_lnk--> Presbyterian Church of Australia. The school in recent years has undertaken the <!--del_lnk--> International Baccalaureate&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Primary Years and <!--del_lnk--> Middle Years programmes.<p>Scotch has a large <!--del_lnk--> campus in <!--del_lnk--> Swanbourne and an outdoor education centre in <!--del_lnk--> Dwellingup. The campus in <!--del_lnk--> Swanbourne consists of a <!--del_lnk--> high school for years 8-12, a <!--del_lnk--> junior school for years Pre-Primary to Grade 7, a <!--del_lnk--> boarding house and sports grounds. The school has over 120 boarding students.<p>Scotch College describes learning as <i>&quot;more than an academic issue; it is a &#39;total picture&#39; which provides a balance between a student&#39;s intellectual, physical, emotional, relational and spiritual needs&quot;.</i> <p>

      <p><a id="Foundation" name="Foundation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Foundation</span></h3>
      <p>Scotch College owes its foundations to a conversation at a dinner party, where the parents of a 12-year-old boy, Mrs. Jane Alexander, complained that there was an absence of a Presbyterian school for boys in Perth. She offered Rev. David Ross, the minister representing the Presbyterian Church in Western Australia, &pound;500 to establish Scotch College. Alexander announced the establishment in December 1896, and when founded, the school was originally named <b>The Alexander Scotch College</b>. The Alexander Scotch College original location is now used by the <!--del_lnk--> Perth Trades Hall with the school now located in <!--del_lnk--> Swanbourne.<p>In 1905, the college became a founding school of the Public Schools Association, showing it to be by that time a well-regarded independent school, and entitling it to take part in the most competitive schoolboy sporting competitions in Western Australia.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, 475 boys enlisted to defend the empire as part of the <!--del_lnk--> Allied forces. This number represented over 50% of all Scotch alumni at the time. A roll of honour is present in Collegians House, the administration building, featuring the names of all past Scotch College students who had volunteered to fight.<p>In 1939, the Head Masters&#39; Conference approached the Commonwealth Government for financial assistance due to low staff salaries, the standard of the school&#39;s science facilities and the lack of money the school possessed. When gifts of money to the school became tax-deductible in 1954 (provided donations were for the purpose of either repaying debt on buildings or helping to fund new building projects), people found they had more incentive to donate to schools. This led to Scotch, among other schools around Australia, beginning fund-raising appeals within the school community.<p><a id="Post_War" name="Post_War"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Post War</span></h3>
      <p>Even before donations were made tax-deductible, an appeal to fund an old-boys memorial for those who served in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> raised &pound;9,000 by 1950. When the school&#39;s council, the town in which Scotch resides in, inquired about the cost for a memorial hall to sit 650 people, they were shocked to discover it would cost around &pound;30,000. A <!--del_lnk--> fete organized in 1953 raised &pound;2,500. Another fete was arranged and appeals to both old-boys and parents raised the total raised to &pound;17,500. Despite lack of funds, David Brisbane, a council member since 1945, laid the foundation stone for the hall in early 1957. Although donations to schools over &pound;1 had been tax-deductible since 1954, it was not until January 1957 that the Taxation Department informed the school that all donations towards the new Scotch College Building Fund would be tax-deductible. The appeal committee launched a major appeal raising &pound;23,000 for the Memorial Hall.<p>The Memorial Hall was opened by Sir <!--del_lnk--> Charles Gairdner, <!--del_lnk--> Governor of Western Australia at the time, on October 19, 1957, the same year as the school&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Diamond Jubilee. The opening led to a further &pound;30,000 in promised donations, although the actual amount received was below this figure. Eventually the cost of the hall led to the school having to be provided a &pound;25,000 overdraft from the <!--del_lnk--> ASB Bank; this lead to an increase in school fees. The total cost of the Memorial Hall was &pound;48,864 and the appeal raised &pound;45,700. Gordon Gooch, who has a sports pavilion at the school named after him, met the shortfall.<p><a name="1970_to_1990"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1970 to 1990</span></h3>
      <p>In 1971, after observing the <!--del_lnk--> May 1968 French riots, a group of year 12 boys organised a &quot;schoolboy strike&quot; on the regulations of hair length, after the issue had been simmering for several months. The strike involved 60 boys refusing to return to class after the lunch bell, despite threat of expulsion, which led the headmaster to arrange an assembly for all boys after losing his temper. The ringleader of the strike, Cary Kallis informed the <!--del_lnk--> Nine Network newsroom to announce the strike. However, Kallis informed several students which led to news of the strike quickly spreading around the school. After being threatened by a teacher with expulsion, Kallis quickly called Channel 9 again, pretending to be a teacher, by say &quot;The strike has been cancelled and the boys have been disciplined&quot;. As mentioned above, the strike still went ahead. <p>In 1984, Scotch acquired <i>Moray</i>, the school&#39;s new outdoor education centre where students would be able to attend camps. This was purchased after the school had considered, for over a decade, the possibility of acquiring a site for a school camp. The Parents&#39; Association gave support to the project and the school purchased the 164-acre property through a mortgagee sale for $220,000. It was named <!--del_lnk--> Moray after a province in <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> where Clan Murray originated (the Moray camp site is adjacent to the <a href="../../wp/m/Murray_River.htm" title="Murray River">Murray River</a>). <p>The Scotch College foundation was established in 1986 when Judge Robert Keall was chairman of the college. The foundation raised $1.1 million within six months to partly fund a new Physical Education Centre. Robert Keall opened the $2.25 million centre on <!--del_lnk--> March 29, <!--del_lnk--> 1988.<p><a id="Recent_Years" name="Recent_Years"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Recent Years</span></h3>
      <p>The school recently announced plans to construct a new hall for assemblies and other functions. This joins other new plans such as the redesign of the Arts and Technology classrooms and a new sporting oval. Building started in March 2006 and is scheduled to finish in 2007. The main new building will be a new hall, named the Dickinson Centre, after Scotch&#39;s previous headmaster, the late WR Dickinson. On <!--del_lnk--> February 20, 2006, Headmaster Revd Andrew Syme, announced that college was in negotiation with a builder about the final price. Construction started on Friday <!--del_lnk--> March 3, 2006, which was the first day of the Labour long weekend.<p>Over the Labour long weekend the college hosted the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Pride Children&#39;s Choir from <a href="../../wp/t/Tanzania.htm" title="Tanzania">Tanzania</a> in the boarding house and on <!--del_lnk--> March 7, 2006, the choir performed to the year 10s and several other classes. The Choir continued to perform at <!--del_lnk--> WOMADelaide and then at the <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth Games Cultural Festival.<p>A memorial service was held for the late WR Dickinson, the 5th headmaster of Scotch College, at 3pm on Wednesday the 10th of May, 2006. A pavilion was erected on the Scotch playing fields, and the School and Pipeband formed a guard of honour for the Dickinson family members and the funeral cortege as they arrived. <p><a name=".22Strippergate.22"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Curriculum</span></h2>
      <p>Scotch offers a wide range of subjects in its academic curriculum. All students in years 8-10 study one language other than English &mdash; either <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a> or <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesian_language.htm" title="Indonesian language">Indonesian</a> &mdash; through the International Baccalaureate&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Middle Years Programme (MYP). The MYP also requires students in years 9 and 10 to do a year-long personal project. For this project, boys can choose a topic of their choice, provided that the topic relates to the <!--del_lnk--> Areas of Interaction.<p>Scotch awards several scholarships based on academic merit to students, but under agreed PSA rules no member schools may award sports scholarships. Entrance scholarships at Scotch are based on the results of scholarship <!--del_lnk--> examinations. In year 11 there is a scholarship open to boy of former alumni (P.C. Anderson Memorial Old Boy&#39;s Scholarship). To be considered boys must have several references and sit an interview.<p>The Gordon Gooch Entrance Scholarship can be sat by any boy entering year 8. The John A. Gooch Scholarship is similar to the Gordon Gooch Entrance Scholarship, but can only be sat by boys entering the senior school directly from the junior school.<p>Students entering year 8 in 2006 are eligible for one of several music scholarships. Students entering will need to be playing at a high level as the scholarship is selected through auditions. It also takes into account the results of his most recent music examination. This includes the results in both the theory and practical section.<p><a id="Middle_school_structure" name="Middle_school_structure"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Middle school structure</span></h3>
      <p>In 2003, the school changed the years 8 through to 10 learning structure after the school became an International Baccalaureate certified school. Students in these years study two languages, a <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">maths</a>, a <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">science</a>, an arts, a technology, a humanities and <!--del_lnk--> Physical Education subject.<div class="thumb tright">

      </div>
      <p>Students in Years 9 and 10 have the option of choosing which <a href="../../wp/t/Technology.htm" title="Technology">technology</a> and <a href="../../wp/v/Visual_arts.htm" title="Visual arts">arts</a> classes they take for either the year or semester. There are two art classes; 2D and 3D art. The former comprises drawing and painting; the latter, pottery and other sculpture art. Drama is another class identified as an art by the MYP, and students learn many techniques, including improvisation and comedy. Music is also an art class and students can create their own music on computer programs like Super Duper Music Looper.<p>For technology classes there are several options. In metal work, boys will build many different metallic objects, including <a href="../../wp/c/Cricket.htm" title="Cricket">cricket</a> stumps. Wood work has boys making objects out of wood. In recent years boys have made tiny <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">CO<sub>2</sub></a> powered <!--del_lnk--> dragsters. The &#39;understanding technology&#39; class is popular, as students create electronics and dancing robots. In recent years, the technology department has talked about wanting students to create a <!--del_lnk--> solar powered car. The main reason this has not been undertaken is because of cost. Information Systems and <!--del_lnk--> 3D modelling are two different subjects. Boys are taught in the <a href="../../wp/c/Computer.htm" title="Computer">computer</a> lab and use the computers to create architectural designs and databases.<p>In year 10, students have the option of doing media studies and/or business and enterprise. Media studies has boys create their own movie and critically analyse feature films in the form of essays. In business and enterprise, students will create their own share portfolio on the <!--del_lnk--> Australian Stock Exchange website. This is an imaginary game however and no real money is involved.<p>In years 9 and 10, boys do a personal project, as part of their <!--del_lnk--> MYP education. This starts midway through year 9 and finishes a year later, midway through year 10. One year, a boy raised over $100,000 for his personal project and donated it to the local <!--del_lnk--> women&#39;s refuge. However, parents and boys have been very critical of the personal project as boys are required to hold meetings discussing their progress during class time. They are also critical of the fact that only the <!--del_lnk--> essay at the end of the project is marked, not the project itself.<p>A similar structure was introduced to the junior school when they joined the IB <!--del_lnk--> Primary Years Programme, becoming the only school in the <!--del_lnk--> Western Australia certified to teach the programme.<p><a id="Senior_school_curriculum" name="Senior_school_curriculum"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Senior school curriculum</span></h3>
      <p>As Scotch does not offer the <!--del_lnk--> IB Diploma Programme to senior students, students in Years 11 and 12 have the option of undertaking either <!--del_lnk--> Tertiary Entrance Exam subjects or wholly School-assessed subjects; students select these subjects in Year 10. Many choose to sit the <!--del_lnk--> Tertiary Entrance Exam so they can attend university to further their education. The top student for each subject is awarded a prize on speech night, and the Year 12 student who finishes top of their year is awarded <i>Dux</i>.<p>Every two years, the school has a tour to France for French language students in Years 11 and 12. These tours run for around two weeks and allow boys to stay with a French family, giving them the chance to experience native French.<p>Scotch students have been consistently gaining high marks in their TEE exams. This was continued in 2004 with two students awarded <!--del_lnk--> General Exhibitions as well as three boys receiving <!--del_lnk--> Certificates of Distinction. A further eleven boys were awarded <!--del_lnk--> Certificates of Excellence. A total of ten Scotch boys were given <!--del_lnk--> Tertiary Entrance Ranks (TERs) of 99 or above and 29 boys received TERs of 95 or above.<p>In 2005, Scotch graduate Adrian Khoo received the <!--del_lnk--> Beazley Medal, awarded to top student in the state, for his TEE results. As in 2004, two students were awarded <!--del_lnk--> General Exhibitions. <!--del_lnk--> Subject Exhibitions were awarded to three students for 5 overall subjects. Eleven boys received <!--del_lnk--> Certificates of Excellence and six boys were awarded <!--del_lnk--> Certificates of Distinction for 11 subjects overall. A total of nine TERs above 99 were received while 30 boys received a TER of 95 or higher.<p><a id="Novell_computer_system" name="Novell_computer_system"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Novell computer system</span></h3>
      <p>Scotch College has not followed the trend among other Australian independent schools of making laptops compulsory for students. The school has an intranet which is available on any computer with internet access; the login page is located on the Scotch website. Students are able to use email, store files and view assignments using the intranet, as each student and teacher has their own individual account to access the intranet site. The computers run on <a href="../../wp/w/Windows_XP.htm" title="Windows XP">Windows XP</a> and use a <!--del_lnk--> Novell client.<p>Over the 2005-06 summer vacation, the intranet was upgraded. The upgrade included changing the layout of the intranet to a more visually <!--del_lnk--> aesthetic design and making page links more prominent on the page. <!--del_lnk--> Novell GroupWise, the school email system, was also upgraded during the same period. Like the intranet, GroupWise is now also more aesthetic to the eye. Teachers also have their own email and intranet accounts. The system is sometimes referred to as the &quot;portal&quot;.<p><a id="Scotch_student_life" name="Scotch_student_life"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Scotch student life</span></h2>
      <p>Scotch offers a comprehensive extra-curricular activities program for students. The school also has boarding facilities for students who live in rural areas of <!--del_lnk--> Western Australia, as well as international students. The major components of the program are sport, music and the Arts. Students in years 10-12 may participate in <!--del_lnk--> FESA Cadet programs.<p><a id="Boarding" name="Boarding"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Boarding</span></h3>
      <p>All boarding students are members of Keys House, one of the ten houses at Scotch. All of the boarders live in residential houses, including the new Keys House block, which was finished in 2001, with their house head, who lives on site. Boarders&#39; meals are served in the Dining hall, which is in close proximity to all boarding facilities. Boarders also have 24 hour access to medical services. In 2006, international students were required to pay an extra $5,700 in lieu of <i>Government Subsidies and extra administration costs</i>. <p>On weekends boarders will often do a variety of activities that staff arrange. They also use the nearby <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Ocean.htm" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> as well as <!--del_lnk--> Challenge Stadium and <!--del_lnk--> Subiaco Oval. Boarders in years 10, 11 and 12 will also participate in sport on a Saturday morning.<p>A boarding tradition at Scotch is walking the entire <!--del_lnk--> Bibbulmun Track. Boys walk sections of the track each year. This is not a compulsory event, however. In 2005, the year 12 boarders gave a presentation about the walk. The Archbishop of Perth was present and gave a memorable speech, which included the line &quot;Trenton Warburton [the Year 12 who recently completed track] and I had a good blow on the beach together&quot;. He was talking about <!--del_lnk--> bagpipes.<p><a id="Moray" name="Moray"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Moray</span></h3>
      <p>In the junior school and years 8 and 9 in the senior school, students will camp for several days, depending on their age, at Moray near <!--del_lnk--> Dwellingup. Moray, close to the <a href="../../wp/m/Murray_River.htm" title="Murray River">Murray River</a>, is set in Australian bush. Moray allows students to camp either outside, under swags, or inside cabins. Students here will learn about safety, the ecosystems and how native Aborigines lived in the area. They will also learn how to be more independent by cooking their own food and setting up their own swag. Students will also do activities on the Murray River such as kayaking or canoeing, climbing an outdoor rock wall, climbing a telephone pole, and doing a suspended ropes course.<p>The Cadets also use Moray for a weekend camp. The cadets do activities design to improve self confidence like the rock wall or the <!--del_lnk--> leap of faith were cadets jump from a telephone pole and try and grab a plastic wire. They are suspended from falling use a wire. One night over the weekend the cadets do a &quot;night stalker&quot; game where the senior cadets try and prevent the junior cadets from reaching a certain point. The seniors use torches to try and identify cadets.<p><a id="House_System" name="House_System"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">House System</span></h3>
      <p>The pastoral care system is based on a House structure which deals with all matters relating to a student&#39;s well-being or curriculum needs. Each student is placed in a House Tutorial Group that is overseen by a House Tutor for each of the 10 Houses. Most House Tutorial Groups have three students from each year level in that house. A House contains students from Years 8 to 12. Each House is led by one Head of House. The members of each House are led by House Captains and Co-Vice Captains. The Houses meet on a regular basis.<p>The House Tutor and Heads of House work as a team to monitor the academic and personal progress of each student in the House Tutorial Group and House.

      <p>Scotch College, like most <!--del_lnk--> Australian independent <!--del_lnk--> schools, requires <!--del_lnk--> students to wear full <!--del_lnk--> school uniform at all times. There are currently two school uniforms - a summer and a winter.<p>In summer, a <!--del_lnk--> khaki collared short-sleeved shirt is worn with light green shorts, house tie, green Scotch socks and black lace-up shoes. On the left breast pocket, above the school badge, a house braid is worn. In the junior school a Scotch coloured braid is worn whilst in Years 8 to 11 the braid is their house colour; Year 12 students wear both braids.<p>In winter a white long-sleeved collared shirt is worn, along with house tie, black belt, grey trousers, grey socks, black lace up shoes and a maroon <!--del_lnk--> blazer.
