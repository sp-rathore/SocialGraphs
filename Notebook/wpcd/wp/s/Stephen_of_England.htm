      <p>Stephen was born at <!--del_lnk--> Blois in <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, the son of <!--del_lnk--> Stephen, <!--del_lnk--> Count of Blois, and <!--del_lnk--> Adela (daughter of <a href="../../wp/w/William_I_of_England.htm" title="William I of England">William the Conqueror</a>). His brothers were Count <!--del_lnk--> Theobald II of Champagne and <!--del_lnk--> Henry of Blois, <!--del_lnk--> bishop of Winchester.<p>Stephen was sent to be reared at the English court of his uncle, King <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_I_of_England.htm" title="Henry I of England">Henry I</a>, in <!--del_lnk--> 1106. He became <!--del_lnk--> Count of Mortain in about <!--del_lnk--> 1115, and married <a href="../../wp/m/Matilda_of_Boulogne.htm" title="Matilda of Boulogne">Matilda</a>, daughter of the <!--del_lnk--> Count of Boulogne, in about <!--del_lnk--> 1125, who shortly after became Countess of Boulogne. Stephen became joint ruler in <!--del_lnk--> 1128. In <!--del_lnk--> 1150 he ceased to co-rule, and in <!--del_lnk--> 1151, the County was given to his son, <!--del_lnk--> Eustace IV. When Eustace died childless, Stephen&#39;s next living son, <!--del_lnk--> William inherited the territory.<p><a id="Seizes_throne_of_England" name="Seizes_throne_of_England"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Seizes throne of England</span></h2>
      <p>Before the death of King <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_I_of_England.htm" title="Henry I of England">Henry I of England</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1135, the majority of the barons of England swore to support Henry&#39;s daughter (<!--del_lnk--> Empress Matilda, granddaughter of William the Conqueror), and her claim to the throne. However, Stephen (also a grandchild of The Conqueror through his mother and who had been raised at Henry&#39;s court) laid claim to the throne. He also claimed his uncle, King Henry, had changed his mind on his deathbed, and named Stephen as his heir. Once Stephen was crowned, he gained the support of the majority of the barons as well as <!--del_lnk--> Pope Innocent II. The first few years of his reign were peaceful, but by <!--del_lnk--> 1139 he was seen as weak and indecisive, setting the country up for a <!--del_lnk--> civil war, commonly called <a href="../../wp/t/The_Anarchy.htm" title="The Anarchy">The Anarchy</a>.<p>Stephen had many traits that made him seem superficially fit for kingship: his high birth, his descent from the Conqueror, his handsomeness, his bravery and his good nature. But he possessed none of the ruthlessness necessary for the ruthless times he lived in. An unfavourable thumbnail sketch of him is given by <!--del_lnk--> Walter Map (who wrote during the reign of Matilda&#39;s son Henry II): &quot;A man of a certain age, remarkably hard-working but otherwise a nonentity [<i>idiota</i>] or perhaps rather inclined to evil.&quot;<p>The reign of Stephen was indeed a turbulent period, to some degree an overflow of struggles for supremacy amongst barons in Normandy. But he retained the support of the majority of English barons throughout his reign and, importantly, the citizens of London. Contemporary records are slight, being mainly in the form of charters which are often difficult to date precisely, and, more significantly, chronicles whose authors were, in most cases, directly or indirectly at the behest of Robert of Gloucester, the principal rebel. It was these who presented <!--del_lnk--> Bishop Henry of Winchester as an opponent of his brother Stephen; but since the kingship of Stephen was supported by Innocent II, and Henry was Papal Legate, some scepticism is appropriate. A reassessment of the reign is due but far from easy.<p><a id="War_with_Matilda" name="War_with_Matilda"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">War with Matilda</span></h2>
      <p>Stephen faced the forces of <!--del_lnk--> Empress Matilda at several locations including the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Lincoln and the Battle of <!--del_lnk--> Beverston Castle. Bad omens haunted him before the Battle of Lincoln (<!--del_lnk--> 2 February <!--del_lnk--> 1141). Stephen was facing his rebellious barons <!--del_lnk--> Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester (the Empress&#39; illegitimate half-brother) and Ranulph, the <!--del_lnk--> Earl of Chester. He fought so bravely in the battle that his battle-axe shattered. He drew a sword and continued fighting until it broke as well, as he was captured by a knight named William de Cahaignes (a relative of Ranulph, ancestor of the <!--del_lnk--> Keynes family including <a href="../../wp/j/John_Maynard_Keynes.htm" title="John Maynard Keynes">John Maynard Keynes</a>, the well known economist). Stephen was defeated and he was brought before his cousin, the <!--del_lnk--> Empress Matilda.<table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="background: #FFFFFF; border: 1px solid #8888AA; border-collapse: collapse; float: right; font-size: 95%; margin: 0px 0px 8px 8px; padding: none; text-align: left; vertical-align: top; width: 240px;">

      <p>Stephen was imprisoned at <a href="../../wp/b/Bristol.htm" title="Bristol">Bristol</a>, but his wife, the Countess Matilda, kept faith, and the Empress was soon forced out of <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>. With the capture of her most able lieutenant, the Earl of Gloucester, Matilda was eventually obliged to release Stephen from captivity, and he was restored to the throne in November of the same year. In December <!--del_lnk--> 1142, the Empress was besieged at <a href="../../wp/o/Oxford.htm" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>, but she managed to escape across the snow to <!--del_lnk--> Wallingford Castle, held by her supporter <!--del_lnk--> Brien FitzCount.<p>In 1147, Empress Matilda&#39;s adolescent son, <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_II_of_England.htm" title="Henry II of England">Henry</a> (the eventual King Henry II), decided to assist in the war effort by raising a small army of mercenaries and invading England. Rumours of this army&#39;s size terrified Stephen&#39;s retainers, although in truth the force was very small. Having been defeated twice in battle, and with no money to pay his mercenaries, the young Henry appealed to his uncle <!--del_lnk--> Robert for aid but was turned away. Desperately, and in secret, the boy then asked Stephen for help. According to the <!--del_lnk--> Gesta Stephani, &quot;<i>On receiving the message, the king...hearkened to the young man...</i>&quot; and bestowed upon him money and other support.<p><a id="Recognises_Henry_as_his_heir_and_dies" name="Recognises_Henry_as_his_heir_and_dies"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Recognises Henry as his heir and dies</span></h2>
      <p>Stephen maintained his precarious hold on the throne for the remainder of his lifetime. However, after a military standoff at <!--del_lnk--> Wallingford with Henry, and following the death of his son and heir, <!--del_lnk--> Eustace, in <!--del_lnk--> 1153, he was persuaded to reach a compromise with Empress Matilda (known as the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Wallingford or Winchester), whereby her son would succeed Stephen on the English throne as King Henry II.<p>Stephen died in <!--del_lnk--> Dover, at <!--del_lnk--> Dover Priory, and was buried in <!--del_lnk--> Faversham Abbey, which he had founded with Countess Matilda in <!--del_lnk--> 1147.<p>Besides Eustace, Stephen and Matilda had two other sons, Baldwin (d. before <!--del_lnk--> 1135), and <!--del_lnk--> William of Blois (Count of <!--del_lnk--> Mortain and Boulogne, and <!--del_lnk--> Earl of Surrey or Warenne). They also had two daughters, Matilda and <!--del_lnk--> Marie of Boulogne. In addition to these children, Stephen fathered at least three <!--del_lnk--> illegitimate children, one of whom, Gervase, became Abbot of Westminster.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (the <a href="../../wp/p/Peterborough_Chronicle.htm" title="Peterborough Chronicle">Peterborough Chronicle</a>, second continuation) provides a moving and succinct appraisal of Stephen&#39;s reign:<dl>
       <dd><i>&quot;In the days of this King there was nothing but strife, evil, and robbery, for quickly the great men who were traitors rose against him. When the traitors saw that Stephen was a good-humoured, kindly, and easy-going man who inflicted no punishment, then they committed all manner of horrible crimes . . . And so it lasted for nineteen years while Stephen was King, till the land was all undone and darkened with such deeds, and men said openly that Christ and his angels slept&quot;.</i></dl>
      <p>The monastic author said, of The Anarchy, &quot;this and more we suffered nineteen winters for our sins.&quot;<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_of_England&quot;</div>
