<h2>Gordon Strachan and Celtic FC join SOS Children</h2><p><strong>01/12/2005</strong></p>
<body>
<p>
<b>Celtic Football Club</b> has pledged its support for "6 villages for 2006", the joint charity campaign of FIFA and SOS Children's Villages. 
</p>

<p>
During the build up to the next World Cup, Celtic will help raise funds needed for the building of a children's village in Rustenburg, South Africa - one of six new children's villages which will be constructed under "6 villages for 2006", the official charity campaign of the 2006 World Cup.
</p>

<p>
<b>Gordon Strachan</b>, manager of Celtic, has agreed to become the official "FIFA for SOS Children's Villages" Ambassador for Scotland and will be leading Celtic's campaign efforts. <b>Strachan</b> commented
“I am very honoured and proud to be asked to be the FIFA/SOS Children’s Ambassador for Scotland.  I will be delighted to offer whatever help I can either as a figurehead or in a practical way.”
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter Lawwell</b>, Chief Executive added “Celtic is proud to work with FIFA and SOS Children on this campaign and believes that this work is fully in line with the rich charitable history of Celtic FC.”
</p>

<p>
Strachan will line up alongside some 60 current and former footballers already serving as "FIFA for SOS Children's Villages" Ambassadors, including <b>Andriy Shevchenko, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Wayne Rooney, George Weah, Jay Jay Okocha, Lucas Radebe, Hugo Sánchez, Robert Pirès</b> and many more. 
</p>

<p><b>FIFA President Joseph S. Blatter </b> spoke enthusiastically of the new 'signings': "We are sure that Celtic FC, with its rich history and strong charitable tradition, and Gordon Strachan, a distinguished Scottish international, will be excellent ambassadors for the "6 villages for 2006" campaign and lead the way within the global football family to help improve the lives of needy children around the world."
</p>

<p>
Mary Cockcroft, chair of the board of trustees of <b>SOS Children</b> commented, “My earliest memories are of being taken by my father to Celtic Park and of a meeting with Jock Stein, so I am absolutely delighted that Celtic and Gordon Strachan have chosen to support our work for some of the world’s neediest children”.
