<img src="../../wp/8/852_Boys_Playing_At_SL_Vientiane_Laos.jpg" width="332" height="500" alt="SOS Children helping children in need in Laos" class="right" /><p><strong>On the run for SOS</strong></p><p>This year's Flora London Marathon on Sunday 23 April 2006 sees two runners taking part for SOS Children and raising funds for our worldwide work including Laos. We wish Kelly Edwards and Lynne Barnes the best of luck!  </p><p>Anyone with their own place in the London Marathon looking for a charity to support please consider SOS Children. </p><p>If you've missed out on the Marathon have you thought about doing something different? Why not sign up for the British 10km London run or the London triathlon? Call SOS Children now to reserve your place. (Some of the SOS team are taking part and they need moral support!) </p><p><strong>Great Scottish Walk- Sunday 18 June</strong></p><p>The Great Scottish Walk in Edinburgh, Scotland, is a fun family day out. As Scotland's premiere fund-raising walk event, it combines the fun exercise of walking with the opportunity of raising money for your favourite charity - SOS Children. </p><p>Since its inception in 1998, the walks have raised over &pound;5 million for charity. There are three walks on the Sunday 18 June 2006 around Edinburgh - over distances of 1.6 and 12 miles. The walks are aimed at getting everyone involved as either teams or individuals, whether young or old, disabled or those just trying to embrace a healthier lifestyle! Leading up to the big day itself there are also 4 Wee Walks aimed at primary aged school children in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Perth and Aberdeen For more information visit about how to sign up for the Great Scottish Walk in support of SOS Children, visit: www.greatscottishwalk.com </p><p>If you or your running club would like more details about how you can take part in events including the British 10K run or the Great Scottish Walk, for SOS Children call Caroline on 01223 365589 or email <a href="mailto:caroline@soschildren.org">caroline@soschildren.org</a> to reserve your place today! </p><p><strong>Could you be a face for SOS Children in your community?</strong></p><p>We are currently looking for Voluntary Regional Coordinators from across the UK who would be able to use their local contacts to meet with schools, companies, community groups in their area to introduce and highlight the work of SOS Children. Could you encourage people to take part in challenge events, such as sky dives and marathons, recruit child and village sponsors or even organise fundraising events from charity dinners to sponsored head-shaves! </p><p>If you or anyone you know would be interested please contact Bec Cork on 01223 365589 or email <a href="mailto:bec@soschildren.org">bec@soschildren.org</a></p>
