It is the least populous state in India, and the third smallest in area after <a href="../../wp/d/Delhi.htm" title="Delhi">Delhi</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/Goa.htm" title="Goa">Goa</a>. Sikkim was an independent state ruled by the <!--del_lnk--> Namgyal <a href="../../wp/m/Monarchy.htm" title="Monarchy">monarchy</a> until 1975, when a referendum was held and the population voted to join India as its twenty-second state.

The Indian state of <!--del_lnk--> West Bengal borders Sikkim to its south. The official languages are English, <!--del_lnk--> Bhutia, <!--del_lnk--> Nepali, <!--del_lnk--> Lepcha, and <!--del_lnk--> Limbu and <a href="../../wp/h/Hindi.htm" title="Hindi">Hindi</a>. It must be noted though that almost all written transactions are in English.

      <p>The earliest recorded event related to Sikkim is the passage of the Buddhist saint <!--del_lnk--> Guru Rinpoche through the land in the 8th century. The Guru is reported to have blessed the land, introduced <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> to Sikkim, and foretold the era of monarchy in the state that would arrive centuries later. In the 14th century, according to legend, <!--del_lnk--> Khye Bumsa, a prince from the <!--del_lnk--> Minyak House in <!--del_lnk--> Kham in Eastern <a href="../../wp/t/Tibet.htm" title="Tibet">Tibet</a>, had a divine revelation one night instructing him to travel south to seek his fortunes. His descendants were later to form the royal family of Sikkim. In 1642, the fifth generation descendant of Khye Bumsa, <!--del_lnk--> Phuntsog Namgyal, was consecrated as the first <!--del_lnk--> Chogyal (king) of Sikkim by the three venerated Lamas who came from the north, west and south to <!--del_lnk--> Yuksom, marking the beginning of the monarchy.<p>Phuntsog Namgyal was succeeded in 1670 by his son, <!--del_lnk--> Tensung Namgyal, who moved the capital from Yuksom to <!--del_lnk--> Rabdentse. In 1700, Sikkim was invaded by the <a href="../../wp/b/Bhutan.htm" title="Bhutan">Bhutanese</a> with the help of the half-sister of the Chogyal, who had been denied the throne. The Bhutanese were driven away by the Tibetans, who restored the throne to the Chogyal ten years later. Between 1717 and 1733, the kingdom faced many raids by the Nepalese in the west and Bhutanese in the east, culminating with the destruction of the capital Rabdentse by the Nepalese.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In 1791, China sent troops to support Sikkim and defend <a href="../../wp/t/Tibet.htm" title="Tibet">Tibet</a> against the <!--del_lnk--> Gurkhas. Following Nepal&#39;s subsequent defeat, Sikkim became a <!--del_lnk--> suzerainty of <a href="../../wp/q/Qing_Dynasty.htm" title="Qing Dynasty">Qing Dynasty</a>. But Nepal still gained a big piece of land at west of <!--del_lnk--> Teesta.<p>Following the arrival of the <!--del_lnk--> British Raj in neighbouring India, Sikkim allied with them against their common enemy, Nepal. The Nepalese attacked Sikkim, overrunning most of the region including the <!--del_lnk--> Terai. This prompted the <a href="../../wp/b/British_East_India_Company.htm" title="British East India Company">British East India Company</a> to attack Nepal, resulting in <!--del_lnk--> the Gurkha War of 1814. Treaties signed between Sikkim and Nepal &mdash; the <!--del_lnk--> Sugauli Treaty &mdash; and Sikkim and British India &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> Titalia Treaty &mdash; returned the territory annexed by the Nepalese to Sikkim in 1817. Ties between Sikkim and the British administrators of India grew sour, however, with the beginning of British taxation of the <!--del_lnk--> Morang region. In 1849 two British <!--del_lnk--> doctors, Sir <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Dalton Hooker and Dr. <!--del_lnk--> Archibald Campbell, the latter being in charge of relations between the British and Sikkim Government, ventured into the mountains of Sikkim unannounced and unauthorised. The doctors were detained by the Sikkim government, leading to a punitive British expedition against the Himalayan kingdom, after which the <!--del_lnk--> Darjeeling district and Morang were annexed to India in 1835. The invasion led to the chogyal&#39;s becoming a puppet king under the directive of the British governor.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In 1947, a popular vote rejected Sikkim&#39;s joining the Indian Union and <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> Jawaharlal Nehru agreed to a special <!--del_lnk--> protectorate status for Sikkim. After a period of unrest in 1972-1973, matters came to a head in 1975, when the <!--del_lnk--> Kazi (Prime Minister) appealed to the <!--del_lnk--> Indian Parliament for representation and change of Sikkim&#39;s status to a state of India. A <!--del_lnk--> referendum was held in which 97.5% of the people voted to join the Indian Union. A few weeks later on <!--del_lnk--> May 16, <!--del_lnk--> 1975, Sikkim officially became the 22nd state of the Indian Union, and monarchy was abolished. Some still feel that Sikkim is occupied by India, particularly people around the former Royal Family.<p>In 2000, in a major embarrassment for China, the seventeenth <!--del_lnk--> Karmapa <!--del_lnk--> Urgyen Trinley Dorje, who had been proclaimed a Lama by China, made a dramatic escape from Tibet to the <!--del_lnk--> Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim. Chinese officials were in a quandary on this issue as any protests to India on the issue would mean an explicit endorsment of India&#39;s governance of Sikkim, which the Chinese still regarded as an independent state occupied by India. China eventually recognised Sikkim as an Indian state in 2003, which led to a thaw in <!--del_lnk--> Sino-Indian relations. In return, India announced its official recognition of <a href="../../wp/t/Tibet.htm" title="Tibet">Tibet</a> as an integrated part of China. As part of a significant pact between India and China signed by the prime ministers of the two countries, <!--del_lnk--> Manmohan Singh and <!--del_lnk--> Wen Jiabao, China released an official map clearly showing Sikkim as part of the Republic of India. On <!--del_lnk--> July 6, <!--del_lnk--> 2006 the Himalayan pass of <!--del_lnk--> Nathula was opened to cross-border trade, a further evidence of improving sentiment over the region.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>The thumb-shaped state of Sikkim is characterised by wholly mountainous terrain. Almost the entire state is hilly, with the elevation ranging from 280&nbsp;metres (920&nbsp;feet) to 8,585&nbsp;metres (28,000&nbsp;feet). The summit of the <!--del_lnk--> Kanchenjunga is the highest point. For the most part, the land is unfit for <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a> because of the precipitous and rocky slopes. However, certain hill slopes have been converted into farm lands using terrace farming techniques and is used for cultivation. Numerous snow-fed streams in Sikkim have carved out river valleys in the west and south of the state. These streams combine into the <!--del_lnk--> Teesta and its tributary, the <!--del_lnk--> Rangeet. The Teesta, described as the &quot;lifeline of Sikkim&quot;, flows through the state from north to south. About a third of the land is heavily forested.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p><a id="Geology" name="Geology"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Geology</span></h3>
      <p>The hills of Sikkim mainly consist of <!--del_lnk--> gneissose and <!--del_lnk--> half-schistose rocks, making their soil brown clay, and generally poor and shallow. The soil is coarse, with large amounts of <!--del_lnk--> iron oxide concentrations, ranging from neutral to <!--del_lnk--> acidic and has poor organic and mineral nutrients. This type of soil tends to support evergreen and deciduous forests.<p>A large portion of the Sikkim territory is covered by the <a href="../../wp/p/Precambrian.htm" title="Precambrian">Precambrian</a> rock and is much younger in age than the hills. The rock consists of <!--del_lnk--> phyllites and <!--del_lnk--> schists and therefore the slopes are highly susceptible to <!--del_lnk--> weathering and prone to <!--del_lnk--> erosion. This, combined with the intense rain, causes extensive <!--del_lnk--> soil erosion and heavy loss of soil nutrients through <!--del_lnk--> leaching. As a result, <!--del_lnk--> landslides are frequent, isolating the numerous small towns and villages from the major urban centres.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>
      <p>The climate ranges from <!--del_lnk--> sub-tropical in the south to <!--del_lnk--> tundra in the northern parts. Most of the inhabited regions of Sikkim, however, enjoy a <a href="../../wp/t/Temperate.htm" title="Temperate">temperate</a> climate, with the temperatures seldom exceeding 28&nbsp;&deg;<!--del_lnk--> C (82&nbsp;&deg;<!--del_lnk--> F) in summer or dropping below 0&nbsp;&deg;C (32&nbsp;&deg;F) in winter.

The average annual temperature for most of Sikkim is around 18&nbsp;&deg;C (64&nbsp;&deg;F). Sikkim is one of the few states in India to receive regular <a href="../../wp/s/Snow.htm" title="Snow">snowfall</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> snow line is around 6,000&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> metres (19,600&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> feet).<p>During the monsoon months, the state is lashed by heavy rains that increase the number of landslides. The state record for the longest period of non-stop rain is eleven days. In the northern region, because of high altitude, temperatures drop below &minus;40&nbsp;&deg;C in winter. <!--del_lnk--> Fog also affects many parts of the state during winter and the monsoons, making transportation extremely perilous.<p><a id="Sub-divisions" name="Sub-divisions"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Sub-divisions</span></h3>

The <!--del_lnk--> Indian army has control of a large territory, as the state is a sensitive border area. Many areas are restricted and permits are needed to visit them. There are a total of eight towns and nine sub-divisions in Sikkim.<p>The four districts are <!--del_lnk--> East Sikkim, <!--del_lnk--> West Sikkim, <!--del_lnk--> North Sikkim and <!--del_lnk--> South Sikkim. The district capitals are Gangtok, <!--del_lnk--> Geyzing, <!--del_lnk--> Mangan and <!--del_lnk--> Namchi respectively. These Four Districts are further divided into Sub-Divisions. &quot;Pakyong&quot; is the sub-division of East District. &quot;Soreng&quot; is the sub-division of West District. &quot;Chungthang&quot; is the sub-division of North District. &quot;Ravongla&quot; is the sub-division of South District.<p><a id="Flora_and_fauna" name="Flora_and_fauna"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Flora and fauna</span></h3>

      <p>Sikkim is situated in an <!--del_lnk--> ecological hotspot of the lower Himalayas, one of only three among the <!--del_lnk--> Ecoregions of India. The forested regions of the state exhibit a diverse range of <!--del_lnk--> fauna and <!--del_lnk--> flora.

      <p>Sikkim&#39;s gross state domestic product for 2004 is estimated at $478 million in current prices.<p>Sikkim&#39;s economy is largely <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agrarian</a>, based on traditional farming methods, on terraced slopes.

      <p>In recent years, the government of Sikkim has promoted tourism. Sikkim has a vast tourism potential and by tapping into this the state has grossed an earnings windfall. With the general improvement in infrastructure, tourism is slated to be the mainstay of the Sikkim&#39;s economy. A fledgling industry the state has recently invested in is <!--del_lnk--> online gambling. The &quot;Playwin&quot; <!--del_lnk--> lottery, which is played on custom-built terminals connected to the <a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">internet</a>, has been a commercial success, with operations all over the country. Among the minerals mined in Sikkim are <a href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper">copper</a>, <!--del_lnk--> dolomite, <!--del_lnk--> limestone, <!--del_lnk--> graphite, <!--del_lnk--> mica, <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a>, and <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a>.<p>The opening of the <!--del_lnk--> Nathula Pass on <!--del_lnk--> July 6, <!--del_lnk--> 2006 connecting <a href="../../wp/l/Lhasa.htm" title="Lhasa">Lhasa</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Tibet.htm" title="Tibet">Tibet</a> to India is expected to give a boost to the local economy, though the financial benefits will be slow to arrive.

      <p>Sikkim does not have any airports or railheads because of its rough terrain.

A regular <!--del_lnk--> helicopter service run by the Sikkim Helicopter Service connects Gangtok to Bagdogra; the flight is thirty minutes long, operates only once a day, and can carry 4 people. The Gangtok <!--del_lnk--> helipad is the only civilian helipad in the state. The closest <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Railways.htm" title="Indian Railways">railway</a> station is <!--del_lnk--> New Jalpaiguri which is situated sixteen <!--del_lnk--> kilometres from Siliguri.<p>National Highway 31A links Siliguri to Gangtok. The highway is an all-weather metalled road which mostly runs parallel of the <!--del_lnk--> river Teesta, entering Sikkim at <!--del_lnk--> Rangpo.
