However, in 2006 the <!--del_lnk--> International Astronomical Union (IAU) created an official <!--del_lnk--> definition of the term &quot;planet&quot;. Under this definition, Pluto is reclassified as a <!--del_lnk--> dwarf planet, and there are eight planets in the Solar System. In addition to Pluto, the IAU currently recognizes two other <!--del_lnk--> dwarf planets: <a href="../../wp/c/Ceres_%2528dwarf_planet%2529.htm" title="Ceres (dwarf planet)">Ceres</a> (<!--del_lnk--> <img alt="Old symbol of Ceres" height="11" longdesc="/wiki/Image:1_Ceres_%282%29.png" src="../../images/30/3027.png" width="7" />), the largest object in the asteroid belt, and <!--del_lnk--> Eris, which lies beyond the Kuiper belt in a region called the scattered disc. Of the known dwarf planets, only Ceres has no moons.<p>For many years, the Solar System was the only known example of planets in orbit around a star. The discovery in recent years of many <a href="../../wp/e/Extrasolar_planet.htm" title="Extrasolar planet">extrasolar planets</a> has led to the term &quot;solar system&quot; being applied generically to all the newly discovered systems. Technically, however, it should strictly refer to Earth&#39;s system only, as the word &quot;<!--del_lnk--> solar&quot; is derived from the Sun&#39;s <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> name, <i><!--del_lnk--> Sol</i>. Other such systems are usually referred to by the names of their parent star: &quot;the <!--del_lnk--> Alpha Centauri system&quot; or &quot;the <!--del_lnk--> 51 Pegasi system&quot;.<p>

      <p>Most objects in orbit around the Sun lie within the <!--del_lnk--> ecliptic, a shallow plane which is roughly parallel to the Sun&#39;s equator. The planets are very close to the ecliptic while <!--del_lnk--> comets and <!--del_lnk--> kuiper belt objects are often at significant angles to it.<p>All of the planets (and most other objects) also orbit with the Sun&#39;s rotation; in a counter-clockwise direction as viewed from a point above the Sun&#39;s north pole. There is a direct relationship between how far away a planet is from the Sun and how quickly it orbits. Mercury, the closest to the sun, travels the fastest, while Neptune, being much farther from the Sun, travels more slowly. Objects orbit in an <!--del_lnk--> ellipse around the Sun, so an orbiting object&#39;s distance from the Sun varies in the course of its year. Its closest approach to the Sun is known as its <!--del_lnk--> perihelion while its farthest point from the Sun is called its <!--del_lnk--> aphelion. Although the orbits of the planets are nearly circular (with perihelions roughly equal to their aphelions), many comets, asteroids and objects of the Kuiper belt follow highly elliptical orbits with large differences between perihelion and aphelion. The paths of objects around the Sun travel according to a law of planetary motion discovered by German astronomer <a href="../../wp/j/Johannes_Kepler.htm" title="Johannes Kepler">Johannes Kepler</a> in the early 1600&#39;s. The sun is slightly off to the side of the centre of each ellipse at a point called a focus. The focus is actually a point just outside the centre of the Sun called the barycenter of the solar system.<p>Astronomers most often measure distances within the solar system in <!--del_lnk--> astronomical units or AU. One AU is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun or roughly 149 598 000&nbsp;km (93,000,000 mi). <a href="../../wp/p/Pluto.htm" title="Pluto">Pluto</a> is roughly 39&nbsp;AU from the Sun while <!--del_lnk--> Jupiter lies at roughly 5.2&nbsp;AU.<p>Informally, the Solar System is sometimes divided into separate &quot;zones&quot;; the first zone, known as the <i>inner Solar System</i>, comprises the <i>inner planets</i> and the main asteroid belt. The <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_System.htm" title="Outer solar system">outer solar system</a> is sometimes defined as everything beyond the asteroids; however it is also the name often given to the region beyond Neptune with the gas giants as a separate &quot;middle zone.&quot;<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>One common misconception is that the orbits of the major objects within the Solar System (planets, Pluto and asteroids) are equidistant. To cope with the vast distances involved, many representations of the Solar System simplify these orbits by showing them the same distance apart. However, in reality, with a few exceptions, the Solar System is arranged so that the farther a planet or belt is from the Sun, the larger the distance between it and the previous orbit. For example, <a href="../../wp/v/Venus.htm" title="Venus">Venus</a> is approximately 0.33 AU farther out than <a href="../../wp/m/Mercury_%2528planet%2529.htm" title="Mercury (planet)">Mercury</a> while <a href="../../wp/j/Jupiter.htm" title="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> is 1.9 AU from the farthest extent of the <!--del_lnk--> asteroid belt and Neptune&#39;s orbit is roughly 20 AU farther out than that of Uranus. Attempts have been made to determine a correlation between these distances (see <!--del_lnk--> Bode&#39;s Law) but to date there is no accepted theory that explains the orbital distances.<p><a id="Planets.2C_dwarf_planets.2C_and_small_solar_system_bodies" name="Planets.2C_dwarf_planets.2C_and_small_solar_system_bodies"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Planets, dwarf planets, and small solar system bodies</span></h2>

      <p>In a decision passed by the <!--del_lnk--> International Astronomical Union General Assembly on August 24, 2006, the objects in the Solar System other than the Sun and <!--del_lnk--> natural satellites were divided into three separate groups: <i>planets</i>, <i>dwarf planets</i> and <i>small solar system bodies</i>.<p>Under this classification, a <b><a href="../../wp/p/Planet.htm" title="Planet">planet</a></b> is any body in orbit around the Sun that a) has enough mass to form itself into a spherical shape and b) has cleared its immediate neighbourhood of all smaller objects. Eight objects in the Solar System currently meet this definition; they are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.<p><b><!--del_lnk--> Dwarf planet</b> was a second and new classification. The key difference between planets and dwarf planets is that while both are required to orbit the Sun and be of large enough mass that their own gravity pulls them into a nearly round shape, dwarf planets are not required to <!--del_lnk--> clear their neighbourhood of other celestial bodies. Three objects in the solar system are currently included in this category; they are <a href="../../wp/p/Pluto.htm" title="Pluto">Pluto</a> (formerly considered a planet), the asteroid <a href="../../wp/1/1_Ceres.htm" title="1 Ceres">Ceres</a>, and the <a href="../../wp/s/Scattered_disc.htm" title="Scattered disc">scattered disc</a> object <!--del_lnk--> Eris. The IAU will begin evaluating other known objects to see if they fit within the definition of dwarf planets. The most likely candidates are some of the larger asteroids and several Trans-Neptunian Objects such as <a href="../../wp/9/90377_Sedna.htm" title="90377 Sedna">Sedna</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Orcus, and <!--del_lnk--> Quaoar.<p>The remainder of the objects in the Solar System were classified as <b><!--del_lnk--> small solar system bodies</b> (<b>SSSBs</b>). As the IAU noted in its resolution:<dl>
       <dd><i>These currently include most of the Solar System asteroids, most Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs), comets, and other small bodies.</i></dl>

      <p>Using <!--del_lnk--> radiometric dating, scientists can estimate that the solar system is 4.6 billion years old. The oldest rocks on Earth are approximately 3.9 billion years old. Rocks this old are rare, as the Earth&#39;s surface is constantly being reshaped by erosion, volcanism and plate tectonics. To estimate the age of the solar system scientists must use <!--del_lnk--> meteorites, which were formed during the early condensation of the solar nebula. The oldest meteorites (such as the <!--del_lnk--> Canyon Diablo meteorite) are found to have an age of 4.6 billion years, hence the solar system must be at least 4.6 billion years old.<p>The current hypothesis of Solar System formation is the <!--del_lnk--> nebular hypothesis, first proposed in 1755 by <a href="../../wp/i/Immanuel_Kant.htm" title="Immanuel Kant">Immanuel Kant</a> and independently formulated by <!--del_lnk--> Pierre-Simon Laplace. The nebular theory holds that the Solar System was formed from the gravitational collapse of a gaseous cloud called the <!--del_lnk--> solar nebula. It had a diameter of 100&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> AU and was 2&ndash;3 times the mass of the Sun.  Over time, a disturbance (possibly a nearby <!--del_lnk--> supernova)  squeezed the nebula, pushing matter inward until gravitational forces overcame the internal gas pressure and it began to collapse. As the nebula collapsed, conservation of <!--del_lnk--> angular momentum meant that it spun faster, and became warmer. As the competing forces associated with gravity, gas pressure, magnetic fields, and rotation acted on it, the contracting nebula began to flatten into a spinning <!--del_lnk--> protoplanetary disk with a gradually contracting <!--del_lnk--> protostar at the centre. Studies of young, pre-fusing solar mass stars, called <!--del_lnk--> T Tauri stars, show that these discs extend to several hundred&nbsp;AU and are rather cool, reaching only a thousand kelvins at their hottest.<p>From this cloud and its gas and dust, the various planets formed. The currently accepted method by which the planets formed is known as <!--del_lnk--> accretion, in which the planets began as dust grains in orbit around the central protostar, which initially formed by direct contact into clumps between one and ten kilometres in diameter, which in turn collided to form larger bodies (<!--del_lnk--> planetesimals), of roughly 5 km in size gradually increasing by further collisions by roughly 15 cm per year over the course of the next few million years.<p>The inner solar system was too warm for volatile molecules like water and methane to condense, and so the planetesimals which formed there were relatively small (comprising only 0.6% the mass of the disc)  and composed largely of compounds with high melting points, such as <!--del_lnk--> silicates and <a href="../../wp/m/Metal.htm" title="Metal">metals</a>. These rocky bodies eventually became the <!--del_lnk--> terrestrial planets. Farther out, the gravitational effects of <a href="../../wp/j/Jupiter.htm" title="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> made it impossible for the protoplanetary objects present to come together, leaving behind the <!--del_lnk--> asteroid belt. <p>Farther out still, beyond the <!--del_lnk--> frost line, where more volatile icy compounds could remain solid, <a href="../../wp/j/Jupiter.htm" title="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Saturn.htm" title="Saturn">Saturn</a> were able to gather more material than the terrestrial planets, as those compounds were more common. They became the <!--del_lnk--> gas giants, while <a href="../../wp/u/Uranus.htm" title="Uranus">Uranus</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/Neptune.htm" title="Neptune">Neptune</a> captured much less material and are known as ice giants because their cores are believed to be made mostly of ices (hydrogen compounds). <p>After 100 million years, the pressure and density of hydrogen in the centre of the collapsing nebula became great enough for the <!--del_lnk--> protosun to begin <!--del_lnk--> thermonuclear fusion, which increased until <!--del_lnk--> hydrostatic equilibrium was achieved.<p>The young Sun&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> solar wind then cleared away all the gas and dust in the <!--del_lnk--> protoplanetary disk, blowing it into interstellar space, thus ending the growth of the planets. <p><a id="Sun" name="Sun"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sun</span></h2>

      <p>The <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">Sun</a> is the Solar System&#39;s parent star, and far and away its chief component. It is classed as a moderately large <!--del_lnk--> yellow dwarf. However, this name is misleading, as on the scale of stars in our galaxy, the Sun is rather large and bright. Stars are classified based on their position on the <!--del_lnk--> Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, a graph which plots the brightness of stars against their surface temperatures. Generally speaking, the hotter a star is, the brighter it is. Stars which follow this pattern are said to be on the <!--del_lnk--> main sequence, and the Sun lies right in the middle of it. This has led many astronomy textbooks to label the Sun as &quot;average;&quot; however, stars brighter and hotter than it are rare, whereas stars dimmer and cooler than it are common. The vast majority of stars are dim <!--del_lnk--> red dwarfs, though they are under-represented in star catalogues as we can observe only those few that are very near the Sun in space.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The Sun&#39;s position on the <!--del_lnk--> main sequence means, according to current theories of stellar evolution, that it is in the &quot;prime of life&quot; for a star, in that it has not yet exhausted its store of hydrogen for <!--del_lnk--> nuclear fusion, and been forced, as older <!--del_lnk--> red giants must, to fuse more inefficient elements such as <a href="../../wp/h/Helium.htm" title="Helium">helium</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon.htm" title="Carbon">carbon</a>. The Sun is growing increasingly bright as it ages. Early in its history, it was roughly 75 percent as bright as it is today. Calculations of the ratios of hydrogen and helium within the Sun suggest it is roughly halfway through its life cycle, and will eventually begin moving off the main sequence, becoming larger, brighter and redder, until, about five billion years from now, it too will become a red giant.<p>The Sun is a <!--del_lnk--> population I star, meaning that it is fairly new in galactic terms, having been born in the later stages of the universe&#39;s evolution. As such, it contains more elements heavier than hydrogen and helium (&quot;<b>metals</b>&quot; in astronomical parlance) than older <!--del_lnk--> population II stars such as those found in <!--del_lnk--> globular clusters. Since elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were formed in the cores of ancient and exploding stars, the first generation of stars had to die before the universe could be enriched with them. For this reason, the very oldest stars contain very few metals, while stars born later have more. This high <!--del_lnk--> metallicity is thought to have been crucial in the Sun&#39;s developing a <!--del_lnk--> planetary system, because planets form from accretion of metals.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The Sun radiates a continuous stream of charged particles, a <a href="../../wp/p/Plasma_%2528physics%2529.htm" title="Plasma (physics)">plasma</a> known as <!--del_lnk--> solar wind, ejecting it outwards at speeds greater than 2 million kilometres per hour, creating a very tenuous &quot;atmosphere&quot; (the <!--del_lnk--> heliosphere), that permeates the solar system for at least 100&nbsp;AU. This environment is known as the <!--del_lnk--> interplanetary medium. Small quantities of <!--del_lnk--> cosmic dust (some of it arguably <!--del_lnk--> interstellar in origin) are also present in the <!--del_lnk--> interplanetary medium and are responsible for the phenomenon of <!--del_lnk--> zodiacal light. The influence of the Sun&#39;s rotating magnetic field on the interplanetary medium creates the largest structure in the solar system, the <!--del_lnk--> heliospheric current sheet.<p>Earth&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> magnetic field protects its atmosphere from interacting with the solar wind. However, Venus and Mars do not have magnetic fields, and the solar wind causes their atmospheres to gradually bleed away into space.<p><a id="Inner_planets" name="Inner_planets"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Inner planets</span></h2>

      <p>The four <b>inner</b> or <!--del_lnk--> terrestrial planets are characterised by their dense, <!--del_lnk--> rocky composition, few or no moons, and lack of ring systems. They are composed largely of minerals with high melting points such as <!--del_lnk--> silicates to form the planets&#39; solid <a href="../../wp/c/Crust_%2528geology%2529.htm" title="Crust (geology)">crusts</a> and semi-liquid <!--del_lnk--> mantles, and metals such as <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/Nickel.htm" title="Nickel">nickel</a>, which form their <!--del_lnk--> cores. Three of the four inner planets have substantial atmospheres. All have <!--del_lnk--> impact craters and possess tectonic surface features, such as <!--del_lnk--> rift valleys and <!--del_lnk--> volcanoes. The term <i>inner planet</i> should not be confused with <b><!--del_lnk--> inferior planet</b>, which designates those planets which are closer to the Sun than the Earth is (i.e. Mercury and Venus).<p>The four inner planets are:<p><a id="Mercury" name="Mercury"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Mercury</span></h3>
      <p><b><a href="../../wp/m/Mercury_%2528planet%2529.htm" title="Mercury (planet)">Mercury</a></b> (0.4&nbsp;AU), the closest planet to the Sun, is also the least massive of the planets, at only 0.055 Earth masses. Mercury has a very thin atmosphere consisting of atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind. Because Mercury is so hot, these atoms quickly escape into space. Thus in contrast to the Earth and Venus whose atmospheres are stable, Mercury&#39;s atmosphere is constantly being replenished. It has no <!--del_lnk--> natural satellite, and it&#39;s only known geological features besides <!--del_lnk--> impact craters are &quot;wrinkle ridges&quot; probably produced by a period of contraction early in its history. Its relatively large iron core and thin mantle have not yet been adequately explained. Hypotheses include that its outer layers were stripped off by a giant impact, and that it was prevented from fully accreting by the Sun&#39;s gravity.<p><a id="Venus" name="Venus"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Venus</span></h3>
      <p><b><a href="../../wp/v/Venus.htm" title="Venus">Venus</a></b> (0.7&nbsp;AU) is of comparable mass to the <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth (planet)">Earth</a> (0.815 Earth masses), and, like Earth, possesses a thick silicate mantle around an iron core, as well as a substantial <!--del_lnk--> atmosphere and evidence of internal geological activity, such as <!--del_lnk--> volcanoes. However, it is much drier than Earth and its atmosphere is 90 times as dense and is composed overwhelmingly (96.5%) of <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>. Venus has no natural satellite. It is the hottest planet, despite being farther from the sun than Mercury, with temperatures reaching more than 400 degrees <!--del_lnk--> Celsius. This is most likely because of the amount of <!--del_lnk--> greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Although no definitive evidence of geological activity has yet been detected on Venus, its substantial atmosphere and lack of a magnetic field to protect it from depletion by the solar wind suggest that it must be regularly replenished by volcanic eruptions, perhaps as massive, global volcanic events which resurface the entire planet at a stroke, though other studies have shown that these events may have been continuous rather than instantaneous. <p><a id="Earth" name="Earth"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Earth</span></h3>
      <p>The largest and densest of the inner planets, <b><a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a></b> (1&nbsp;AU) is also the only one to demonstrate unequivocal evidence of current geological activity. Earth is the only planet known to have life. Its liquid <!--del_lnk--> hydrosphere, unique among the terrestrial planets, is probably the reason Earth is also the only planet where <a href="../../wp/p/Plate_tectonics.htm" title="Plate tectonics">plate tectonics</a> has been observed, because water acts as a lubricant for <!--del_lnk--> subduction. Its atmosphere is radically different from the other terrestrial planets, having been altered by the presence of life to contain 21 percent free oxygen. It has one satellite, the <a href="../../wp/m/Moon.htm" title="Moon">Moon</a>; the only large satellite of a terrestrial planet in the Solar System. In fact, the Moon is in co-orbit around the Sun with the Earth; its annual orbit around the Sun is essentially circular. The Moon possesses many features in common with other terrestrial planets, though differs in that its core is much smaller.<p><a id="Mars" name="Mars"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Mars</span></h3>

Charon does not exactly orbit Pluto in a traditional sense; Charon is about one-tenth the mass of Pluto and the centre of gravity of the pair is not within Pluto. Both bodies orbit a <!--del_lnk--> barycenter of gravity above the surface of Pluto (in empty space), making Pluto-Charon a <!--del_lnk--> binary system. Two much smaller moons, Nix and Hydra, orbit Pluto and Charon. Those Kuiper belt objects which, like Pluto, possess a 3:2 orbital resonance with Neptune (ie, they orbit twice for every three Neptunian orbits) are called <!--del_lnk--> Plutinos.<p><a id="Scattered_disc" name="Scattered_disc"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Scattered disc</span></h2>

      <p>Overlapping the Kuiper belt but extending much further outwards is the <b><a href="../../wp/s/Scattered_disc.htm" title="Scattered disc">scattered disc</a></b>. Scattered disc objects are believed to have been originally native to the Kuiper belt, but were ejected into erratic orbits in the outer fringes by the gravitational influence of Neptune&#39;s outward migration (<i>see <!--del_lnk--> Formation and evolution of the Solar System</i>). Most scattered disc objects have perihelia within the Kuiper belt but aphelia as far as 150&nbsp;AU from the Sun. Their orbits are also highly inclined to the ecliptic plane, and are often almost perpendicular to it. Some astronomers, such as Kuiper belt co-discoverer <!--del_lnk--> David Jewitt, consider the scattered disc to be merely another region of the Kuiper belt, and describe scattered disc objects as &quot;scattered Kuiper belt objects.&quot;<p><b><!--del_lnk--> Centaurs</b>, which roughly extend from 9 to 30&nbsp;AU, are icy comet-like bodies that orbit in the region between Jupiter and Neptune. The largest known Centaur, <!--del_lnk--> 10199 Chariklo, has a diameter of between 200 and 250&nbsp;km. The first centaur to be discovered, <!--del_lnk--> 2060 Chiron, has been called a comet since it has been shown to develop a coma just as comets do when they approach the sun.

      <p>The point at which the solar system ends and interstellar space begins is not precisely defined, since its outer boundaries are delineated by two separate forces: the <!--del_lnk--> solar wind and the <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">Sun</a>&#39;s <a href="../../wp/g/Gravitation.htm" title="Gravity">gravity</a>.

The outer boundary of the sheath, the <!--del_lnk--> heliopause, is the point at which the solar wind finally terminates, and one enters the environment of interstellar space.

      <p>The solar system appears to have a very remarkable orbit. It is both extremely close to being circular, and at nearly the exact distance at which the orbital speed matches the speed of the compression waves that form the spiral arms. The solar system appears to have remained between spiral arms for most of the existence of life on Earth. The radiation from <!--del_lnk--> supernovae in spiral arms could theoretically sterilize planetary surfaces, preventing the formation of large animal life on land. By remaining out of the spiral arms, Earth may be unusually free to form large animal life on its surface. The solar system also lies well outside the star-crowded environs of the galactic centre. The opposing gravitational tugs from so many close stars within the galactic centre would have prevented planets from forming.<p>Recent studies of <a href="../../wp/e/Extrasolar_planet.htm" title="Extrasolar planet">Extrasolar</a> systems neighboring Earth&#39;s have shown that our system&#39;s configuration might not be common, as the vast majority so far discovered have been found to be markedly different. For instance, many extrasolar planetary systems contain a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> hot Jupiter&quot;; a planet of comparable size to Jupiter that nonetheless orbits very close to its star, at, for instance, 0.05 AU. It has been hypothesised that while the giant planets in these systems formed in the same place as the gas giants in Earth&#39;s solar system did, some sort of migration took place which resulted in the giant planet spiralling in towards the parent star. Any terrestrial planets which had previously existed would presumably either be destroyed or ejected from the system. On the other hand, the apparent prevalence of hot Jupiters could result from a <!--del_lnk--> sampling error, as planets of similar size at greater distances from their stars are more difficult to detect.<p><a id="Discovery_and_exploration" name="Discovery_and_exploration"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Discovery and exploration</span></h2>

He discovered that the <a href="../../wp/m/Moon.htm" title="Moon">Moon</a> was cratered, that the Sun was marked with sunspots, and that Jupiter had four satellites in orbit around it. <!--del_lnk--> Christiaan Huygens followed on from Galileo&#39;s discoveries by discovering Saturn&#39;s moon <!--del_lnk--> Titan and the shape of the <!--del_lnk--> rings of Saturn.  <!--del_lnk--> Giovanni Domenico Cassini later discovered four more <!--del_lnk--> moons of Saturn, the <!--del_lnk--> Cassini division in Saturn&#39;s rings, and the <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Red_Spot.htm" title="Great Red Spot">Great Red Spot</a> of Jupiter.<p>In 1682, <!--del_lnk--> Edmund Halley realised that repeated sightings of a <a href="../../wp/c/Comet.htm" title="Comet">comet</a> were in fact recording the same object, returning regularly once every 75-6 years. This proved once and for all that comets were not atmospheric phenomena, as had been previously thought, and was the first evidence that anything other than the planets orbited the Sun.<p>In 1781, <!--del_lnk--> William Herschel was looking for binary stars in the constellation of <!--del_lnk--> Taurus when he observed what he thought was a new comet. In fact, its orbit revealed that it was a new planet, <a href="../../wp/u/Uranus.htm" title="Uranus">Uranus</a>, the first ever discovered.<p>In 1801, <!--del_lnk--> Giuseppe Piazzi discoverd <a href="../../wp/1/1_Ceres.htm" title="1 Ceres">Ceres</a>, a small world between Mars and Jupiter that was initially considered a new planet. However, subsequent discoveries of thousands of other small worlds in the same region led to their eventual separate reclassification: <a href="../../wp/a/Asteroid.htm" title="Asteroid">asteroids</a>.<p>In 1846, discrepancies in the orbit of Uranus led many to suspect a large planet must be tugging at it from farther out. <!--del_lnk--> Urbain Le Verrier&#39;s calculations eventually led to the discovery of <a href="../../wp/n/Neptune.htm" title="Neptune">Neptune</a>.<p>Further discrepancies in the orbits of the planets led <!--del_lnk--> Percival Lowell to conclude yet another planet, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Planet X&quot; must still be out there. After his death, his Lowell Observatory conducted a search, which ultimately led to <!--del_lnk--> Clyde Tombaugh&#39;s discovery of <a href="../../wp/p/Pluto.htm" title="Pluto">Pluto</a> in 1930. Pluto was, however, found to be too small to have disrupted the orbits of the outer planets, and its discovery was therefore coincidental. Like Ceres, it was initially considered to be a planet, but after the discovery of many other similarly sized objects in its vicinity it was eventually reclassified as a <!--del_lnk--> Kuiper belt object.<p>In 1992, astronomers <!--del_lnk--> David Jewitt of the <!--del_lnk--> University of Hawaii and <!--del_lnk--> Jane Luu of the <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts Institute of Technology discovered <!--del_lnk--> 1992 QB1, the first object found beyond Neptune in 62 years. This object proved to be the first of a new population, which came to be known as the <!--del_lnk--> Kuiper Belt; an icy analogue to the asteroid belt of which such objects as Pluto and Charon were deemed a part.
