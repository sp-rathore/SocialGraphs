      <p>A <b>siege</b> is a <!--del_lnk--> military <!--del_lnk--> blockade and <!--del_lnk--> assault of a <a href="../../wp/c/City.htm" title="City">city</a> or <!--del_lnk--> fortress with the intent of conquering by force or <!--del_lnk--> attrition. A siege occurs when an attacker encounters a city or fortress that refuses to <!--del_lnk--> surrender and cannot be easily taken by a <!--del_lnk--> frontal assault. Sieges usually involve surrounding the target and blocking the provision of supplies, typically coupled with <!--del_lnk--> siege engines, <!--del_lnk--> artillery bombardment, or <!--del_lnk--> sapping (also known as mining) to reduce <!--del_lnk--> fortifications.<p>Sieges probably predate the development of cities as large population centers. Ancient cities in the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> show <!--del_lnk--> archeological evidence of having had fortified <!--del_lnk--> city walls. During the <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Early Modern period, siege warfare dominated the conduct of war in Europe. <a href="../../wp/l/Leonardo_da_Vinci.htm" title="Leonardo da Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> gained as much of his renown from the design of fortifications as from his artwork.<p><!--del_lnk--> Medieval campaigns were generally designed around a succession of sieges. In the <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleon_I_of_France.htm" title="Napoleon I of France">Napoleonic</a> era, increasing use of ever more powerful <!--del_lnk--> cannon reduced the value of fortifications. In modern times, <a href="../../wp/t/Trench_warfare.htm" title="Trench warfare">trenches</a> replaced walls, and <!--del_lnk--> bunkers replaced castles. In the 20th century, the significance of the classical siege declined. With the advent of mobile warfare, one single fortified stronghold is no longer as decisive as it once was. While sieges do still occur, they are not as common as they once were due to changes in modes of battle, principally the ease by which huge volumes of destructive power can be directed onto a static target. Sieges in present day are more commonly either smaller hostage, militant, or extreme resisting-arrest situations such as the <!--del_lnk--> Waco Siege.<p>

      <p>City walls and fortifications were essential for the defense of the first cities in the <!--del_lnk--> ancient Near East. The walls were built by mud bricks, stone, wood or a combination of these materials depending on local availability. City walls may also have served the dual purpose of showing presumptive enemies the might of the Kingdom. The great walls surrounding the <!--del_lnk--> Sumerian city of <!--del_lnk--> Uruk gained such a wide-spread reputation. The walls were 9.5 km / 6 miles in length, and raised up to 12 metres / 40 feet in height. Later the walls of <!--del_lnk--> Babylon, reinforced by towers and moats, gained a similar reputation. In <!--del_lnk--> Anatolia, the <!--del_lnk--> Hittites built massive stone walls around their cities, taking advantage of the hillsides. The cities of the <!--del_lnk--> Indus Valley civilization showed less effort in constructing defenses, and likewise the <a href="../../wp/m/Minoan_civilization.htm" title="Minoan civilization">Minoan civilization</a> on <!--del_lnk--> Crete. These civilizations probably relied more on the defense of their outer borders or sea shores.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The earliest representations of siege warfare is dated to the <!--del_lnk--> Protodynastic Period of Egypt, c.3000 BC. These show symbolic destruction of city walls by divine animals using hoes. The first siege equipment is known from Egyptian tomb reliefs of the 24th century BC, showing Egyptian soldiers storming <!--del_lnk--> Canaanite town walls on wheeled siege ladders. Later Egyptian temple reliefs of the 13th century BC portrays the violent <!--del_lnk--> siege of Dapur, a Syrian city, with soldiers climbing scale ladders supported by archers. <a href="../../wp/a/Assyria.htm" title="Assyria">Assyrian</a> palace reliefs of the 9th to 7th centuries BC display sieges of several Near Eastern cities. Though a simple battering ram had come into use in the previous millennium, the Assyrians improved siege warfare and built huge wooden tower shaped battering rams with archers positioned on top.<p><a id="Tactics_in_siege_warfare" name="Tactics_in_siege_warfare"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Tactics in siege warfare</span></h3>
      <p>The most common practice of siege warfare was however to lay siege and wait for the surrender of the enemies inside. The <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">Egyptian</a> siege of <!--del_lnk--> Megiddo in the 15th century BC lasted for 7 months before its inhabitants surrendered. The <!--del_lnk--> Hittite siege of a rebellious Anatolian vassal in the 14th century BC ended when the queen mother came out of the city and begged for mercy on behalf of her people. If the main objective of a campaign was not the conquest of a particular city, it could simply be passed by. The Hittite campaign against the kingdom of <!--del_lnk--> Mitanni in the 14th century BC bypassed the fortified city of <!--del_lnk--> Carchemish. When the main objective of the campaign had been fulfilled, the Hittite army returned to Carchemish and the city fell after an eight-day-siege. The well-known <!--del_lnk--> Assyrian Siege of Jerusalem in the 8th century BC came to an end when the <!--del_lnk--> Israelites bought them off with gifts and tribute, according to the <a href="../../wp/a/Assyria.htm" title="Assyria">Assyrian</a> account, or when the Assyrian camp was struck by mass death, according to the <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">Biblical</a> account. Due to the problem of logistics, long lasting sieges involving but a minor force could seldom be maintained.<p><a id="Siege_accounts" name="Siege_accounts"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Siege accounts</span></h3>
      <p>Although there are numerous ancient accounts of cities being sacked, few contain any clues to how this was achieved. Some popular tales existed on how the cunning heroes succeeded in their sieges. The best-known is the <!--del_lnk--> Trojan Horse of the <a href="../../wp/t/Trojan_War.htm" title="Trojan War">Trojan War</a>, and a similar story tells how the <!--del_lnk--> Canaanite city of <!--del_lnk--> Joppa was conquered by the Egyptians in the 15th century BC. The Biblical <!--del_lnk--> Book of Joshua contains the story of the miraculous <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Jericho. A better detailed historical account from the 8th century BC, called the <!--del_lnk--> Piankhi stela, records how the <!--del_lnk--> Nubians laid siege to and conquered several Egyptian cities using <!--del_lnk--> battering rams, <!--del_lnk--> archers, slingers and building <!--del_lnk--> causeways across <!--del_lnk--> moats.<p><a id="Greco-Roman_and_medieval_siege_warfare" name="Greco-Roman_and_medieval_siege_warfare"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Greco-Roman and medieval siege warfare</span></h2>

      <p><a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>&#39;s <a href="../../wp/m/Macedon.htm" title="Macedon">Macedonian</a> army was involved in many sieges. There are two which are of particular note: <!--del_lnk--> Tyre and <!--del_lnk--> Sogdian Rock. Tyre was a <!--del_lnk--> Phoenician island-city about 1 km from the mainland, and thought to be impregnable. The Macedonians built a mole (causeway) out to the island. It is said to have been at least 60 m (200 ft) wide. When the causeway was within artillery range of Tyre, Alexander brought up stone throwers and light catapults to bombard the city walls. The city fell to the Macedonians after a seven month siege. In complete contrast to Tyre, Sogdian Rock was captured by guile. The fortress was high up on cliffs. Alexander used commando-like tactics to scale the cliffs and capture the high ground. The demoralized defenders surrendered.<p>The importance of siege warfare in the ancient period should not be underestimated. One of the contributing causes of <!--del_lnk--> Hannibal&#39;s inability to defeat Rome was his lack of siege train; thus, while he was able to defeat Roman armies in the field, he was unable to capture Rome itself.<p>The legionary armies of the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Republic and <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Empire</a> are noted as being particularly skilled and determined in siege warfare. An astonishing number and variety of sieges, for example, formed the core of <a href="../../wp/j/Julius_Caesar.htm" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar&#39;s</a> mid-1st century BCE conquest of <!--del_lnk--> Gaul (modern France). In his <!--del_lnk--> Gallic Wars, Caesar describes how at the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Alesia.htm" title="Battle of Alesia">Battle of Alesia</a> the <!--del_lnk--> Roman legions created two huge fortified walls around the city. The inner <!--del_lnk--> circumvallation, 10 miles, held in <!--del_lnk--> Vercingetorix&#39;s forces, while the outer <!--del_lnk--> contravallation kept relief from reaching them. The Romans held the ground in between the two walls. The besieged <!--del_lnk--> Gauls, facing starvation, eventually surrendered after their relief force met defeat against Caesar&#39;s auxiliary cavalry.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Sicarii <!--del_lnk--> Zealots who defended <!--del_lnk--> Masada in 74 were defeated by the Roman Legions who built a ramp 100 meters high up to the fortress&#39;s west wall.<p>The universal method for defending against siege is the use of fortifications, principally walls and ditches to supplement natural features. A sufficient supply of food and water is also important to defeat the simplest method of siege warfare: <!--del_lnk--> starvation. During a siege, a surrounding army would build <!--del_lnk--> earthworks (a line of <!--del_lnk--> circumvallation) to completely encircle their target, preventing food and water supplies from reaching the besieged city. If sufficiently desperate as the siege progressed, defenders and civilians might have been reduced to eating anything vaguely edible&mdash;horses, family pets, the leather from shoes, and even <!--del_lnk--> each other. On occasion, the defenders would drive &#39;surplus&#39; civilians out to reduce the demands on stored food and water.<p><!--del_lnk--> Disease was another effective siege weapon, although the attackers were often as vulnerable as the defenders. In some instances, catapults or like weapons would fling diseased animals over city walls in an early example of <!--del_lnk--> biological warfare.<div class="thumb tright">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>To end a siege more rapidly various methods were developed in ancient and medieval times to counter fortifications, and a large variety of <!--del_lnk--> siege engines were developed for use by besieging armies. <!--del_lnk--> Ladders could be used to <!--del_lnk--> escalade over the defenses. <!--del_lnk--> Battering rams and <!--del_lnk--> siege hooks could be used to force through gates or walls, while <!--del_lnk--> catapults, <!--del_lnk--> ballistae, <!--del_lnk--> trebuchets, <!--del_lnk--> mangonels, and <!--del_lnk--> onagers could be used to launch projectiles in order to break down a city&#39;s fortifications and kill its defenders. A <!--del_lnk--> siege tower could also be used: a substantial structure built as high, or higher than the walls, it allowed the attackers to fire down upon the defenders and also advance troops to the wall with less danger than using ladders.<p>In addition to launching projectiles at the fortifications or defenders, it was also quite common to attempt to undermine the fortifications, causing them to collapse. This could be accomplished by digging a tunnel beneath the <!--del_lnk--> foundations of the walls, and then deliberately collapsing or exploding the tunnel. This process is known as <!--del_lnk--> sapping or mining. The defenders could dig counter-tunnels to cut into the attackers&#39; works and collapse them prematurely.<p>Fire was often used as a weapon when dealing with wooden fortifications.

      <p>Advances in the prosecution of sieges in ancient and medieval times naturally encouraged the development of a variety of defensive counter-measures. In particular, <!--del_lnk--> medieval fortifications became progressively stronger&mdash;for example, the advent of the <!--del_lnk--> concentric castle from the period of the <a href="../../wp/c/Crusades.htm" title="Crusades">Crusades</a>&mdash;and more dangerous to attackers&mdash;witness the increasing use of <!--del_lnk--> machicolations and <!--del_lnk--> murder-holes, as well the preparation of <!--del_lnk--> boiling oil, molten <a href="../../wp/l/Lead.htm" title="Lead">lead</a> or hot <a href="../../wp/s/Sand.htm" title="Sand">sand</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Arrow slits (also called arrow loops or loopholes), <!--del_lnk--> sally ports (concealed doors) for sallies, and deep water wells were also integral means of resisting siege at this time. Particular attention would be paid to defending entrances, with gates protected by <!--del_lnk--> drawbridges, <!--del_lnk--> portcullises and <!--del_lnk--> barbicans. <!--del_lnk--> Moats and other water defenses, whether natural or augmented, were also vital to defenders.<p>In the European <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, virtually all large cities had city walls&mdash;<!--del_lnk--> Dubrovnik in <!--del_lnk--> Dalmatia is an impressive and well-preserved example&mdash;and more important cities had <!--del_lnk--> citadels, <!--del_lnk--> forts or <!--del_lnk--> castles. Great effort was expended to ensure a good water supply inside the city in case of siege. In some cases, long tunnels were constructed to carry water into the city. Complex systems of underground tunnels were used for storage and communications in medieval cities like <!--del_lnk--> T&aacute;bor in <!--del_lnk--> Bohemia (similar to those used much later in <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> during the <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_War.htm" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>).<p>Until the invention of <a href="../../wp/g/Gunpowder.htm" title="Gunpowder">gunpowder</a>-based weapons (and the resulting higher-velocity projectiles), the balance of power and logistics definitely favored the defender. With the invention of gunpowder, <!--del_lnk--> cannon and (in modern times) <!--del_lnk--> mortars and <!--del_lnk--> howitzers, the traditional methods of defense became less and less effective against a determined siege.<p><a id="Mongol_siege_warfare" name="Mongol_siege_warfare"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Mongol siege warfare</span></h2>
      <p>In the Middle Ages, the <a href="../../wp/m/Mongol_Empire.htm" title="Mongol Empire">Mongol Empire</a>&#39;s campaign against <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> by <a href="../../wp/g/Genghis_Khan.htm" title="Genghis Khan">Genghis Khan</a> and his army was extremely effective, allowing the Mongols to sweep through large areas. Even if they could not enter some of the more well-fortified cities, they used innovative battle tactics to grab hold of the land and the people:<dl>
       <dd><i>&quot;By concentrating on the field armies, the strongholds had to wait. Of course, smaller fortresses, or ones easily surprised, were taken as they came along. This had two effects. First, it cut off the principal city from communicating with other cities where they might expect aid. Secondly, refugees from these smaller cities would flee to the last stronghold. The reports from these cities and the streaming hordes of refugees not only reduced the morale of the inhabitants and garrison of the principal city, it also strained their resources. Food and water reserves were taxed by the sudden influx of refugees. Soon, what was once a formidable undertaking became easy. The Mongols were then free to lay siege without interference of the field army as it had been destroyed... At the siege of <!--del_lnk--> Aleppo, <!--del_lnk--> Hulegu used twenty catapults against the Bab al-Iraq (Gate of Iraq) alone. In J&ucirc;zj&acirc;n&icirc;, there are several episodes in which the Mongols constructed hundreds of siege machines in order to surpass the number which the defending city possessed. While J&ucirc;zj&acirc;n&icirc; surely exaggerated, the improbably high numbers which he used for both the Mongols and the defenders do give one a sense of the large numbers of machines used at a single siege.&quot;</i> <sup>1</sup></dl>
      <p>Another Mongol tactic was to use catapults to launch corpses of <!--del_lnk--> plague victims into besieged cities. The disease-carrying <!--del_lnk--> fleas from the person&#39;s body would then infest the city, and the plague would spread allowing the city to be easily captured, although this <!--del_lnk--> transmission mechanism was not known at the time.<p>On the first night while laying siege to a city, the leader of the Mongol forces would lead from a white <!--del_lnk--> tent: if the city surrendered, all would be spared. On the second day, he would use a red tent: if the city surrendered, the men would all be killed, but the rest would be spared. On the third day, he would use a black tent: no quarter would be given.<p>Similar attitude was common to most armies. A city that surrendered could expect to negotiate terms to avoid a <!--del_lnk--> sack. A city broken by siege or assault could suffer extreme retribution, even in the 19th century. While the ruthless <!--del_lnk--> sack of Jerusalem in the finish of the <a href="../../wp/f/First_Crusade.htm" title="First Crusade">First Crusade</a> is often quoted as a sign of Christian religious fanaticism and barbarity against the Muslim opponents, it was no different from any siege ending in taking the city by assault. Jerusalem was taken by an all-out assault; the common usage was that it could be looted for three days and three nights, and the inhabitants freely raped or killed. The city had been similarly sacked only four years earlier, 1095, by victorious <!--del_lnk--> Turkomans. It was a common usage to sack the city and kill all the adult inhabitants if the city was taken by assault, carry out an &quot;arson tax&quot; if the city surrendered after a siege (as in <!--del_lnk--> Jerusalem 1187 and <!--del_lnk--> Visby 1361), and spare the city if it surrendered without a siege.<p><a id="Sieges_in_the_age_of_gunpowder" name="Sieges_in_the_age_of_gunpowder"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sieges in the age of gunpowder</span></h2>
      <p>The introduction of <a href="../../wp/g/Gunpowder.htm" title="Gunpowder">gunpowder</a> and the use of <!--del_lnk--> cannons brought about a new age in siege warfare. Cannons were first used in the early 13th century, but did not become significant weapons for another 150 years or so. By the 16th century, they were an essential and regularized part of any campaigning army, or castle&#39;s defenses.<p>The greatest advantage of cannons over other siege weapons was the ability to fire a heavier projectile, further, faster and more often than previous weapons. Thus, &#39;old fashioned&#39; walls&mdash;that is high and, relatively, thin&mdash;were excellent targets and, over time, easily demolished. In 1453, the great walls of <!--del_lnk--> Constantinople were broken through in just six weeks by the 62 cannon of <!--del_lnk--> Mehmet II&#39;s army.<p>However, new fortifications, designed to withstand gunpowder weapons, were soon constructed throughout Europe. During the <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Early Modern period, siege warfare continued to dominate the conduct of war in Europe.<p>Once siege guns were developed the techniques to assaulting a town or a fortress became well known and ritualized. The attacking army would surround a town. Then the town would be asked to surrender. If they did not comply the besieging army would surround the town with temporary fortifications to stop <!--del_lnk--> sallies from the stronghold or relief getting in. The attackers would then build a length of trenches parallel to the defences and just out of range of the defending artillery. They would then dig a trench towards the town in a <!--del_lnk--> zigzag pattern so that it could not be <!--del_lnk--> enfiladed by defending fire. Once within artillery range another parallel trench would be dug with gun emplacements. If necessary using the first artillery fire for cover this process would be repeated until guns were close enough to be laid accurately to make a breach in the fortifications. So that the <!--del_lnk--> forlorn hope and support troops could get close enough to exploit the breach more zigzag trenches could be dug even closer to the walls with more parallel trenches to protect and conceal the attacking troops. After each step in the process the besiegers would ask the besieged to surrender. If the forlorn hope stormed the breach successfully the defenders could expect no mercy.<p><a id="Emerging_theories_on_improving_fortifications" name="Emerging_theories_on_improving_fortifications"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Emerging theories on improving fortifications</span></h3>
      <p>The castles that in earlier years had been formidable obstacles were easily breached by the new weapons. For example, in Spain, the newly equipped army of <!--del_lnk--> Ferdinand and Isabella was able to conquer <!--del_lnk--> Moorish strongholds in <!--del_lnk--> Granada in 1482&ndash;92 that had held out for centuries before the invention of cannons.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In the early 15th century, Italian architect <!--del_lnk--> Leon Battista Alberti wrote a treatise entitled <i>De Re aedificatoria</i> which theorized methods of building fortifications capable of withstanding the new guns. He proposed that walls be &quot;built in uneven lines, like the teeth of a saw.&quot; He proposed star-shaped fortresses with low thick walls.<p>However, few rulers paid any attention to his theories. A few towns in Italy began building in the new style late in the 1480s, but it was only with the French invasion of the Italian peninsula in 1494&ndash;95 that the new fortifications were built on a large scale. <!--del_lnk--> Charles VIII invaded Italy with an army of 18,000 men and a horse-drawn <!--del_lnk--> siege-train. As a result he could defeat virtually any city or state, no matter how well defended. In a panic, military strategy was completely rethought throughout the Italian states of the time, with a strong emphasis on the new fortifications that could withstand a modern siege.<p><a id="New_styles_of_fortresses_employed" name="New_styles_of_fortresses_employed"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">New styles of fortresses employed</span></h3>
      <p>The most effective way to protect walls against cannon fire proved to be depth (increasing the width of the defenses) and angles (ensuring that attackers could only fire on walls at an oblique angle, not square on). Initially walls were lowered and backed, in front and behind, with earth. Towers were reformed into triangular bastions.<p>This design matured into the <i><!--del_lnk--> trace italienne</i>. Star-shaped fortresses surrounding towns and even cities with outlying defenses proved very difficult to capture, even for a well equipped army. Fortresses built in this style throughout the 16th century did not become fully obsolete until the 19th century, and were still in use throughout <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> (though modified for 20th century warfare).<p>However, the cost of building such vast modern fortifications was incredibly high, and was often too much for individual cities to undertake. Many were bankrupted in the process of building them; others, such as <!--del_lnk--> Siena, spent so much money on fortifications that they were unable to maintain their armies properly, and so lost their wars anyway. Nonetheless, innumerable large and impressive fortresses were built throughout northern Italy in the first decades of the 16th century to resist repeated French invasions that became known as the <!--del_lnk--> Wars of Italy. Many stand to this day.<p>In the 1530s and 1540s, the new style of fortification began to spread out of Italy into the rest of Europe, particularly to France, the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, and Spain. Italian engineers were in enormous demand throughout Europe, especially in war-torn areas such as the Netherlands, which became dotted by towns encircled in modern fortifications. For many years, defensive and offensive tactics were well balanced leading to protracted and costly wars such as Europe had never known, involving more and more planning and government involvement.<p>The new fortresses ensured that war rarely extended beyond a series of sieges. Because the new fortresses could easily hold 10,000 men, an attacking army could not ignore a powerfully fortified position without serious risk of counterattack. As a result, virtually all towns had to be taken, and that was usually a long, drawn-out affair, potentially lasting from several months to years, while the members of the town were starved to death. Most battles in this period were between besieging armies and relief columns sent to rescue the besieged.<p><a id="Marshal_Vauban" name="Marshal_Vauban"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Marshal Vauban</span></h3>

      <p>At the end of the 17th century, Marshal <!--del_lnk--> Vauban, a <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> military engineer, developed modern fortification to its pinnacle, refining siege warfare without fundamentally altering it: ditches would be dug; walls would be protected by <!--del_lnk--> glacis; and <!--del_lnk--> bastions would <!--del_lnk--> enfilade an attacker. He was also a master of planning sieges himself. Before Vauban, sieges had been somewhat slapdash operations. Vauban refined besieging to a science with a methodical process that, if uninterrupted, would break even the strongest fortifications.<p>Examples of Vauban-style fortresses in <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a> include <!--del_lnk--> Fort McHenry in <a href="../../wp/b/Baltimore%252C_Maryland.htm" title="Baltimore, Maryland">Baltimore, Maryland</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Fort Ticonderoga in <!--del_lnk--> New York State, and <!--del_lnk--> La Citadelle in <!--del_lnk--> Quebec City.<p>Planning and maintaining a siege is just as difficult as fending one off. A besieging army must be prepared to repel both <!--del_lnk--> sorties from the besieged area and also any attack that may try to relieve the defenders. It was thus usual to construct lines of trenches and defenses facing in both directions. The outermost lines, known as the lines of <!--del_lnk--> contravallation, would surround the entire besieging army and protect it from attackers. This would be the first construction effort of a besieging army, built soon after a fortress or city had been invested. A line of <!--del_lnk--> circumvallation would also be constructed, facing in towards the besieged area, to protect against sorties by the defenders and to prevent the besieged from escaping.<p>The next line, which Vauban usually placed at about 600 meters from the target, would contain the main batteries of heavy cannons so that they could hit the target without being vulnerable themselves. Once this line was established, work crews would move forward creating another line at 250 meters. This line contained smaller guns. The final line would be constructed only 30 to 60 meters from the fortress. This line would contain the <!--del_lnk--> mortars and would act as a <!--del_lnk--> staging area for attack parties once the walls were breached. It would also be from there that sappers working to undermine the fortress would operate.<p>The trenches connecting the various lines of the besiegers could not be built perpendicular to the walls of the fortress, as the defenders would have a clear line of fire along the whole trench. Thus, these lines (known as <i>saps</i>) needed to be sharply jagged.<p>Another element of a fortress was the <!--del_lnk--> citadel. Usually a citadel was a &quot;mini fortress&quot; within the larger fortress, sometimes designed as a last bastion of defense, but more often as a means of protecting the garrison from potential revolt in the city. The citadel was used in wartime and peacetime to keep the residents of the city in line.<p>As in ages past, most sieges were decided with very little fighting between the opposing armies. An attacker&#39;s army was poorly served incurring the high casualties that a direct assault on a fortress would entail. Usually they would wait until supplies inside the fortifications were exhausted or disease had weakened the defenders to the point that they were willing to surrender. At the same time, diseases, especially <!--del_lnk--> typhus were a constant danger to the encamped armies outside the fortress, and often forced a premature retreat. Sieges were often won by the army that lasted the longest.<p>An important element of <!--del_lnk--> strategy for the besieging army was whether or not to allow the encamped city to surrender. Usually it was preferable to graciously allow a <!--del_lnk--> surrender, both to save on casualties, and to set an example for future defending cities. A city that was allowed to surrender with minimal loss of life was much better off than a city that held out for a long time and was brutally butchered at the end. Moreover, if an attacking army had a reputation of killing and pillaging regardless of a surrender, then other cities&#39; defensive efforts would be redoubled.<p><a id="Advent_of_mobile_warfare" name="Advent_of_mobile_warfare"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Advent of mobile warfare</span></h3>
      <p>Siege warfare dominated in Western Europe for most of the <a href="../../wp/1/17th_century.htm" title="17th century">seventeenth</a> and <a href="../../wp/1/18th_century.htm" title="18th century">eighteenth</a> centuries. An entire campaign, or longer, could be used in a single siege (for example, <!--del_lnk--> Ostend in 1601&ndash;04; <!--del_lnk--> La Rochelle in 1627&ndash;28). This resulted in extremely elongated conflicts. The balance was that while siege warfare was extremely expensive and very slow, it was very successful&mdash;or, at least, more so than encounters in the field. Battles arose through clashes between besiegers and punative relieving armies, but the principle was a slow grinding victory by the greater economic power. The relatively rare attempts at forcing pitched battles (<!--del_lnk--> Gustavus Adolphus in 1630; the French against the Dutch in 1672 or 1688) were almost always expensive failures. Although during the <!--del_lnk--> English Civil War (1642&ndash;1651) there were many sieges, the general maxim of the field armies was &quot;Where is the enemy? Let us go and fight them. Or... if the enemy was coming... Why, what should be done! Draw out into the fields and fight them.&quot; This was very different from the <!--del_lnk--> siege of Nuremberg during the <!--del_lnk--> 30 Years&#39; War and was demonstrated to the continental powers by regiments of the <!--del_lnk--> New Model Army at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Dunes (1658) during the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Spanish War.<p>However, this pattern was vastly reduced in the <!--del_lnk--> French Revolutionary and <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleonic_Wars.htm" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>. New techniques stressed the division of armies into all-arms corps that would march separately and only come together on the battlefield. The less concentrated army could now live off the country and move more rapidly over a larger number of roads. Fortresses comanding lines of communication could be bypassed and no longer stop an invasion. This military revolution was described by <!--del_lnk--> Clausewitz. Though highly successful, this revolution relied on a densely populated rich countryside to work. The civil population resented feeding invading armies. In Spain and Russia, French armies starved and the local peasants became anti-French guerillas as too many troops, sought too much food, from too few peasants. For political and logistical reasons, the British army fighting the French in Spain relied heavily on supply lines. Sieges therefore played a more significant role in the <!--del_lnk--> Peninsular War than in most other Napoleonic warfare.<p>Advances in artillery made previously impregnable defenses useless. For example, the walls of <!--del_lnk--> Vienna that had held off the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Turks</a> in the mid-seventeenth century were no obstacle to <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleon_I_of_France.htm" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> in the late eighteenth. Where sieges occurred, the attackers were usually able to defeat the defenses within a matter of days or weeks, rather than weeks or months as previously. But <!--del_lnk--> Lines of Torres Vedras (1810&ndash;1811), which were built by the Portuguese under the direction of <!--del_lnk--> Royal Engineers of the <!--del_lnk--> British Army during the <!--del_lnk--> Peninsular war were able to stop a French Army and were the first example of <a href="../../wp/t/Trench_warfare.htm" title="Trench warfare">Trench warfare</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Siege of Sevastopol (1854&ndash;1855) during the <a href="../../wp/c/Crimean_War.htm" title="Crimean War">Crimean War</a> and those of <!--del_lnk--> Petersburg (1864&ndash;1865) during the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> showed that modern citadels could still resist an enemy for many months. This era of rapidly moving armies continued through the 19th century. For example, the great Swedish white-elephant fortress of <!--del_lnk--> Karlsborg was built in the tradition of Vauban and intended as a reserve capital for Sweden, but it was obsolete before it was completed in 1869.<p>Advances in firearms technology without the necessary advances in battlefield communications gradually led to the defense again gaining the ascendancy. During the <!--del_lnk--> Franco-Prussian War, the battlefield front-lines moved rapidly through France. However, the <!--del_lnk--> Siege of Metz and the <!--del_lnk--> Siege of Paris held up German armies for months at a time due to the superior firepower of the <!--del_lnk--> Chassepot rifle and the principle of detached or semi-detached forts with heavy-caliber <!--del_lnk--> artillery. This resulted in the construction of fortress works across Europe such as the massive fortifications at <!--del_lnk--> Verdun.<p><a id="Modern_warfare" name="Modern_warfare"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Modern warfare</span></h2>

      <p>Mainly as a result of the increasing firepower (such as <!--del_lnk--> machine guns) available to defensive forces, <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">First World War</a> <a href="../../wp/t/Trench_warfare.htm" title="Trench warfare">trench warfare</a> briefly revived a form of siege warfare. Although siege warfare had moved out from an urban setting because city walls had become ineffective against modern weapons, trench warfare was nonetheless able to utilize many of the techniques of siege warfare in its prosecution (<!--del_lnk--> sapping, mining, <!--del_lnk--> barrage and, of course, <!--del_lnk--> attrition) but on a much larger scale and on a greatly extended front. The development of the armoured <a href="../../wp/t/Tank.htm" title="Tank">tank</a> and improved <!--del_lnk--> infantry <!--del_lnk--> tactics at the end of World War I swung the pendulum back in favour of maneuver.<p>The <a href="../../wp/b/Blitzkrieg.htm" title="Blitzkrieg">Blitzkrieg</a> of the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">Second World War</a> truly showed that fixed fortifications are easily defeated by maneuver instead of frontal assault or long sieges. The great <!--del_lnk--> Maginot Line was bypassed and battles that would have taken weeks of siege could now be avoided with the careful application of air power (such as the German <!--del_lnk--> paratrooper capture of <!--del_lnk--> Fort Eben-Emael, Belgium, early in World War II). The most important &#39;sieges&#39; of the Second World War were on the Eastern Front where bloody urban warfare marked the battles of <!--del_lnk--> Leningrad, <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Stalingrad.htm" title="Battle of Stalingrad">Stalingrad</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Berlin. In these battles, the ruins of an urban landscape proved to be just as effective an obstacle to an advancing army as any fortifications. In the west apart from the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Atlantic the sieges were not on the same scale as those on the European Eastern front; however, there were several notable or critical sieges: the island of <a href="../../wp/m/Malta.htm" title="Malta">Malta</a> for which the population won the <!--del_lnk--> George Cross, <!--del_lnk--> Tobruk and <!--del_lnk--> Monte Cassino. In the <!--del_lnk--> South-East Asian Theatre there was the siege of <a href="../../wp/s/Singapore.htm" title="Singapore">Singapore</a> and in the <!--del_lnk--> Burma Campaign sieges of <!--del_lnk--> Myitkyina, the <!--del_lnk--> Admin Box and the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Tennis Court which was the high water mark for the Japanese advance into <!--del_lnk--> India.<p>The air supply methods which were developed and used extensively in the Burma Campaign for supplying the <!--del_lnk--> Chindits and other units, including those in sieges such as <!--del_lnk--> Imphal, as well as flying <!--del_lnk--> the Hump into China, allowed the western powers to develop air lift expertise which would prove vital during the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> <!--del_lnk--> Berlin Blockade.<p>During the <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_War.htm" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a> the battles of <!--del_lnk--> Dien Bien Phu (1954) and <!--del_lnk--> Khe Sanh (1968) possessed siege-like characteristics. In both cases, the <!--del_lnk--> Vietminh and <!--del_lnk--> Vietcong were able to cut off the opposing army by capturing the surrounding rugged terrain. At Dien Bien Phu, the French were unable to use air power to overcome the siege and were defeated. However, at Khe Sanh a mere 14 years later, advances in air power allowed the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> to withstand the siege. The resistance of US forces was assisted by the <!--del_lnk--> PAVN and <!--del_lnk--> PLAF forces&#39; decision to use the Khe Sanh siege as strategic distraction to allow their mobile warfare offensive, the first <!--del_lnk--> Tet offensive to unfold securely. The Siege of Khe Sanh displays typical features of modern sieges, as the defender has greater capacity to withstand siege, the attacker&#39;s main aim is to bottle operational forces, or create a strategic distraction, rather than take a siege to conclusion.<p><a id="Recent_sieges" name="Recent_sieges"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Recent sieges</span></h3>

       <li>From <!--del_lnk--> 5 April <!--del_lnk--> 1992 to <!--del_lnk--> 29 February <!--del_lnk--> 1996 the <!--del_lnk--> Siege of Sarajevo took place, where <a href="../../wp/s/Sarajevo.htm" title="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a>, then controlled by the <a href="../../wp/b/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina.htm" title="Bosnia and Herzegovina">Bosnian</a> government, was besieged by the <!--del_lnk--> Serb paramilitary.<li>In 2004, <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> forces laid siege to the Iraqi city of <!--del_lnk--> Fallujah.</ul>

      <p>Despite the overwhelming might of the modern state, siege tactics continue to be employed in <a href="../../wp/p/Police.htm" title="Police">police</a> conflicts. This has been due to a number of factors, primarily risk to life, whether that of the police, the besieged, bystanders or <!--del_lnk--> hostages. Police make use of trained <!--del_lnk--> negotiators, <a href="../../wp/p/Psychology.htm" title="Psychology">psychologists</a> and, if necessary, force, generally being able to rely on the support of their nation&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> armed forces if required.<p>One of the complications facing police in a siege involving hostages is the <!--del_lnk--> Stockholm syndrome where sometimes hostages can develop a sympathetic rapport with their captors. If this helps keep them safe from harm this is considered to be a good thing, but there have been cases where hostages have tried to shield the captors during an assault or refused to co-operate with the authorities in bringing prosecutions.<p>The 1993 <!--del_lnk--> police siege on the <!--del_lnk--> Branch Davidian church in <!--del_lnk--> Waco, <!--del_lnk--> Texas, lasted 51 days, an atypically long police siege. Unlike traditional military sieges, police sieges tend to last for hours or days rather than weeks, months or years.<p>In Britain if the siege involves perpetrators who are considered by the British Government to be terrorists, then if an assault is to take place, the civilian authorities hand command and control over to the military. The threat of such an action ended the <!--del_lnk--> Balcombe Street Siege in 1975 but the <!--del_lnk--> Iranian Embassy Siege in 1980 ended in a military assault and the death of all but one of the hostage takers.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege&quot;</div>
