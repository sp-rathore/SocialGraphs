      <p>The Swastika has an extensive history. The motif seems to have first been used in <!--del_lnk--> Neolithic <!--del_lnk--> Eurasia. The swastika is used in religious and civil ceremonies in India. Most Indian temples, entrance of houses, weddings, festivals and celebrations are decorated with swastikas. The symbol was introduced to <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asia by Hindu kings and remains an integral part of Balinese Hinduism to this day, and it is a common sight in Indonesia. The symbol has an ancient history in Europe, appearing on artifacts from pre-Christian <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="European">European</a> cultures. It was also adopted independently by several <!--del_lnk--> Native American cultures.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In the <!--del_lnk--> Western world, the symbol experienced a resurgence following the archaeological work in the late nineteenth century of <!--del_lnk--> Heinrich Schliemann, who discovered the symbol in the site of ancient <!--del_lnk--> Troy and associated it with the ancient migrations of <!--del_lnk--> Proto-Indo-Europeans. He connected it with similar shapes found on ancient pots in Germany, and theorised that the swastika was a &quot;significant religious symbol of our remote ancestors,&quot; linking Germanic, Greek and Indo-Iranian cultures. By the early 20th century it was widely used worldwide and was regarded as a symbol of good luck and auspiciousness.<p>The work of Schliemann soon became intertwined with the <i><!--del_lnk--> v&ouml;lkisch</i> movements, for which the swastika was a symbol of &quot;Aryan&quot; identity, a concept that came to be equated by theorists like <!--del_lnk--> Alfred Rosenberg with a <!--del_lnk--> Nordic <!--del_lnk--> master race originating in northern Europe. Since its adoption by the <!--del_lnk--> Nazi Party of <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, the swastika has been associated with <a href="../../wp/f/Fascism.htm" title="Fascism">fascism</a>, <!--del_lnk--> racism (<!--del_lnk--> white supremacy), <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, and <a href="../../wp/t/The_Holocaust.htm" title="The Holocaust">the Holocaust</a> in much of the West. The swastika remains a core symbol of <!--del_lnk--> Neo-Nazi groups, and is also regularly used by <!--del_lnk--> activist groups to signify the supposed Nazi-like behaviour of organizations and individuals they oppose.<p><a id="Etymology_and_alternative_names" name="Etymology_and_alternative_names"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Etymology and alternative names</span></h2>
      <p>The word <i>swastika</i> is derived from the <!--del_lnk--> Sanskrit <i><span class="IAST Unicode" style="font-face: Arial Unicode MS, GNU Unifont, Lucida Sans Unicode; white-space: wrap; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">svastika</span></i> (in <!--del_lnk--> Devanagari, <span class="Unicode">&#x938;&#x94D;&#x935;&#x938;&#x94D;&#x924;&#x93F;&#x915;</span>), meaning any lucky or auspicious object, and in particular a mark made on persons and things to denote good luck. It is composed of <i>su-</i> (cognate with <!--del_lnk--> Greek <i>&epsilon;&upsilon;-</i>, &quot;eu-&quot;), meaning &quot;good, well&quot; and <i>asti</i> a verbal abstract to the root <i>as</i> &quot;to be&quot;; <i>svasti</i> thus means &quot;well-being&quot;. The suffix <i>-ka</i> forms a diminutive, and <i>svastika</i> might thus (andre) be translated literally as &quot;little thing associated with well-being&quot;, corresponding roughly to &quot;lucky charm&quot;, or &quot;thing that is auspicious&quot;. The suffix <i>-tika</i> also literally means <i>mark</i>; therefore a sometimes alternate name for swastika in India is <i>shubhtika</i> (literally <i>good mark</i>). The word first appears in the Classical Sanskrit (in the <a href="../../wp/r/Ramayana.htm" title="Ramayana">Ramayana</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Mahabharata.htm" title="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a> epics).<p>Alternative historical <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> spellings of the Sanskrit word include <i>suastika</i> and <i>svastica</i>. Alternative names for the shape are:<ul>
       <li><i>Black Spider</i>, to various peoples in middle and western Europe<li><i>crooked cross</i><li><i>cross cramponned,</i> <i>~nn&eacute;e</i>, or <i>~nny</i> (in <a href="../../wp/h/Heraldry.htm" title="Heraldry">heraldry</a>), as each arm resembles a <i>crampon</i> or angle-iron. (Compare <i>Winkelma&szlig;kreuz</i> in <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a>)<li><i>cross gammadion</i>, <i>tetragammadion</i> or just <i>gammadion</i>, as each arm resembles the <!--del_lnk--> Greek letter &Gamma; (<i><!--del_lnk--> gamma</i>).

      <p>The ubiquity of the swastika symbol is easily explained by it being a very simple symbol that will arise independently in any basketweaving society. The swastika is a repeating design, created by the edges of the reeds in a square basket-weave. Other theories attempt to establish a connection via <!--del_lnk--> cultural diffusion or an explanation along the lines of <a href="../../wp/c/Carl_Jung.htm" title="Carl Jung">Carl Jung</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> collective unconscious.<p>While the existence of the swastika symbol in the <!--del_lnk--> Americas may be explained by the basket-weave theory, its American presence weakens the cultural diffusion theory. While some have proposed that the swastika was secretly transferred to <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a> by an early seafaring civilization on Eurasia, a separate but parallel development is considered the most likely explanation.<p>Yet another explanation is suggested by <a href="../../wp/c/Carl_Sagan.htm" title="Carl Sagan">Carl Sagan</a> in his book <i>Comet</i>. Sagan reproduces an ancient <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">Chinese</a> manuscript that shows comet tail varieties: most are variations on simple comet tails, but the last shows the comet nucleus with four bent arms extending from it, recalling a swastika. Sagan suggests that in antiquity a <a href="../../wp/c/Comet.htm" title="Comet">comet</a> could have approached so close to Earth that the jets of gas streaming from it, bent by the comet&#39;s rotation, became visible, leading to the adoption of the swastika as a symbol across the world.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Bob Kobres in <!--del_lnk--> <i>Comets and the Bronze Age Collapse</i> (1992) contends that the swastika-like comet on the Han Dynasty silk comet atlas was labeled a &quot;long tailed pheasant star&quot; due to its resemblance to a <!--del_lnk--> bird&#39;s foot., and further suggests that many swastika and swastika-like motifs may have been representations of bird tracks, including many of those found by Schliemann.<p>Barbara G. Walker, author of <i>The Woman&#39;s Dictionary of Symbols and Sacred Objects</i>, claims that the crux dissimulata, an early swastika, represented the four winds. Concerning the short-armed version of this symbol, known as the gammadion because it is made up of four Greek gammas, Walker says this symbol was an emblem of the ancient goddess and probably represented &quot;the solstices and equinoxes, or the four directions, four elements, and four divine guardians of the world.&quot;<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The discovery of the <!--del_lnk--> Indo-European language group in the 1790s led to a great effort by archaeologists to link the pre-history of <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European</a> peoples to the ancient &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Aryans&quot; (variously referring to the <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Iranians or the <!--del_lnk--> Proto-Indo-Europeans). Following his discovery of objects bearing the swastika in the ruins of <!--del_lnk--> Troy, <!--del_lnk--> Heinrich Schliemann consulted two leading <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> scholars of the day, <!--del_lnk--> Emile Burnouf and <!--del_lnk--> Max M&uuml;ller. Schliemann concluded that the Swastika was a specifically Indo-European symbol. Later discoveries of the motif among the remains of the Hittites and of ancient <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a> seemed to confirm this theory. This idea was taken up by many other writers, and the swastika quickly became popular in the <!--del_lnk--> West, appearing in many designs from the 1880s to the 1920s.<p>These discoveries, and the new popularity of the swastika symbol, led to a widespread desire to ascribe symbolic significance to every example of the motif. In <!--del_lnk--> Germanic countries examples of similar shapes in ancient European artifacts and in folk art were interpreted as emblems of good-luck linked to the Indo-Iranian meaning.<p>Western use of the motif, along with the religious and cultural meanings attached to it, was subverted in the early <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">twentieth century</a> after it was adopted as the emblem of the <!--del_lnk--> Nazi Party (<a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a>: <i>Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei</i>). This association occurred because Nazism stated that the historical Aryans were the forefathers of modern Germans and then proposed that, because of this, the subjugation of the world by Germany was desirable, and even predestined. The swastika was used as a conveniently geometrical and eye-catching symbol to emphasize the so-called Aryan-German correspondence and instill racial pride. Since <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, most <!--del_lnk--> Westerners know the swastika as solely a Nazi symbol, leading to incorrect assumptions about its pre-Nazi use in the West and confusion about its sacred religious and historical status in other cultures.<br clear="all" />

      <p><a href="../../wp/g/Geometry.htm" title="Geometry">Geometrically</a>, the swastika can be regarded as an irregular <!--del_lnk--> icosagon or 20-sided <!--del_lnk--> polygon. The arms are of varying width and are often rectilinear (but need not be). However, the proportions of the Nazi swastika were fixed: they were based on a 5x5 grid.<p>Characteristic is the 90&deg; <!--del_lnk--> rotational symmetry (that is, the symmetry of the <!--del_lnk--> cyclic group <i>C<sub>4h</sub></i>) and <!--del_lnk--> chirality, hence the absence of reflectional <a href="../../wp/s/Symmetry.htm" title="Symmetry">symmetry</a>, and the existence of two versions which are each other&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> mirror image.<p>The mirror-image forms are often described as:<ul>
       <li>left-facing and, as depicted across, right-facing;<li>left-hand and right-hand;<li><!--del_lnk--> clockwise and counterclockwise.</ul>
      <p>&quot;Left-facing&quot; and &quot;right-facing&quot; are used mostly consistently. Looking at an upright swastika, the upper arm clearly faces towards <i>the viewer&#39;s</i> left (&#x534D;) or right (&#x5350;). The other two descriptions are ambiguous as it is unclear if they refer to the direction of the bend in each arm or to the implied rotation of the symbol. If the latter, whether the arms lead or trail remains unclear. The terms are used inconsistently (sometimes even by the same writer) which is confusing and may obfuscate an important point, that the rotation of the swastika may have symbolic relevance.<p>The interpretation of rotational direction may be influenced by the viewer&#39;s own bias. Critics of the swastika may see a right-facing design as an active, even aggressive symbol, slicing like a circular saw in a clockwise manner. A viewer with a more positive bias may consider the right-facing arms to be a passive design, rotating like a waterwheel in the opposite direction.<p>Nazi <!--del_lnk--> ensigns had a <!--del_lnk--> through and through image, so each version was present on one side, but the <!--del_lnk--> Nazi flag on land was right-facing on both sides (<!--del_lnk--> , at the bottom).<p>The swastika is, after the simple equilateral cross (the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Greek cross&quot;), the next most commonly found version of the cross.<p>Seen as a cross, the four lines emanating from the centre point to the four <!--del_lnk--> cardinal directions. The most common association is with the <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">Sun</a>.

      <p>The name <!--del_lnk--> sauwastika is sometimes given for the supposedly &quot;evil&quot;, left-facing, form of the swastika (&#x534D;). A common belief is that the left-facing swastika is generally regarded as evil in Hindu tradition. This is because the much more common form in India is the right-facing swastika. Indians of all faiths sometimes use the symbol in both orientations - mostly for symmetry. Buddhists, outside of India, generally use the left-facing swastika over the right-facing swastika although, again, both can be used. Despite this, the misconception that the left-facing swastika is evil is widespread, even among some contemporary Indian communities.<p>Some contemporary writers &mdash; Servando Gonz&aacute;lez, for example &mdash; confuse matters even further by asserting that the right-facing swastika, used by the <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">Nazis</a> is in fact the &quot;evil&quot; sauwastika. (Gonz&aacute;lez &quot;proves&quot; that the left-facing swastika is the sunwise one with reference to a 1930s box of <!--del_lnk--> Standard fireworks from <!--del_lnk--> Sivakasi, India.) This inversion &ndash; whether intentional or not &ndash; might derive from a desire to prove that the Nazis&#39; use of the right-handed swastika was expressive of their &quot;evil&quot; intent. (<i>See also <a href="#Taboo_in_Western_countries" title="">Taboo in Western countries</a>.</i>) But the notion that <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> deliberately inverted the &quot;good left-facing&quot; swastika is wholly unsupported by any historical evidence.<br clear="all" />

      <p>The swastika is common as a design motif in current <!--del_lnk--> Hindu architecture and Indian artwork as well as in ancient Western <a href="../../wp/a/Architecture.htm" title="Architecture">architecture</a>, frequently appearing in <a href="../../wp/m/Mosaic.htm" title="Mosaic">mosaics</a>, <!--del_lnk--> friezes, and other works across the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_history.htm" title="Ancient history">ancient</a> world. <!--del_lnk--> Ancient Greek architectural designs are replete with interlinking swastika motifs. Related symbols in classical Western architecture include the <!--del_lnk--> cross, the three-legged triskele or <!--del_lnk--> triskelion and the rounded <!--del_lnk--> lauburu. The swastika symbol is also known in these contexts by a number of names, especially <i>gammadion</i>.<p>In <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">Chinese</a>, <a href="../../wp/k/Korea.htm" title="Korea">Korean</a>, and <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japanese</a> art, the swastika is often found as part of a repeating pattern. One common pattern, called <i>sayagata</i> in Japanese, comprises left and right facing swastikas joined by lines. As the negative space between the lines has a distinctive shape, the sayagata pattern is sometimes called the &quot;key fret&quot; motif in English.<p>The swastika symbol was found extensively in the ruins of the ancient city of <!--del_lnk--> Troy and can also be found in some of the mosaics in the ruins of <a href="../../wp/p/Pompeii.htm" title="Pompeii">Pompeii</a>.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Roman art and architecture, and in <!--del_lnk--> Romanesque and <!--del_lnk--> Gothic art in the West, isolated swastikas are relatively rare, and the swastika is more commonly found as a repeated element in a border or tessellation. The swastika often represented perpetual motion, reflecting the design of a rotating windmill or watermill. A design of interlocking swastikas is one of several <!--del_lnk--> tessellations on the floor of the cathedral of <!--del_lnk--> Amiens, France. A border of linked swastikas was a common Roman architectural motif, and can be seen in more recent buildings as a neoclassical element. A swastika border is one form of <!--del_lnk--> meander, and the individual swastikas in such border are sometimes called <!--del_lnk--> <i>Greek keys</i>.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Laguna Bridge in <!--del_lnk--> Yuma, Arizona was built in <!--del_lnk--> 1905 by the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">U.S.</a> Reclamation Department and is decorated with a row of swastikas.<p>Metal <!--del_lnk--> typeface Swastika borders were used by <!--del_lnk--> U.S. printers in the early 1900&#39;s.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Ceramic tiles with a swastika design have appeared in many parts of the world including the United States in the early part of the 20th century. When originally installed, the tiles are typically a minor decorative element. The durable tiles have been a source of controversy when they are assumed to be <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazi">Nazi</a> symbols.<p>Swastika tiles adorn the <!--del_lnk--> New Jersey Statehouse in <!--del_lnk--> Trenton, built in the 1930&#39;s. A <!--del_lnk--> newspaper article in <!--del_lnk--> The Press of Atlantic City notes that the statehouse tiles were created by the local Mueller Tile Mosaic Company, using an innovative technique that combined <!--del_lnk--> glazing and deep carving to create a photographic-like sense of depth. The tiles were installed throughout the <!--del_lnk--> US and <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>.<p>Reprints of tile catalogs, including the 1930 Mueller Tile <!--del_lnk--> Faience Inserts catalogue are available from the non-profit <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a> based <!--del_lnk--> Tile Heritage Foundation&#39;s website. At least two other US tile manufacturers also produced swastika tiles among their many designs. The Tile Heritage Foundation website features sample pages from more than 90 tile catalogs, including two that include swastika designs. The 1920 Wheatley Pottery Company of <!--del_lnk--> Cincinnati <!--del_lnk--> Ohio, and the 1928 catalog from the Cambridge-Wheatley Company of <!--del_lnk--> Covington, Kentucky, which marketed Wheatley tiles.<ul>

       <li>In May of 2006, five <!--del_lnk--> terra cotta tiles were removed from <!--del_lnk--> St. Mary&#39;s Cathedral in <!--del_lnk--> St. Cloud Minnesota, the oldest <!--del_lnk--> parish in the community. The upper church, constructed in the late 1920&#39;s, included a number of decorative tiles including a series of ten that depicted ancient forms of the <!--del_lnk--> cross. Located near the eaves, the tiles represented the crux gammata, also known as the <!--del_lnk--> Gammadion, &quot;hooked cross&quot;. The swastika tiles alternated with a related design featuring the <!--del_lnk--> Lauburu or &quot;Basque cross&quot;. The building was designed in the Italian <!--del_lnk--> Romanesque style by a local architect who added <!--del_lnk--> Art Deco features, including the ancient symbols, sunburst brick patterns and zig zag details.</ul>

       <dd>Three of the tiles were destroyed in the process of removal, one was put on permanent display at the church. The removal was prompted in part by criticism from some current and former faculty at <!--del_lnk--> St. Cloud State University, where <!--del_lnk--> the university&#39;s electronic diversity newsletter featured a series of articles, including a <!--del_lnk--> history of the swastika that claimed by 1920 it was already &quot;the symbol of <!--del_lnk--> Aryan conquest and mastery&quot;.

       <li>In November 1998 the <!--del_lnk--> Rome, New York <!--del_lnk--> Sentinel newspaper reported that swastika tiles were removed from the Gansevoort Elementary School where they had survived on a school floor for 84 years. The <!--del_lnk--> newspaper&#39;s editorial responded: <i>&quot;School officials lost a chance to enlighten the public. A recommendation earlier this year by a committee of Gansevoort staff and parents to &quot;leave the floor as is&quot; and install a display about the history of the swastika was ignored.

The swastika is considered extremely holy and auspicious by all Hindus, and is regularly used to decorate all sorts of items to do with Hindu culture. It is used in all Hindu <!--del_lnk--> yantras and religious designs. Throughout the subcontinent of India it can be seen on the sides of temples, written on religious scriptures, on gift items, and on letterhead. The Hindu god <a href="../../wp/g/Ganesha.htm" title="Ganesh">Ganesh</a> is often shown as sitting on a lotus flower on a bed of swastikas.<p>The swastika is found all over <!--del_lnk--> Hindu temples, signs, altars, pictures and iconography where it is sacred. It is used in all Hindu weddings, festivals, ceremonies, houses and doorways, clothing and jewelry, motor transport and even decorations on food items like cakes and pastries. Amongst the Hindus of <!--del_lnk--> Bengal, it is common to see the name &quot;swastika&quot; applied to a slightly different symbol, which has the same significance as the common swastika, and both symbols are used as auspicious signs. This symbol looks something like a stick figure of a human being. &quot;Swastika&quot; is a common given name amongst Bengalis and a prominent literary magazine in Calcutta is called the <i>Swastika</i>. The stick figure, however, is not mainstream usage in India.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Aum symbol is also sacred in Hinduism. While Aum is representative of a single primordial tone of creation, the Swastika is a pure geometrical mark and has no syllabic tone associated with it. The Swastika is one of the 108 symbols of <!--del_lnk--> Lord Vishnu and represents the sun&#39;s rays without which there would be no life.<p><a id="Buddhism" name="Buddhism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Buddhism</span></h3>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Jainism gives even more prominence to the swastika than Hinduism. It is a symbol of the seventh Jina (Saint), the <i>Tirthankara Suparsva</i>. It is considered to be one of the 24 auspicious marks and the emblem of the seventh <!--del_lnk--> arhat of the present age. All Jain temples and holy books must contain the swastika and ceremonies typically begin and end with creating a swastika mark several times with rice around the altar. Jains use rice to make a swastika (also known as &quot;Sathiyo&quot; in the state of Gujarat, India) in front of idols in a temple. Jains then put an offering on top of this swastika - this offering is usually a fruit, a sweet (mithai), a dried fruit or sometimes a coin or currency note.<p><a id="Abrahamic_religions" name="Abrahamic_religions"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Abrahamic religions</span></h3>

A number of variations on the flag have been used over the years; red top and bottom bands instead of orange were previously used, and in 1942 a ring (representing the traditional Kuna nose-ring) was added to the centre of the flag to distance it from the symbol of the Nazi party.<p><a id="Pre-Christian_European_religions" name="Pre-Christian_European_religions"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Pre-Christian European religions</span></h3>

      <p>The ancient symbol used by the <!--del_lnk--> G&oacute;ral societies was adopted by the <!--del_lnk--> Polish mountain infantry units in the 1920s.

A distinctive blue swastika was a background emblem of <!--del_lnk--> The Air defence and Anti-gas League (1928-1939, LOPP), which had circa 1.5 million members in 1937.<p>Outside of the military traditions, the mountaineer&#39;s swastika also influenced a number of other symbols and logos used on Polish soil. Among such was the logo of the IGNIS publishing company (est. 1822), and the personal symbol of <!--del_lnk--> Mieczys&#x142;aw Kar&#x142;owicz, a notable composer and admirer of the Tatras. After his tragic death in the mountains in 1909, the place of his death was marked by a memorial stone and a swastika <!--del_lnk--> . Finally, it was also used as a personal logo and <!--del_lnk--> ex libris by <!--del_lnk--> Walery Eliasz-Radzikowski of <!--del_lnk--> Boreyko Coat of Arms, a Polish author who was also strongly influenced by the Polish mountaineers and had a swastika on the dust jackets of all his books and letters.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Nazi Party (<i>Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei</i> or <i>NSDAP</i>) formally adopted the swastika or <i><b>Hakenkreuz</b></i> (hooked cross) in 1920. This was used on the party&#39;s flag (<i>right</i>), badge, and armband. It had also been used unofficially by the NSDAP and its predecessor, the German Workers Party, <i>Deutsche Arbeiterpartei</i> (<i>DAP</i>).<p>In <i><!--del_lnk--> Mein Kampf</i>, <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> wrote:<dl>
       <dd>&quot;I myself, meanwhile, after innumerable attempts, had laid down a final form; a flag with a red background, a white disk, and a black swastika in the middle. After long trials I also found a definite proportion between the size of the flag and the size of the white disk, as well as the shape and thickness of the swastika.&quot;</dl>
      <p>(Red, white, and black were the colors of the flag of the old <!--del_lnk--> German Empire.)<p>The use of the swastika was associated by Nazi theorists with their conjecture of Aryan cultural descent of the German people. Following the <!--del_lnk--> Nordicist version of the <!--del_lnk--> Aryan invasion theory, the Nazis claimed that the early Aryans of <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, from whose Vedic tradition the swastika sprang, were the prototypical white invaders. It was also widely believed that the <!--del_lnk--> Indian caste system had originated as a means to avoid racial mixing. The concept of <!--del_lnk--> Racial purity was an ideology central to Nazism though it is now considered <!--del_lnk--> unscientific. For Rosenberg, the Aryans of India were both a model to be imitated and a warning of the dangers of the spiritual and racial &quot;confusion&quot; that, he believed, arose from the close proximity of races.<div class="floatleft"><span><a class="image" href="../../images/279/27934.jpg.htm" title=""><img alt="" height="306" longdesc="/wiki/Image:Adolf_Hitler_in_Yugoslavia_crop.JPG" src="../../images/279/27934.jpg" width="120" /></a></span></div>
      <p>Thus, they saw fit to co-opt the sign as a symbol of the Aryan <!--del_lnk--> master race. The use of the swastika as a symbol of the <!--del_lnk--> Aryan race dates back to writings of <!--del_lnk--> Emile Burnouf. Following many other writers, the German nationalist poet <!--del_lnk--> Guido von List believed it to be a uniquely Aryan symbol. When Hitler created a flag for the Nazi party, he sought to incorporate both the swastika and &quot;those revered colors expressive of our homage to the glorious past and which once brought so much honour to the German nation&quot; (red, white and black). He also stated that &quot;the red expressed the social thought underlying the movement. White the national thought. And the swastika signified the mission allotted to us &ndash; the struggle for the victory of Aryan mankind and at the same time the triumph of the ideal of creative work which is in itself and always will be anti-Semitic.&quot; (<i>Mein Kampf</i>).<p>In fact, the swastika was already in use as a symbol of German <i>v&ouml;lkisch</i> nationalists movements (<i><!--del_lnk--> V&ouml;lkische Bewegung</i>). In <i>Deutschland Erwache</i> (<!--del_lnk--> ISBN 0-912138-69-6), Ulric of England (<i>sic</i>) says &mdash;<div class="thumb tleft">

       <dd>&hellip; what inspired Hitler to use the swastika as a symbol for the NSDAP was its use by the <!--del_lnk--> Thule Society (<a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">Ger.</a> Thule-Gesellschaft) since there were many connections between them and the DAP &hellip; from 1919 until the summer of 1921 Hitler used the special Nationalsozialistische library of <!--del_lnk--> Dr. Friedrich Krohn, a very active member of the <i>Thule-Gesellschaft</i>, &hellip; Dr. Krohn was also the dentist from Sternberg who was named by Hitler in <i>Mein Kampf</i> as the designer of a flag very similar to one that Hitler designed in 1920 &hellip; during the summer of 1920, the first party flag was shown at Lake Tegernsee &hellip; these home-made &hellip; early flags were not preserved, the <i>Ortsgruppe M&uuml;nchen</i> flag was generally regarded as the first flag of the Party.</dl>
      <p>Jos&eacute; Manuel Erbez says &mdash;<dl>
       <dd>The first time the swastika was used with an &quot;Aryan&quot; meaning was on <!--del_lnk--> December 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1907, when the self-named <!--del_lnk--> Order of the New Templars, a secret society founded by [Adolf Joseph] Lanz von Liebenfels, hoisted at Werfenstein Castle (<a href="../../wp/a/Austria.htm" title="Austria">Austria</a>) a yellow flag with a swastika and four fleurs-de-lys.</dl>
      <p>However, Liebenfels was drawing on an already established use of the symbol.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 14 March <!--del_lnk--> 1933, shortly after Hitler&#39;s appointment as Chancellor of Germany, the NSDAP flag was hoisted alongside Germany&#39;s national colors. It was adopted as the sole national flag on 15 September 1935.<p>The swastika was used for badges and flags throughout Nazi Germany, particularly for government and military organizations, but also for &quot;popular&quot; organizations such as the <i>Reichsbund Deutsche J&auml;gerschaft</i>.<p>While the DAP and the NSDAP had used both right-facing and left-facing swastikas, the right-facing swastika is used consistently from 1920 onwards. However, Ralf Stelter notes that the swastika flag used on land had a right-facing swastika on both sides, while the ensign (naval flag) had it printed through so that you would see a left-facing swastika when looking at the ensign with the flagpole to the right.<p>Several variants are found:<ul>
       <li>a 45&deg; black swastika on a white disc as in the NSDAP and national flags;<li>a 45&deg; black swastika on a white lozenge (e.g., <!--del_lnk--> Hitler Youth);<li>a 45&deg; black swastika with a white outline was painted on the tail of aircraft of the <a href="../../wp/l/Luftwaffe.htm" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>;<li>a 45&deg; black swastika outlined by thin white and black lines on a white disc (e.g., the German War Ensign);<li>an upright black swastika outlined by thin white and black lines on a white disc (e.g., Hitler&#39;s personal flag, in which a gold wreath encircles the swastika; the <i>Schutzstaffel</i>; and the <i>Reichsdienstflagge</i>, in which a black circle encircles the swastika);<li>small gold, silver, black, or white 45&deg; swastikas, often lying on or being held by an eagle, on many badges and flags.<li>a swastika with curved outer arms forming a broken circle, as worn by the <!--del_lnk--> SS <i>Nordland</i> Division. (See photo at &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Nordland Reenactors&quot;.)</ul>
      <p>There were attempts to amalgamate Nazi and Hindu use of the swastika. Notably by <!--del_lnk--> Savitri Devi Mukherji who declared Hitler an <!--del_lnk--> avatar of <!--del_lnk--> Vishnu (see <!--del_lnk--> Nazi mysticism).<p><a id="Taboo_in_Western_countries" name="Taboo_in_Western_countries"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Taboo in Western countries</span></h2>
      <p>Because of its use by Hitler and the <!--del_lnk--> Nazis and, in modern times, by <!--del_lnk--> neo-Nazis and other <!--del_lnk--> hate groups, for many people in the West, the swastika is associated primarily with <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">Nazism</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> white supremacy in general. Hence, outside historical contexts, it has become <!--del_lnk--> taboo in Western countries. The historical context of architectural decorations has sometimes been ignored in local efforts to remove swastikas from pre-<a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> buildings.<p><a id="Germany" name="Germany"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Germany</span></h3>
      <p>The German postwar <!--del_lnk--> criminal code makes the public showing of the <i>Hakenkreuz</i> (the swastika) and other Nazi symbols illegal and punishable, except for scholarly reasons. It is even censored from the lithographs on boxes of model kits, and the decals that come in the box. The swastikas on Hindu and Jain temples are exempt, as religious symbols cannot be banned in Germany.<p>A German fashion company is being investigated for using traditional British-made folded leather buttons after complaints that they resembled swastikas. In response, <!--del_lnk--> Esprit destroyed two hundred thousand catalogues.<p>A controversy was stirred by the decision of several police departments to begin inquiries against anti-fascists. In late <!--del_lnk--> 2005 police raided the offices of the punklabel and mailorder &quot;Nix Gut Records&quot; and confiscated merchandise depicting crossed-out swastikas and fists smashing swastikas. In <!--del_lnk--> 2006 the <!--del_lnk--> Stade police department started an inquiry against anti-fascist youths using a placard, depicting a person dumping a swastika into a trashcan. The placard was displayed in opposition to the campaign of right-wing nationalist parties for local elections.<p>On Friday, <!--del_lnk--> March 17, <!--del_lnk--> 2006 member of the <!--del_lnk--> Bundestag <!--del_lnk--> Claudia Roth reported herself to the German police for displaying a crossed-out swastika on multiple demonstrations against Neo-Nazis, and subsequently got the Bundestag to suspend her immunity from prosecution. She intends to show the absurdity of charging anti-fascists with using fascist symbols: &quot;We don&#39;t need prosecution of non-violent young people engaging against right-wing extremism.&quot;<p>The relevant excerpt of the German criminal code reads:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>In <a href="../../wp/f/Finland.htm" title="Finland">Finland</a>, the Finnish Airforce units still wear a swastika on their <!--del_lnk--> Colours.  In addition, the shoulder insignia of the Airforce Headquarters bears a swastika design.  In 1945 the Air Force changed its national emblem to a roundel but the use of swastika in some other insignia was continued. In <!--del_lnk--> 1958, president <!--del_lnk--> Urho Kekkonen inaugurated the Colours of the Airforce units which feature a swastika design. The latest Colour of this pattern was inaugurated by president <!--del_lnk--> Tarja Halonen in <!--del_lnk--> 25 October <!--del_lnk--> 2005 for the newly formed <!--del_lnk--> Air Warfare School.  Also the <!--del_lnk--> Utti Jaeger Regiment, responsible for training special forces, bears a swastika-like emblem on her Colour.<p>In 1963 the chain of the Grand Cross of the <!--del_lnk--> Order of the White Rose was changed by replacing the swastika with a <!--del_lnk--> fir branch design.<p><a id="Other_uses" name="Other_uses"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other uses</span></h3>
      <p>Founded in the 1970s, the <!--del_lnk--> Ra&euml;lian Movement, a religious sect believing in the possibility of immortality by scientific progress, used a symbol that was the source of considerable controversy: an interlaced <!--del_lnk--> Star of David and swastika. In 1991, the symbol was changed to remove the swastika and deflect public criticism.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Society for Creative Anachronism, which aims to study and recreate <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Medieval</a> and <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> history, imposes restrictions on its members&#39; use of the swastika on their arms, although some arms dating to the early days of the group have the symbol.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> San Diego, there is a building shaped like a Swastika. It can be found on <!--del_lnk--> Google Earth (32 40&#39;34.09&quot; N, 117 09&#39;27.96 W) or <!--del_lnk--> Google Maps.<p>The powerful symbolism acquired by the swastika has often been used in graphic design and propaganda as a means of <!--del_lnk--> drawing Nazi comparisons; examples include the cover of <!--del_lnk--> Stuart Eizenstat&#39;s 2003 book <i><!--del_lnk--> Imperfect Justice</i>, publicity materials for <!--del_lnk--> Costa-Gavras&#39;s 2002 film <i>Amen</i>, and a billboard that was erected opposite the U.S. Interests Section in <!--del_lnk--> Havana, Cuba, in 2004, which juxtaposed images of the <!--del_lnk--> Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse pictures with a swastika.

      <p>In post-Independence India, electoral ballot papers have been stamped with a round swastika (similar to the Norse sun cross). Thus, that variant of the symbol is connected with political elections. Its use as a symbol of wealth, prosperity and good luck is ubiquitous in India, and the symbol is used as a decorative motif in most traditional Hindu homes and most religious ceremonies. Many businesses and other organisations, like the <!--del_lnk--> Ahmedabad Stock Exchange, use the swastika in their logos. The Red Swastika was also suggested as an emblem of <a href="../../wp/i/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement.htm" title="International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement">International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement</a> in <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, but the idea was not put into practice <!--del_lnk--> .<p><a id="Tajikistan" name="Tajikistan"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Tajikistan</span></h3>
      <p>In 2005 authorities in <a href="../../wp/t/Tajikistan.htm" title="Tajikistan">Tajikistan</a> called for the widespread adoption of the swastika as a national <!--del_lnk--> symbol. President <!--del_lnk--> Emomali Rahmonov declared the swastika an &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Aryan&quot; <!--del_lnk--> symbol and 2006 to be &quot;the year of Aryan culture&quot; a time to: &ldquo;study and popularize Aryan contributions to the history of the world civilization; to raise a new generation (of Tajiks) with the spirit of national self-determination; and to develop deeper ties with other ethnicities and cultures.&rdquo;<!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika&quot;</div>
