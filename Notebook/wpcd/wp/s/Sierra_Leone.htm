      <p><b>Sierra Leone</b>, officially the <b>Republic of Sierra Leone</b>, is a country in <!--del_lnk--> West Africa. It is bordered by <a href="../../wp/g/Guinea.htm" title="Guinea">Guinea</a> on the north and <a href="../../wp/l/Liberia.htm" title="Liberia">Liberia</a> on the south, with the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> on the west. The name Sierra Leone was adapted from the <a href="../../wp/p/Portuguese_language.htm" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a> name for the country: <i>Serra Leoa</i>. The literal meaning is &quot;Lion Mountain.&quot; During the 1700s Sierra Leone was an important centre of the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_slave_trade.htm" title="Atlantic slave trade">Transatlantic Slave Trade</a>. The capital <a href="../../wp/f/Freetown.htm" title="Freetown">Freetown</a> was founded in <!--del_lnk--> 1792 by the <!--del_lnk--> Sierra Leone Company as a home for <!--del_lnk--> Black Britons who had fought for the <!--del_lnk--> British in the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Revolutionary_War.htm" title="American Revolutionary War">American Revolutionary War</a>.<p>In 1808, Freetown became a <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British</a> <!--del_lnk--> Crown Colony, and in 1896, the interior of the country became a British <!--del_lnk--> Protectorate. The Crown Colony and Protectorate joined and gained <!--del_lnk--> independence in <!--del_lnk--> 1961. From <!--del_lnk--> 1991 to <!--del_lnk--> 2002, the country suffered greatly under a devastating <!--del_lnk--> civil war. To end the civil war, <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">UN</a> and <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> forces disarmed 17,000 militia and rebels, in the largest UN <!--del_lnk--> peacekeeping act of the decade. The average life span of a Sierra Leonean is 38 years for men and 42 years for women. <!--del_lnk--> <script type="text/javascript">

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Temne were living along the northern coast of present-day Sierra Leone when the first <!--del_lnk--> Portuguese navigators reached the region in <!--del_lnk--> 1460. The Portuguese landed on the Sierra Leone <!--del_lnk--> Peninsula, naming it Serra Lyoa (meaning lion mountains) after the mountains located there. Beginning c.1500, <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="European">European</a> traders stopped regularly on the peninsula, exchanging cloth and metal goods for ivory, timber, and small numbers of <!--del_lnk--> slaves. Beginning in the mid-16th century, <!--del_lnk--> Mande-speaking people migrated into Sierra Leone from present-day Liberia, and they eventually established the states of Bullom, Loko, Boure, and Sherbro. In the early 17th century, British traders became increasingly active along the Sierra Leone coast. Sierra Leone was a major source of <!--del_lnk--> slaves for the <!--del_lnk--> transatlantic slave trade during the 17th and 18th centuries.<p>Following the <!--del_lnk--> American Revolutionary War (1775&ndash;83) attempts were made to resettle <!--del_lnk--> freed slaves who had sided with <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> in <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>. In <!--del_lnk--> 1787, 400 persons (including 280 black men, 70 white women, and 50 black women) left England for Sierra Leone. The ones who could finish the voyage and arrive at the <!--del_lnk--> Sierra Leone Peninsula, bought land from local Temne leaders, and established the Province of Freedom near present-day <a href="../../wp/f/Freetown.htm" title="Freetown">Freetown</a>. The settlement did not fare well, and most of the inhabitants died of disease in the first year. A renewed attempt at settlement was made in <!--del_lnk--> 1792, when about 1,100 freed slaves under the leadership of the <!--del_lnk--> abolitionist <!--del_lnk--> John Clarkson landed on the peninsula and founded Freetown. They were joined by about 500 free blacks from <a href="../../wp/j/Jamaica.htm" title="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> in 1800. The new <!--del_lnk--> colony was controlled by the Sierra Leone Company, which forcefully held off the Temne while the settlers supported themselves by <!--del_lnk--> farming.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1807, Great Britain outlawed the <!--del_lnk--> slave trade, and in early <!--del_lnk--> 1808 the British government took over Freetown from the financially troubled company, using it as a naval base for anti-slavery patrols. Between <!--del_lnk--> 1808 and <!--del_lnk--> 1864 approximately 50,000 liberated slaves settled at Freetown. Protestant missionaries were active there, and in <!--del_lnk--> 1827 they founded <!--del_lnk--> Fourah Bay College, where Africans were educated and became active as <!--del_lnk--> missionaries, <!--del_lnk--> traders, and <!--del_lnk--> civil servants along the Sierra Leone coast and on <!--del_lnk--> Sherbro Island as well as in other regions in West Africa, especially among the <!--del_lnk--> Yoruba people.<p><a id="The_Colonial_Era" name="The_Colonial_Era"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">The Colonial Era</span></h2>
      <p>During the periods <!--del_lnk--> 1821 to <!--del_lnk--> 1827, <!--del_lnk--> 1843 to <!--del_lnk--> 1850, and <!--del_lnk--> 1866 to <!--del_lnk--> 1874, British holdings on the <!--del_lnk--> Gold Coast (now <a href="../../wp/g/Ghana.htm" title="Ghana">Ghana</a>) were placed under the governor of Sierra Leone. In <!--del_lnk--> 1863 an advisory legislative council was established in Sierra Leone. The British were reluctant to assume added responsibility by increasing the size of the colony, but in 1896 the interior was proclaimed a <!--del_lnk--> British protectorate, mainly in order to forestall <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> ambitions in the region, and the Colony and Protectorate of Sierra Leone was established.<p>The protectorate was ruled &ldquo;indirectly&rdquo; (i.e., through the rulers of the numerous small states, rather than by creating an entirely new administrative structure) and a hut tax was imposed in <!--del_lnk--> 1898 to pay for administrative costs. The Africans protested the tax in 1898 and and fought the British in a war later became known as the <!--del_lnk--> Hut Tax War of 1898. Led in the north by <!--del_lnk--> Bai Bureh and in the south by the <!--del_lnk--> Poro secret society; the British quickly emerged victorious and there were no further major armed protests. Under the British, little economic development was undertaken in the protectorate until the 1950s, although a railroad was built and the production for export of palm products and peanuts was encouraged.<p>After <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Africans were given more political responsibility, and educational opportunities were enlarged. In the economic sphere, mining (especially of diamonds and iron ore) increased greatly. The Creoles of the colony, who had been largely excluded from higher government posts in favour of the British, sought a larger voice in the affairs of Sierra Leone. A constitution adopted in <!--del_lnk--> 1951 gave additional power to Africans. However, the Creoles were a small minority in the combined colony and protectorate, and in the elections of 1<!--del_lnk--> 951 the protectorate-based Sierra Leone Peoples party (SLPP), led by <!--del_lnk--> Sir <!--del_lnk--> Milton Margai (a <!--del_lnk--> Mende), emerged victorious.<p><a id="An_Independent_Nation" name="An_Independent_Nation"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">An Independent Nation</span></h2>
      <p>On Apr. 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1961, Sierra Leone became an independent nation, with Milton Margai as <!--del_lnk--> prime minister. He died three years later in <!--del_lnk--> 1964 and was succeeded by his brother, <!--del_lnk--> Albert Margai. Margai was highly criticized during his reign; he was accused of <!--del_lnk--> corruption and of a policy of <!--del_lnk--> affirmative action in favour of the <!--del_lnk--> Mende tribe. Following the <!--del_lnk--> 1967 general elections, the Governor General <!--del_lnk--> Henry Josiah Lightfoot Boston declared <!--del_lnk--> Siaka Stevens candidate of the <!--del_lnk--> All Peoples Congress (APC) and <!--del_lnk--> Mayor of <a href="../../wp/f/Freetown.htm" title="Freetown">Freetown</a> as the new Prime Minister of Sierra Leone. However, a <!--del_lnk--> military coup led by <!--del_lnk--> Brigadier <!--del_lnk--> David Lansana in support of Margai ousted Stevens a few minutes after he took office.<p>The Lansana government itself was soon toppled and replaced by a National Reformation Council (NRC) headed by <!--del_lnk--> Brigadier <!--del_lnk--> Andrew Juxon-Smith In <!--del_lnk--> 1968. An army revolt overthrew the NRC and returned the nation to parliamentary government, with Siaka Stevens as prime minister. The following years were marked by considerable <!--del_lnk--> unrest, caused by <!--del_lnk--> ethnic and army disaffection with the central government.<p>After an attempted coup in <!--del_lnk--> 1971, parliament declared Sierra Leone to be a <!--del_lnk--> Republic, with Siaka Stevens as president. <!--del_lnk--> Guinean troops requested by Stevens to support his government were in the country from <!--del_lnk--> 1971 to <!--del_lnk--> 1973. Stevens&#39;s APC party swept the 1973 parliamentary elections, creating a <!--del_lnk--> de facto one-party state; a <!--del_lnk--> 1978 referendum made the APC the only legal party in Sierra Leone.<p>Siaka Probyn Stevens, who had been President of Sierra Leone for 18 years, retired from that position in November 1985, although he continued his role as chairman of the ruling APC party. In August 1985, the APC named military commander <!--del_lnk--> Major General <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Saidu Momoh, Stevens&#39; own choice, as the party candidate to succeed him. Momoh was elected President in a one-party referendum on October 1, 1985. A formal inauguration was held in January 1986, and new parliamentary elections were held in May 1986.<p>In October 1990, President Momoh set up a constitutional review commission to review the 1978 one-party constitution with a view to broadening the existing political process, guaranteeing fundamental <a href="../../wp/h/Human_rights.htm" title="Human rights">human rights</a> and the rule of law, and strengthening and consolidating the democratic foundation and structure of the nation. The commission, in its report presented January <!--del_lnk--> 1991, recommended re-establishment of a multi-party system of government. Based on that recommendation, a constitution was approved by Parliament in July <!--del_lnk--> 1991 and <!--del_lnk--> ratified in September; it became effective on <!--del_lnk--> October 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1991.<p><a id="Civil_War" name="Civil_War"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Civil War</span></h2>

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> April 29, <!--del_lnk--> 1992, a group of young military officers, led by 25 year old <!--del_lnk--> Captain <!--del_lnk--> Valentine Strasser apparently frustrated by failure to deal with rebels, launched a military coup, which sent Momoh into exile in <a href="../../wp/g/Guinea.htm" title="Guinea">Guinea</a> and established the <!--del_lnk--> National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC) as Strassar <!--del_lnk--> President. On January 1996, after nearly four years in power, President Strassar was ousted in a coup led by his defence minister <!--del_lnk--> Brigadier <!--del_lnk--> Julius Maada Bio.<p>Promises of a return to civilian rule were fulfilled by Bio, who handed power over to <!--del_lnk--> Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, of the Sierra Leone People&#39;s party, after the conclusion of presidential elections in early 1996. Kabbah&#39;s government reached a cease-fire in the war with <!--del_lnk--> Corporal <!--del_lnk--> Foday Sankoh-lead, <!--del_lnk--> Revolutionary United Front (RUF), which had launched its first attacks in <!--del_lnk--> 1991; rebel terror attacks continued, however, apparently aided by <a href="../../wp/l/Liberia.htm" title="Liberia">Liberia</a>.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> May 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1997, The <!--del_lnk--> Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC), led by <!--del_lnk--> Major General <!--del_lnk--> Johnny Paul Koroma, overthrew President Kabbah. Koroma suspends the <!--del_lnk--> constitution, bans <!--del_lnk--> demonstrations, abolishes <!--del_lnk--> political parties and invited the <!--del_lnk--> RUF to join the government.<p>The United Nations imposed <!--del_lnk--> sanctions against the military government in October, 1997, and the <!--del_lnk--> Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) sent in forces led by <a href="../../wp/n/Nigeria.htm" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>. The rebels were subdued in February, 1998, and President Kabbah was returned to office in <!--del_lnk--> March.<p>Fighting continued, however, in many parts of the country, with reports of widespread atrocities. Over 6,000 people were killed in fighting in the Freetown area in January, 1999 alone. In March, Nigeria announced it would withdraw its forces by May. A peace accord was signed in July between President Kabbah and Foday Sankoh of the RUF. The agreement granted the rebels seats in a new government and all forces a general amnesty from prosecution. The government had largely ceased functioning effectively, however, and at least half of its territory remained under rebel control.<p>In October, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> agreed to send peacekeepers to help restore order and disarm the rebels. The first of the 6,000-member force began arriving in December, and the Security Council voted in February, 2000, to increase the UN forces to 11,000 (and subsequently to 13,000). In May, when nearly all Nigerian forces had left and UN forces were attempting to disarm the RUF in Eastern Sierra Leone, Sankoh&#39;s forces clashed with the UN troops, and some 500 peacekeepers were taken hostage as the peace accord effectively collapsed.<p>An 800-member British force entered the country to secure Western Freetown and evacuate <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europeans">Europeans</a>; some also acted in support of the forces fighting the RUF, including Koroma&#39;s AFRC group. After Sankoh was <!--del_lnk--> captured in Freetown, the hostages were gradually released by the RUF, but clashes between the UN forces and the RUF continued, and in July the <!--del_lnk--> West Side Boys&mdash;part of the AFRC&mdash;clashed with the peacekeepers. In the same month the <!--del_lnk--> UN Security Council placed a ban on the sale of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone in an attempt to undermine the funding of the RUF. In late August, senor Ruf <!--del_lnk--> commander <!--del_lnk--> Sam Bockarie became head of the RUF; also, British troops training the Sierra Leone army were taken hostage by the West Side Boys, but were freed by a British raid in September.<p>General elections scheduled for early 2001 were postponed, due to the insecurity caused by the civil war. In May, 2001, sanctions were imposed on <a href="../../wp/l/Liberia.htm" title="Liberia">Liberia</a> because of its support for the <!--del_lnk--> rebels, and UN peacekeepers began to make headway in disarming the various factions. Although disarmament of rebel and progovernment militias proceeded slowly and fighting continued to occur, by January, 2002, most of the estimated 45,000 fighters had surrendered their weapons. In a ceremony that month, government and rebel leaders declared the civil war to have officially ended; an estimated 50,000 people died in the conflict.<p>Elections were finally held in May, <!--del_lnk--> 2002. President Kabbah was re-elected, and his <!--del_lnk--> Sierra Leone People&#39;s party won a majority of the parliamentary seats. In June, 2003, the UN ban on the sale of Sierra Leone diamonds expired and was not renewed. The UN disarmament and rehabilitation program for Sierra Leone&#39;s fighters was completed in February, 2004, by which time another 70,000 former combatants had been helped. UN forces returned primary responsibility for security in the area around the capital to Sierra Leone&#39;s police and armed forces] in September, 2004; it was the last part of the country to be turned over. Some UN peacekeepers remained to assist the Sierra Leone government until the end of 2005. Because the political unrest of Sierra Leone in recent years U.S., U.K. and Australian embassies all currently discourage travel to Sierra Leone.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>

      <p>Roughly circular in shape, Sierra Leone has an area of almost 30,000 square miles.

The beginning and end of the rainy season is marked by strong <!--del_lnk--> thunderstorms not unlike those of the hot summer period on the US eastern seaboard.

      <p>Sierra Leone is emerging from a protracted civil war and is showing signs of a successful transition. Investor and consumer confidence continue to rise, adding impetus to the country&rsquo;s economic recovery. In addition to this there is greater freedom of movement and the successful rehabilitation and resettlement of residential areas. In 2001 Sierra Leone attracted US$4 million in foreign direct investment. The country has also enjoyed an improvement in the terms of trade as a result of the lower of international petroleum prices.<p>The country&rsquo;s main economic sectors include <a href="../../wp/d/Diamond.htm" title="Diamond">diamond</a> mining, <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a> and fisheries. The mining of diamonds, bauxite and rutile provides the major source of hard currency. Agriculture employs two-thirds of the country&rsquo;s six million strong population with most involved in subsistence agriculture. The sector accounted for 51% of the country&rsquo;s GDP. Sierra Leone&rsquo;s manufacturing sector continues to develop and consists mainly of the processing of raw materials and of light manufacturing for the domestic market. In 2002 the country&rsquo;s GDP was US$789.4 million.<p>Despite its successes and development, the Sierra Leone economy still faces some significant challenges. There is a high rate of unemployment particularly among the youth and ex-combatants. Authorities have been slow to implement reforms in the civil service and the pace of the privatisation programme is also slacking and donors have urged its advancement.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>
