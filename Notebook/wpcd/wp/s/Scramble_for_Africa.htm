      <p>The <b>Scramble for Africa</b> (or the <b>Race for Africa</b>) was the proliferation of conflicting European claims to African territory during the <!--del_lnk--> New Imperialism period, between the <!--del_lnk--> 1880s and the start of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>.<p>The latter half of the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a> saw the transition from the &quot;informal&quot; imperialism of control through military influence and economic dominance to that of direct rule. Attempts to mediate imperial competition, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Berlin Conference (<!--del_lnk--> 1884 - <!--del_lnk--> 1885) among the <!--del_lnk--> United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the <!--del_lnk--> French Third Republic and the <!--del_lnk--> German Empire, failed to establish definitively the competing powers&#39; claims. Disputes over Africa was one of the factors leading to the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">First World War</a>.<p>

      <p>The opening of Africa to Western exploration and exploitation had begun in earnest at the end of the <a href="../../wp/1/18th_century.htm" title="18th century">18th century</a>. By <!--del_lnk--> 1835, <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europeans</a> had mapped most of northwestern Africa. Among the most famous of the European explorers was <a href="../../wp/d/David_Livingstone.htm" title="David Livingstone">David Livingstone</a>, who charted the vast interior and <!--del_lnk--> Serpa Pinto, who crossed both <a href="../../wp/s/Southern_Africa.htm" title="Southern Africa">Southern Africa</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Central Africa on a difficult expedition, mapping much of the interior of the continent. Arduous expeditions in the 1850s and 1860s by <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_Francis_Burton.htm" title="Richard Francis Burton">Richard Burton</a>, <!--del_lnk--> John Speke and <!--del_lnk--> James Grant located the <a href="../../wp/a/African_Great_Lakes.htm" title="African Great Lakes">great central lakes</a> and the source of the <a href="../../wp/n/Nile.htm" title="Nile">Nile</a>. By the end of the century, Europeans had charted the <a href="../../wp/n/Nile.htm" title="Nile">Nile</a> from its source, the courses of the <a href="../../wp/n/Niger_River.htm" title="Niger River">Niger</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Congo_River.htm" title="Congo River">Congo</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Zambezi Rivers had been traced, and the world now realized the <!--del_lnk--> vast resources of Africa.<p>However, on the eve of the New Imperialist scramble for Africa, only ten percent of the continent was under the control of Western nations. In <!--del_lnk--> 1875, the most important holdings were <!--del_lnk--> Algeria, whose conquest by <!--del_lnk--> France had started in the 1830s &mdash; despite <!--del_lnk--> Abd al-Qadir&#39;s strong resistance and the <!--del_lnk--> Kabyles&#39; rebellion in the 1870s; the <!--del_lnk--> Cape Colony, held by the <!--del_lnk--> United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland; and <a href="../../wp/a/Angola.htm" title="Angola">Angola</a>, held by <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>.<p>Technological advancement facilitated overseas expansionism. <!--del_lnk--> Industrialization brought about rapid advancements in transportation and communication, especially in the forms of <!--del_lnk--> steam navigation, <a href="../../wp/r/Rail_transport.htm" title="Rail transport">railroads</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> telegraphs. Medical advances also were important, especially medicines for <!--del_lnk--> tropical diseases. The development of <!--del_lnk--> quinine, an effective treatment for <a href="../../wp/m/Malaria.htm" title="Malaria">malaria</a>, enabled vast expanses of the tropics to be penetrated.<p><a id="Causes_of_the_scramble" name="Causes_of_the_scramble"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Causes of the scramble</span></h2>

      <p><a href="../../wp/s/Sub-Saharan_Africa.htm" title="Sub-Saharan Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</a>, one of the last regions of the world largely untouched by &quot;informal imperialism&quot; and &quot;<a href="../../wp/c/Civilization.htm" title="Civilization">civilization</a>&quot;, was also attractive to Europe&#39;s ruling elites for economic and racial reasons. During a time when Britain&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> balance of trade showed a growing deficit, with shrinking and increasingly <!--del_lnk--> protectionist continental markets due to the <!--del_lnk--> Long Depression (1873-1896), Africa offered Britain, Germany, France, and other countries an open market that would garner it a trade surplus: a market that bought more from the metropole than it sold overall. Britain, like most other industrial countries, had long since begun to run an unfavorable balance of trade (which was increasingly offset, however, by the income from overseas investments).<p>As Britain developed into the world&#39;s first post-industrial nation, financial services became an increasingly important sector of its economy. Invisible financial exports, as mentioned, kept Britain out of the red, especially <!--del_lnk--> capital investments outside Europe, particularly to the developing and open markets in Africa, predominantly white <!--del_lnk--> settler <!--del_lnk--> colonies, the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, <!--del_lnk--> South Asia, <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asia, and <a href="../../wp/o/Oceania.htm" title="Oceania">Oceania</a>.<p>In addition, surplus capital was often more profitably invested overseas, where cheap labor, limited competition, and abundant raw materials made a greater premium possible. Another inducement to imperialism, of course, arose from the demand for raw materials unavailable in Europe, especially <a href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper">copper</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Cotton.htm" title="Cotton">cotton</a>, <!--del_lnk--> rubber, <a href="../../wp/t/Tea.htm" title="Tea">tea</a>, and <a href="../../wp/t/Tin.htm" title="Tin">tin</a>, to which European consumers had grown accustomed and upon which European industry had grown dependent.<p>However, in Africa &mdash; exclusive of what would become the <!--del_lnk--> Union of South Africa in <!--del_lnk--> 1909 &mdash; the amount of capital investment by Europeans was relatively small, compared to other continents, before and after the 1884-85 <!--del_lnk--> Berlin Conference. Consequently, the companies involved in tropical African commerce were relatively small, apart from <!--del_lnk--> Cecil Rhodes&#39; <!--del_lnk--> De Beers Mining Company, who had carved out <!--del_lnk--> Rhodesia for himself, as <!--del_lnk--> L&eacute;opold II would exploit the <!--del_lnk--> Congo Free State. These observations might detract from the pro-imperialist arguments of colonial <!--del_lnk--> lobbies such as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Alldeutscher Verband</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Francesco Crispi or <!--del_lnk--> Jules Ferry, who argued that sheltered overseas markets in Africa would solve the problems of low prices and over-production caused by shrinking continental markets. However, according to the classic thesis of <!--del_lnk--> John A. Hobson, exposed in <i><!--del_lnk--> Imperialism</i> (1902), which would influence authors such as <a href="../../wp/v/Vladimir_Lenin.htm" title="Lenin">Lenin</a>&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism</i> (1916), <!--del_lnk--> Trotsky or <!--del_lnk--> Hannah Arendt&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> The Origins of Totalitarianism</i> (1951), this shrinking of continental markets was a main factor of the global New Imperialism period. Later historians have noted that such statistics only obscured the fact that formal control of tropical Africa had great strategic value in an era of imperial rivalry, while the <a href="../../wp/s/Suez_Canal.htm" title="Suez Canal">Suez Canal</a> has remained a strategic location. The 1886 <!--del_lnk--> Witwatersrand Gold Rush, which lead to the foundation of <a href="../../wp/j/Johannesburg.htm" title="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a> and was a major factor of the <a href="../../wp/s/Second_Boer_War.htm" title="Second Boer War">Second Boer War</a> in 1899, accounted for the &quot;conjunction of the superfluous money and of the superfluous manpower, which gave themselves their hand to quit together the country&quot;, which is in itself, according to Hannah Arendt, the new element of the imperialist era.<p><a id="Strategic_rivalry" name="Strategic_rivalry"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Strategic rivalry</span></h3>

      <p>While tropical Africa was not a large zone of investment, other regions overseas were. The vast interior &mdash; between the gold- and diamond-rich <a href="../../wp/s/Southern_Africa.htm" title="Southern Africa">Southern Africa</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, had, however, key strategic value in securing the flow of overseas trade. Britain was thus under intense political pressure, especially among supporters of the <!--del_lnk--> Conservative Party, to secure lucrative markets such as <!--del_lnk--> British Raj <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, <a href="../../wp/q/Qing_Dynasty.htm" title="Qing Dynasty">Qing Dynasty</a> <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, and <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin America</a> from encroaching rivals. Thus, securing the key waterway between East and West &mdash; the <a href="../../wp/s/Suez_Canal.htm" title="Suez Canal">Suez Canal</a>&mdash; was crucial. The rivalry between the UK, France, Germany and the other European powers account for a large part of the colonization. Thus, while Germany, which had been unified under <!--del_lnk--> Prussia&#39;s rule only after the 1866 <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Sadowa and the 1870 <!--del_lnk--> Franco-Prussian War, was hardly a colonial power before the New Imperialism period, it would eagerly participate in the race. A <!--del_lnk--> rising industrial power close on the heels of Great Britain, it hadn&#39;t yet had the chance to control oversea territories, mainly due to its late unification, its fragmentation in various states, and its absence of experience in modern <!--del_lnk--> navigation. This would change under <a href="../../wp/o/Otto_von_Bismarck.htm" title="Otto von Bismarck">Bismarck</a>&#39;s leadership, who implemented the <i><!--del_lnk--> Weltpolitik</i> (World Policy) and, after putting in place the bases of France&#39;s isolation with the <!--del_lnk--> Dual Alliance with <!--del_lnk--> Austria-Hungary and then the 1882 <!--del_lnk--> Triple Alliance with Italy, called for the 1884-85 <!--del_lnk--> Berlin Conference which set the rules of effective control of a foreign territory. Germany&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> expansionism would lead to the <!--del_lnk--> Tirpitz Plan, implemented by <!--del_lnk--> admiral von Tirpitz, who would also champion the various <!--del_lnk--> Fleet Acts starting in 1898, thus engaging in an <!--del_lnk--> arms race with Great Britain. By 1914, they had given Germany the second largest naval force in the world (roughly 40% smaller than the <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Navy.htm" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a>). According to von Tirpitz, this aggressive naval policy was supported by the <!--del_lnk--> National Liberal Party rather than by the conservatives, thus demonstrating that the main supports of the European <!--del_lnk--> nation states&#39; imperialism were the rising <i><!--del_lnk--> bourgeoisie</i> classes.<p><a id="Bismarck.27s_Weltpolitik" name="Bismarck.27s_Weltpolitik"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Bismarck&#39;s <i>Weltpolitik</i></span></h4>

      <p>Germany began its world expansion in the 1880s under Bismarck&#39;s leadership, encouraged by the national <i><!--del_lnk--> bourgeoisie</i>. Some of them, claiming themselves of <!--del_lnk--> Friedrich List&#39;s thought, advocated expansion in the <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a> and in <!--del_lnk--> Timor, other proposed to set themselves in <a href="../../wp/t/Taiwan.htm" title="Taiwan">Formosa</a> (modern <a href="../../wp/t/Taiwan.htm" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>), etc. In the end of the 1870s, these isolated voices began to be relayed by a real imperialist policy, known as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Weltpolitik</i> (&quot;World Policy&quot;), which was backed by <a href="../../wp/m/Mercantilism.htm" title="Mercantilism">mercantilist thesis</a>. In 1881, H&uuml;bbe-Schleiden, a lawyer, published <i>Deutsche Kolonisation</i>, according to which the &quot;development of national <!--del_lnk--> consciousness demanded an independent oversea policy&quot;. <!--del_lnk--> Pan-germanism was thus linked to the young nation&#39;s imperialist drives. In the beginning of the 1880s, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Deutscher Kolonialverein</i> was created, and got its own magazine in 1884, the <i>Kolonialzeitung</i>. This colonial lobby was also relayed by the nationalist <i><!--del_lnk--> Alldeutscher Verband</i>.<p>Germany thus became the third largest colonial power in Africa, acquiring an overall empire of 2.6 million square kilometers and 14 million colonial subjects, mostly in its African possessions (Southwest Africa, Togoland, the Cameroons, and Tanganyika). The scramble for Africa led Bismarck to propose the 1884-85 <!--del_lnk--> Berlin Conference. Following the 1904 <i><!--del_lnk--> Entente cordiale</i> between France and the UK, Germany tried to test the alliance in 1905, with the <!--del_lnk--> First Moroccan Crisis. This led to the 1905 <!--del_lnk--> Algeciras Conference, in which France&#39;s influence on Morocco was compensated by the exchange of others territories, and then to the 1911 <!--del_lnk--> Agadir Crisis. Along with the 1898 <!--del_lnk--> Fashoda Incident between France and the UK, this succession of <!--del_lnk--> international crisis proves the bitterness of the struggle between the various <!--del_lnk--> imperialisms, which ultimately led to <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>.<p><a id="The_clash_of_rival_imperialisms" name="The_clash_of_rival_imperialisms"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The clash of rival imperialisms</span></h4>

Following the defeat of the <!--del_lnk--> First Italo-Abyssinian War (1895-96), it acquired <!--del_lnk--> Somaliland in 1899-90 and the whole of Eritrea (1899). In 1911, it engaged in a <!--del_lnk--> war with the Ottoman Empire, in which it acquired <!--del_lnk--> Tripolitania and <!--del_lnk--> Cyrenaica (modern <a href="../../wp/l/Libya.htm" title="Libya">Libya</a>). <!--del_lnk--> Enrico Corradini, who fully supported the war, and later merged his group in the early <!--del_lnk--> fascist party (PNF), developed in 1919 the concept of <i>Proletarian Nationalism</i>, supposed to legitimize Italy&#39;s imperialism by a surprising mixture of <a href="../../wp/s/Socialism.htm" title="Socialism">socialism</a> with <a href="../../wp/n/Nationalism.htm" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a>: &quot;We must start by recognizing the fact that there are proletarian nations as well as proletarian classes; that is to say, there are nations whose living conditions are subject...to the way of life of other nations, just as classes are. Once this is realized, nationalism must insist firmly on this truth: Italy is, materially and morally, a proletarian nation.&quot; The <!--del_lnk--> Second Italo-Abyssinian War (1935-36), ordered by <a href="../../wp/b/Benito_Mussolini.htm" title="Benito Mussolini">Mussolini</a>, would actually be one of the last colonial wars (that is, intended to colonize a foreign country, opposed to <!--del_lnk--> wars of national liberation), occupying <a href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia.htm" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> for 5 years, which had remained the last African independent territory. The <!--del_lnk--> Spanish Civil War, marking for some the beginning of the <!--del_lnk--> European Civil War, would begin in 1936.<p>On the other hand, the British abandoned their <!--del_lnk--> splendid isolation in 1902 with the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Japanese Alliance, which would enable the <!--del_lnk--> Empire of Japan to be victorious during the <!--del_lnk--> war against Russia (1904-05). The UK then signed the <i><!--del_lnk--> Entente cordiale</i> with France in 1904, and, in 1907, the <!--del_lnk--> Triple Entente which included Russia, thus pitted against the Triple Alliance which <a href="../../wp/o/Otto_von_Bismarck.htm" title="Otto von Bismarck">Bismarck</a> had patiently made up.<p><a id="The_American_Colonization_Society_and_the_foundation_of_Liberia" name="The_American_Colonization_Society_and_the_foundation_of_Liberia"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The American Colonization Society and the foundation of Liberia</span></h4>

      <p>Even the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> took part, marginally, in this enterprise, through the <!--del_lnk--> American Colonization Society (ACS), established in 1816 by <!--del_lnk--> Robert Finley. The ACS offered emigration to <a href="../../wp/l/Liberia.htm" title="Liberia">Liberia</a> (&quot;Land of the Free&quot;), a colony founded in 1820, to <!--del_lnk--> free black slaves; emancipated slave <!--del_lnk--> Lott Cary actually became the first American <!--del_lnk--> Baptist <!--del_lnk--> missionary in Africa.

      <p>Led by <a href="../../wp/s/Southern_United_States.htm" title="Southern United States">Southerners</a>, the American Colonization Society&#39;s first president was <a href="../../wp/j/James_Monroe.htm" title="James Monroe">James Monroe</a>, from <!--del_lnk--> Virginia, who became the fifth <a href="../../wp/p/President_of_the_United_States.htm" title="President of the United States">president of the United States</a> from 1817 to 1825. Thus, one of the main proponents of American colonization of Africa was the same man who proclaimed, in his 1823 <!--del_lnk--> State of the Union address, the US opinion that European powers should no longer <!--del_lnk--> colonize the Americas or interfere with the affairs of <!--del_lnk--> sovereign nations located in the Americas. In return, the US planned to stay neutral in wars between European powers and in wars between a European power and its colonies. However, if these latter type of wars were to occur in the Americas, the U.S. would view such action as hostile toward itself. This famous statement became known as the <!--del_lnk--> Monroe Doctrine and was the base of the <!--del_lnk--> US&#39; isolationism during the 19th century.<p>Although the Liberia colony never became quite as big as envisaged, it was only the first step in the American colonization of Africa, according to its early proponents. Thus, <!--del_lnk--> Jehudi Ashmun, an early leader of the ACS, envisioned an American empire in Africa. Between 1825 and 1826, he took steps to lease, annex, or buy tribal lands along the coast and along major rivers leading inland. Like his predecessor Lt. <!--del_lnk--> Robert Stockton, who in 1821 established the site for <a href="../../wp/m/Monrovia.htm" title="Monrovia">Monrovia</a> by &quot;persuading&quot; a local chief referred to as &quot;King Peter&quot; to sell Cape Montserado (or Mesurado) by pointing a pistol at his head, Ashmun was prepared to use force to extend the colony&#39;s territory. In a May 1825 treaty, King Peter and other native kings agreed to sell land in return for 500 bars of tobacco, three barrels of rum, five casks of powder, five umbrellas, ten iron posts, and ten pairs of shoes, among other items. In March 1825, the ACS began a quarterly, <i>The African Repository and Colonial Journal</i>, edited by Rev. <!--del_lnk--> Ralph Randolph Gurley (1797-1872), who headed the Society until 1844. Conceived as the Society&#39;s propaganda organ, the Repository promoted both colonization and Liberia.<p>The Society controlled the colony of Liberia until 1847 when, under the perception that the British might annex the settlement, Liberia was proclaimed a free and independent state, thus becoming the first African <!--del_lnk--> decolonised state. By 1867, the Society had sent more than 13,000 emigrants. After the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> (1861-1865), when many blacks wanted to go to Liberia, financial support for colonization had waned. During its later years the society focused on educational and missionary efforts in Liberia rather than further emigration.<p><a id="A_succession_of_international_crises_leading_to_World_War_I" name="A_succession_of_international_crises_leading_to_World_War_I"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">A succession of international crises leading to World War I</span></h2>

From 1879 to 1884, Stanley was secretly sent by L&eacute;opold II to the <!--del_lnk--> Congo region, where he made treaties with several African chiefs and by <!--del_lnk--> 1882 obtained over 900,000 square miles (2,300,000 km&sup2;) of territory, the <!--del_lnk--> Congo Free State. L&eacute;opold II, who personally owned the colony starting in 1885 and exploited it for <a href="../../wp/i/Ivory.htm" title="Ivory">ivory</a> and <!--del_lnk--> rubber, would impose such a <!--del_lnk--> terror regime on the colonized people that Belgium decided to annex it in 1908.

      <p>As a result, the important developments were taking place in the Nile valley. <!--del_lnk--> Ferdinand de Lesseps had obtained concessions from <!--del_lnk--> Isma&#39;il Pasha, the ruler of Egypt, in 1854-56, to build the <a href="../../wp/s/Suez_Canal.htm" title="Suez Canal">Suez Canal</a>. During the decade of work, over 1.5 million Egyptians were forced to work on the canal, 125,000 of whom perished due to malnutrition, fatigue and disease, especially <a href="../../wp/c/Cholera.htm" title="Cholera">cholera</a>. Shortly before its completion in <!--del_lnk--> 1869, <!--del_lnk--> Isma&#39;il Pasha, the <!--del_lnk--> ruler of Egypt, borrowed enormous sums from French and English bankers at high rates of interest. By <!--del_lnk--> 1875, he was facing financial difficulties and was forced to sell his block of shares in the Suez Canal. The shares were snapped up by the <a href="../../wp/p/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Benjamin_Disraeli%252C_1st_Earl_of_Beaconsfield.htm" title="Benjamin Disraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a>, who sought to give his country practical control in the management of this strategic waterway. When Isma&#39;il Pasha repudiated Egypt&#39;s foreign debt in <!--del_lnk--> 1879, Britain and France assumed joint financial control over the country, forcing the Egyptian ruler to abdicate. The Egyptian ruling classes did not relish foreign intervention. The <!--del_lnk--> Urabi Revolt broke out against the <!--del_lnk--> Khedive and European influence in <!--del_lnk--> 1882, a year after the <!--del_lnk--> Mahdist revolt. <!--del_lnk--> Muhammad Ahmad, who had proclaimed himself the <i><!--del_lnk--> Mahdi</i>, redeemer of <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a>, in 1881, led the rebellion and was defeated only by <!--del_lnk--> Kitchener in 1898.

      <p>The occupation of <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> and the acquisition of the Congo were the first major moves in what came to be a precipitous scramble for African territory.

      <p>The French thrust into the African interior was mainly from <!--del_lnk--> West Africa (modern day <a href="../../wp/s/Senegal.htm" title="Senegal">Senegal</a>) eastward, through the <!--del_lnk--> Sahel along the southern border of the Sahara, a territory covering modern day <a href="../../wp/s/Senegal.htm" title="Senegal">Senegal</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Mali.htm" title="Mali">Mali</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/Niger.htm" title="Niger">Niger</a>, and <a href="../../wp/c/Chad.htm" title="Chad">Chad</a>. Their ultimate aim was to have an uninterrupted link between the <a href="../../wp/n/Niger_River.htm" title="Niger River">Niger River</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Nile, thus controlling all trade to and from the Sahel region, by virtue of their existing control over the Caravan routes through the Sahara.

This &#39;red line&#39; through Africa is made most famous by <!--del_lnk--> Cecil Rhodes.

      <p>Although the 1884-85 Berlin Conference had set the rules for the scramble for Africa, it hadn&#39;t weakened the rival imperialisms.

As a result, the new German power decided to test the solidity of the influence, using the contested territory of <a href="../../wp/m/Morocco.htm" title="Morocco">Morocco</a> as a battlefield.<p>Thus, on <!--del_lnk--> March 31, <!--del_lnk--> 1905, the <!--del_lnk--> Kaiser Wilhelm II visited <!--del_lnk--> Tangiers and made a speech in favour of Moroccan independence, challenging French influence in Morocco. France&#39;s influence in Morocco had been reaffirmed by Britain and Spain in 1904. The <!--del_lnk--> Kaiser&#39;s speech bolstered French <a href="../../wp/n/Nationalism.htm" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a> and with British support the French foreign minister, <!--del_lnk--> Th&eacute;ophile Delcass&eacute;, took a defiant line. The crisis peaked in mid-June 1905, when Delcass&eacute; was forced out of the ministry by the more conciliation minded premier <!--del_lnk--> Maurice Rouvier. But by July 1905 Germany was becoming isolated and the French agreed to a conference to solve the crisis. Both France and Germany continued to posture up to the conference, with Germany mobilizing reserve army units in late December and France actually moving troops to the border in January 1906.<p>The 1906 <!--del_lnk--> Algeciras Conference was called to settle the dispute. Of the thirteen nations present the German representatives found their only supporter was <!--del_lnk--> Austria-Hungary. France had firm support from Britain, Russia, Italy, Spain, and the U.S. The Germans eventually accepted an agreement, signed on <!--del_lnk--> May 31, <!--del_lnk--> 1906, where France yielded certain domestic changes in Morocco but retained control of key areas.<p>However, five years later, the second Moroccan crisis (or <!--del_lnk--> Agadir Crisis) was sparked by the deployment of the German gunboat <!--del_lnk--> <i>Panther</i>, to the port of <!--del_lnk--> Agadir on <!--del_lnk--> July 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1911. Germany had started to attempt to surpass <!--del_lnk--> Britain&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> naval supremacy &mdash; the British navy had a policy of remaining larger than the next two naval fleets in the world combined. When the British heard of the <i>Panther&#39;</i>s arrival in Morocco, they wrongly believed that the Germans meant to turn Agadir into a naval base on the Atlantic.<p>The German move was aimed at reinforcing claims for compensation for acceptance of effective French control of the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Africa.htm" title="North Africa">North African</a> kingdom, where France&#39;s pre-eminence had been upheld by the 1906 Algerisas Conference. In November 1911, a convention was signed under which Germany accepted France&#39;s position in Morocco in return for territory in the <!--del_lnk--> French Equatorial African colony of <!--del_lnk--> Middle Congo (now the <a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_the_Congo.htm" title="Republic of the Congo">Republic of the Congo</a>).<p>France subsequently established a full <!--del_lnk--> protectorate over Morocco (<!--del_lnk--> March 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1912), ending what remained of the country&#39;s formal independence. Furthermore, British backing for France during the two Moroccan crises reinforced the Entente between the two countries and added to Anglo-German estrangement, deepening the divisions which would culminate in World War I.<p><a id="The_colonial_encounter" name="The_colonial_encounter"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The colonial encounter</span></h2>

      <p><a href="../../wp/c/Capitalism.htm" title="Capitalism">Capitalism</a>, an economic system in which capital, or wealth, is put to work to produce more capital, revolutionized traditional economies, inducing social changes and political consequences that revolutionized African and Asian societies. Maximizing production and minimizing cost did not necessarily coincide with traditional, seasonal patterns of agricultural production. The ethic of wage productivity was thus, in many respects, a new concept to supposedly &#39;idle natives&#39; merely accustomed to older patterns of production. Balanced, subsistence-based economies shifted to specialization and accumulation of surpluses. Tribal states or empires organized along precarious, unwritten cultural traditions also shifted to a division of labor based on legal protection of land and labor &mdash; once inalienable, but now commodities to be bought, sold, or traded.<p><a id="The_colonial_consciousness_and_colonial_exhibitions" name="The_colonial_consciousness_and_colonial_exhibitions"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The colonial consciousness and colonial exhibitions</span></h3>

      <p>In its early stages, imperialism was mainly the act of individual explorers and some adventurous merchantmen. The <!--del_lnk--> metropoles were a long way from approving without any dissent the expensives adventures carried out abroad, and various important political leaders opposed themselves to the colonization in its first years. Thus, <a href="../../wp/w/William_Ewart_Gladstone.htm" title="William Ewart Gladstone">William Gladstone</a> (<!--del_lnk--> Liberal), British premier between 1868&ndash;1874, 1880&ndash;1885, 1886 and 1892&ndash;1894, opposed it. However, during his second ministry, he could not resist the colonial lobby, and thus did not execute his electoral promise to disengage from Egypt. Although Gladstone was personally opposed to imperialism, the <!--del_lnk--> social tensions caused by the <!--del_lnk--> Long Depression pushed him to favour <!--del_lnk--> jingoism: the imperialists had become the &quot;parasites of <!--del_lnk--> patriotism&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> Hobson). In <!--del_lnk--> France, then <!--del_lnk--> Radical politician <!--del_lnk--> Georges Clemenceau also adamantly opposed himself to it: he thought colonization was a diversion from the &quot;blue line of the <!--del_lnk--> Vosges&quot; mountains, that is <!--del_lnk--> revanchism and the patriotic urge to reclaim the <!--del_lnk--> Alsace-Lorraine region which had been annexed by the 1871 <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Frankfurt. Clemenceau actually made <!--del_lnk--> Jules Ferry&#39;s cabinet fall after the 1885 <!--del_lnk--> Tonkin disaster. According to <!--del_lnk--> Hannah Arendt&#39;s classic <i><!--del_lnk--> The Origins of Totalitarianism</i> (1951), this unlimited expansion of national <!--del_lnk--> sovereignty on oversea territories contradicted the unity of the <!--del_lnk--> nation-state which provided <a href="../../wp/c/Citizenship.htm" title="Citizenship">citizenship</a> to its population. Thus, a tension between the <!--del_lnk--> universalist will to respect <a href="../../wp/h/Human_rights.htm" title="Human rights">human rights</a> of the colonized people, as they may be considered as &quot;citizens&quot; of the nation-state, and the imperialist drives to cynically <!--del_lnk--> exploit populations deemed inferior began to surface. Some rare voices in the metropoles opposed what they saw as unnecessary evils of the colonial administration, left to itself and described in <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Conrad&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Heart of Darkness</i> (1899) &mdash; contemporary of <a href="../../wp/r/Rudyard_Kipling.htm" title="Rudyard Kipling">Kipling</a>&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> The White Man&#39;s Burden</i> &mdash; or in <!--del_lnk--> C&eacute;line&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Journey to the End of the Night</i> (1932).<p>Thus, colonial <!--del_lnk--> lobbies were progressively set up to legitimize the Scramble for Africa and other expensives oversea adventures. In Germany, in France, in Britain, the bourgeoisie began to claim strong oversea policies to insure the market&#39;s growth. In 1916, <a href="../../wp/v/Vladimir_Lenin.htm" title="Lenin">Lenin</a> would publish his famous <i><!--del_lnk--> Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism</i> to explain this phenomenon. Even in lesser powers, voices like <!--del_lnk--> Corradini began to claim a &quot;place in the sun&quot; for so-called &quot;proletarian nations&quot;, bolstering <a href="../../wp/n/Nationalism.htm" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a> and <!--del_lnk--> militarism in an early prototype of <a href="../../wp/f/Fascism.htm" title="Fascism">fascism</a>.<p><a id="Colonial_propaganda_and_jingoism" name="Colonial_propaganda_and_jingoism"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Colonial propaganda and jingoism</span></h4>
      <p>However, by the end of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, the colonized empires had become very popular almost everywhere: <!--del_lnk--> public opinion had been convinced of the needs of a colonial empire, although many of the metropolitans would never see a piece of it. <!--del_lnk--> Colonial exhibitions had been instrumental in this change of popular mentalities brought about by the colonial <a href="../../wp/p/Propaganda.htm" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a>, supported by the colonial lobby and by various scientifics. Thus, the conquest of territories were inevitably followed by public displays of the <!--del_lnk--> indigenous people for scientific and leisure purposes. Karl Hagenbeck, a German merchant in wild animals and future entrepreneur of most Europeans <!--del_lnk--> zoos, thus decided in 1874 to exhibit <a href="../../wp/s/Samoa.htm" title="Samoa">Samoa</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Sami people as &quot;purely natural&quot; populations. In 1876, he sent one of his collaborators to the newly conquered Egyptian Sudan to bring back some wild beasts and <!--del_lnk--> Nubians. Presented in Paris, London and Berlin, these Nubians were very successful. Such &quot;<!--del_lnk--> human zoos&quot; could be found in Hamburg, Anvers, Barcelona, London, Milan, New York, Warsaw, etc., with 200,000 to 300,000 visitors attending each exhibition. <!--del_lnk--> Tuaregs were exhibited after the French conquest of <a href="../../wp/t/Timbuktu.htm" title="Timbuktu">Timbuktu</a> (discovered by <!--del_lnk--> Ren&eacute; Caill&eacute;, disguised as a Muslim, in <!--del_lnk--> 1828, who thus won the prize offered by the French <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de G&eacute;ographie</i>); <!--del_lnk--> Malagasy after the occupation of <a href="../../wp/m/Madagascar.htm" title="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>; <!--del_lnk--> Amazons of <!--del_lnk--> Abomey after <!--del_lnk--> Behanzin&#39;s mediatic defeat against the French in 1894... Not used to the climatic conditions, some of the indigenous exposed died, such as some <!--del_lnk--> Galibis in Paris in 1892.<p>Geoffroy de Saint-Hilaire, director of the Parisian Jardin d&#39;acclimatation, decided in 1877 to organize two &quot;ethnological spectacles&quot;, presenting Nubians and <!--del_lnk--> Inuit. The public of the Jardin d&#39;acclimatation doubled, with a million paying entrances that year, a huge success for these times. Between 1877 and 1912, approximatively thirty &quot;ethnological exhibitions&quot; were presented at the Jardin zoologique d&#39;acclimatation. &quot;Negro villages&quot; would be presented in Paris&#39; 1878 and 1879 World&#39;s Fair; the 1900 World&#39;s Fair presented the famous <!--del_lnk--> diorama &quot;living&quot; in Madagascar, while the Colonial Exhibitions in Marseilles (1906 and 1922) and in Paris (1907 and 1931) would also display human beings in cages, often nudes or quasi-nudes. Nomadic &quot;<a href="../../wp/s/Senegal.htm" title="Senegal">Senegalese</a> villages&quot; were also created, thus displaying the power of the colonial empire to all the population.<p>In the US, <!--del_lnk--> Madison Grant, head of the New York Zoological Society, exposed <!--del_lnk--> pigmy <!--del_lnk--> Ota Benga in the <!--del_lnk--> Bronx Zoo alongside the apes and others in 1906. At the behest of Grant, a prominent <!--del_lnk--> scientific racist and <!--del_lnk--> eugenicist, zoo director Hornaday placed Ota Benga in a cage with an orangutan and labeled him &quot;The Missing Link&quot; in an attempt to illustrate <!--del_lnk--> darwinism, and in particular that Africans like Ota Benga were closer to apes than were Europeans.<p>Such colonial exhibitions, which include the 1924 <!--del_lnk--> British Empire Exhibition and the successful 1931 Paris <i>Exposition coloniale</i>, were doubtlessly a key element of the colonisation project and legitimized the ruthless Scramble for Africa, in the same way that the popular comic-strip <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Adventures_of_Tintin.htm" title="The Adventures of Tintin">The Adventures of Tintin</a></i>, full of <!--del_lnk--> clich&eacute;s, were obviously carrier of an <!--del_lnk--> ethnocentric and <!--del_lnk--> racist <!--del_lnk--> ideology which was the condition of the masses&#39; consent to the imperialist phenomenon. <!--del_lnk--> Herg&eacute;&#39;s work attained summits with <i><!--del_lnk--> Tintin in the Congo</i> (1930-31) or <i><!--del_lnk--> The Broken Ear</i> (1935).<p>While comic-strips played the same role as <!--del_lnk--> westerns to legitimize the <!--del_lnk--> Indian Wars in the United States, colonial exhibitions were both popular <i>and</i> scientific, being an interface between the crowds and serious scientific research. Thus, <!--del_lnk--> anthropologists such as <!--del_lnk--> Madison Grant or <!--del_lnk--> Alexis Carrel built their <!--del_lnk--> pseudo-scientific racism, inspired by <!--del_lnk--> Gobineau&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races</i> (1853-55). Human zoos provided both a real-size <!--del_lnk--> laboratory for these racial hypothesis and a demonstration of their validity: by labelling <!--del_lnk--> Ota Benga as the &quot;missing link&quot; between <!--del_lnk--> apes and <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europeans">Europeans</a>, as was done in the Bronx Zoo, <!--del_lnk--> social darwinism and the pseudo-hierarchy of races, grounded in the biologization of the notion of &quot;<a href="../../wp/r/Race.htm" title="Race">race</a>&quot;, were simultaneously &quot;proved&quot;, and the layman could observe this &quot;scientific truth&quot;.<p><a href="../../wp/a/Anthropology.htm" title="Anthropology">Anthropology</a>, the daughter of colonisation, participated in this so-called <!--del_lnk--> scientific racism based on <!--del_lnk--> social darwinism by supporting, along with <!--del_lnk--> social positivism and <!--del_lnk--> scientism, the claims of the superiority of the Western civilization over &quot;<!--del_lnk--> primitive cultures&quot;. However, the discovery of ancient cultures would <!--del_lnk--> dialectically lead anthropology to criticize itself and reevalue the importance of foreign cultures. Thus, the 1897 <i><!--del_lnk--> Punitive Expedition</i> led by the British Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Harry Rawson captured, burned, and looted the city of <!--del_lnk--> Benin, incidentally bringing to an end the highly sophisticated <!--del_lnk--> West African <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Benin. However, the sack of Benin distributed the famous <!--del_lnk--> Benin bronzes and other works of art into the European <!--del_lnk--> art market, as the <!--del_lnk--> British Admiralty auctioned off the confiscated patrimony to defray costs of the Expedition. Most of the great Benin bronzes went first to purchasers in <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>, though a sizable group remain in the <!--del_lnk--> British Museum. The Benin bronzes then catalyzed the beginnings of a long reassessment of the value of West African culture, which had strong influences on the formation of <!--del_lnk--> modernism.<p>Several contemporary studies have thus focused on the construction of the <!--del_lnk--> racist discourse in the 19th century and its propaganda as a precondition of the colonization project and of the Scramble of Africa, made with total disconcern for the local population, as examplified by <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_Morton_Stanley.htm" title="Henry Morton Stanley">Stanley</a>, according to whom &quot;the <!--del_lnk--> savage only respects force, power, boldness, and decision.&quot; <a href="../../wp/a/Anthropology.htm" title="Anthropology">Anthropology</a>, which was related to <!--del_lnk--> criminology, thrived on these explorations, as had <a href="../../wp/g/Geography.htm" title="Geography">geography</a> before them and <!--del_lnk--> ethnology &mdash; which, along with <a href="../../wp/c/Claude_L%25C3%25A9vi-Strauss.htm" title="Claude L&eacute;vi-Strauss">Claude L&eacute;vi-Strauss</a>&#39; studies, would theorize the <!--del_lnk--> ethnocentric illusion &mdash; afterwards. According to several historians, the formulation of this racist discourse and practices would also be a precondition of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> state racism&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> Michel Foucault) as incarnated by the <a href="../../wp/t/The_Holocaust.htm" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> (see also <!--del_lnk--> Olivier LeCour Grandmaison&#39;s description of the <!--del_lnk--> conquest of Algeria and <!--del_lnk--> Sven Lindqvist, as well as Hannah Arendt). The invention of <!--del_lnk--> concentration camps during the Second Boer War would also be an <!--del_lnk--> innovation used by the <!--del_lnk--> Third Reich.<p><a id="The_extermination_of_the_Namaka_and_the_Herero" name="The_extermination_of_the_Namaka_and_the_Herero"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The extermination of the Namaka and the Herero</span></h3>

      <p>During the New Imperialism period, by the end of the century, Europe added almost 9 million square miles (23,000,000 km&sup2;) &mdash; one-fifth of the land area of the globe &mdash; to its overseas colonial possessions . Europe&#39;s formal holdings now included the entire African continent except <a href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia.htm" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Liberia.htm" title="Liberia">Liberia</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Saguia el-Hamra, the latter of which would be integrated into <!--del_lnk--> Spanish Sahara. Between <!--del_lnk--> 1885 and <!--del_lnk--> 1914 Britain took nearly 30% of Africa&#39;s population under its control, to 15% for France, 9% for Germany, 7% for Belgium and only 1% for <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> . <a href="../../wp/n/Nigeria.htm" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> alone contributed 15 million subjects, more than in the whole of <!--del_lnk--> French West Africa or the entire German colonial empire. It was paradoxical that Britain, the staunch advocate of free trade, emerged in 1914 with not only the largest overseas empire thanks to its long-standing presence in India, but also the greatest gains in the &quot;scramble for Africa&quot;, reflecting its advantageous position at its inception. In terms of surface area occupied, the French were the marginal victors but most of their empire was covered by desert.<p>The political imperialism followed the economic expansion, with the &quot;colonial lobbies&quot; bolstering <!--del_lnk--> chauvinism and <!--del_lnk--> jingoism at each crisis in order to legitimize the colonial enterprise. The tensions between the imperial powers led to a succession of crisis, which finally exploded in August <!--del_lnk--> 1914, when previous rivalries and alliances created a domino situation that drew the major European nations into the war. Austria-Hungary attacked Serbia to avenge the murder by Serbian agents of Austrian crown prince Francis Ferdinand, Russia would mobilize to assist its slav brothers in Serbia, Germany would intervene to support Austria-Hungary against Russia. Since Russia had a military alliance with France against Germany, the <!--del_lnk--> German General Staff, led by <!--del_lnk--> General von Moltke decided to realize the well prepared <!--del_lnk--> Schlieffen Plan to invade France and quickly knock her out of the war before turning against Russia in what was expected to be a long campaign. This required an invasion of Belgium which brought Great Britain into the war against Germany, Austria-Hungary and their allies. German <!--del_lnk--> U-Boat campaigns against ships bound for Britain eventually drew the United States into what had become the First World War. Moreover, using the Anglo-Japanese Alliance as an excuse, <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> leaped onto this opportunity to conquer German interests in <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific to become the dominating power in Western Pacific, setting the stage for the <!--del_lnk--> Second Sino-Japanese War (starting in <!--del_lnk--> 1937) and eventually the <!--del_lnk--> Second World War.<p><a id="African_colonies_listed_by_colonizing_power" name="African_colonies_listed_by_colonizing_power"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">African colonies listed by colonizing power</span></h2>
