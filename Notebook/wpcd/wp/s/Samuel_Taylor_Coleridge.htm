      <p><a id="Early_life_and_education" name="Early_life_and_education"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Early life and education</span></h2>
      <p>Samuel Taylor Coleridge was born on October 21, 1772 in the rural town of <!--del_lnk--> Ottery St Mary, <!--del_lnk--> Devonshire. He was the youngest of ten children, and his father, the Reverend John Coleridge, was a well respected <!--del_lnk--> vicar. Coleridge suffered from constant ridicule by his older brother Frank, partially due to jealousy, as Samuel was often praised and favoured by his parents. To escape this abuse from critics, he frequently sought refuge at a local library, which led him to discover his passion for poetry.<p>He later wrote in his <i>Biographia Literaria</i>:<blockquote>
       <p>At six years old I remember to have read <i>Belisarius</i>, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, and <i>Philip Quarll</i> - and then I found the <i>Arabian Nights&#39; Entertainments</i> - one tale of which (the tale of a man who was compelled to seek for a pure virgin) made so deep an impression on me (I had read it in the evening while my mother was mending stockings) that I was haunted by spectres whenever I was in the dark - and I distinctly remember the anxious and fearful eagerness with which I used to watch the window in which the books lay - and whenever the sun lay upon them, I would seize it, carry it by the wall, and bask, and read.</blockquote>
      <p>After the death of his father in 1781, contrary to his desires, he was sent to <!--del_lnk--> Christ&#39;s Hospital, a boarding school in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>. The school was notorious for its unwelcoming atmosphere and strict regimen under The Rev. James Bowyer, many years Head Master of the Grammar-School, which fostered thoughts of guilt and depression in young Samuel&#39;s maturing mind.<p>However, Coleridge seems to have appreciated his teacher, as he wrote in detailed recollections of his schooldays in <i>Biographia Literaria</i>:<blockquote>
       <p>I enjoyed the inestimable advantage of a very sensible, though at the same time, a very severe master...At the same time that we were studying the Greek Tragic Poets, he made us read Shakspeare and Milton as lessons: and they were the lessons too, which required most time and trouble to bring up, so as to escape his censure. I learnt from him, that Poetry, even that of the loftiest, and, seemingly, that of the wildest odes, had a logic of its own, as severe as that of science; and more difficult, because more subtle, more complex, and dependent on more, and more fugitive causes....</blockquote>
      <blockquote>
       <p>In our own English compositions (at least for the last three years of our school education) he showed no mercy to phrase, metaphor, or image, unsupported by a sound sense, or where the same sense might have been conveyed with equal force and dignity in plainer words... In fancy I can almost hear him now, exclaiming <i>Harp? Harp? Lyre? Pen and ink, boy, you mean! Muse, boy, Muse? your Nurse&#39;s daughter, you mean! Pierian spring? Oh aye! the cloister-pump, I suppose!</i> ... Be this as it may, there was one custom of our master&#39;s, which I cannot pass over in silence, because I think it ... worthy of imitation. He would often permit our theme exercises, ... to accumulate, till each lad had four or five to be looked over. Then placing the whole number abreast on his desk, he would ask the writer, why this or that sentence might not have found as appropriate a place under this or that other thesis: and if no satisfying answer could be returned, and two faults of the same kind were found in one exercise, the irrevocable verdict followed, the exercise was torn up, and another on the same subject to be produced, in addition to the tasks of the day.</blockquote>
      <p>
       <br />
      <p>Throughout life, Coleridge idealized his father as pious and innocent, but his relationship with his mother was more problematic. His childhood was characterized by attention-seeking, which has been linked to his dependent personality as an adult. He was rarely allowed to return home during the school term, and this distance from his family at such a turbulent time proved emotionally damaging. He later wrote of his loneliness at school in the poem <i>Frost at Midnight</i>: &quot;With unclosed lids, already had I dreamt/Of my sweet birthplace&quot;<p>From <!--del_lnk--> 1791 until <!--del_lnk--> 1794 Coleridge attended <!--del_lnk--> Jesus College at the <a href="../../wp/u/University_of_Cambridge.htm" title="University of Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>. In 1792 he won the Browne Gold Medal for an Ode that he wrote on the slave trade. In November, 1793, he left the college and enlisted in the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Dragoons, perhaps because of debt or because the girl that he loved had rejected him. His brothers arranged for his discharge a few months later (ironically because of supposed insanity) and he was readmitted to Jesus College, though he would never receive a degree from Cambridge.<p><a id="Pantisocracy_and_marriage" name="Pantisocracy_and_marriage"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Pantisocracy and marriage</span></h2>
      <p>At the university he was introduced to political and theological ideas then considered radical, including those of the poet <!--del_lnk--> Robert Southey. Coleridge joined Southey in a plan, soon abandoned, to found a <!--del_lnk--> utopian <!--del_lnk--> commune-like society, called <!--del_lnk--> pantisocracy, in the wilderness of <!--del_lnk--> Pennsylvania. In <!--del_lnk--> 1795 the two friends married sisters Sarah and Edith Fricker, but Coleridge&#39;s marriage proved unhappy. He grew to detest his wife, whom he only married because of social constraints, and eventually divorced her. During and after his failed marriage, he came to love a woman named Sara Hutchinson, who did not share this passion and consequentially caused much distress. Sara departed for <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>, but Coleridge remained in <!--del_lnk--> Britain. In <!--del_lnk--> 1796 he published <i>Poems on Various Subjects</i>.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1795 Coleridge met poet <!--del_lnk--> William Wordsworth and his sister <!--del_lnk--> Dorothy. They became immediate friends.<p>Around 1796, Coleridge started taking <!--del_lnk--> opium as a pain reliever. His and Dorothy Wordsworth&#39;s notebooks record that he suffered from a variety of medical complaints, including <!--del_lnk--> toothache and facial <!--del_lnk--> neuralgia. There was no stigma associated with taking opium then, but also little understanding of the physiological or psychological aspects of <!--del_lnk--> addiction.<p>The years <!--del_lnk--> 1797 and <!--del_lnk--> 1798, during which he lived in <!--del_lnk--> Nether Stowey, <!--del_lnk--> Somerset, Coleridge and Wordsworth, having visited him and being enchanted by the surroundings, rented Alfoxton Park, a little over three miles away, were among the most fruitful of Coleridge&#39;s life. Besides the <i>Rime of The Ancient Mariner</i>, he composed the symbolic poem <i><a href="../../wp/k/Kubla_Khan.htm" title="Kubla Khan">Kubla Khan</a></i>, written&mdash;Coleridge himself claimed&mdash;as a result of an opium dream, in &quot;a kind of a reverie&quot;; and the first part of the narrative poem <i>Christabel</i>. During this period he also produced his much-praised &quot;conversation&quot; poems <i>This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison</i>, <i>Frost at Midnight</i>, and <i>The Nightingale</i>.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1798 Coleridge and Wordsworth published a joint volume of poetry, <i><!--del_lnk--> Lyrical Ballads</i>, which proved to be the starting-point for the English <!--del_lnk--> romantic movement. Though the productive Wordsworth contributed more poems to the volume, Coleridge&#39;s first version of <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Rime_of_the_Ancient_Mariner.htm" title="The Rime of the Ancient Mariner">The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</a></i> was the longest poem and drew more immediate attention than anything else.<p>In the <a href="../../wp/s/Spring_%2528season%2529.htm" title="Spring (season)">spring</a> of 1798, Coleridge temporarily took over for Rev. <!--del_lnk--> Joshua Toulmin at Taunton&#39;s Mary Street Unitarian Chapel  while Rev. Toulmin grieved over the drowning death of his daughter Jane. Poetically commenting on the strength of Rev. Toulmin, Coleridge wrote in a 1798 letter to John Prior Estlin,<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
       <p>I walked into Taunton (eleven miles) and back again, and performed the divine services for Dr. Toulmin. I suppose you must have heard that his daughter, (Jane, on <!--del_lnk--> April 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1798) in a melancholy derangement, suffered herself to be swallowed up by the tide on the sea-coast between <!--del_lnk--> Sidmouth and <!--del_lnk--> Bere (sic. Beer). These events cut cruelly into the hearts of old men: but the good Dr. Toulmin bears it like the true practical <!--del_lnk--> Christian, - there is indeed a tear in his eye, but that eye is lifted up to the <!--del_lnk--> Heavenly Father.</blockquote>
      <p>In the <a href="../../wp/a/Autumn.htm" title="Autumn">autumn</a> of 1798, Coleridge and Wordsworth left for a stay in <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>; Coleridge soon went his own way and spent much of his time in university towns. During this period he became interested in German philosophy, especially the <!--del_lnk--> transcendental idealism of <a href="../../wp/i/Immanuel_Kant.htm" title="Immanuel Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>, and in the literary criticism of the 18th-century dramatist <!--del_lnk--> Gotthold Lessing. Coleridge studied German and, after his return to England, translated the dramatic trilogy <i>Wallenstein</i> by the German Classical poet <!--del_lnk--> Friedrich Schiller into English.<p>Coleridge was critical of the literary taste of his contemporaries, and a literary conservative insofar as he was afraid that the lack of taste in the ever growing masses of literate people would mean a continued desecration of literature itself.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1800 he returned to England and shortly thereafter settled with his family and friends at <!--del_lnk--> Keswick in the <a href="../../wp/l/Lake_District.htm" title="Lake District">Lake District</a> of <!--del_lnk--> Cumberland to be near <!--del_lnk--> Grasmere, where Wordsworth had moved. Soon, however, he was beset by marital problems, illnesses, increased opium dependency, tensions with Wordsworth, and a lack of confidence in his poetic powers, all of which fueled the composition of <i>Dejection: An Ode</i> and an intensification of his philosophical studies.<p>From <!--del_lnk--> 1804 to <!--del_lnk--> 1806, Coleridge lived in <a href="../../wp/m/Malta.htm" title="Malta">Malta</a> and travelled in <!--del_lnk--> Sicily and <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>, in the hope that leaving Britain&#39;s damp climate would improve his health and thus enable him to reduce his consumption of opium. For a while he had a civil-service job as the Public Secretary of the British administration of <a href="../../wp/m/Malta.htm" title="Malta">Malta</a>, assisting governor <!--del_lnk--> Sir Alexander John Ball. <!--del_lnk--> Thomas de Quincey alleges in his <i>Recollections of the Lakes and the Lake Poets</i> that it was during this period that Coleridge became a full-blown opium addict, using the drug as a substitute for the lost vigour and creativity of his youth. It has been suggested, however, that this reflects de Quincey&#39;s own experiences more than Coleridge&#39;s.<p>Between <!--del_lnk--> 1808 and <!--del_lnk--> 1819 this &quot;giant among dwarfs&quot;, as he was often considered by his contemporaries, gave a series of lectures in London and <a href="../../wp/b/Bristol.htm" title="Bristol">Bristol</a> &ndash; those on <a href="../../wp/w/William_Shakespeare.htm" title="William Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> renewed interest in the playwright as a model for contemporary writers.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1816 Coleridge, with his addiction worsening, his spirits depressed, and his family alienated, took residence in the home of the physician James Gillman, in <!--del_lnk--> Highgate. In Gillman&#39;s home he finished his major prose work, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Biographia Literaria</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1817), a volume composed of 25 chapters of autobiographical notes and dissertations on various subjects, including some incisive literary theory and criticism. The sections in which Coleridge expounded his definitions of the nature of poetry and the imagination are particularly important: he made a famous distinction between primary and secondary imagination on the one hand and fancy on the other. He published other writings while he was living at the Gillman home, notably <i>Sibylline Leaves</i> (1817), <i>Aids to Reflection</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1825), and <i>Church and State</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1830). He died of heart failure in Highgate on <!--del_lnk--> July 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1834.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p><a id="Poetry" name="Poetry"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Poetry</span></h2>
      <p>Coleridge is probably best known for his long narrative poems, <i>The <!--del_lnk--> Rime of the Ancient Mariner</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Christabel</i>. Even those who have never read the <i>Rime</i> have come under its influence: its words have given the <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English language</a> the metaphor of an <a href="../../wp/a/Albatross.htm" title="Albatross">albatross</a> around one&#39;s neck, the quotation of &quot;water, water everywhere, nor any drop to drink (almost always rendered as &quot;but not a drop to drink&quot;)&quot;, and the phrase &quot;a sadder and a wiser man (again, usually rendered as &quot;sadder but wiser man&quot;)&quot;. <i>Christabel</i> is known for its musical rhythm, language, and its <!--del_lnk--> Gothic tale.<p><i><a href="../../wp/k/Kubla_Khan.htm" title="Kubla Khan">Kubla Khan</a>, or, A Vision in a Dream, A Fragment</i>, although shorter, is also widely known and loved. It has strange, dreamy imagery and can be read on many levels. Both <i>Kubla Khan</i> and <i>Christabel</i> have additional &quot;romantic&quot; aura because they were never finished. <!--del_lnk--> Stopford Brooke characterised both poems as having no rival due to their &quot;exquisite metrical movement&quot; and &quot;imaginative phrasing.&quot; It is one of history&#39;s tragedies that Coleridge was interrupted while writing Kubla Khan by a visitor and could not recall any more of the poem afterwards.<p>Coleridge&#39;s shorter, meditative &quot;conversation poems,&quot; however, proved to be the most influential of his work. These include both quiet poems like <i>This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison</i> and <i>Frost at Midnight</i> and also strongly emotional poems like <i>Dejection</i> and <i>The Pains of Sleep</i>. Wordsworth immediately adopted the model of these poems, and used it to compose several of his major poems. Via Wordsworth, the conversation poem became a standard vehicle for English poetic expression, and perhaps the most common approach among modern poets.<p>Coleridge&#39;s poetry so impressed the parents of <!--del_lnk--> black British composer <!--del_lnk--> Samuel Coleridge-Taylor (1875-1912) that they named him after the poet.<p><a id="Coleridge_and_the_influence_of_the_Gothic" name="Coleridge_and_the_influence_of_the_Gothic"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Coleridge and the influence of the Gothic</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Gothic novels like Polidori&rsquo;s <i>The Vampire</i>, Walpole&rsquo;s <i>The Castle of Otranto</i>, Mrs Radcliffe&rsquo;s <i>The Mysteries of Udolpho</i> and <i>The Italian</i>, and Matthew Lewis&rsquo;s <i>The Monk</i> were the best-sellers of the end of the eighteenth century, and thrilled many young women (who were often strictly forbidden to read them). <a href="../../wp/j/Jane_Austen.htm" title="Jane Austen">Jane Austen</a> satirised the style mercilessly in <i><!--del_lnk--> Northanger Abbey</i>.<p>Coleridge wrote reviews of Mrs Radcliffe&rsquo;s books and of <i>The Mad Monk</i> among others. He comments in his reviews:<blockquote>
       <p><i>Situations of torment, and images of naked horror, are easily conceived; and a writer in whose works they abound, deserves our gratitude almost equally with him who should drag us by way of sport through a military hospital, or force us to sit at the dissecting-table of a natural philosopher. To trace the nice boundaries, beyond which terror and sympathy are deserted by the pleasurable emotions, - to reach those limits, yet never to pass them, hic labor, hic opus est.</i></blockquote>
      <p>and:<blockquote>
       <p><i>The horrible and the preternatural have usually seized on the popular taste, at the rise and decline of literature. Most powerful stimulants, they can never be required except by the torpor of an unawakened, or the languor of an exhausted, appetite... We trust, however, that satiety will banish what good sense should have prevented; and that, wearied with fiends, incomprehensible characters, with shrieks, murders, and subterraneous dungeons, the public will learn, by the multitude of the manufacturers, with how little expense of thought or imagination this species of composition is manufactured.</i></blockquote>
      <p>However, Coleridge used mysterious and demonic elements in poems such as <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Rime_of_the_Ancient_Mariner.htm" title="The Rime of the Ancient Mariner">The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</a></i> (1798), <i><!--del_lnk--> Christabel</i> and <i><a href="../../wp/k/Kubla_Khan.htm" title="Kubla Khan">Kubla Khan</a></i> (published 1816 but known in manuscript form before then) and certainly influenced other poets and writers of the time. Poems like this both drew inspiration from and helped to inflame the craze for <!--del_lnk--> Gothic romance.<p><!--del_lnk--> Mary Shelley, who knew Coleridge well, mentions <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Rime_of_the_Ancient_Mariner.htm" title="The Rime of the Ancient Mariner">The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</a></i> twice directly in <i><a href="../../wp/f/Frankenstein.htm" title="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a></i>, and some of the descriptions in the novel echo it indirectly. Although <!--del_lnk--> William Godwin, her father, disagreed with Coleridge on some important issues, he respected his opinions and Coleridge often visited the Godwins. Mary Shelley later recalled hiding behind the sofa and hearing his voice chanting <i>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</i>.<p><a id="Family_connections" name="Family_connections"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Family connections</span></h2>
      <p>Coleridge was the father of <!--del_lnk--> Hartley Coleridge, <!--del_lnk--> Sara Coleridge, and <!--del_lnk--> Derwent Coleridge and grandfather of <!--del_lnk--> Herbert Coleridge, <!--del_lnk--> Ernest Hartley Coleridge and Christabel Coleridge. He was the uncle of <!--del_lnk--> the first Baron Coleridge. The poet Mary Elizabeth Coleridge (1861 - 1907) was his great-great niece.
