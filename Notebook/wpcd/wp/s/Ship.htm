      <p>A <b>ship</b> is a large, sea-going <!--del_lnk--> watercraft.<p>A ship usually has sufficient size to carry its own <a href="../../wp/b/Boat.htm" title="Boat">boats</a>, such as <!--del_lnk--> lifeboats, <!--del_lnk--> dinghies, or <!--del_lnk--> runabouts. A <!--del_lnk--> rule of thumb saying (though it doesn&#39;t always apply) goes: &quot;a boat can fit on a ship, but a ship can&#39;t fit on a boat&quot;. Consequently <!--del_lnk--> submarines are referred to as &quot;boats&quot;, because early submarines were small enough to be carried aboard a ship in transit to distant waters. Another type of large vessel which is traditionally called a boat is the <!--del_lnk--> Great Lakes freighter. Often local <a href="../../wp/l/Law.htm" title="Law">law</a> and regulation will define the exact size (or the number of <!--del_lnk--> masts) which a boat requires to become a ship. Compare <!--del_lnk--> vessel.<p>During the <!--del_lnk--> age of sail, <b>ship</b> signified a <!--del_lnk--> ship-rigged vessel, that is, one with three or more masts, usually three, all <!--del_lnk--> square-rigged. Such a vessel would normally have one fore and aft sail on her aftermost mast which was usually the mizzen. Almost invariably she would also have a <!--del_lnk--> bowsprit but this was not part of the definition. The same economic pressures which increased sizes to the point of carrying four or five masts, also introduced the fore and aft rig to larger vessels, so few ship-rigged vessels were built with more than three masts. The five-masted <i><!--del_lnk--> Preussen</i> was the outstanding example, but the big <!--del_lnk--> German ships and <!--del_lnk--> barques were built partly for <!--del_lnk--> prestige reasons.<p><b><!--del_lnk--> Nautical</b> means related to sailors, particularly customs and practices at <a href="../../wp/s/Sea.htm" title="Sea">sea</a>. <b>Naval</b> is the adjective pertaining to ships, though in common usage it has come to be more particularly associated with the noun &#39;<!--del_lnk--> navy&#39;.<p>

</script><a id="Measuring_ships" name="Measuring_ships"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Measuring ships</span></h2>
      <p>One can <!--del_lnk--> measure ships in terms of overall length, length of the waterline, beam (breadth), depth (distance between the crown of the weather deck and the top of the keelson), <!--del_lnk--> draft (distance between the highest waterline and the bottom of the ship) and <!--del_lnk--> tonnage. A number of different tonnage definitions exist; most measure <!--del_lnk--> volume rather than weight, and are used when describing merchant ships for the purpose of tolls, taxation, etc.<p>In Britain until the <!--del_lnk--> Samuel Plimsoll Merchant Shipping Act of 1876, ship-owners could load their vessels until their decks were almost awash, resulting in a dangerously unstable condition. Additionally, anyone who signed onto such a ship for a voyage and, upon realizing the danger, chose to leave the ship, could end up in <!--del_lnk--> gaol.<p><!--del_lnk--> Samuel Plimsoll, a <!--del_lnk--> member of Parliament, realised the problem and engaged some <!--del_lnk--> engineers to derive a fairly simple <!--del_lnk--> formula to determine the position of a line on the side of any specific ship&#39;s hull which, when it reached the surface of the water during loading of cargo, meant the ship had reached its maximum safe loading level. To this day, that mark, called the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Plimsoll Mark&quot;, exists on ships&#39; sides, and consists of a <!--del_lnk--> circle with a horizontal line through the centre. Because different types of water, (summer, fresh, tropical fresh, winter north Atlantic) have different densities, subsequent regulations required painting a group of lines forward of the Plimsoll mark to indicate the safe depth (or freeboard above the surface) to which a specific ship could load in water of various densities. Hence the &quot;ladder&quot; of lines seen forward of the Plimsoll mark to this day.<p><a id="Propulsion" name="Propulsion"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Propulsion</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Pre-mechanisation" name="Pre-mechanisation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Pre-mechanisation</span></h3>
      <p>Until the application of the <a href="../../wp/s/Steam_engine.htm" title="Steam engine">steam engine</a> to ships in the early <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a>, oars propelled <!--del_lnk--> galleys or the wind propelled <!--del_lnk--> sailing ships. Before mechanisation, merchant ships always used sail, but as long as <!--del_lnk--> naval warfare depended on ships closing to <!--del_lnk--> ram or to fight hand-to-hand, galleys dominated in marine conflicts because of their maneuverability and speed. The <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Greek</a> <!--del_lnk--> navies that fought in the <!--del_lnk--> Peloponnesian War used <!--del_lnk--> triremes, as did the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a> contesting the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Actium. The use of large numbers of <!--del_lnk--> cannon from the <a href="../../wp/1/16th_century.htm" title="16th century">16th century</a> meant that maneuverability took second place to broadside weight; this led to the dominance of the sail-powered warship.<p><a id="Steam_propulsion" name="Steam_propulsion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Steam propulsion</span></h3>
      <p>The development of the <!--del_lnk--> steamship became a complex process, the first commercial success accruing to <!--del_lnk--> Robert Fulton&#39;s <i>North River Steamboat</i> (often called <!--del_lnk--> <i>Clermont</i>) in the US in <!--del_lnk--> 1807, followed in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> by the 45-foot <!--del_lnk--> <i>Comet</i> of <!--del_lnk--> 1812. Steam propulsion progressed considerably over the rest of the 19th century. Notable developments included the <!--del_lnk--> condenser, which reduced the requirement for fresh water, and the multiple expansion engine, which improved efficiency. As the means of transmitting the engine&#39;s power, the <!--del_lnk--> paddle wheel gave way to the more efficient screw <!--del_lnk--> propeller. The marine <!--del_lnk--> steam turbine developed by Sir <!--del_lnk--> Charles Algernon Parsons, brought the power to weight ratio down. He had achieved publicity by demonstrating it unofficially in the 100-foot <i><!--del_lnk--> Turbinia</i> at the <!--del_lnk--> Spithead <!--del_lnk--> naval review in <!--del_lnk--> 1897. This facilitated a generation of high-speed liners in the first half of the <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a> and rendered the reciprocating steam engine out of date, in warships.<p>Most new ships since around <!--del_lnk--> 1960 have been built with <!--del_lnk--> diesel engines. Rising fuel costs have almost led to the demise of the steam turbine, with many ships being re-engined to improve fuel efficiency. One high profile example was the 1968 built <i><!--del_lnk--> Queen Elizabeth 2</i> which had her turbines replaced with a diesel-electric propulsion plant in 1986. The last major passenger ship built with steam turbines was the <i><!--del_lnk--> Fairsky</i>, launched in 1984. Some specialised merchant ships have also been built with steam turbines since then, notably <!--del_lnk--> Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a> carriers where part of the cargo has been used as fuel for the boilers.<p><a id="LNG_Carriers" name="LNG_Carriers"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">LNG Carriers</span></h4>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> LNG carriers in particular have remained a stronghold for steam , and new ships continue to be built with steam turbines in this high growth area of shipping. This is because the Natural Gas is stored in a liquid state in <!--del_lnk--> cryogenic vessels onboard these ships. A small amount of &quot;boil off&quot; of gas is required to maintain the pressure and temperature inside the vessels to within operating limits. The &quot;boil off&quot; gas provides the fuel for the ship&#39;s boilers, which provide steam for the turbines- the simplest method of dealing with the gas. Technology to operate <!--del_lnk--> internal combustion engines (modified marine <!--del_lnk--> two stroke <!--del_lnk--> diesel engines) on this gas has improved however, so these engines are beginning to appear in LNG carriers; with their greater thermal efficiency, less gas is burnt. Also, developments have been made in the process of re-liquefying &quot;boil off&quot; gas, enabling it to be returned to the cryogenic tanks. The financial returns on LNG are potentially greater than the cost of the marine grade fuel oil burnt in conventional diesel engines, so the re-liquefaction process is starting to be used on diesel engine propelled LNG carriers. Another factor driving the switch from turbines to diesel engines for LNG carriers is the shortage of steam turbine qualified sea going engineers. With the lack of turbine powered ships in other shipping sectors, and the rapid increase in size of the worldwide LNG fleet, not enough have been trained to meet the demand. It may be that the days of the last stronghold for steam turbine propulsion systems are numbered, despite all but sixteen of the orders for new LNG carriers at the end of 2004 being for steam turbine propelled ships. <!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Diesel_propulsion" name="Diesel_propulsion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Diesel propulsion</span></h3>
      <p>The marine <!--del_lnk--> diesel engine first came into use in <!--del_lnk--> 1903 when the rivertanker <!--del_lnk--> <i>Vandal</i> was brought into service by <!--del_lnk--> Branobel. At the same time it was the first <!--del_lnk--> diesel electric ship. It soon offered even greater efficiency than the steam turbine but for many years had an inferior power-to-space ratio. About this period too, heavy <!--del_lnk--> fuel oil came into more general use and began to replace <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a> as the fuel of choice in steamships. Its great advantages were the convenience, the reduction in manning owing to the removal of the need for trimmers and stokers, and the reduction in space required for fuel bunkers. Diesel engines today are broadly classified according to their operating cycle (<!--del_lnk--> two-stroke or <!--del_lnk--> four-stroke), their construction (<!--del_lnk--> crosshead, <!--del_lnk--> trunk, or <!--del_lnk--> opposed piston) and their speed (slow speed, medium speed or high speed). Most modern larger merchant ships use either slow speed, two stroke, crosshead engines, or medium speed, four stroke, trunk engines. Some smaller vessels may operate high speed diesel engines. The operating ranges of the different speed types are as follows;<ul>
       <li>Slow speed- any engine with a maximum operating speed up to 300 revs/minute, although most large 2 stroke slow speed diesel engines operate below 120 revs/minute. Some very long stroke engines have a maximum speed of around 80 revs/minute. The largest, most powerful engines in the world are slow speed, two stroke, crosshead diesels.<li>Medium speed- any engine with a maximum operating speed in the range 300- 900 revs/ minute. Many modern 4 stroke medium speed diesel engines have a maximum operating speed of around 500 rpm.<li>High speed- any engine with a maximum operating speed above 900 revs/ minute</ul>
      <p>As modern ships&#39; propellers are at their most efficient at the operating speed of most slow speed diesel engines, ships with these engines do not generally require gearboxes. Usually such propulsion systems consist of either one or two propeller shafts each with its own direct drive engine. Ships propelled by medium or high speed diesel engines may have one or two (sometimes more) propellers, commonly with one or more engines driving each propeller shaft through a gearbox. Where more than one engine is geared to a single shaft, each engine will most likely drive through a clutch, allowing engines not being used to be disconnected from the gearbox while others continue to operate. This arrangement allows maintenance to be carried out while under way at sea. <!--del_lnk--> Diesel electric is another propulsion system that has been around for a long time, but is becoming more common. By having the engines drive alternators, which supply electricity to motors driving the propellers, gearboxes and clutches can be dispensed with and greater flexibility gained in the positioning of the engines, while still providing the step down in speed required for a medium speed engine to efficiently drive a ships propeller.<p>The size of the different types of engines is an important factor in selecting what will be installed in a new ship. Slow speed two stroke engines are much taller, but the foot print required- length and width- is smaller than that required for four stroke medium speed diesel engines. As space higher up in passenger ships and ferries is at a premium, these ships tend to use multiple medium speed engines resulting in a longer, lower engine room than that required for two stroke diesel engines. Multiple engine installations also gives greater redundancy in the event of mechanical failure of one or more engines and greater efficiency over a wider range of operating conditions.<p><a id="Other_propulsion_systems" name="Other_propulsion_systems"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other propulsion systems</span></h3>
      <p>Many warships built since the 1960s have used <!--del_lnk--> gas turbines for propulsion, as have a few passenger ships, like the <!--del_lnk--> jetfoil. Most recently, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Queen Mary 2</i> has had gas turbines installed in addition to <!--del_lnk--> diesel engines. Because of their poor thermal efficiency, it is common for ships using them to have diesel engines for cruising with gas turbines reserved for when higher speeds are required. Some warships and a few modern cruise ships have also utilised steam turbines to improve the efficiency of gas turbines in a <!--del_lnk--> combined cycle. In such a combined cycle, where waste heat from a gas turbine is used to create steam for driving a steam turbine, thermal efficiency can be the same or slightly greater than that of diesel engines. However, the grade of fuel required for gas turbines is much more expensive than that required for diesel engines so running costs are higher.<p>A few ships have <!--del_lnk--> used nuclear reactors (like <!--del_lnk--> Arktika class icebreaker with 75,000 shaft horsepower), but this is not a separate form of propulsion; the <!--del_lnk--> reactor heats steam to drive the turbines. Nonetheless, it has caused concerns about safety and waste disposal. It has become usual only in large <a href="../../wp/a/Aircraft_carrier.htm" title="Aircraft carrier">aircraft carriers</a>, where the space previously used for ship&#39;s bunkerage could then be used instead to bunker aviation fuel, and in <!--del_lnk--> submarines, where the ability to run submerged at high speed and in relative quiet for long periods holds obvious advantage. A few <!--del_lnk--> cruisers have also employed nuclear power; as of 2006, the only ones remaining in service are the <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russian</a> <!--del_lnk--> Kirov class.<p><a id="General_terminology" name="General_terminology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">General terminology</span></h2>
      <p>Ships may occur collectively as <!--del_lnk--> fleets, <!--del_lnk--> squadrons or <!--del_lnk--> flotillas. <!--del_lnk--> Convoys of ships commonly occur.<p>A collection of ships for military purposes may compose a <!--del_lnk--> navy or a <!--del_lnk--> task force.<p>In the past, people counting or grouping disparate types of ship may refer to the individual vessels as <!--del_lnk--> bottoms, but this generally refers only to merchant vessels. Groups of sailing ships could constitute, say, a fleet of 40 sail. Groups of submarines (particularly German <!--del_lnk--> U-boats in the 1940s) hunt in <!--del_lnk--> wolf packs.<p><a id="Some_types_of_ships_and_boats" name="Some_types_of_ships_and_boats"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Some types of ships and boats</span></h2>
