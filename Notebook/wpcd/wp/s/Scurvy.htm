      <p><b>Scurvy</b> (N.Lat. scorbutus) is a <!--del_lnk--> deficiency disease that results from lack of <a href="../../wp/v/Vitamin_C.htm" title="Vitamin C">vitamin C</a>, which is required for correct <!--del_lnk--> collagen synthesis in humans. The scientific name of vitamin C, ascorbic acid, is derived from the latin name of scurvy, scorbutus. Scurvy leads to the formation of liver spots on the skin, spongy gums, and bleeding from all <!--del_lnk--> mucous membranes. The spots are most abundant on the thighs and legs, and a person with the ailment looks pale, feels depressed, and is partially immobilized.<p>Scurvy was at one time common among <!--del_lnk--> sailors and others who were on ships, whose <a href="../../wp/s/Ship.htm" title="Ship">ships</a> were out to sea longer than perishable <a href="../../wp/f/Fruit.htm" title="Fruit">fruits</a> and <a href="../../wp/v/Vegetable.htm" title="Vegetable">vegetables</a> could be stored and by <!--del_lnk--> soldiers who were similarly separated from these foods for extended periods. It was described by <a href="../../wp/h/Hippocrates.htm" title="Hippocrates">Hippocrates</a> (c. 460 BC&ndash;c. 380 BC). Its cause and cure has been known in many native cultures since prehistory. For example, in 1536, the French explorer <a href="../../wp/j/Jacques_Cartier.htm" title="Jacques Cartier">Jacques Cartier</a>, exploring the <!--del_lnk--> St. Lawrence River, used the local natives&#39; knowledge to save his men who were dying of scurvy. He boiled the needles of the <!--del_lnk--> arbor vitae tree (Eastern White Cedar) to make a tea that was later shown to contain 50 mg of vitamin C per 100 grams.  <p>However it was a Scottish captain in the British <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Navy.htm" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a>, <!--del_lnk--> James Lind (<!--del_lnk--> 1716 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> 1794) who first proved it could be treated with <!--del_lnk--> citrus fruit in experiments he described in his <!--del_lnk--> 1753 book, <i>A Treatise of the Scurvy</i>.<p>In infants, scurvy is sometimes referred to as <b>Barlow&#39;s Disease,</b> named after Sir <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Barlow (<!--del_lnk--> 1845-<!--del_lnk--> 1945), a British <!--del_lnk--> physician who described it. Barlow&#39;s disease is different from <!--del_lnk--> Barlow&#39;s syndrome.<p>Scurvy is also known as <b>Moeller&#39;s disease</b> and <b>Cheadle&#39;s disease</b>.<p>

</script><a id="Prognosis" name="Prognosis"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Prognosis</span></h2>
      <p>Untreated scurvy is always fatal. However, since all that is required for a full recovery is the resumption of normal vitamin C intake, death from scurvy is rare in modern times.<p><a id="Pathophysiology" name="Pathophysiology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Pathophysiology</span></h2>
      <p>Normal <!--del_lnk--> collagen synthesis depends upon the <!--del_lnk--> hydroxylation of <!--del_lnk--> proline and <!--del_lnk--> lysine residues in the endoplasmic reticulum, to form <!--del_lnk--> hydroxyproline and <!--del_lnk--> hydroxylysine, respectively. Prolyl and <!--del_lnk--> lysyl hydroxylase, the enzymes that catalyze the hydroxylation reactions, require vitamin C as a cofactor. In cases of chronic deficiency, hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine are not formed in appreciable amounts and the resulting <!--del_lnk--> collagen fibrils are considerably weaker. This is due in part to the loss of hydrogen bonding between hydroxyprolines and constituent heteroatoms within the collagen &alpha;-helical trimer, which otherwise confer mechanical stability.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p>Scurvy was probably first observed as a disease by <a href="../../wp/h/Hippocrates.htm" title="Hippocrates">Hippocrates</a>. In the <a href="../../wp/1/13th_century.htm" title="13th century">13th century</a> the <a href="../../wp/c/Crusades.htm" title="Crusades">Crusaders</a> suffered from scurvy frequently, and it has inflicted terrible losses on both besieged and besieger in times of war. Scurvy was one of the limiting factors of marine travel, often killing large numbers of the passengers and crew on long-distance voyages. It even played a significant role in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>.<p>The British civilian medical profession of 1614 knew that it was the acidic principle of citrus fruit which was lacking, although they considered any acid as acceptable when ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) was unavailable. In 1614 <!--del_lnk--> John Woodall (Surgeon General of the <a href="../../wp/b/British_East_India_Company.htm" title="British East India Company">East India Company</a>) published his book &quot;The Surgion&#39;s Mate&quot; as a handbook for apprentice surgeons aboard the company&#39;s ships. In it he described scurvy as resulting from a dietary deficiency. His recommendation for its cure was fresh food or, if not available, oranges, lemons, limes and tamarinds, or as a last resort, Oil of Vitriol (<a href="../../wp/s/Sulfuric_acid.htm" title="Sulfuric acid">sulfuric acid</a>).<p>However, it was not until <!--del_lnk--> 1747 that the treatment and prevention of scurvy by supplementation of the diet with citrus fruit such as <a href="../../wp/l/Lemon.htm" title="Lemon">lemons</a> and <!--del_lnk--> limes was introduced into the British Navy by <!--del_lnk--> James Lind. It was in conforming to this policy that Captain <a href="../../wp/j/James_Cook.htm" title="James Cook">James Cook</a> persuaded his men to eat foods such as citrus fruits and <!--del_lnk--> sauerkraut during their voyages of discovery in <!--del_lnk--> HM Bark <i>Endeavour</i>. This major innovation ensured that not a single man was lost to scurvy during Cook&#39;s first voyage, although two did suffer from the disease for a time. This was a remarkable and practically unheard-of achievement in 18th century long-distance sea-faring.<p>The plant known as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> scurvy grass&quot; acquired its name from the observation that it cured scurvy, but this was of no great help to those who spent months at sea. During sea voyages, it was discovered that <!--del_lnk--> sauerkraut was of use in preventing scurvy. In the <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Navy.htm" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a>&#39;s <a href="../../wp/a/Arctic.htm" title="Arctic">Arctic</a> expeditions in the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a> it was widely believed that scurvy was prevented by good hygiene on board ship, regular exercise, and maintaining the morale of the crew, rather than by a diet of fresh food, so that Navy expeditions continued to be plagued by scurvy even while fresh meat was well-known as a practical <!--del_lnk--> antiscorbutic among civilian whalers and explorers in the <a href="../../wp/a/Arctic.htm" title="Arctic">Arctic</a>. At the time <!--del_lnk--> Robert Falcon Scott made his two expeditions to the <!--del_lnk--> Antarctic in the early <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a>, the prevailing medical theory was that scurvy was caused by &quot;tainted&quot; canned food. It was not until <!--del_lnk--> 1932 that the connection between <a href="../../wp/v/Vitamin_C.htm" title="Vitamin C">vitamin C</a> and scurvy was established.<p>The use of limes by the Royal Navy to prevent scurvy gave rise to the name &quot;limey&quot; for a British sailor, which has been since extended to all British in American <!--del_lnk--> slang. The name &quot;<!--del_lnk--> kraut&quot; for a German soldier in World War II may similarly be based on the fact that the German Navy kept sauerkraut as scurvy prevention after the Royal Navy changed to limes.<p><a id="Modern_incidence" name="Modern_incidence"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Modern incidence</span></h2>
      <p>Scurvy is mostly caused by the lack of Vitamin C. In modern western society, scurvy is rarely present in adults. However, vitamin C is destroyed by the process of <!--del_lnk--> pasteurization, so babies fed with ordinary bottled milk sometimes suffer from scurvy if they are not provided with adequate vitamin supplements. Virtually all commercially available baby formulas contain added vitamin C for this reason, however heat destroys vitamin C. Human <!--del_lnk--> breast milk contains sufficient vitamin C to prevent scurvy on its own.<p>Scurvy is one of the accompanying diseases of <!--del_lnk--> malnutrition (other such micronutrient deficiencies are <a href="../../wp/b/Beriberi.htm" title="Beriberi">beriberi</a> or <a href="../../wp/p/Pellagra.htm" title="Pellagra">pellagra</a>) and thus is still widespread in areas of the world depending on external food aid. (See also the report from the <a href="../../wp/w/World_Health_Organization.htm" title="World Health Organization">WHO</a> referenced below.)<p><a id="Prevention" name="Prevention"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Prevention</span></h2>
      <p>Scurvy can be prevented by a diet that includes limes, oranges, and lemons, or the juices of these fruits. Other good sources of Vitamin C are fruits such as guava, papaya, or strawberries. It can also be found in some vegetables, such as bell peppers, tomatoes, broccoli, potatoes, cabbage, and spinach.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scurvy&quot;</div>
