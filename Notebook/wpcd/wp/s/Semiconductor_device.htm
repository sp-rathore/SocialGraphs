      <p>The main reason semiconductor materials are so useful is that the behaviour of a semiconductor can be easily manipulated by the addition of impurities, known as <!--del_lnk--> doping. Semiconductor <!--del_lnk--> conductivity can be controlled by introduction of an electric field, by exposure to <a href="../../wp/l/Light.htm" title="Light">light</a>, and even pressure and heat; thus, semiconductors can make excellent sensors. Current conduction in a <a href="../../wp/s/Semiconductor.htm" title="Semiconductor">semiconductor</a> occurs via mobile or &quot;free&quot; <i><!--del_lnk--> electrons</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> holes</i> (collectively known as <i><!--del_lnk--> charge carriers</i>). Doping a semiconductor such as <a href="../../wp/s/Silicon.htm" title="Silicon">silicon</a> with a small amount of impurity atoms, such as <a href="../../wp/p/Phosphorus.htm" title="Phosphorus">phosphorus</a> or <a href="../../wp/b/Boron.htm" title="Boron">boron</a>, greatly increases the number of free electrons or holes within the semiconductor. When a doped semiconductor contains excess holes it is called &quot;p-type&quot;, and when it contains excess free electrons it is known as &quot;n-type&quot;. The semiconductor material used in devices is doped under highly controlled conditions in a fabrication facility, or <i><!--del_lnk--> fab</i>, to precisely control the location and concentration of p- and n-type dopants. The junctions which form where n-type and p-type semiconductors join together are called <!--del_lnk--> p-n junctions.<p><a id="Diode" name="Diode"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"><!--del_lnk--> Diode</span></h3>
      <p>The <i>p-n junction diode</i> is a device made from a p-n junction. At the junction of a p-type and an n-type semiconductor there forms a region called the <!--del_lnk--> depletion zone which blocks current conduction from the n-type region to the p-type region, but allows current to conduct from the p-type region to the n-type region. Thus when the device is <i>forward biased</i>, with the p-side at higher <!--del_lnk--> electric potential, the diode conducts current easily; but the current is very small when the diode is <i>reverse biased</i>.<p>Exposing a semiconductor to <a href="../../wp/l/Light.htm" title="Light">light</a> can generate <!--del_lnk--> electron&ndash;hole pairs, which increases the number of free carriers and its conductivity. Diodes optimized to take advantage of this phenomenon are known as <i><!--del_lnk--> photodiodes</i>. <!--del_lnk--> Compound semiconductor diodes can also be used to generate light, as in <!--del_lnk--> light-emitting diodes and <!--del_lnk--> laser diodes.<p><a id="Transistor" name="Transistor"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"><!--del_lnk--> Transistor</span></h3>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Bipolar junction transistors are formed from two p-n junctions, in either n-p-n or p-n-p configuration. The middle, or <i>base</i>, region between the junctions is typically very narrow. The other regions, and their associated terminals, are known as the <i>emitter</i> and the <i>collector</i>. A small current injected through the junction between the base and the emitter changes the properties of the base-collector junction so that it can conduct current even though it is reverse biased. This creates a much larger current between the collector and emitter, controlled by the base-emitter current.<p>Another type of transistor, the <!--del_lnk--> field effect transistor operates on the principle that semiconductor conductivity can be increased or decreased by the presence of an electric field. An <a href="../../wp/e/Electric_field.htm" title="Electric field">electric field</a> can increase the number of free electrons and holes in a semiconductor, thereby changing its conductivity. The field may be applied by a reverse-biased p-n junction, forming a <i>junction field effect transistor</i>, or <!--del_lnk--> JFET; or by an electrode isolated from the bulk material by an oxide layer, forming a <i>metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor</i>, or <!--del_lnk--> MOSFET.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The MOSFET is the most used semiconductor device today.

Depending on the type of carrier in the channel, the device may be an <i>n-channel</i> (for electrons) or a <i>p-channel</i> (for holes) MOSFET. Although the MOSFET is named in part for its &quot;metal&quot; gate, in modern devices <!--del_lnk--> polysilicon is typically used instead.<p><a id="Semiconductor_device_materials" name="Semiconductor_device_materials"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Semiconductor device materials</span></h2>

      <p>By far, <a href="../../wp/s/Silicon.htm" title="Silicon">silicon</a> (Si) is the most widely used material in semiconductor devices. Its combination of low raw material cost, relatively simple processing, and a useful temperature range make it currently the best compromise among the various competing materials. Silicon used in semiconductor device manufacturing is currently fabricated into <!--del_lnk--> boules that are large enough in diameter to allow the production of 300 <!--del_lnk--> mm (12 <!--del_lnk--> in.) <!--del_lnk--> wafers.<p><a href="../../wp/g/Germanium.htm" title="Germanium">Germanium</a> (Ge) was a widely used early semiconductor material but its thermal sensitivity makes it less useful than silicon. Today, germanium is often alloyed with silicon for use in very-high-speed SiGe devices; <!--del_lnk--> IBM is a major producer of such devices.<p><!--del_lnk--> Gallium arsenide (GaAs) is also widely used in high-speed devices but so far, it has been difficult to form large-diameter boules of this material, limiting the wafer diameter to sizes significantly smaller than silicon wafers thus making mass production of GaAs devices significantly more expensive than silicon.<p>Other less common materials are also in use or under investigation.<p><!--del_lnk--> Silicon carbide (SiC) has found some application as the raw material for blue <!--del_lnk--> light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and is being investigated for use in semiconductor devices that could withstand very high operating temperatures and environments with the presence of significant levels of <!--del_lnk--> ionizing radiation. <!--del_lnk--> IMPATT diodes have also been fabricated from SiC.<p>Various <a href="../../wp/i/Indium.htm" title="Indium">indium</a> compounds (indium arsenide, indium <a href="../../wp/a/Antimony.htm" title="Antimony">antimonide</a>, and indium <a href="../../wp/p/Phosphorus.htm" title="Phosphorus">phosphide</a>) are also being used in LEDs and solid state <!--del_lnk--> laser diodes. <a href="../../wp/s/Selenium.htm" title="Selenium">Selenium</a> <!--del_lnk--> sulfide is being studied in the manufacture of <!--del_lnk--> photovoltaic <!--del_lnk--> solar cells.<p><a id="List_of_common_semiconductor_devices" name="List_of_common_semiconductor_devices"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Semiconductor device applications</span></h2>
      <p>All transistor types can be used as the building blocks of <!--del_lnk--> logic gates, which are fundamental in the design of <!--del_lnk--> digital circuits. In digital circuits like <!--del_lnk--> microprocessors, transistors act as on-off switches; in the MOSFET, for instance, the <!--del_lnk--> voltage applied to the gate determines whether the <!--del_lnk--> switch is on or off.<p>Transistors used for <!--del_lnk--> analog circuits do not act as on-off switches; rather, they respond to a continuous range of inputs with a continuous range of outputs. Common analog circuits include <!--del_lnk--> amplifiers and <!--del_lnk--> oscillators.<p>Circuits that interface or translate between digital circuits and analog circuits are known as <!--del_lnk--> mixed-signal circuits.<p><!--del_lnk--> Power semiconductor devices are discrete devices or integrated circuits intended for high current or high voltage applications. Power integrated circuits combine IC technology with power semiconductor technology, these are sometimes referred to as &quot;smart&quot; power devices. Several companies specialize in manufacturing power semiconductors.<p><a id="Component_identifiers" name="Component_identifiers"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Component identifiers</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> type designators of semiconductor devices are often manufacturer specific. Nevertheless, there have been attempts at creating standards for type codes, and a subset of devices follow those. For <!--del_lnk--> discrete devices, for example, there are three standards: <!--del_lnk--> JEDEC JESD370B in <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">USA</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Pro Electron in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> and <!--del_lnk--> JIS in <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>.<p><a id="History_of_semiconductor_device_development" name="History_of_semiconductor_device_development"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History of semiconductor device development</span></h2>
      <p><a name="1900s"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1900s</span></h3>
      <p>Semiconductors had been used in the electronics field for some time before the invention of the transistor. Around the turn of the 20th century they were quite common as detectors in <a href="../../wp/r/Radio.htm" title="Radio">radios</a>, used in a device called a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> cat&#39;s whisker&quot;. These detectors were somewhat troublesome, however, requiring the operator to move a small tungsten filament (the whisker) around the surface of a <!--del_lnk--> galena (lead sulfide) or <!--del_lnk--> carborundum (silicon carbide) crystal until it suddenly started working. Then, over a period of a few hours or days, the cat&#39;s whisker would slowly stop working and the process would have to be repeated. At the time their operation was completely mysterious. After the introduction of the more reliable and amplified <!--del_lnk--> vacuum tube based radios, the cat&#39;s whisker systems quickly disappeared. The &quot;cat&#39;s whisker&quot; is a primitive example of a special type of diode still popular today, called a <!--del_lnk--> Schottky diode.<p><a id="World_War_II" name="World_War_II"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">World War II</span></h3>
      <p>During World War II, <a href="../../wp/r/Radar.htm" title="Radar">radar</a> research quickly pushed radar receivers to operate at ever higher <!--del_lnk--> frequencies and the traditional tube based radio receivers no longer worked well. The introduction of the <!--del_lnk--> cavity magnetron from Britain to the United States in 1940 during the <!--del_lnk--> Tizard Mission resulted in a pressing need for a practical high-frequency amplifier.<p>On a whim, <!--del_lnk--> Russell Ohl of <!--del_lnk--> Bell Laboratories decided to try a cat&#39;s whisker. By this point they had not been in use for a number of years, and no one at the labs had one. After hunting one down at a used radio store in <!--del_lnk--> Manhattan, he found that it worked much better than tube-based systems.<p>Ohl investigated why the cat&#39;s whisker functioned so well. He spent most of 1939 trying to grow more pure versions of the crystals. He soon found that with higher quality crystals their finicky behaviour went away, but so did their ability to operate as a radio detector. One day he found one of his purest crystals nevertheless worked well, and interestingly, it had a clearly visible crack near the middle. However as he moved about the room trying to test it, the detector would mysteriously work, and then stop again. After some study he found that the behaviour was controlled by the light in the room&ndash;more light caused more conductance in the crystal. He invited several other people to see this crystal, and <!--del_lnk--> Walter Brattain immediately realized there was some sort of junction at the crack.<p>Further research cleared up the remaining mystery. The crystal had cracked because either side contained very slightly different amounts of the impurities Ohl could not remove&ndash;about 0.2%. One side of the crystal had impurities that added extra electrons (the carriers of electrical current) and made it a &quot;conductor&quot;. The other had impurities that wanted to bind to these electrons, making it (what he called) an &quot;insulator&quot;. Because the two parts of the crystal were in contact with each other, the electrons could be pushed out of the conductive side which had extra electrons (soon to be known as the <i>emitter</i>) and replaced by new ones being provided (from a battery, for instance) where they would flow into the insulating portion and be collected by the whisker filament (named the <i>collector</i>). However, when the voltage was reversed the electrons being pushed into the collector would quickly fill up the &quot;holes&quot; (the electron-needy impurities), and conduction would stop almost instantly. This junction of the two crystals (or parts of one crystal) created a solid-state diode, and the concept soon became known as semiconduction. The mechanism of action when the diode is off has to do with the separation of <!--del_lnk--> charge carriers around the junction. This is called a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> depletion region&quot;.<p><a id="Development_of_the_diode" name="Development_of_the_diode"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Development of the diode</span></h3>
      <p>Armed with the knowledge of how these new diodes worked, a vigorous effort began in order to learn how to build them on demand. Teams at <!--del_lnk--> Purdue University, <!--del_lnk--> Bell Labs, <!--del_lnk--> MIT, and the <a href="../../wp/u/University_of_Chicago.htm" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a> all joined forces to build better crystals. Within a year germanium production had been perfected to the point where military-grade diodes were being used in most radar sets.<p><a id="Development_of_the_transistor" name="Development_of_the_transistor"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Development of the transistor</span></h3>
      <p>After the war, <!--del_lnk--> William Shockley decided to attempt the building of a <!--del_lnk--> triode-like semiconductor device. He secured funding and lab space, and went to work on the problem with Brattain and <!--del_lnk--> John Bardeen.<p>The key to the development of the transistor was the further understanding of the process of the <!--del_lnk--> electron mobility in a semiconductor. It was realized that if there was some way to control the flow of the electrons from the emitter to the collector of this newly discovered diode, one could build an amplifier. For instance, if you placed contacts on either side of a single type of crystal the current would not flow through it. However if a third contact could then &quot;inject&quot; electrons or holes into the material, the current would flow.<p>Actually doing this appeared to be very difficult. If the crystal were of any reasonable size, the number of electrons (or holes) required to be injected would have to be very large -&ndash; making it less than useful as an <!--del_lnk--> amplifier because it would require a large injection current to start with. That said, the whole idea of the crystal diode was that the crystal itself could provide the electrons over a very small distance, the depletion region. The key appeared to be to place the input and output contacts very close together on the surface of the crystal on either side of this region.<p>Brattain started working on building such a device, and tantalizing hints of amplification continued to appear as the team worked on the problem. Sometimes the system would work but then stop working unexpectedly. In one instance a non-working system started working when placed in water. Ohl and Brattain eventually developed a new branch of <a href="../../wp/q/Quantum_mechanics.htm" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> known as <!--del_lnk--> surface physics to account for the behaviour. The electrons in any one piece of the crystal would migrate about due to nearby charges. Electrons in the emitters, or the &quot;holes&quot; in the collectors, would cluster at the surface of the crystal where they could find their opposite charge &quot;floating around&quot; in the air (or water). Yet they could be pushed away from the surface with the application of a small amount of charge from any other location on the crystal. Instead of needing a large supply of injected electrons, a very small number in the right place on the crystal would accomplish the same thing.<p>Their understanding solved the problem of needing a very small control area to some degree. Instead of needing two separate semiconductors connected by a common, but tiny, region, a single larger surface would serve. The emitter and collector leads would both be placed very close together on the top, with the control lead placed on the base of the crystal. When current was applied to the &quot;base&quot; lead, the electrons or holes would be pushed out, across the block of semiconductor, and collect on the far surface. As long as the emitter and collector were very close together, this should allow enough electrons or holes between them to allow conduction to start.<p><a id="The_first_transistor" name="The_first_transistor"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The first transistor</span></h3>

      <p>The Bell team made many attempts to build such a system with various tools, but generally failed. Setups where the contacts were close enough were invariably as fragile as the original cat&#39;s whisker detectors had been, and would work briefly, if at all. Eventually they had a practical breakthrough. A piece of gold foil was glued to the edge of a plastic wedge, and then the foil was sliced with a razor at the tip of the triangle. The result was two very closely spaced contacts of gold. When the plastic was pushed down onto the surface of a crystal and voltage applied to the other side (on the base of the crystal), current started to flow from one contact to the other as the base voltage pushed the electrons away from the base towards the other side near the contacts. The point-contact transistor had been invented.<p>While the device was constructed a week earlier, Brattain&#39;s notes describe the first demonstration to higher-ups at Bell Labs on the afternoon of <!--del_lnk--> 23 December <!--del_lnk--> 1947, often given as the birthdate of the transistor. The &quot;PNP point-contact germanium transistor&quot; operated as a speech amplifier with a power gain of 18 in that trial. Known generally as a <!--del_lnk--> point-contact transistor today, <!--del_lnk--> John Bardeen, <!--del_lnk--> Walter Houser Brattain, and <!--del_lnk--> William Bradford Shockley were awarded the <!--del_lnk--> Nobel Prize in physics for their work in 1956.<p><a id="Origin_of_the_term_.22transistor.22" name="Origin_of_the_term_.22transistor.22"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Origin of the term &quot;transistor&quot;</span></h3>
      <p>Bell Telephone Laboratories needed a generic name for their new invention: &quot;Semiconductor Triode&quot;, &quot;Solid Triode&quot;, &quot;Surface States Triode&quot; [sic], &quot;Crystal Triode&quot; and &quot;Iotatron&quot; were all considered, but &quot;transistor&quot;, coined by <!--del_lnk--> John R. Pierce, won an internal ballot. The rationale for the name is described in the following extract from the company&#39;s Technical Memoranda (<!--del_lnk--> May 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1948) calling for votes:<blockquote>
       <p>Transistor. This is an abbreviated combination of the words &quot;transconductance&quot; or &quot;transfer&quot;, and &quot;varistor&quot;. The device logically belongs in the varistor family, and has the transconductance or transfer impedance of a device having gain, so that this combination is descriptive.</blockquote>
      <p><a id="Improvements_in_transistor_design" name="Improvements_in_transistor_design"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Improvements in transistor design</span></h3>
      <p>Shockley was upset about the device being credited to Brattain and Bardeen, who he felt had built it &quot;behind his back&quot; to take the glory. Matters became worse when Bell Labs lawyers found that some of Shockley&#39;s own writings on the transistor were close enough to those of an earlier 1925 patent by <!--del_lnk--> Julius Edgar Lilienfeld that they thought it best that his name be left off the patent application.<p>Shockley was incensed, and decided to demonstrate who was the real brains of the operation. Only a few months later he invented an entirely new type of transistor with a layer or &#39;sandwich&#39; structure. This new form was considerably more robust than the fragile point-contact system, and would go on to be used for the vast majority of all transistors into the 1960s. It would evolve into the <!--del_lnk--> bipolar junction transistor.<p>With the fragility problems solved, a remaining problem was purity. Making <a href="../../wp/g/Germanium.htm" title="Germanium">germanium</a> of the required purity was proving to be a serious problem, and limited the number of transistors that actually worked from a given batch of material. Germanium&#39;s sensitivity to temperature also limited its usefulness. Scientists theorized that silicon would be easier to fabricate, but few bothered to investigate this possibility. <!--del_lnk--> Gordon K. Teal was the first to develop a working silicon transistor, and his company, the nascent <!--del_lnk--> Texas Instruments, profited from its technological edge. Germanium disappeared from most transistors by the late 1960s.<p>Within a few years, transistor-based products, most notably radios, were appearing on the market. A major improvement in manufacturing yield came when a chemist advised the companies fabricating semiconductors to use <!--del_lnk--> distilled water rather than tap water: <a href="../../wp/c/Calcium.htm" title="Calcium">calcium</a> <!--del_lnk--> ions were the cause of the poor yields. &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Zone melting&quot;, a technique using a moving band of molten material through the crystal, further increased the purity of the available crystals.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_device&quot;</div>
