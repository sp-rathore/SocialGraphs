      <p>Human remains and artifacts from more than 100,000 years ago have been found in Swaziland. The earliest inhabitants of the area were <!--del_lnk--> Khoisan <!--del_lnk--> hunter-gatherers. They were largely replaced by Bantu tribes during <a href="../../wp/b/Bantu.htm" title="Bantu">Bantu</a> <!--del_lnk--> migrations. Evidence of agriculture and iron use dates from about the <a href="../../wp/4/4th_century.htm" title="4th century">4th century</a>, and people speaking languages ancestral to current <!--del_lnk--> Sotho and <!--del_lnk--> Nguni languages began settling no later than the <a href="../../wp/1/11th_century.htm" title="11th century">11th century</a>. The ruling Dlamini lineage had chiefships in the region in the <a href="../../wp/1/18th_century.htm" title="18th century">18th century</a>. An enlarged Swazi kingdom was established by <!--del_lnk--> King Sobhuza I in the early <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a>. Soon thereafter the first whites started to settle in the area. In the <!--del_lnk--> 1890s the <!--del_lnk--> South African Republic in the <!--del_lnk--> Transvaal claimed sovereignty over Swaziland but never fully established power. After the <!--del_lnk--> South African War of <!--del_lnk--> 1899&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 1902, Swaziland became a British protectorate. The country was eventually granted independence on <!--del_lnk--> September 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1968. Since then, Swaziland has seen a struggle between pro-democracy activists and the totalitarian monarchy.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> head of state is the king, currently <!--del_lnk--> King Mswati III, who ascended to the throne upon the death of his father <!--del_lnk--> King Sobhuza II in <!--del_lnk--> 1986. By tradition, the king reigns along with his mother (the <i>Indlovukazi</i>, lit. <i>Great She-Elephant</i>), the former viewed as the administrative head of state and the latter as a spiritual and national head of state. As the monarch, the king not only appoints the prime minister &mdash; the head of government &mdash; but also appoints a small number of representatives for both chambers of the <!--del_lnk--> Libandla (parliament). The <!--del_lnk--> Senate consists of 30 members, while the <!--del_lnk--> House of Assembly has 65 seats, 55 of which are occupied by elected representatives (elections are held every 5 years in November). It is important to note that with so much power is in the hands of the king, effectively Swaziland is an absolute monarchy, despite the presence of a nominally democratic parliamentary system.<p>The constitution that was adopted in 1968 was suspended in 1973 in a State of Emergency decree presumably still in force today, though the government claims that it has been dissolved. In <!--del_lnk--> 2001 King Mswati III appointed a committee to draft a new constitution. Drafts were released for comment in May 2003 and November 2004. However, they were strongly criticized by civil society organizations in Swaziland and human rights organizations elsewhere. In 2005, the constitution was put into effect, though there is still much debate in the country about that issue.<p><!--del_lnk--> King Mswati III is often strongly criticized for living so lavishly in a nation that is afflicted by the world&#39;s highest <a href="../../wp/h/HIV.htm" title="HIV">HIV</a> infection rates at 42.6 percent. His fleet of luxury cars, and the millions spent towards refurbishing his numerous wives&#39; luxury mansions, are at odds with the approximately 34 percent of the population that stand unemployed, and nearly 70 percent of the population who live on less than a dollar a day. Swaziland is one of the poorest nations in the world, although one of the wealthier nations in Africa, and has a very low <!--del_lnk--> HDI development score.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>Swaziland ranks among the more prosperous countries in <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>. Most of the high-level economic activity is in the hands of non-Africans, but ethnic Swazis are becoming more active. Small entrepreneurs are moving into middle management positions. 70% of Swazis live in rural areas and are being ravaged by drought and a resulting food crisis that threatens hundreds of thousands with hunger. The past few years have seen wavering economic growth, which has been exacerbated by the economy&#39;s inability to create new jobs at the same rate that new job seekers enter the market. This is due largely in part to the country&#39;s population growth rate that strains the natural heritage and the country&#39;s ability to provide adequate <!--del_lnk--> social services, such as <!--del_lnk--> health care and <a href="../../wp/e/Education.htm" title="Education">education</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Overgrazing, <!--del_lnk--> soil depletion, <a href="../../wp/d/Drought.htm" title="Drought">drought</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> floods are persistent problems. In <!--del_lnk--> 2004 Swaziland acknowledged for the first time that it suffered an AIDS crisis, with 42.6% of the population infected with HIV (see <!--del_lnk--> AIDS_in_Africa). Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> Themba Dlamini declared a humanitarian crisis due to the combined effect of drought and land degradation, increased poverty, and HIV/AIDS. The <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> special envoy on <a href="../../wp/a/AIDS.htm" title="AIDS">AIDS</a>, Stephen Lewis, said: &ldquo;Swaziland stands alone with the world&#39;s highest rate of <a href="../../wp/h/HIV.htm" title="HIV">HIV</a> infection after nearby <a href="../../wp/b/Botswana.htm" title="Botswana">Botswana</a> made headway against the deadly pandemic&rdquo;<p>Nearly 60% of Swazi territory is held by the Crown in the trust of the Swazi nation. The balance is privately owned, much of it by foreigners. The questions of land use and ownership remains a very sensitive one. For Swazis living on rural homesteads, the principal occupation is either subsistence farming or livestock herding. Culturally, cattle are important symbols of wealth and status, but they are being used increasingly for milk, meat and profit.<p>Swaziland enjoys well-developed road links with <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>. It also has railroads running east to west and north to south. The older east-west link, called the <!--del_lnk--> Goba line, makes it possible to export bulk goods from Swaziland through the Port of <a href="../../wp/m/Maputo.htm" title="Maputo">Maputo</a> in <a href="../../wp/m/Mozambique.htm" title="Mozambique">Mozambique</a>. Until recently, most of Swaziland&#39;s imports were shipped through this port. Conflict in Mozambique in the 1980s diverted many Swazi exports to ports in South Africa. A north-south rail link, completed in 1986, provides a connection between the Eastern Transvaal (now Mpumalanga) rail network and the South African ports of <!--del_lnk--> Richards Bay and <!--del_lnk--> Durban.<p>The sugar industry, based solely on irrigated cane, is Swaziland&#39;s leading export earner and private-sector employer. Soft drink concentrate (a U.S. investment) is the country&#39;s largest export earner, followed by wood pulp and lumber from cultivated pine forests. <!--del_lnk--> Pineapple, <!--del_lnk--> citrus fruit, and <a href="../../wp/c/Cotton.htm" title="Cotton">cotton</a> are other important <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agricultural</a> exports.<p>Swaziland mines coal and diamonds for export. There also is a quarry industry for domestic consumption. Mining contributes about 1.8% of Swaziland&#39;s GDP each year but has been declining in importance in recent years.<p>Recently, a number of industrial firms have located at the industrial estate at Matsapha near Manzini. In addition to processed agricultural and forestry products, the fast-growing industrial sector at Matsapha also produces garments, textiles, and a variety of light manufactured products. The Swaziland Industrial Development Company (SIDC) and the Swaziland Investment Promotion Authority (SIPA) have assisted in bringing many of these industries to the country. Government programs encourage Swazi entrepreneurs to run small and medium-sized firms. Tourism also is important, attracting more than 424,000 visitors annually (mostly from Europe and South Africa).<p>From the mid-1980s foreign investment in the manufacturing sector boosted economic growth rates significantly. Since mid-1985, the depreciated value of the currency has increased the competitiveness of Swazi exports and moderated the growth of imports, generating trade surpluses. During the 1990s, the country often ran small trade deficits. South Africa and the European Union are major customers for Swazi exports. The United States is a significant market for Swazi sugar, a market that would presumably extend to textiles should Swaziland become a beneficiary of the African Growth Opportunity Act.<p>Swaziland, Lesotho, Botswana, Namibia, and the Republic of South Africa form the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), where import duties apply uniformly to member countries. Swaziland, Lesotho, Namibia, and South Africa also are members of the Common Monetary Area (CMA) in which repatriation and unrestricted funds are permitted. Swaziland issues its own currency, the <!--del_lnk--> lilangeni (plural: emalangeni), which is at par with the <!--del_lnk--> South African rand.<p>Swaziland is in the process or formulating an <!--del_lnk--> Action Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour, which is expected to be adopted in the period 2006-2007.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swaziland&quot;</div>
