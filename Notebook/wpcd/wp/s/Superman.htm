      <p><b>Superman</b> is a <!--del_lnk--> fictional character and one of the most famous and popular <!--del_lnk--> comic book <!--del_lnk--> superheroes of all time. Created by <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">American</a> writer <!--del_lnk--> Jerry Siegel and <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canadian</a>-born artist <!--del_lnk--> Joe Shuster in <!--del_lnk--> 1932 while both were growing up in <a href="../../wp/c/Cleveland%252C_Ohio.htm" title="Cleveland, Ohio">Cleveland, Ohio</a>, and sold to <!--del_lnk--> Detective Comics Inc. the same year Superman debuted in <i><!--del_lnk--> Action Comics</i> #1 (June <!--del_lnk--> 1938), the character has since appeared in radio serials, <!--del_lnk--> television programs, <!--del_lnk--> films, <!--del_lnk--> comic books, <!--del_lnk--> newspaper strips and <!--del_lnk--> video games, contributing to his long-standing ubiquity.<p>Superman is born <b>Kal-El</b> on an alien planet &mdash; later named <!--del_lnk--> Krypton &mdash; and is rocketed to <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a> as an infant by his scientist father moments before the planet&#39;s destruction. The rocket lands on Earth, where he is found by passing motorists who adopt him and give him the name <b><!--del_lnk--> Clark Kent</b>. As Clark reaches maturity, he learns he has superhuman abilities, which he resolves to use to help others, fighting anything from petty crime to universal threats. After adopting a costume consisting of a blue <!--del_lnk--> shirt with a stylized &quot;S&quot; on the chest, a pair of red <!--del_lnk--> briefs over blue <!--del_lnk--> pants, a pair of red <!--del_lnk--> boots, and a red <!--del_lnk--> cape, he becomes Earth&#39;s champion, with the media giving him several nicknames including <b>&quot;The Man of Steel&quot;</b>, <b>&quot;The Man of Tomorrow&quot;</b>, and <b>&quot;The Last Son of Krypton&quot;</b>.

      <p>The details of Superman&#39;s origin, relationships and abilities changed significantly during the course of the character&#39;s publication, from what is considered the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Age of comic books through the <!--del_lnk--> Modern Age.<p><a id="Golden_Age" name="Golden_Age"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Golden Age</span></h3>
      <p>As shown in the original Golden Age comics &mdash; including <i><!--del_lnk--> Action Comics</i> #1 (1938), <i><!--del_lnk--> Superman</i> (Vol. 1) #1 (1939), and <i>Superman</i> (Vol. 1) #61 (1949), as well as in later stories such as <i>Secret Origins</i> (Vol. 2) #1 (<!--del_lnk--> 1986) &mdash; noted scientist Jor-L discovers that <!--del_lnk--> Krypton is about to explode, yet he cannot convince his fellow <!--del_lnk--> Kryptonians to save themselves. However, he manages to construct a spaceship to save his infant son, Kal-L. The ship launches just as the planet explodes, with Kal-L landing on <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a> in a farm country town (later identified as <!--del_lnk--> Smallville) around the time of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>. In this version, John and Mary Kent (passing motorists who witness the spaceship landing) take the infant to an <!--del_lnk--> orphanage and soon return to adopt the child, naming him Clark. In his <!--del_lnk--> 1942 novel, <!--del_lnk--> George Lowther changes the names Jor-L, Kal-L and Lora (Superman&#39;s birth mother) to the more modern <!--del_lnk--> Jor-El and <!--del_lnk--> Lara. According to an interview with Joe Shuster shortly before his death, the name &quot;Clark Kent&quot; was chosen as a combination of the names of two movie stars, <!--del_lnk--> Clark Gable and <!--del_lnk--> Kent Taylor <p>Clark grows up on the Kent family farm, slowly discovering that he possesses various superpowers but unaware of his <!--del_lnk--> Kryptonian origins. After the deaths of his adoptive parents, Clark decides to use his powers for the benefit of humanity, constructing a stylized costume and moving to the nearby city of <!--del_lnk--> Metropolis. Clark begins work as a reporter at the <i>Daily Star</i> newspaper and soon makes his debut as the world&#39;s first superhero, Superman.<p>The earliest Superman stories were written by Siegel, and drawn by Shuster in a style heavily influenced by comic strip artist <!--del_lnk--> Roy Crane. According to <!--del_lnk--> Jules Feiffer, &quot;Shuster represented the best of old-style comic book drawing. His work was direct, unprettied - crude and vigorous; as easy to read as a diagram.... Slickness, thank God, was beyond his means&quot; (Feiffer,The Great Comic Book Heroes, 1965). In the last interview Shuster gave before his death, he explained that he had modelled the visual appearance of Clark Kent on himself and movie star Harold Lloyd, and that of Superman on Douglas Fairbanks Senior. Lois Lane was modeled after Joanne Carter, who would later marry Jerry Siegel. The skyscape of Metropolis was inspired by that of the City of Toronto, where Shuster had spent most of his childhood, and the newspaper employing Clark Kent, originally the Daily Star, was named after the Toronto Star for which Shuster had been a paperboy. (Mietkewicz, above)<p>With Superman&#39;s quick success, the demand for Superman stories exceeded the creator&#39;s ability to produce them. Although the stories continued to carry the Siegel and Shuster byline, progressively more of the work was done by assistants in the Siegel and Shuster studio (Les Daniels, Comix: A History of Comic Books in America, 1971). But the use of assistants was not always successful. According to Jules Feiffer, Shuster &quot;could not draw well, but he drew single-mindedly -- no one could ghost that style. It was the man. When assistants began &#39;improving&#39; the appearance of the strip it went downhill. It looked as though it was being drawn in a bank&quot; (Feiffer, above). One story in which Superman encountered a fictional cartoonist provided a tongue-in-cheek look at how such work was delegated. The story, which purported on the title page to tell &quot;how comic strips are written and drawn&quot;, showed a studio filled with &quot;artists -- stacks of them -- figure men, background specialists, inkers, letterers&quot; as well as script-writers, all devoted to the production of stories about a Superman-like character, while the original creator of the strip was to Superman&#39;s consternation kept busy answering his fan mail (&quot;King of the Comic Books&quot;, Superman no. 25, 1943).<p>In the early stories, Superman is the only science-fiction element. He is described as the champion of the helpless and the oppressed, and he combats real-world social evils: munitions manufacturers, dangerous conditions in mines and a hit-and-run drunk driver (in <i>Superman</i> #1), rigged prize fights and corrupt businessmen (in <i>Superman</i> #2), child abusers and wife beaters (in <i>Superman</i> #3) and crooked cops and politicians (in <i>Superman</i> #7). By 1940, more extraordinary antagonists began to appear in the stories, including giants, mad scientists and dinosaurs.<p>Superman&#39;s powers also developed during the <!--del_lnk--> 1940s, including vast increases in strength and acquiring the ability to fly &mdash; the earliest comics depict Superman able to leap only an eighth of a mile at a time. In <i>Superman</i> (Vol. 1) #61 (1949), Superman finally learns of the existence of <!--del_lnk--> Krypton. Superman becomes an honorary member of the <!--del_lnk--> Justice Society of America, though he only participates in two capers in the original <!--del_lnk--> Golden Age stories (<i>All-Star Comics</i> #8 and #36).<p>Beginning in the 1940s, Superman&#39;s life as a boy is gradually fleshed out. The first <!--del_lnk--> Superboy story appears in <i><!--del_lnk--> More Fun Comics</i> #101 (February 1945) but the locale is still not clearly specified though it appears to be a <!--del_lnk--> Metropolis neighbourhood, and the Kents still do not have names. <!--del_lnk--> Superboy is not established as a <!--del_lnk--> Smallville resident until <i><!--del_lnk--> Superboy</i> (Vol. 1) #2 (May 1949) and his parents&#39; names, <!--del_lnk--> Jonathan and <!--del_lnk--> Martha Kent, are not mentioned until <i><!--del_lnk--> Superboy</i> (Vol. 1) #12 in January 1951, twelve years after his debut in <i><!--del_lnk--> Action Comics</i> #1.<p>Other developments in the Superman mythos appear as a result of appearances in other media, including radio and newspaper strips. The <i>Daily Star</i> becomes the <i><!--del_lnk--> Daily Planet</i> &mdash; possibly because newspapers called <i>The Daily Star</i> already existed &mdash; and <!--del_lnk--> Perry White replaces original editor George Taylor in the first episode of the radio serial; an office boy named <!--del_lnk--> Jimmy Olsen joins the cast soon afterward.<p><a id="Silver_Age" name="Silver_Age"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Silver Age</span></h3>
      <p>During the <!--del_lnk--> 1940s and <!--del_lnk--> 1950s, the Superman mythos gradually added familiar elements firmly established by the late 1950s, such as greater emphasis on the <!--del_lnk--> science fiction elements of Superman&#39;s world, including his <!--del_lnk--> Kryptonian origins as well as an updated version of his origins.<p>In the version that became extant by the early <!--del_lnk--> 1960s (and memorably summarized at the start of each episode of the 1950s <i><!--del_lnk--> Adventures of Superman</i> <!--del_lnk--> television series), Superman is born on <!--del_lnk--> Krypton as Kal-El, the son of <!--del_lnk--> Jor-El (a leader-scientist) and <!--del_lnk--> Lara. When Kal-El is two or three years-old, <!--del_lnk--> Jor-El learns that <!--del_lnk--> Krypton is doomed to explode. He brings this warning to the Science Council, <!--del_lnk--> Krypton&#39;s rulers. The Science Council refuses to warn their fellow <!--del_lnk--> Kryptonians and forbids <!--del_lnk--> Jor-El to do so. <!--del_lnk--> Jor-El immediately begins work on a rocket that will allow the whole family to escape the coming disaster; however, events move too quickly, and only a small model is completed by the time of the final quakes. <!--del_lnk--> Lara stays by her husband&#39;s side rather than accompany Kal-El to <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a> so that his ship will have a better chance of surviving the trip. Knowing that <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a>&#39;s lower gravity and yellow <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">sun</a> will give the boy extraordinary powers, <!--del_lnk--> Jor-El launches Kal-El&#39;s rocketship toward <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a> moments before <!--del_lnk--> Krypton explodes.<p>Kal-El&#39;s ship lands in a field near the town of <!--del_lnk--> Smallville and is discovered by <!--del_lnk--> Jonathan and <!--del_lnk--> Martha Kent. They name the child <!--del_lnk--> Clark after Martha&#39;s maiden name. After formally adopting him, the Kents raise him. The Kents discover his amazing powers and train their adopted son to use his powers constructively. At the age of eight, Clark adopts the superhero identity &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Superboy&quot; and fights crime, both in the present and in the far future as a member of the <!--del_lnk--> Legion of Super-Heroes. After his graduation from high school and the death of his adoptive parents, Clark moves to <!--del_lnk--> Metropolis to attend Metropolis University. During his junior year, Clark changes his superhero name to &quot;Superman&quot;. After graduating with a degree in <!--del_lnk--> journalism, Clark is hired by the <i><!--del_lnk--> Daily Planet</i>.<p>In 1971, the <b>Galaxy Broadcasting Station</b> and its president, <!--del_lnk--> Morgan Edge, purchase the <i><!--del_lnk--> Daily Planet</i>, Edge subsequently naming Clark as the lead <!--del_lnk--> anchorman for its <!--del_lnk--> Metropolis television station, WGBS-TV. Later in the <!--del_lnk--> 1970s, childhood friend <!--del_lnk--> Lana Lang joins Clark in his newscasts as co-anchor.<p>After the establishment of <!--del_lnk--> DC Comics&#39; <!--del_lnk--> Multiverse in the 1960s, it is established retroactively that the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Age version of Superman lives on the <!--del_lnk--> parallel world of <!--del_lnk--> Earth-Two and is named &quot;Kal-L&quot;, while his <!--del_lnk--> Silver Age counterpart lives on <!--del_lnk--> Earth-One and is named &quot;Kal-El.&quot;<p>While the <!--del_lnk--> Multiverse allowed for <!--del_lnk--> DC Comics to bring <!--del_lnk--> Golden Age stories back into continuity, it also created problems. There had been no break in Superman stories between the <!--del_lnk--> Golden and <!--del_lnk--> Silver Ages; the character had been published in one ongoing story since his debut. Additionally, <!--del_lnk--> DC had dropped the name &quot;Kal-L&quot; in favour of &quot;Kal-El&quot; before the end of the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Age. A series of stories in the 1970s establish that the <!--del_lnk--> Earth-Two Superman <!--del_lnk--> had married his version of Lois Lane in the 1950s (<i><!--del_lnk--> Action Comics</i> #484 (<!--del_lnk--> 1978)) and had become the editor-in-chief of <i>The Daily Star</i>. In the early 1970s, Kal-L discovers a <!--del_lnk--> Kryptonian rocket that contains his cousin, Kara Zor-L. After acclimating to <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a>, Kara becomes the superheroine <!--del_lnk--> Power Girl. Kal-L also continues to serve with the revived <!--del_lnk--> Justice Society; he is revealed as a founding member of the group in the team&#39;s origin story in <i>DC Special</i> #29. In the early <!--del_lnk--> 1980s, Kal-L is also shown as a member of the <!--del_lnk--> All-Star Squadron during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>.<p>During the 1985 <!--del_lnk--> limited series <i><!--del_lnk--> Crisis on Infinite Earths</i>, the various parallel Earths are combined into one, retroactively eliminating some of <!--del_lnk--> Earth-Two&#39;s heroes from existence. Kal-L, the <!--del_lnk--> Earth-Two Superman, his wife <!--del_lnk--> Lois Lane of Earth-Two, the <!--del_lnk--> Superboy of Earth-Prime and <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Luthor, Jr. of <!--del_lnk--> Earth-Three, have no reality to call their own, and they enter a &quot;paradise dimension&quot; at the end of the series. Kal-L isn&#39;t seen again until the <!--del_lnk--> limited series <i><!--del_lnk--> The Kingdom</i>, in which it is revealed that he has found a means of exiting his dimension, but chooses not to do so yet.<p><!--del_lnk--> DC Comics retired the <!--del_lnk--> Silver Age version of Superman in 1986, after the publication of <i><!--del_lnk--> Crisis on Infinite Earths</i>. Just before the character&#39;s revamp, the <!--del_lnk--> Silver Age Superman was given a sendoff in the two-part story <i><!--del_lnk--> Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?</i> published in <i><!--del_lnk--> Superman</i> (Vol. 1) #423 and <i><!--del_lnk--> Action Comics</i> #583, written by <!--del_lnk--> Alan Moore with art by <!--del_lnk--> Curt Swan. Although the new <!--del_lnk--> Modern Age version of Superman is said to have already been active for many years, most previous Superman appearances and elements were rendered out of continuity by <!--del_lnk--> John Byrne&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Man of Steel</i>. Later stories such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Superman: Birthright</i> bring many of the <!--del_lnk--> Silver Age elements back into continuity.<p><a id="Modern_Age" name="Modern_Age"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Modern Age</span></h3>
      <p><a id="Man_of_Steel" name="Man_of_Steel"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Man of Steel</i></span></h4>
      <p>In 1986, after the <i><!--del_lnk--> Crisis on Infinite Earths</i> <!--del_lnk--> limited series, <!--del_lnk--> DC Comics hired writer/artist <!--del_lnk--> John Byrne to re-create the Superman character, reshaping the previous 48 years of stories by putting new twists on the established mythos.<p>In Byrne&#39;s re-introductory six issue limited series, Superman, like all post-<!--del_lnk--> Crisis <!--del_lnk--> Kryptonians, is conceived through <!--del_lnk--> in-vitro fertilization on <!--del_lnk--> Krypton. While still a <!--del_lnk--> fetus, he escapes <!--del_lnk--> Krypton&#39;s destruction in a spacecraft (his &quot;birthing matrix&quot; with a warp engine attached to it), and lands more than 50 years later on <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a>, just outside of <!--del_lnk--> Smallville, <!--del_lnk--> Kansas. Superman is effectively born on <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a> and is as much a son of <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a> as of <!--del_lnk--> Krypton. As in the original version, the Kents find and adopt him and raise him like a normal human being.<p>In Byrne&#39;s retelling, Clark&#39;s powers develop gradually, beginning with his invulnerability, and he doesn&#39;t fly until he is a teenager. After leaving <!--del_lnk--> Smallville, he travels the world before settling in <!--del_lnk--> Metropolis, completing his education, and going to work at the <i><!--del_lnk--> Daily Planet</i>. Although he spends years helping people and averting disasters in secret during his travels, Clark does not become Superman until just before starting work at the <i><!--del_lnk--> Daily Planet</i> when he prevents an experimental spacecraft from crashing in <!--del_lnk--> Metropolis. The Kents remain alive and continue to be important supporting characters in the franchise to this day. In this version, the Superman costume is designed by the Kents and made by Clark&#39;s adoptive mother.<p>The post-<!--del_lnk--> Crisis comics present Clark Kent as the &quot;real&quot; person, with Superman as the secret identity that he uses to prevent his enemies from harming family and friends. People do not suspect that Superman is hiding his real identity because he wears no mask. The concept that Clark is the real man, as well as greater emphasis on his earthly upbringing, is a deliberate reversal of the pre-<!--del_lnk--> Crisis version.<p>Another significant aspect of Superman&#39;s reinvention is a reduced level of abilities, with powers such as time travel removed completely and other powers &mdash; notably his invulnerability and super-strength &mdash; vastly reduced. The series also introduces the idea that Superman&#39;s invulnerability stems from his body&#39;s creating an &quot;energy field&quot; when exposed to solar radiation from <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a>&#39;s yellow <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">sun</a>.<p><i><!--del_lnk--> Man of Steel</i> #3 depicts the first meeting between Superman and <a href="../../wp/b/Batman.htm" title="Batman">Batman</a>. Superman attempts to take <a href="../../wp/b/Batman.htm" title="Batman">Batman</a> into custody but realizes that <a href="../../wp/b/Batman.htm" title="Batman">Batman</a> must operate outside the law. Other post-<!--del_lnk--> Crisis comics show that the relationship between the two is a trusting one, despite the unease each feels due to the differences in their methods: Superman relies on trust and strength to achieve his goals in cooperation with the law, while <a href="../../wp/b/Batman.htm" title="Batman">Batman</a> operates outside the law, relying on fear and his intellect.<p><i><!--del_lnk--> Man of Steel</i> also reduces the emphasis on Superman&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Kryptonian heritage. Previous comic books depicted a Superman not only aware of his heritage but also as versed in its language, culture, and other elements. In <i><!--del_lnk--> Man of Steel</i> #6, Superman first learns of his <!--del_lnk--> Kryptonian heritage as an adult when his birthing matrix generates a memory implant. While such <!--del_lnk--> Kryptonian technology is able to help bolster his knowledge, the revamped Superman is no longer a completely <!--del_lnk--> Kryptonian-educated man.<p><a id="Death" name="Death"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Death</span></h4>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1992, <!--del_lnk--> DC Comics published the storyline <i><!--del_lnk--> The Death of Superman</i>, in which Superman battles a monster of then-unknown origins called <!--del_lnk--> Doomsday. Both Superman and <!--del_lnk--> Doomsday are killed, taking each other down with their final blows. <i>Funeral for a Friend</i> follows <i>The Death of Superman</i>, chronicling Superman&#39;s funeral and examines other characters&#39; reactions to the death of the hero.<p>Next, <!--del_lnk--> DC published the <i><!--del_lnk--> Reign of the Supermen</i> storyline, during which four different characters &mdash; a new <!--del_lnk--> Superboy, the cyborg <!--del_lnk--> Man of Tomorrow, the brutal <!--del_lnk--> Last Son of Krypton and <!--del_lnk--> Steel &mdash; are introduced as Superman, although none of them actually are. A de-powered Kal-El later surfaces in a <!--del_lnk--> Kryptonian battle-suit near the end of <i><!--del_lnk--> Reign of the Supermen</i>. After Steel and <!--del_lnk--> Linda Danvers destroy the battle-suit, Kal-El is revealed as the pilot, wearing a black costume with a silver &#39;S&#39; shield and long hair. The cyborg allies with <!--del_lnk--> Mongul and destroys <!--del_lnk--> Coast City. Superman, <!--del_lnk--> Superboy, <!--del_lnk--> Supergirl, <!--del_lnk--> Steel, <!--del_lnk--> Hal Jordan and the <!--del_lnk--> Eradicator attack the &quot;Engine City&quot; built on top of <!--del_lnk--> Coast City, and the united Supermen defeat the Man of Tomorrow, who is exposed as scientist Hank Henshaw.<p>As in the original continuity, <!--del_lnk--> Lois Lane is Clark Kent/Superman&#39;s love interest, but this was the first time they were presented as a couple in any medium. After the <i><!--del_lnk--> Reign of the Supermen</i> storyline, Lois and Clark are reunited. The television series <i><!--del_lnk--> Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman</i> took its cues from this incarnation of Superman. When they eventually marry in the mid-1990s special <i>Superman: The Wedding Album</i>, it coincided with the marriage of the two characters in the television show.<p><a id="Birthright" name="Birthright"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Birthright</i></span></h4>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 2004, <!--del_lnk--> DC published an updated version of Superman&#39;s origin in the 12-issue <!--del_lnk--> limited series <i><!--del_lnk--> Birthright</i>. Written by <!--del_lnk--> Mark Waid, <i><!--del_lnk--> Birthright</i> restores some of the pre-<!--del_lnk--> Crisis elements eliminated by <!--del_lnk--> John Byrne, including an emphasis on alien heritage.<p>The series was planned as an origin story meant to reconcile material published between <i><!--del_lnk--> Man of Steel</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Birthright</i>. It introduces elements from Superman adaptations such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Superman: The Animated Series</i> and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Smallville</i> television series and brings several <!--del_lnk--> Silver Age and some <!--del_lnk--> Golden Age concepts back into continuity. Unlike the previous <i><!--del_lnk--> Man of Steel</i> origin, <i><!--del_lnk--> Birthright</i> doesn&#39;t eliminate most of the previous <i>Superman</i> stories told, even making references to <i><!--del_lnk--> Man of Steel</i> itself.<p>In <i><!--del_lnk--> Birthright</i>, the &quot;birthing matrix&quot; is replaced by the more well-known rocketship, with Kal-El leaving <!--del_lnk--> Krypton as an infant rather than a <!--del_lnk--> fetus. Clark now possesses the ability to see a living being&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> aura&quot;, Superman&#39;s identity has more facets than just Clark vs. Superman, instead his identities represent different aspects of his personality. &quot;Smallville Clark&quot; is the &quot;true&quot; <!--del_lnk--> Clark Kent, the one most comfortable with who he is and who he is with his parents. &quot;Metropolis Clark&quot; is quiet, fairly isolated, and shy, blending into the background and not drawing attention to himself. He often finds himself being the odd man out. Superman is also quiet, but rather than being seemingly harmless like Clark, he is a formidable force, tearing robot assault helicopters from the sky and dropping a drug lord&#39;s private yacht into his pool.<br clear="all" />
      <p><a id="Infinite_Crisis" name="Infinite_Crisis"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Infinite Crisis</i></span></h4>
      <p>In the 2005-2006 <i><!--del_lnk--> Infinite Crisis</i> <!--del_lnk--> limited series (the sequel to the 1985-&#39;86 <!--del_lnk--> limited series <i><!--del_lnk--> Crisis on Infinite Earths</i>), the <!--del_lnk--> Earth-Two Superman (Kal-L) escapes from the &quot;paradise&quot; dimension with <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Luthor, Jr. and <!--del_lnk--> Superboy-Prime . Kal-L wants to recreate the universe, which he believes is corrupt, making aspects of <!--del_lnk--> Earth-Two predominant, rather than those of <!--del_lnk--> Earth-One. He believes this will also save the dying <!--del_lnk--> Lois Lane of Earth-2. Alexander Luthor builds a machine which re-creates Earth-2, transporting Kal-L and Lois there where Lois revives briefly before collapsing and dying. In grief, Kal-L lashes out at the <!--del_lnk--> Earth-One Superman, and the two fight until <!--del_lnk--> Wonder Woman arrives and ends their battle.<p>The two Supermen team up to confront Luthor and <!--del_lnk--> Superboy-Prime, whose plan to restore the <!--del_lnk--> Multiverse will kill billions of people. The pair willingly deplete their powers as they drag <!--del_lnk--> Superboy-Prime into <!--del_lnk--> Rao, <!--del_lnk--> Krypton&#39;s red sun, and use the last of their strength to defeat him on <!--del_lnk--> Mogo, the sentient <!--del_lnk--> Green Lantern planet. Fatally wounded in the battle, Kal-L dies in his cousin <!--del_lnk--> Power Girl&#39;s arms. He and Lois are buried next to the deceased <!--del_lnk--> Superboy.<p><i>Infinite Crisis Secret Files &amp; Origins 2006</i> shows that <!--del_lnk--> Superboy-Prime is to blame for many continuity errors in the <!--del_lnk--> DC Universe. In his attempt to escape reality, his assault on the barrier wall of the paradise dimension alters history, causing <!--del_lnk--> revisions of events to occur, including the <i><!--del_lnk--> Birthright</i> origin. <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Luthor, Jr.&#39;s attempts to manipulate the <!--del_lnk--> Multiverse result in <!--del_lnk--> New Earth, affecting Superman&#39;s history further. Alexander indicates that Superman&#39;s early years are once more similar to the <!--del_lnk--> Silver Age and <i><!--del_lnk--> Birthright</i> origins.<p>During the publication of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Infinite Crisis</i> <!--del_lnk--> limited series, the majority of <!--del_lnk--> DC Comics&#39; superhero line advanced one year. <!--del_lnk--> One year later, Superman remains powerless, and <!--del_lnk--> Supergirl defends <!--del_lnk--> Metropolis. Unburdened by his responsibility to the world, <!--del_lnk--> Clark Kent has re-solidified his reputation as a star reporter. <!--del_lnk--> Lex Luthor&#39;s reputation is damaged irreparably, partially due to Clark&#39;s writing, and his fortune and power dwindle. Under attack, Clark&#39;s powers gradually return, and he returns to action. He finds that his sensory powers are enhanced, as are his computational abilities and memory.<p><a id="Clark_Kent" name="Clark_Kent"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Clark Kent</span></h2>

      <p>Clark Kent is the secret identity of Superman. Kent, as opposed to Superman, is traditionally presented as behaving in a more introverted or mild manner compared to his superheroic self. <!--del_lnk--> John Byrne&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Man of Steel</i> revamp drops many traditional aspects of Clark Kent in favour of giving him a more aggressive and extroverted personality, including making Kent a top <a href="../../wp/a/American_football.htm" title="American football">football</a> player in high school and a successful author. Subsequent revamps have restored the more mild-mannered Clark Kent that is traditionally associated with the character.<p>Clark is a reporter at the <!--del_lnk--> Metropolis newspaper the <i><!--del_lnk--> Daily Planet</i>, which allows him to keep track of events in which he might be able to help. Fellow reporter <!--del_lnk--> Lois Lane is often the object of Clark&#39;s affection; Lois&#39;s affection for Superman and rejection of Clark are a recurring theme in Superman comics, television, and movies. Unlike <a href="../../wp/b/Batman.htm" title="Batman">Batman</a>, Superman considers himself Clark Kent first and Superman second. In an episode of <i><!--del_lnk--> Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman</i>, Clark says, &quot;<i>Superman</i> is what I can do. <i>Clark</i> is who I am.&quot; <p>Clark keeps his Superman identity a secret to protect his loved ones. Various methods for keeping his Superman&#39;s identity secret over the years include his using &quot;super-hypnosis&quot;, subliminally causing people to not make the connection, compressing his spine as Clark Kent to become shorter, and studying the <!--del_lnk--> Meisner acting technique to switch seamlessly between personas. Furthermore, since Superman goes into public unmasked, most people assume that he has no other identity. As long as he does not let on that he has another life, there is no real reason to look for a secret identity. Even <a href="../../wp/b/Batman.htm" title="Batman">Batman</a> commended him on this disguise.<p>Modern comic book stories show that to the average observer, Superman is the greatest hero in the world and a larger-than-life figure. When first confronted by evidence that Clark Kent is Superman, <!--del_lnk--> Lex Luthor dismisses it, saying, &quot;No one with the power of Superman would be living as a normal man.&quot;<p><a id="Personality_and_character" name="Personality_and_character"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Personality and character</span></h2>
      <p>In the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Age stories, Superman&#39;s personality is rough and destructive. Although nowhere near as cold-blooded as the early <a href="../../wp/b/Batman.htm" title="Batman">Batman</a>, the Superman featured in the comics of the 1930s and 1940s is not squeamish about tossing evildoers around in such a manner that fatalities would logically be almost inevitable (although seldom or never shown on the page). His actions were more socially conscious, such as declaring war on reckless drivers, fighting against the mistreatment of prisoners or tearing down insufficient housing so that the government would be forced to build new homes. By the end of 1940, however, editor <!--del_lnk--> Whitney Ellsworth instituted a code of conduct for his characters to follow, and the writers moved toward Superman&#39;s better known &quot;<a href="../../wp/s/Scouting.htm" title="Scouting">Boy Scout</a>&quot; persona.<p>His adoptive human parents, the Kents, imbue young Clark Kent with a strong sense of purpose, <!--del_lnk--> morality and <!--del_lnk--> compassion. Superman was raised to believe that his abilities are gifts not to be abused. In many ways, he is the perfect hero as he embodies all the best traits that people would believe to see in themselves. Unlike the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Age Superman, this Superman dislikes killing, and vows to &quot;never take a life&quot;, and to retire if he ever does. All the same, when <!--del_lnk--> General Zod taunts Superman in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Phantom Zone</i> miniseries for his resolve, Superman responds &quot;My code doesn&#39;t say a damned thing about not battering you to within an inch of yours!&quot;<p>Recent writers have attempted to deepen Superman&#39;s persona and provide a rationale for his goodness. Superman is often depicted with a mix of <!--del_lnk--> idealism, <!--del_lnk--> restraint, <!--del_lnk--> fairness and <!--del_lnk--> compassion. The <i><!--del_lnk--> Birthright</i> <!--del_lnk--> limited series attributes Superman&#39;s compassion for living things to his ability to see their &quot;<!--del_lnk--> auras&quot;. He also struggles with the differences between what is right and what is practical.<p>In <i><!--del_lnk--> Superman/Batman</i> #3, <a href="../../wp/b/Batman.htm" title="Batman">Batman</a> thinks, &quot;It is a remarkable dichotomy. In many ways, Clark is the most human of us all. Then...he shoots fire from the skies, and it is difficult not to think of him as a god. And how fortunate we all are that it does not occur to <b>him</b>.&quot; In the modern age of comics, the relationship between Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent has at times been strained by their differing ideologies, which results from their different backgrounds and upbringing. However, they have come to recognize each other as not only the most trusted of allies, but great friends, with Batman being the one person Superman trusted with Lex Luthor&#39;s kryptonite ring in order for someone to be able to stop Superman should he ever go rogue. Although a heavy burden to bear, Batman has proven worthy of doing so.<p><a id="Powers_and_abilities" name="Powers_and_abilities"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Powers and abilities</span></h2>

      <p>Superman possesses extraordinary powers, traditionally described as, &quot;faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, and able to leap tall buildings in a single bound&quot;, a phrase first used in the <i>Superman</i> radio serials and Max Fleischer animated shorts of the 1940s as well as the TV series of the <!--del_lnk--> 1950s. Although contemporary media still reference Superman that way, the character&#39;s powers are much more vast and complex. For most of his existence, Superman&#39;s famous arsenal of powers include <!--del_lnk--> flight, <!--del_lnk--> super-strength, invulnerability, super-speed, vision powers (including <!--del_lnk--> x-ray, <!--del_lnk--> heat, telescopic, infra-red, and microscopic vision), super-<!--del_lnk--> photographic memory, super-hearing and super-breath, which enables him to freeze objects by blowing on them, as well as exert the propulsive force of high-speed winds.<p>As originally conceived and presented in his early stories, Superman&#39;s powers were relatively limited, consisting of superhuman strength that allowed him to lift a car over his head, run at amazing speeds and leap one-eighth of a mile, as well as incredibly tough skin that could be pierced by nothing less than an exploding artillery shell. Writers gradually increased his powers to larger extents during the <!--del_lnk--> Silver Age, in which Superman could fly to other worlds and galaxies and even across universes with relative ease. He would often fly across the solar system to stop meteors from hitting earth in advance or sometimes just to get his mind off things. Writers found it increasingly difficult to write Superman stories in which the character was believably challenged, so <!--del_lnk--> DC Comics made a series of attempts to rein the character in. The most significant attempt, <!--del_lnk--> John Byrne&#39;s 1986 rewrite, established several hard limits on his abilities: He barely survives a nuclear blast, and his space flights are limited by how long he can hold his breath. Superman&#39;s power levels have again increased since then, with Superman currently possessing enough strength to hurl a mountain and withstand nuclear blasts with ease.<p>Unlike humans, Superman cannot give blood as his skin is impenetrable. He cannot donate organs due to his alien physiology. It is uncertain whether Superman can go without food or drink or for how long; some writers have portrayed him as obtaining all the energy he needs from <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a>&#39;s yellow <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">sun</a>, much like <a href="../../wp/p/Photosynthesis.htm" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>.<p>The source of Superman&#39;s powers changes subtly over the course of his history. It is originally said that Superman&#39;s abilities derive from his <!--del_lnk--> Kryptonian heritage, making him eons more evolved than <a href="../../wp/h/Human.htm" title="Humans">humans</a>. Soon it is established that <!--del_lnk--> Krypton&#39;s <a href="../../wp/g/Gravitation.htm" title="Gravity">gravity</a> had been stronger than <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a>&#39;s, a situation similar to that of <!--del_lnk--> Edgar Rice Burroughs&#39; <!--del_lnk--> John Carter. As Superman becomes increasingly godlike, the implication that all <!--del_lnk--> Kryptonians had possessed the same abilities became problematic for writers, making it doubtful that a race of such beings could have been wiped out by something as trifling as an exploding planet. In part to counter this, the Superman writers established that <!--del_lnk--> Kryptonians, whose native star had been red, only possessed superpowers under the light of a yellow <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">sun</a>. More recent stories have attempted to find a balance between the two explanations.<p>Superman is most vulnerable to <!--del_lnk--> Kryptonite, mineral debris from <!--del_lnk--> Krypton transformed into radioactive material by the forces that destroyed the planet. Exposure to <!--del_lnk--> Kryptonite radiation nullifies Superman&#39;s powers and immobilizes him with pain; prolonged exposure will eventually kill him. The only mineral on Earth that can protect him from Kryptonite is lead, which blocks the radiation. <!--del_lnk--> Kryptonite was first introduced to the public in <!--del_lnk--> 1943 as a <!--del_lnk--> plot device to allow the radio serial <!--del_lnk--> voice actor, <!--del_lnk--> Bud Collyer, to take some time off; for several shows, Superman was represented by groaning noises while he was trapped by a chunk of <!--del_lnk--> Kryptonite. Green <!--del_lnk--> Kryptonite is the most commonly seen form but writers introduced other forms over the years, such as red, gold, blue and black, each with its own effect. Red, for example, could split Superman into two people, creating <!--del_lnk--> Superman Red and Superman Blue. But, a lead suit will prevent him from being affected at all, and he becomes invincible.<p>Superman is also vulnerable to <!--del_lnk--> magic; however, this is not used in his stories as commonly as <!--del_lnk--> Kryptonite, and the vulnerability has been at best hazily defined. The most common implication is that, like any other person, Superman has no special protection against it via his powers.<p>Superman&#39;s abilities have occasionally been removed or altered for dramatic reasons. In the <i>Superman</i> comics of the late <!--del_lnk--> 1990s, Superman loses his traditional powers and transforms into a being of <!--del_lnk--> electromagnetic energy. In this form, Superman can phase through solid objects, see frequencies of energy, and draw power from electrical sources. In order to maintain physical cohesion in this form, he needs to wear a containment suit. During this time, he is able to transform into the corporeal form of <!--del_lnk--> Clark Kent but has no special powers in his human guise.<p>Superman&#39;s powers also dwindle (or usually, disappear) under the light of a red sun. In some canonical accounts, Superman&#39;s powers are proportionally reduced under an orange sun (midway in the spectrum between yellow and red), and actually increase under a white or blue sun (beyond yellow on the spectrum).<p>Recently, some authors have implied that Superman&#39;s powers can reach nearly unlimited levels, based on <!--del_lnk--> solar energy absorption and withdrawal of mental blocks. In <i><!--del_lnk--> Our Worlds at War</i>, Superman dives into the <i>sun</i> to gain sufficient energy to overpower <!--del_lnk--> Brainiac 13, who was imbued with the <!--del_lnk--> Imperiex Force. In <i><!--del_lnk--> Superman/Batman</i>, when <!--del_lnk--> Kara Zor-El claims to be more powerful than Superman, he tells her that he put personal mental blocks on his powers as he grew up to keep from losing control and causing irreparable damage, blocks that Supergirl does not have. While Supergirl can appear to be stronger, Superman just has greater self-control.<p>In an interview with <!--del_lnk--> Joe Casey on Alvaro&#39;s ComicBoards, he states that Superman can re-arrange the <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_System.htm" title="Solar System">Solar System</a> and tear a star apart. &quot;I&#39;ve always seen Superman as this completely over-the-top, fantastic character who has no limits whatsoever,&quot; writes Casey. Unencumbered by mental blocks, &quot;Superman is unbeatable.&quot;<p>It is implied in the <i><!--del_lnk--> One Year Later</i> <i>Superman</i> story that Superman exerts an element of subconscious control over his powers; to be Superman truly, it appears that <!--del_lnk--> Clark Kent must, on some level, want to be Superman. This is evidenced by the one-year period following the <i><!--del_lnk--> Infinite Crisis</i> during which he lives happily as the powerless <!--del_lnk--> Clark Kent, with no desire to return to his former lifestyle. This lasts until <!--del_lnk--> Intergang operatives attack him and his powers return as his life is imperiled. After this, his other skills return (including <!--del_lnk--> flight and super-speed).<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Awards</span></h2>
      <p>Superman, both the character and his various comic series, have received various awards over the years. <i><!--del_lnk--> The Reign of the Supermen</i> storyline received the <i><!--del_lnk--> Comics Buyer&#39;s Guide</i> Fan Award for Favorite Comic Book Story in 1993.<p><a id="Cultural_influences" name="Cultural_influences"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Cultural influences</span></h2>

      <p>Some people incorrectly believe that Superman is partly based on <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">German</a> philosopher <a href="../../wp/f/Friedrich_Nietzsche.htm" title="Friedrich Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> &Uuml;bermensch, which literally translates to &quot;overman&quot;, but could also mean &quot;superman.&quot; However, it is important to realize that in many ways Superman and the &Uuml;bermensch are polar opposites. Nietzsche envisioned the &Uuml;bermensch as a man who had transcended the limitations of society, religion, and conventional morality while still being fundamentally human. Superman, although an alien gifted with incredible powers, chooses to limit himself to conventional human moral codes and social mores. Nietzsche envisioned the perfect man as being beyond moral codes; Siegel and Shuster envisioned the perfect man as holding himself to a higher standard of adherence to them.<p>Because Siegel and Shuster were both <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jewish">Jewish</a>, it is thought that their creation was partly influenced by the nativity tale of <!--del_lnk--> Moses, and also by the <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> legends of the <!--del_lnk--> Golem, a mythical being created to protect and serve the persecuted <a href="../../wp/j/Judaism.htm" title="Judaism">Jews</a> of <a href="../../wp/1/16th_century.htm" title="16th century">16th century</a> <a href="../../wp/p/Prague.htm" title="Prague">Prague</a> and later revived in popular culture in reference to their suffering at the hands of the <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazis">Nazis</a> in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> during the 1930s and 1940s. (Superman&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Kryptonian name, &quot;Kal-El,&quot; resembles the <a href="../../wp/h/Hebrew_language.htm" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> words &#x5E7;&#x5DC;-&#x5D0;&#x5DC;, which means &quot;voice of God&quot;.)<p>Another influence could be <!--del_lnk--> Hugo Danner, the main character of the novel <i><!--del_lnk--> Gladiator</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Philip Wylie. Danner has the same powers of the early Superman (as do many other pulp characters of the twenties and thirties).<p><!--del_lnk--> Doc Savage may be another influence; from sharing the first name of &quot;Clark&quot; to both having an arctic <!--del_lnk--> Fortress of Solitude and the similarity between the &quot;Man of Bronze&quot; and &quot;Man of Steel&quot; monikers. The <!--del_lnk--> Fortress of Solitude, however, was a very late addition to the Superman mythology, and both the &quot;Man of Steel&quot; and &quot;Man of Bronze&quot; nicknames were probably influenced by <!--del_lnk--> Howard Pyle&#39;s novel <i><!--del_lnk--> Men of Iron</i>. However, the sources cited by <!--del_lnk--> Jerry Siegel himself were <!--del_lnk--> Edgar Rice Burroughs&#39; <i><!--del_lnk--> John Carter of Mars</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Tarzan</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Johnston McCulley&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Zorro</i>, and <!--del_lnk--> E.C. Seegar&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Popeye</i>. Superman also appears to have been influenced by <!--del_lnk--> Jack Williamson&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> The Girl From Mars</i>.<p>One sometimes overlooked early influence on early Superman stories is the context of the <!--del_lnk--> Great Depression. The left-leaning perspective of creators Shuster and Siegel is reflected in early storylines. Superman sometimes took on the role of social activist, fighting crooked businessmen and politicians and demolishing run-down tenements, for example.<sup>[<i><!--del_lnk--> citations needed</i>]</sup> In the earlier storylines Shuster and Siegal often had Superman champion a variety of social causes. In later Superman radio programs Superman continued to take on a social issues like prejudice. For example, Superman took on a version of the KKK in a 1946 broadcast of <!--del_lnk--> The Adventures of Superman (radio).<p><a id="Characters" name="Characters"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Characters</span></h2>
