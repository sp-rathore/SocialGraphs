      <p>The term <b>Severn crossing</b> is used specifically to refer to two <!--del_lnk--> motorway crossings over the <!--del_lnk--> estuary of the <a href="../../wp/r/River_Severn.htm" title="River Severn">River Severn</a> between <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> and <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a>, despite there being many other bridges upstream. The two crossings are:<ul>
       <li>The original <b><!--del_lnk--> Severn Bridge</b> (<!--del_lnk--> Welsh: <i>Pont Hafren</i>)<li>The <b><!--del_lnk--> Second Severn Crossing</b> (Welsh: <i>Ail Groesfan Hafren</i>)</ul>
      <p>The first motorway <!--del_lnk--> suspension bridge was inaugurated on <!--del_lnk--> 8 September <!--del_lnk--> 1966, and the newer <!--del_lnk--> cable-stayed bridge, a few <!--del_lnk--> miles to the south, was inaugurated on <!--del_lnk--> 5 June <!--del_lnk--> 1996.<p>The two Severn crossings are nowadays generally regarded (at least by people in the south of England and South Wales) as the main crossing points from England into Wales. Prior to 1966 road traffic between the southern counties of Wales and the southern counties of England &ndash; including <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> &ndash; either had to travel via <!--del_lnk--> Gloucester or take the <!--del_lnk--> Aust Ferry, which ran roughly along the line of the Severn Bridge, from Old Passage near <!--del_lnk--> Aust to <!--del_lnk--> Beachley. The ferry ramps at Old Passage and <!--del_lnk--> Beachley are still visible.<p>Tolls are collected on both crossings from vehicles travelling in a westward direction only. As of September 2006, the toll for a car is <!--del_lnk--> &pound;4.90.<p>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Severn Tunnel, carrying mainline trains under the Severn, follows a very similar route to the Second Severn Crossing.<p><a id="The_Future" name="The_Future"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Future</span></h2>
      <p>The proposed <!--del_lnk--> Severn Barrage will constitute a third crossing if it is ever built. It is generally presumed that it would carry a road crossing. Until recently, a rail link over it had been ruled out because the barrage would contain a huge set of shipping locks that the rails would need to traverse. However, it has been suggested that a rail bridge could carry smaller, modern trains over the locks, so a rail link is possible.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severn_crossing&quot;</div>
