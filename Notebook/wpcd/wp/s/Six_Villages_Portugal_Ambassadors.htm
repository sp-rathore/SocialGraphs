<h2>Scolari, Maniche and Mada&iacute;l become FIFA/SOS ambassadors</h2><p><strong>13/06/2006</strong></p>
<img src="../../wp/p/Portugal_ambassadors.jpg" width="189" height="126" alt="FIFA/SOS Ambassadors Scolari, Madaíl and Maniche" class="left" /><p>SOS Children has gained the support of three more big names from the world of Portuguese football to add to its team of over 100 FIFA/SOS Ambassadors. Coach Luiz Filipe Scolari, Chelsea midfielder Maniche and Football Federation President Gilberto Mada&iacute;l have all pledged to use their influence in football to help children around the world. </p><p>Portugal's national football team is on the rise, having scored the most goals of any team in the qualifying rounds for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and their support of &ldquo;6 villages for 2006&rdquo; is a great boost to the campaign. </p><p>Dr Mada&iacute;l, Scolari and Maniche join an already impressive list, including their fellow Portuguese internationals Pauleta, Beto and Nuno Gomes.</p><p>Scolari said of his appointment, &quot;I am happy for the distinction of becoming a FIFA/SOS ambassador. It shows that football is important not only to Portugal and to the rest of the world, but also for children.&quot;</p><p>Dr Mada&iacute;l made a donation to SOS Children's Villages on behalf of the Portuguese Football Federation, and said he felt very privileged to be &quot;one of the few football executives in the world&quot; to be honoured as an FIFA/SOS Ambassador. </p><p>Scolari, Maniche and Dr Mada&iacute;l were presented with their FIFA/SOS Ambassador's certificates at a special ceremony held in the children's village in Bicesse, Portugal, where Maniche spent the afternoon signing autographs and having fun with the children. He promised them that he would be a dedicated FIFA/SOS ambassador, saying, &quot;I will be available to SOS Children's Villages in whatever way they need me, that is my goal. I will work to help these children and this worthwhile campaign in one form or another.&quot;</p><p><a href="../../wp/s/Six_Villages_News.htm">Back to SOS World Cup news</a></p>
