      <p>The <b>Kingdom of Sweden</b> (<!--del_lnk--> Swedish: <i><span class="unicode audiolink"><!--del_lnk--> Konungariket Sverige</span>&nbsp;</i>) is a <!--del_lnk--> Nordic country in <!--del_lnk--> Scandinavia. It is bordered by <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a> in the west, <a href="../../wp/f/Finland.htm" title="Finland">Finland</a> in the northeast, the <!--del_lnk--> Skagerrak Strait and the <!--del_lnk--> Kattegat Strait in the southwest, and the <a href="../../wp/b/Baltic_Sea.htm" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic Sea</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf of Bothnia in the east. It is connected to <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> in the southwest by the <!--del_lnk--> Oresund Bridge.<p>Sweden has a low <!--del_lnk--> population density except in its <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan areas, with most of the inland consisting of <a href="../../wp/f/Forest.htm" title="Forest">forests</a>. The country has large natural resources of water, timber, and iron ore. Its citizens enjoy a high standard of living in a country that is generally perceived as modern and liberal.<p>Following the end of the <!--del_lnk--> Viking Age, Sweden became part of the <!--del_lnk--> Kalmar Union together with <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a> (<a href="../../wp/f/Finland.htm" title="Finland">Finland</a> at this time was a part of the Swedish kingdom). Sweden left the union in the beginning of the 16th century, and more or less constantly battled its neighbours for many years, especially Russia and the still united <!--del_lnk--> Denmark-Norway, which never completely accepted Sweden leaving the union. In the 17th century Sweden extended its territory through <a href="../../wp/w/War.htm" title="Warfare">warfare</a> and became a <!--del_lnk--> Great Power, twice its current size. By 1814 Sweden had lost its empire as well as Finland, previously an integral part of the Kingdom of Sweden. Since 1814, Sweden has been at peace, adopting a <!--del_lnk--> non-aligned foreign policy in peacetime and <!--del_lnk--> neutrality in wartime.<p>Sweden has been a major European exporter of <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper">copper</a> and <!--del_lnk--> timber since the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>. However, <!--del_lnk--> improved transportation and <!--del_lnk--> communication allowed it to utilize natural assets from different parts of the country on a far larger scale, most notably <!--del_lnk--> timber and <!--del_lnk--> iron ore. Economic liberalization as well as universal schooling contributed to the rapid industrialization and by the 1890s the country had begun to develop an advanced manufacturing industry. In the 20th century a <!--del_lnk--> welfare state emerged. Sweden usually ranks among the top nations in the <!--del_lnk--> UN Human Development Index.<p>

      <p>Soon after the end of the last ice age, Sweden became populated by <!--del_lnk--> hunter-gatherers and then farmers during the <a href="../../wp/s/Stone_Age.htm" title="Stone Age">Stone Age</a> (10 000 BC &ndash; 1700 BC). This was followed by the <a href="../../wp/b/Bronze_Age.htm" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a> (1700 - 500 BC) and <a href="../../wp/i/Iron_Age.htm" title="Iron Age">Iron Age</a> (500 BC - AD 1050). Societies in Sweden remained on the preliterate tribal and <!--del_lnk--> chiefdom levels to the 1st millennium AD.<p>Sweden was first mentioned in the 1st century, by Roman historian <!--del_lnk--> Tacitus, who wrote that the <!--del_lnk--> Suiones tribe lived out in the sea and were powerful in both arms and ships. This referred to the inhabitants of eastern Sweden: <!--del_lnk--> Svealand, primarily around lake <!--del_lnk--> M&auml;laren. From this tribe, Sweden derived its name (see <!--del_lnk--> Etymology of Sweden). The southern parts, on the other hand, were inhabited by the <!--del_lnk--> Geats in the <!--del_lnk--> G&ouml;taland territory, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Beowulf</i> speaks of semi-legendary <!--del_lnk--> Swedish-Geatish wars in the <a href="../../wp/6/6th_century.htm" title="6th century">6th century</a>. The northern part, <!--del_lnk--> Norrland, was sparsely populated by <!--del_lnk--> Sami and possibly different tribes/people related to the <!--del_lnk--> Finns.<p>During the <!--del_lnk--> Viking Age of the 9th and 10th century, <!--del_lnk--> Swedish vikings travelled east setting their mark on the <!--del_lnk--> Baltic countries and <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>, whose name probably comes from the <!--del_lnk--> Slavic name for these Vikings: <i>Rus</i>. This name is probably derived from <!--del_lnk--> Roslagen, and is also reflected in the modern Finnish and Estonian name for Sweden: <span lang="sv" xml:lang="sv"><i>Ruotsi</i></span> and <span lang="sv" xml:lang="sv"><i>Rootsi</i></span>, respectively. Their routes passed the <!--del_lnk--> rivers of Russia down south to <!--del_lnk--> Constantinople and southern Europe.<p><a id="Middle_Ages" name="Middle_Ages"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Middle Ages</span></h3>

      <p>With <!--del_lnk--> Christianization in the 11th century, the country became <!--del_lnk--> consolidated, with its centre in the agricultural regions of &Ouml;sterg&ouml;tland and V&auml;sterg&ouml;tland and later on also in the water-ways of the northern Baltic and the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf of Finland. In the 14th century Sweden, like the rest of Europe, was struck by the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Death.htm" title="Black Death">Black Death</a> (the Plague), with all its effect.<p>During the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, the expansion of Sweden into the northern wilderness of <!--del_lnk--> Laplandia and <!--del_lnk--> Norrbotten, the Scandinavian <!--del_lnk--> peninsula, and present-day <a href="../../wp/f/Finland.htm" title="Finland">Finland</a> continued. Area of present day <a href="../../wp/f/Finland.htm" title="Finland">Finland</a> was a part of <!--del_lnk--> Sweden proper from the early thirteenth century until 1809.<p>In 1389, <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a>, <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> and Sweden were united under a single <!--del_lnk--> monarch in a treaty known as the <!--del_lnk--> Kalmar Union. After several wars and disputes between these nations, King <!--del_lnk--> Gustav I of Sweden (<!--del_lnk--> House of Vasa) broke free in 1521 and established a nation state, considered the <!--del_lnk--> foundation of modern Sweden. Shortly afterwards he rejected <!--del_lnk--> Catholicism and led Sweden to the <!--del_lnk--> Protestant Reformation.

      <p>The 17th century saw <!--del_lnk--> the rise of Sweden as one of the <!--del_lnk--> Great Powers in Europe, because of successful participation, initiated by King <!--del_lnk--> Gustav II Adolph, in the <!--del_lnk--> Thirty Years&#39; War and by <!--del_lnk--> Carl X Gustav of Sweden in the <!--del_lnk--> The Deluge of <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Poland</a>. During this time Sweden was a power of some importance in northern Europe, but its overall standing was not comparable to that of Europe&#39;s leading nations. Sweden also acquired several mighty enemies and the great power status crumbled in the 18th century. <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Russia took the reins of northern Europe in the <!--del_lnk--> Great Northern War, and finally in 1809 when the autonomous <!--del_lnk--> Grand Duchy of Finland was created out of the <!--del_lnk--> eastern half of Sweden.<p>After Denmark was defeated in the <!--del_lnk--> Napoleonic wars, Norway was ceded to Sweden in the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Kiel. Norway had meanwhile declared itself independent and this led to the <!--del_lnk--> Campaign against Norway, which was fought in 1814. It ended with the <!--del_lnk--> Convention of Moss, which forced Norway into a union with Sweden that was not dissolved until 1905. But the campaign also signified the last of the <!--del_lnk--> Swedish wars and its 200 years of peace are arguably unique in the world today.<p><a id="Modern_history" name="Modern_history"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Modern history</span></h3>
      <p>The 18th and 19th centuries saw a significant population increase, which the writer <!--del_lnk--> Esaias Tegn&eacute;r in 1833 famously attributed to <i>&quot;the peace, the (<a href="../../wp/s/Smallpox.htm" title="Smallpox">smallpox</a>) <!--del_lnk--> vaccine, and the <a href="../../wp/p/Potato.htm" title="Potatoes">potatoes</a>&quot;</i> , with the population doubling between 1750 and 1850. Many looked towards America for a better life, and although not affluent, many Swedes had sufficiently high incomes to be able to afford the boat tickets necessary to make the journey across the Atlantic. It is believed that between 1850 and 1910 more than one million Swedes moved to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. In the early 20th century, more Swedes lived in <a href="../../wp/c/Chicago.htm" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> than in <a href="../../wp/g/Gothenburg.htm" title="Gothenburg">Gothenburg</a> (Sweden&#39;s second largest city). Most Swedish immigrants moved to the Midwest United States, with a large population in <a href="../../wp/m/Minnesota.htm" title="Minnesota">Minnesota</a>. Some Swedes also moved to <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>.<p>Sweden was traditionally less developed than <!--del_lnk--> Western Europe (though more affluent than much of Eastern and Southern Europe); industrialization began in earnest after 1870. During the late 19th century, Sweden was influenced by Protestant <!--del_lnk--> temperance movements, mainly of American origin. As a result of their intense propaganda, it is often claimed that alcohol consumption was unusually high in Sweden at this time. However, there is no factual ground for believing that alcohol consumption was higher than in other comparable countries.<p>Strong grassroots movements sprung up during the latter half of the 19th century (unions, temperance groups, and independent religious groups). They were all based on democratic principles and built a strong base for Sweden&#39;s migration into a modern parliamentary democracy, achieved by the time of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>. As the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> progressed during the century, people gradually began moving into <!--del_lnk--> cities to work in <!--del_lnk--> factories, and became involved in <!--del_lnk--> Socialist <a href="../../wp/t/Trade_union.htm" title="Trade union">unions</a>. A <!--del_lnk--> Socialist <a href="../../wp/r/Revolution.htm" title="Revolution">revolution</a> was avoided in 1917, following the re-introduction of <!--del_lnk--> Parliamentarism, and the country was <!--del_lnk--> democratized.<p><a id="Recent_history" name="Recent_history"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Recent history</span></h3>
      <p>By the 1930s Sweden had achieved one of Europe&#39;s highest living standards.<p><!--del_lnk--> Sweden remained neutral during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> and <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> as claimed by itself, although its neutrality during World War II has been highly debated and not accepted by most of the world. Sweden was forcibly under German influence for most of the war, as ties to the rest of the world were cut off through blockades. The Swedish government felt that it was in no position to openly disagree with Germany, but it did attempt to help the Allies in secret. Many refugees were saved partly because of Sweden&#39;s neutrality, among them many Jews. (<i>See further <!--del_lnk--> Sweden during World War II</i>).<p>Following the war, Sweden took advantage of intact industrial base, social stability and its natural resources, making it possible to expand its industry to supply the rebuilding of Europe, leading it to be one of the richest countries in the world by 1960. Sweden was part of the <a href="../../wp/m/Marshall_Plan.htm" title="Marshall Plan">Marshall Plan</a> but continued to stay non-aligned during the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>, and is still not a member of any <!--del_lnk--> military alliance. During most of the post-war era, the country was governed by the <!--del_lnk--> Swedish Social Democratic Party and established a <!--del_lnk--> welfare state, striving for a &quot;well being for all&quot;-policy.<p>Sweden joined the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> in 1995. During the Cold War, Europe&#39;s non-aligned Western countries, except Ireland, had considered membership unwise as the then European Community, although not involved in military co-operation, was strongly associated with NATO countries; following the end of the Cold War, Sweden, Austria and Finland joined. However, in a 2003 consultative referendum, Swedish citizens declined to adopt the <a href="../../wp/e/Euro.htm" title="Euro">Euro</a>. Sweden remains non-aligned militarily although it participates in some joint military excercises with NATO (and other) countries and has extensive cooperation with other European countries in the area of defence technology and defence indstry. Sweden has a long history of participating in international military operations, including most recently, Afghanistan, where Swedish troops are under NATO command, and in EU sponsored peace keeping operations in Kosovo and Bosnia.<p>Sweden&#39;s economic performance worsened beginning in the 1970s. Following a recession in the early 1990s as a result of global economic slowdown, measures were taken to liberalize the economy. Although the basis of the welfare state have been maintained a number of economic reforms have been implemented, including a reform of the pension system, privatization of state-owned companies and liberalization of markets. The economic situation has improved significantly since then with growth rates outpacing those of the Eurozone.<p>Sweden has had two political murders in recent history.

An additional group that has a strong say based on tradition is the <!--del_lnk--> indigenous <!--del_lnk--> Sami people, mostly living in <!--del_lnk--> rural <!--del_lnk--> Lapland and amounting to about 17,000 people.<p>Sweden has been transformed from a nation of <!--del_lnk--> emigration ending after <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> to a nation of <!--del_lnk--> immigration from <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> onwards.

      <p>Swedish is a <!--del_lnk--> North Germanic language, related and very similar to <!--del_lnk--> Danish and <!--del_lnk--> Norwegian, but differing in pronunciation and <!--del_lnk--> orthography. Sweden has no <!--del_lnk--> official language but Swedish holds a <!--del_lnk--> de facto status as such. The dominant language has always been Swedish and there has previously never been a political need to make it an <!--del_lnk--> official language. However, with the recognition of five <!--del_lnk--> minority languages of Sweden (<!--del_lnk--> Finnish, <!--del_lnk--> Me&auml;nkieli, <!--del_lnk--> Sami, <!--del_lnk--> Romani and <!--del_lnk--> Yiddish) on <!--del_lnk--> April 1, <!--del_lnk--> 2000, the issue of whether Swedish should be declared the official language was raised. On <!--del_lnk--> December 7, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, the parliament voted on this issue, but with a count of 147 to 145 because of voting errors by some members of parliament the proposal to make Swedish the official language failed. It was, however, strengthened as the principal language in that same proposal.<p>A majority of Swedes, especially those born after World War II, are able to understand and speak <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> thanks to trade links, the popularity of overseas travel, a strong Anglo-American influence and the tradition of <!--del_lnk--> subtitling rather than dubbing foreign television shows and films. English became a compulsory subject for <!--del_lnk--> secondary school students studying <!--del_lnk--> natural sciences as early as 1849 and has been a compulsory subject for all Swedish students since the late 1940s. Depending on the local school authorities, English is currently a compulsory subject from <!--del_lnk--> third until <!--del_lnk--> ninth grade, and all students continuing in secondary school study English for at least another year. Most students also learn one and sometimes two additional languages; the most popular being <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_language.htm" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a>.

      <p>Legislative power was (symbolically) shared between king and parliament until 1975. In 1971 the Riksdag became <!--del_lnk--> unicameral. Constitutionally, the 349-member Riksdag holds supreme authority in Sweden, and its acts are not subject to compulsory <!--del_lnk--> judicial review, although the review carried out by <i>lagr&aring;det</i> (Law Council) is typically respected. Acts of the parliament must be made inapplicable at every level if they are obviously against constitutional laws.<p>Legislation may be initiated by the <!--del_lnk--> Cabinet or by members of Parliament. Members are elected on the basis of <!--del_lnk--> proportional representation for a four-year term. The <!--del_lnk--> Constitution of Sweden can be altered by the Riksdag, which requires a <!--del_lnk--> supermajority and confirmation after the following general elections. Sweden has three other constitutional laws: the Act of Royal Succession, the Freedom of Press Act and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression.<p>Executive power was shared between the King and a noble <!--del_lnk--> Privy Council until 1680, followed by the King&#39;s <a href="../../wp/a/Autocracy.htm" title="Autocracy">autocratic rule</a> initiated by the common estates of the Parliament. As a reaction to the failed <!--del_lnk--> Great Northern War, <!--del_lnk--> Parliamentarism was introduced in 1719, followed by three different flavours of <!--del_lnk--> Constitutional Monarchy in 1772, 1789 and 1809, <!--del_lnk--> the latter granting several civil liberties. The monarch remains as the formal, but merely symbolic <!--del_lnk--> head of state with <!--del_lnk--> ceremonial duties.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Swedish Social Democratic Party has played a leading political role since 1917, after <!--del_lnk--> Reformists had confirmed their strength and the <!--del_lnk--> revolutionaries left the party. After 1932, the <!--del_lnk--> Cabinets have been dominated by the Social Democrats. Only four general elections (1976, 1979, 1991 and 2006) have given the centre-right bloc enough seats in Parliament to form a government. It is considered the reason for the Swedish post-war <!--del_lnk--> welfare state, with government expenditure of slightly more than 50% of the <!--del_lnk--> gross domestic product. In the 2006 general election the Moderate Party, allied wih the Centre Party, Liberal People&#39;s Party, and the Christian Democrats, with a common political platform, won a majority of the votes. Together they have formed a majority government under the leadership of the Moderate party&#39;s leader <!--del_lnk--> Fredrik Reinfeldt.<p>The following political parties hold seats in the Riksdag (the most recent elections were held in September 2006; the next elections will be held in <!--del_lnk--> September 2010):<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Socialdemokraterna (s, Social Democrats): 130 seats, 35.0% (2002: 39.8% of votes, 144 seats)<li><!--del_lnk--> Moderaterna (m, Moderates): 97 seats, 26.2% (2002: 15.2% of votes, 55 seats)<li><!--del_lnk--> Centerpartiet (c, Centre Party): 29 seats, 7.9% (2002: 22 seats, 6.1% of votes)<li><!--del_lnk--> Folkpartiet liberalerna (fp, Liberal Party): 28 seats, 7.5% (2002: 13.3% of votes, 48 seats)<li><!--del_lnk--> Kristdemokraterna (kd, Christian Democrats): 24 seats, 6.6% (2002: 33 seats, 9.1% of votes)<li><!--del_lnk--> V&auml;nsterpartiet (v, Left Party): 22 seats, 5.8% (2002: 28 seats, 8.3% of votes)<li><!--del_lnk--> Milj&ouml;partiet (mp, Greens): 19 seats, 5.2% (2002: 17 seats, 4.6% of votes)<li>Other parties (SD, FI, Piratpartiet, Junilistan, Sjukv&aring;rdspartiet) 5.7%</ul>
      <p>Sweden has a history of strong political involvement by ordinary people through its &quot;popular movements&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> Folkr&ouml;relser in Swedish), the most notable being <!--del_lnk--> trade unions, the <!--del_lnk--> women&#39;s movement, the <!--del_lnk--> temperance movement, and - more recently - <!--del_lnk--> sports movement. Election turnout in Sweden has always been high in international comparisons, although it has declined in recent decades, and is currently around 80% (80.11 in <!--del_lnk--> Sweden general election, 2002).<p>Some Swedish political figures that have become known worldwide include <!--del_lnk--> Raoul Wallenberg, <!--del_lnk--> Folke Bernadotte, <!--del_lnk--> Dag Hammarskj&ouml;ld former <!--del_lnk--> Secretary General of the United Nations, <!--del_lnk--> Olof Palme, former Prime Minister, <!--del_lnk--> Carl Bildt former Prime Minister and currently <!--del_lnk--> Foreign minister, <!--del_lnk--> Jan Eliasson the President of the <!--del_lnk--> General Assembly of the United Nations and <!--del_lnk--> Hans Blix former <!--del_lnk--> IAEA inspector in Iraq.<p><a id="Energy_politics" name="Energy_politics"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Energy politics</span></h3>
      <p>The <a href="../../wp/1/1973_oil_crisis.htm" title="1973 oil crisis">1973 oil crisis</a> strengthened Sweden&#39;s commitment to decrease dependence on imported fossil fuels. Since then, electricity has been generated mostly from <!--del_lnk--> hydropower and nuclear power. Among other things, the accident of <!--del_lnk--> Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station (<!--del_lnk--> USA) prompted the <!--del_lnk--> Swedish parliament to hold a <!--del_lnk--> referendum on nuclear power. The referendum led to a decision that no further nuclear power plants should be built and that a <!--del_lnk--> nuclear power phase-out should be completed by 2010. <!--del_lnk--> As of 2005, the use of <!--del_lnk--> renewables amounted to 26% of the energy supply in Sweden, most important being <!--del_lnk--> hydropower and, on a far smaller scale, <!--del_lnk--> biomass. In 2003, electricity from hydropower accounted for 53 <!--del_lnk--> TWh and 40% of the country&#39;s production of <a href="../../wp/e/Electricity.htm" title="Electricity">electricity</a> with nuclear power delivering 65 TWh (49%). At the same time, the use of <a href="../../wp/b/Biofuel.htm" title="Biofuel">biofuels</a>, <!--del_lnk--> peat etc. produced 13 TWh of electricity.<p>In March 2005, an opinion poll showed that 83% supported maintaining or increasing nuclear power. Since then however, reports about radioactive leakages at a nuclear waste store in Forsmark, Sweden, have been published. This does not seem to have changed the public support of continued use of nuclear power.<p>Sweden decided to phase out <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_fission.htm" title="Nuclear fission">nuclear fission</a> before 2020, although it is very unlikely that this will happen.<p><a id="Foreign_policy" name="Foreign_policy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Foreign policy</span></h3>
      <p>Throughout the 20th century, <!--del_lnk--> Swedish foreign policy was based on the principle of <!--del_lnk--> non-alignment in peacetime and <!--del_lnk--> neutrality in wartime.<p>Sweden has been known as one, if not the most diplomatically <!--del_lnk--> neutral state during times of war. Dating back to <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> Sweden did not favour any one side. This has been disputed by many since in effect Sweden allowed the Nazi regime to use its railroad system to transport troops and goods, especially iron ore from the rich mines in northern Sweden, something the German war machine was in desperate need of. This also carries on to <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> era politics in which Sweden was not under the <!--del_lnk--> Warsaw Pact and received only minimal aid from the <a href="../../wp/m/Marshall_Plan.htm" title="Marshall Plan">Marshall Plan</a> and remained neutral for quite some time. Sweden was also known to be the first western nation to detect unusually high <!--del_lnk--> radiation levels in the atmosphere, which later was confirmed to have been the residual nuclear fallout from the <!--del_lnk--> Chernobyl accident.<p>During the early Cold War era, Sweden combined its policy of non-alignment with a low profile in international affairs. At the same time, the country maintained relatively close informal connections with the Western bloc, especially in the realm of intelligence exchange. In 1952 a Swedish <!--del_lnk--> DC-3 was <!--del_lnk--> shot down over the Baltic sea by a Soviet Fighter. Later investigations revealed that the plane was actually gathering information for <a href="../../wp/n/NATO.htm" title="NATO">NATO</a>. Another plane, a <!--del_lnk--> Catalina <!--del_lnk--> search and rescue craft, was sent out a few days later and shot down by the Soviets as well.<p>Beginning in the late 1960s, Sweden for a period attempted to play a more significant and independent role in international relations. This involved significant activity in international peace efforts, especially through the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>, and in support to the <!--del_lnk--> Third World. Since the murder of <!--del_lnk--> Olof Palme in 1986 and the end of the Cold War, this has been significantly toned down, although Sweden is still comparatively active in peace keeping missions and maintains a generous foreign aid budget.<p>In 1981 a Soviet <!--del_lnk--> Whiskey class submarine ran aground close to the Swedish naval base at <!--del_lnk--> Karlskrona in the southern part of the country. It has never been clearly established whether the submarine ended up on the shoals through a navigational mistake or if it was a matter of <!--del_lnk--> espionage against Swedish military potential. The incident triggered a diplomatic crisis between Sweden and the Soviet Union.<p>Since 1995 Sweden has been a member of the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a>, and as a consequence of a new world security situation the country&#39;s foreign policy doctrine has been partly modified, with Sweden playing a more active role in European security co-operation as well.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>

      <p>Swedens economy is in a phase of growth (2006) and features a modern distribution system, excellent internal and external communications, and a skilled labour force. <!--del_lnk--> Timber, <!--del_lnk--> hydropower, and <!--del_lnk--> iron ore constitute the resource base of an <a href="../../wp/e/Economics.htm" title="Economics">economy</a> heavily oriented toward <!--del_lnk--> foreign trade. The country has announced its intention to end its dependency on oil by <!--del_lnk--> 2020.<p>The engineering sector accounts for 50% of output and exports. Telecommunications, the automotive industry and the pharmaceutical industries are of great importance. <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">Agriculture</a> accounts for only 2% of <!--del_lnk--> GDP and 2% of the jobs.<p>Sweden&#39;s industry is overwhelmingly in private control; unlike some other industrialized Western countries, such as Austria and Italy, publicly owned enterprises were always of minor importance. 80% of the workforce is organized through the trade-unions which have the right to elect two representatives to the board in all Swedish companies with more than 25 employees. The public and the trade-union controlled pension funds, non-profit organizations and the reserve funds of the trade-unions own more than 50% of Sweden capital.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> government&#39;s commitment to fiscal discipline resulted in a substantial budgetary surplus in 2001; however, this was cut by more than half in 2002 because of the global economic slowdown and a decline in revenue coupled with an increase in government spending. The Swedish <!--del_lnk--> Riksbank is focusing on price stability with its inflation target of 2%. Growth is expected to reach 3.3% in 2006. High taxes have however ensured a higher degree of government influence on household consumption decisions than in most other Western nations. Public sector spending amounts to 53% of the GDP; the high figure primarily reflects the large transfer payments of the Swedish welfare state.<p>Swedish unemployment figures are highly contested, with the Social-Democrats defending the official figure of 5.4% (as of 2006) and the centre-right <!--del_lnk--> Alliance for Sweden claiming a much higher figure. These numbers do not, however, include unemployed people in government programmes (about 2% of the workforce), people on extended sick-leave, those in early retirement or those outside the unemployment system. Unemployment is higher amongst younger people. Some analysts speculate that the unemployment rate for younger people can be as high as 45%. Many Swedes work abroad in <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a> and even the <!--del_lnk--> UK, where they are desired and viewed as a skilled workforce. Because of the contradiction - unemployment and a growing commercial enterprise economy, politicians and analysts often speak of the &quot;jobless growth&quot;.<p>Sweden is known for having an even distribution of income, with a <!--del_lnk--> Gini coefficient at 0.21 in 2001 (one of the most even income distributions in the industrialized world). However Sweden still bears scars from the economic crisis in the 1990s, induced by a glitch in the economic system and poor leadership. The crisis resulted in thousands of people unemployed and a great national debt. Two remains of the event are the great economic segregation in the country and the national debt of approximately 1245 billion <!--del_lnk--> Swedish Krona (approx. 133 billion &euro;, 2006.09).<p><a id="Welfare_state" name="Welfare_state"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Welfare state</span></h2>

      <p>In recent years, economic liberalization has ensured that Sweden is now more similar to other high tax European countries. However, some still claim that the <!--del_lnk--> Scandinavian model is mid-way between <a href="../../wp/s/Socialism.htm" title="Socialism">socialism</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Capitalism.htm" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a>, or the most developed form of capitalism.<p>Like many other industrialized countries, especially in Western Europe, Sweden has a large welfare state. However, it is unusually extensive in Sweden. The state provides for tax-funded childcare, parental leave, a ceiling on health care costs, tax-funded education (all levels up to, and including university), retirement pensions, tax-funded dental care up to 20 years of age and <!--del_lnk--> sick leave (partly paid by the employer). Parents are entitled to a total of 480 days partly paid leave between birth and the child&#39;s eighth birthday, with 60 days reserved specifically for each parent, in effect providing the father with two so called &quot;daddy-months&quot;. In addition, the ceiling on health care costs makes it easier, relative to other nations, for Swedish workers to take time off for medical reasons.<p>The Swedish welfare system remains extensive, but a recession in the 1990s forced an introduction of a number of reforms, such as <!--del_lnk--> education vouchers in 1992 and decentralization of some types of healthcare services to municipal control.<p>The welfare state requires high taxes. Since the late 1960s, Sweden has had the highest tax quota (as percentage of GDP) in the industrialized world, but today the difference is only a couple of percentage points of GDP above that of other high-tax countries such as France, Belgium and Denmark. Sweden has a two step <!--del_lnk--> progressive tax scale with a municipal income tax of about 30% and an additional high-income state tax of 20-25% when a salary exceeds roughly 300 000 SEK per year. The employing company pays an additional 32% of an &quot;employer&#39;s fee&quot;. In addition, a national <!--del_lnk--> VAT of 25% or 18% is added to many things bought by private citizens, with the exception of food (12% VAT), transportation, and books (6% VAT). Certain items are taxed at higher rates, e.g. petrol/diesel and alcoholic beverages.<p><a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h2>

      <p>As part of its social welfare system, Sweden provides an extensive <!--del_lnk--> childcare system that guarantees a place for all young children from 1-5 years old in a public day-care facility (<i>f&ouml;rskola</i> or <i>dagis</i>). Between ages 6-16, children attend compulsory comprehensive school, divided in three stages. After completing the ninth grade, 90% continue with a three year upper secondary school (<i>gymnasium</i>) leading sometimes to a vocational diploma and sometimes to the qualifications for further studies at a <!--del_lnk--> university or university college (<i>h&ouml;gskola</i>).<p><a id="Religion" name="Religion"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h2>

      <p>Before the 11th century, people of Sweden adhered to <!--del_lnk--> Norse paganism, worshipping <!--del_lnk--> &AElig;sir gods, with its centre at the <!--del_lnk--> Temple in Uppsala. With <!--del_lnk--> Christianization in the 11th century, the laws of the country were changed, forbidding worship of other deities.<p>After the <!--del_lnk--> Protestant Reformation in the 1530s the Church and State were united, abolishing the authority of the Roman Catholic bishops, and in the long run allowed only <!--del_lnk--> Lutheranism to prevail. This process was not completed until the <!--del_lnk--> Uppsala Synod 1593. During the era following the Reformation, usually known as the period of <!--del_lnk--> Lutheran Orthodoxy, in the 17th century, small groups of non-Lutherans, especially <!--del_lnk--> Calvinist <!--del_lnk--> Dutchmen and <!--del_lnk--> Walloons who played a significant role in trade and industry, were quietly tolerated as long as they kept a low religious profile. The <!--del_lnk--> Sami originally had their own shamanistic religion, but they were converted to Lutheranism by Swedish missionaries in the 17th and 18th centuries.<p>Not until liberalization in the late 18th century, were believers of other faiths, including <a href="../../wp/j/Judaism.htm" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Catholicism, allowed to openly live and work in Sweden, although it remained <!--del_lnk--> illegal until 1860 for Lutheran Swedes to convert to another religion. The 19th century saw the arrival of various <!--del_lnk--> evangelical <!--del_lnk--> free churches, and, towards the end of the century <!--del_lnk--> secularism began attracting attention, leading people to distance themselves from Church rituals. Leaving the <!--del_lnk--> Church of Sweden became legal with the so-called dissenter law of 1860, but only under the provision of entering another denomination. The right to stand outside any religious denomination was established in the Law on Freedom of Religion in 1951. Today about 78% of Swedes belong to the Church of Sweden, but the number is decreasing by about one per cent every year, and Church of Sweden services are sparsely attended (hovering in the single digit percentages of the population). The reason for the large number of inactive members is that until 1996, all children became members automatically at birth, if at least one of their parents were a member. Since 1996, all children that are baptised become members. Some 275,000 Swedes are today members of various free churches (where congregation attendance is much higher), and, in addition, <!--del_lnk--> immigration has meant that there are now some 92,000 <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholics and 100,000 <a href="../../wp/e/Eastern_Orthodox_Church.htm" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Eastern Orthodox Christians</a> living in Sweden. Due to <!--del_lnk--> immigration, Sweden also has a significant <!--del_lnk--> Muslim population. As many as 500,000 are Muslims by tradition and between 80,000 - 400,000 of these are practising Muslims. <i>(See also <!--del_lnk--> Islam in Sweden)</i><p>According to the most recent Eurostat &quot;Eurobarometer&quot; poll, in 2005, only 23% of Swedish citizens responded that &quot;they believe there is a god&quot;, whereas 53% answered that &quot;they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force&quot; and 23% that &quot;they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, god, or life force&quot;.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

More recently, the films of <!--del_lnk--> Lukas Moodysson and <!--del_lnk--> Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m have received international recognition.<p>Throughout the 1960s and 1970s Sweden was perceived as an international leader in what is now referred to as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> sexual revolution&quot;, with gender equality particularly promoted. In present time the rate of single-people is one of the highest in the world. Some Swedish films reflected a liberal view of sexuality, including scenes of love making that caught international attention, and introduced the concept of the &quot;Swedish sin&quot;. However, Sweden was at that time not as sexually liberal as people believed. Sweden has also become, in recent decades, fairly liberal regarding homosexuality, as is reflected in the popular acceptance of films such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Fucking &Aring;m&aring;l</i> (In English: <i>Show Me Love</i>), and the popular writer <!--del_lnk--> Jonas Gardell, among others.

There is also <!--del_lnk--> Saami music, called the <!--del_lnk--> joik, which is actually a type of chant which is part of the traditional Saami animistic spirituality but has gained recognition in the international world of folk music as well.<p>ABBA-members Benny Andersson and Bj&ouml;rn Ulvaeus have been very successful in musical theatre, with their international hit <!--del_lnk--> Mamma Mia!, as well as <!--del_lnk--> Chess, and <!--del_lnk--> Kristina fr&aring;n Duvem&aring;la, which was a huge success in Sweden and an English version is expected to hit Broadway in 2007.<h3> <span class="mw-headline">Holidays</span></h3>
