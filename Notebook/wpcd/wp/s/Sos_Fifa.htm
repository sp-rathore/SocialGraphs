<h2>FIFA and SOS Children</h2>
<img src="../../wp/f/Football_mad_boys.jpg" width="177" height="266" alt="SOS children from Mexico" class="left" /><p>Football is the world's best loved sport, and the World Cup probably the most watched event. FIFA, world football's governing body, has recognised the potential football has in doing good in the world and has establisihed firm links with SOS Children's Villages to help some of the most disadvantaged children around the world.</p><p>Initiated in 1995 by then FIFA President Jo&atilde;o Havelange, the partnership between FIFA and SOS Children's Villages has benefited thousands of children worldwide. In addition to promoting the humanitarian work of SOS Children, FIFA also supports the various sports activities of children and youths in the organisation's care.</p><p>FIFA supports SOS Children's Villages both nationally and internationally, playing an important role in encouraging further partnerships between national football associations and the 132 national associations of SOS Children's Villages around the world. Many SOS Children&rsquo;s Villages also benefit from FIFA&rsquo;s development programmes Futuro I, II and III as well as the Com-Unity programme. </p><p>Thanks to the partnership with FIFA, SOS Children has also gained the support of over 100 football stars who act as FIFA/SOS Ambassadors. The ever-growing list of Ambassadors includes some of football&rsquo;s greatest ever players and we are very grateful for their support. Find out more about our <a href="../../wp/s/Six_Villages_Ambassadors.htm">footballing Ambassadors</a>.</p><p>FIFA President, Joseph S. Blatter, described the partnership as &quot;one of the clearest signals of social responsibility in the world of football&quot;, adding that: &quot;SOS Children's Villages is a wonderful partner, and this partnership is one of the most pleasing aspects of FIFA's work.&quot; </p><p>In December 2003, FIFA and SOS Children's Villages extended their partnership and launched the joint effort &quot;6 villages for 2006 - Official Charity Campaign of the 2006 World Cup. The campaign was a huge success, raising money for the construction and maintenance of six new SOS Children&rsquo;s Villages, one each in Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa, Ukraine and Vietnam. Find out more about &ldquo;6 villages for 2006&rdquo;, our <a href="../../wp/s/Six_Villages.htm">World Cup campaign</a>.</p><h3>SOS Children and football</h3>
