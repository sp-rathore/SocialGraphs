      <p>The Bol&iacute;var aristocratic bloodline derives from la Ciudad de Caracas (also Bol&iacute;var or Bol&iacute;var, today part of the municipality of <!--del_lnk--> Ziortza-Bolibar), a small village in the <!--del_lnk--> Basque county of <!--del_lnk--> Biscay (<a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>), and is the origin of their surname. A portion of their wealth, by the 1600s, came from the <!--del_lnk--> Aroa River gold and copper mines in <a href="../../wp/v/Venezuela.htm" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>.<p>By the 1500s, vague information about existence of gold was rumored around the rivers <!--del_lnk--> Yaracuy, <!--del_lnk--> Santa Cruz, and Aroa. In 1605, more precise locations of ores became known, particularly in a small valley lateral to the Aroa River next to <!--del_lnk--> La Quebrada de Las Minas.<p>In 1632, gold was first mined, leading to further discoveries of extensive copper deposits. Towards the later 1600s, copper was exploited with the name &quot;Cobre Caracas&quot;. These mines became property of Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var&#39;s family.<p>Later in his revolutionary life, Bol&iacute;var used part of the mineral income to finance the South American revolutionary wars. Some people claim that his family grew to prominence before gaining great wealth. For example, the <!--del_lnk--> Cathedral of Caracas, founded in 1575, has a side chapel dedicated to Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var&#39;s family.<p><a id="El_Libertador_.28The_Liberator.29" name="El_Libertador_.28The_Liberator.29"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">El Libertador (The Liberator)</span></h2>
      <p>Bol&iacute;var returned to Venezuela in 1807, and, when Napoleon made <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Bonaparte <!--del_lnk--> King of Spain and its <!--del_lnk--> colonies in 1808, he participated in the <!--del_lnk--> resistance <!--del_lnk--> juntas in South America. The Caracas junta declared its independence in 1810, and Bol&iacute;var was sent to <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">Britain</a> on a diplomatic mission.<p>Bol&iacute;var returned to Venezuela in 1811. But, in July 1812, junta leader <!--del_lnk--> Francisco de Miranda surrendered to the Spanish, and Bol&iacute;var had to flee to <!--del_lnk--> Cartagena de Indias. In this period, Bol&iacute;var wrote his <i><!--del_lnk--> Manifiesto de Cartagena</i>.<p>In 1813, after acquiring a military command in <!--del_lnk--> New Granada under the direction of the Congress of <!--del_lnk--> Tunja, he led the invasion of Venezuela on <!--del_lnk--> May 14. This was the beginning of the famous <i>Campa&ntilde;a Admirable</i>, the Admirable Campaign. He entered <!--del_lnk--> M&eacute;rida on <!--del_lnk--> May 23, where he was proclaimed as <i>El Libertador</i> (the liberator from the Spanish army), following the occupation of <!--del_lnk--> Trujillo on <!--del_lnk--> June 9. Six days later, on <!--del_lnk--> June 15, he dictated his famous Decree of War to the Death (<i><!--del_lnk--> Decreto de Guerra a Muerte</i>). Caracas was retaken on <!--del_lnk--> August 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1813, and Bol&iacute;var was ratified as &quot;El Libertador&quot;, thus proclaiming the <!--del_lnk--> Venezuelan Second Republic. Due to the rebellion of <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; Tom&aacute;s Boves in 1814 and the fall of the republic, he returned to <!--del_lnk--> New Granada, where he then commanded a <a href="../../wp/c/Colombia.htm" title="Colombia">Colombian</a> <a href="../../wp/n/Nationalism.htm" title="Nationalism">nationalist</a> force and entered <a href="../../wp/b/Bogot%25C3%25A1.htm" title="Bogot&aacute;">Bogot&aacute;</a> in 1814, recapturing the city from the dissenting republican forces of <!--del_lnk--> Cundinamarca. He intended to march into <!--del_lnk--> Cartagena and enlist the aid of local forces in order to capture Royalist <!--del_lnk--> Santa Marta. However, after a number of political and military disputes with the government of Cartagena, Bol&iacute;var fled, in 1815, to <a href="../../wp/j/Jamaica.htm" title="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, where he requested the <a href="../../wp/h/Haiti.htm" title="Haiti">Haitian</a> leader <!--del_lnk--> Alexandre P&eacute;tion for aid.<p>In 1816, with Haitian help (given because he promised to free slaves), Bol&iacute;var landed in Venezuela and captured Angostura (now <!--del_lnk--> Ciudad Bol&iacute;var).<p>A victory at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Boyac&aacute; in 1819 added New Granada to the territories free from Spanish control, and in <!--del_lnk--> September 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1821 the <!--del_lnk--> Gran Colombia (a federation covering much of modern <a href="../../wp/v/Venezuela.htm" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Colombia.htm" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Panama.htm" title="Panama">Panama</a>, and <a href="../../wp/e/Ecuador.htm" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>) was created, with Bol&iacute;var as president and <!--del_lnk--> Francisco de Paula Santander as vice president.<p>Further victories at the <!--del_lnk--> Carabobo in 1821 and <!--del_lnk--> Pichincha in 1822 consolidated his rule over <a href="../../wp/v/Venezuela.htm" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Ecuador.htm" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a> respectively. After a meeting in <!--del_lnk--> Guayaquil, on <!--del_lnk--> July 26 and July 27, 1822, with <a href="../../wp/a/Argentina.htm" title="Argentina">Argentine</a> General <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; de San Mart&iacute;n, who had received the title of <i>Protector of Peruvian Freedom</i>, in August 1821, after having partially liberated Peru from the Spanish, Bol&iacute;var took over the task of fully liberating <a href="../../wp/p/Peru.htm" title="Peru">Peru</a>. The Peruvian congress named him <!--del_lnk--> dictator of Peru, on <!--del_lnk--> February 10, <!--del_lnk--> 1824, which allowed Bol&iacute;var to completely reorganize the political and military administration. Bol&iacute;var, assisted by <!--del_lnk--> Antonio Jos&eacute; de Sucre, decisively defeated the Spanish cavalry, on <!--del_lnk--> August 6, 1824, at <!--del_lnk--> Jun&iacute;n. Sucre destroyed the still numerically superior remnants of the Spanish forces at <!--del_lnk--> Ayacucho on <!--del_lnk--> December 9.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> August 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1825, at the <!--del_lnk--> Congress of Upper Peru, the <!--del_lnk--> Republic of <a href="../../wp/b/Bolivia.htm" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a> was created in order to weaken the former aristocracy of the former Viceroyalty of Peru in Lima and to honour Bol&iacute;var, who drafted a new constitution for the new nation. This constitution reflected the influence of the <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Enlightenment on Bol&iacute;var&#39;s political thought, as well as that of classical <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greek</a> and <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Roman</a> authors.<p>Bol&iacute;var had great difficulties maintaining control of the vast <!--del_lnk--> Gran Colombia. During 1826, internal divisions had sparked dissent throughout the nation and regional uprisings erupted in Venezuela, thus the fragile South American coalition appeared to be on the verge of collapse.<p>An amnesty was declared and an arrangement was reached with the Venezuelan rebels, but political dissent in New Granada grew as a consequence of this. In an attempt to keep the federation together as a single entity, Bol&iacute;var called for a constitutional convention at <!--del_lnk--> Oca&ntilde;a during April 1828.<p>He had seen his dream of eventually creating an American Revolution-style federation between all the newly independent republics, with a government ideally set-up solely to recognize and uphold individual rights, succumb to the pressures of particular interests throughout the region, which rejected that model and allegedly had little or no allegiance to liberal principles.<p>For this reason, and to prevent a break-up, Bol&iacute;var wanted to implement in <!--del_lnk--> Gran Colombia a more centralist model of government, including some or all of the elements of the Bolivian constitution he had written (which included a lifetime presidency with the ability to select a successor, though this was theoretically held in check by an intricate system of balances).<p>This move was considered controversial and was one of the reasons why the deliberations met with strong opposition. The convention almost ended up drafting a document which would have implemented a radically federalist form of government, which would have greatly reduced the powers of the central administration.<p>Unhappy with what would be the ensuing result, Bol&iacute;var&#39;s delegates left the convention. After the failure of the convention due to grave political differences, Bol&iacute;var proclaimed himself <!--del_lnk--> dictator on <!--del_lnk--> August 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1828 through the &quot;Organic Decree of Dictatorship&quot;.<p>He considered this as a temporary measure, as a means to reestablish his authority and save the republic, though it increased dissatisfaction and anger among his political opponents. An assassination attempt on September 25, 1828 failed, in part thanks to the help of his lover, <!--del_lnk--> Manuela S&aacute;enz, according to popular belief.<p>Although Bol&iacute;var emerged physically intact from the event, this nevertheless greatly affected him. Dissident feelings continued, and uprisings occurred in New Granada, Venezuela and Ecuador during the next two years.<p><a id="Death_and_Legacy" name="Death_and_Legacy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Death and Legacy</span></h2>
      <p>Bol&iacute;var finally resigned his presidency on <!--del_lnk--> April 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1830, intending to leave the country for exile in Europe, possibly in France. He had already sent several crates (containing his belongings and his writings) ahead of him to Europe.<p>He died before setting sail, after a painful battle with <a href="../../wp/t/Tuberculosis.htm" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> on <!--del_lnk--> December 17, <!--del_lnk--> 1830, in <!--del_lnk--> &quot;La Quinta de San Pedro Alejandrino&quot;, in <!--del_lnk--> Santa Marta, <a href="../../wp/c/Colombia.htm" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>.<p>His remains were moved from Santa Marta to Caracas in 1842, where a monument was set up for his burial. The &#39;Quinta&#39; near Santa Marta has been preserved as a museum with numerous references to his life.<p><a id="Political_legacy" name="Political_legacy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Political legacy</span></h3>

      <p>On his deathbed, Bol&iacute;var asked his <!--del_lnk--> aide-de-camp, General <!--del_lnk--> Daniel Florencio O&#39;Leary to burn the extensive archive of his writings, letters, and speeches. O&#39;Leary disobeyed the order and his writings survived, providing historians with a vast wealth of information about Bol&iacute;var&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> liberal philosophy and thought.<p>A great admirer of the <!--del_lnk--> American Revolution (and a great critic of the <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>), Bol&iacute;var described himself in his many letters as a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> liberal&quot; and defender of the <!--del_lnk--> free market economic system.

      <p>Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var has no direct descendants. His bloodline lives on through his sister Juana Bol&iacute;var y Palacios who married Dionisio Palacios y Blanco (Sim&oacute;n and Juana&#39;s maternal uncle) and had two children: Guillermo and Benigna.<p>Fernando Bol&iacute;var was the nephew and adoptive son of Simon Bol&iacute;var, the great hero of South America&rsquo;s wars of independence. In 1826, Fernando Bol&iacute;var preferred the University of Virginia over West Point and matriculated in 1827 against the desires of Simon Bol&iacute;var. Young Bol&iacute;var chose the University of Virginia because of his profound admiration of Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s ideas, legacy and dreams. Bol&iacute;var came to the newly opened University of Virginia to enroll in classes and began a long and still-growing link between Latin America and Jefferson&rsquo;s University. Fernando Bol&iacute;var was the second international student to attend U.Va. and the first from Latin America before leaving the University to become a distinguished South American diplomat. Fernando Bol&iacute;var stayed for a brief period at U.Va, but he always treasured his days in Charlottesville and wrote about them in his memoirs.<p>
       <br /> Guillermo died when fighting alongside his uncle in the battle of La Hogaza in 1817. Benigna Palacios y Bol&iacute;var married Pedro Amestoy. Their great-grandchildren, Pedro (94) and <!--del_lnk--> Eduardo Mendoza Goiticoa (90) live in <a href="../../wp/c/Caracas.htm" title="Caracas">Caracas</a>. They are Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var&#39;s closest living relatives. <p><a id="Honors" name="Honors"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Honours</span></h2>
