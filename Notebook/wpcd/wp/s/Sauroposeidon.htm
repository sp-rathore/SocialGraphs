      <p>The vertebrae were discovered in rural <!--del_lnk--> Oklahoma, not far from the <!--del_lnk--> Texas border, in a <!--del_lnk--> claystone outcrop that dates the fossils to about 110 <!--del_lnk--> million years ago (<!--del_lnk--> mya). This falls within the Early Cretaceous Period, specificially between the <!--del_lnk--> Aptian and <!--del_lnk--> Albian epochs.<p>The four neck vertebrae were discovered in <!--del_lnk--> 1994 at the <!--del_lnk--> Antlers Formation in <!--del_lnk--> Atoka County, Oklahoma by Dr. Richard Cifelli and a team from the <!--del_lnk--> Oklahoma Museum of Natural History.<p>While discovered in 1994, the vertebrae were stored until three years later, when Dr. Cifelli gave them to a graduate student, Matt Wedel, to analyze as part of a project. Upon their realization of the find&#39;s significance, they issued a press release in October of <!--del_lnk--> 1999, followed by official publication of their findings in the <i>Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology</i> in March of <!--del_lnk--> 2000. The new species was dubbed <i>S. proteles</i>, and the <!--del_lnk--> holotype is OMNH 53062.<p><a id="Etymology" name="Etymology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Etymology</span></h2>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> genus name comes from <i>sauros</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Greek for &quot;lizard&quot;), and <i><!--del_lnk--> Poseidon</i>, a sea-god in <a href="../../wp/g/Greek_mythology.htm" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythology</a>, who is also associated with earthquakes. The species name <i>proteles</i> also comes from the Ancient Greek and means &quot;perfect before the end&quot;, which refers to <i>Sauroposeidon&#39;s</i> status as the last and most specialized giant sauropod known in North America, during the Early Cretaceous.<p><a id="Who.27s_the_biggest.3F" name="Who.27s_the_biggest.3F"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Who&#39;s the biggest?</span></h2>
      <dl>
       <dd>&quot;It&#39;s truly astonishing. It&#39;s arguably the <!--del_lnk--> largest creature ever to walk the earth.&quot; <dl>
         <dd>&mdash; Richard Cifelli, discoverer of <i>Sauroposeidon</i></dl>
      </dl>
      <p>The press release in 1999 immediately garnered international media attention, which led to many (inaccurate) news reports of &quot;the largest dinosaur ever!&quot;. While it is true that <i>Sauroposeidon</i> is probably the tallest known dinosaur, it is neither the longest nor the most massive. <i><!--del_lnk--> Supersaurus</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Argentinosaurus</i> are better candidates for the title &quot;World&#39;s Largest Dinosaur&quot;, though weak <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil.htm" title="Fossil">fossil</a> evidence makes an exact ranking impossible.<p>The <i>Sauroposeidon</i> find was composed of four articulated, mid-cervical vertebrae (numbers 5 to 8), with the cervical <!--del_lnk--> ribs in place. The vertebrae are extremely elongated, with the largest one about 1.2 <!--del_lnk--> meters (4 <!--del_lnk--> feet) long, which makes it the longest on record. Examination of the <!--del_lnk--> bones revealed that they are honeycombed with tiny air cells, and are very thin, like the bones of a <a href="../../wp/c/Chicken.htm" title="Chicken">chicken</a> or an <a href="../../wp/o/Ostrich.htm" title="Ostrich">ostrich</a>, making the neck lighter and easier to lift.<p>Estimates of size are based on a comparison between the four <i>Sauroposeidon</i> vertebrae and the vertebrae of the HM SII specimen of <i><a href="../../wp/b/Brachiosaurus.htm" title="Brachiosaurus">Brachiosaurus</a> brancai</i>, located in the <!--del_lnk--> Humboldt Museum in <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin.htm" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>. The HM SII is the most complete brachiosaur known, though since it is composed of pieces from different individuals its proportions may not be totally accurate. Comparisons to the other brachiosaurid relatives of <i>Sauroposeidon</i> are difficult due to limited remains.<p>The neck length of <i>Sauroposeidon</i> is estimated at 11.25 to 12 meters, compared to a neck length of 9 meters (30 ft) for the HM SII <i>Brachiosaurus</i>. This is based on the assumption that the rest of the neck has the same proportions as <i>Brachiosaurus</i>, which is a reasonably good conjecture.<p><i>Sauroposeidon</i> was probably able to raise its head 18 meters (60 ft) above the ground, which is as high as a six-story building. The long neck and the high brachiosaurid shoulders are what makes it the tallest known dinosaur. In some ways, its build is similar to the modern <a href="../../wp/g/Giraffe.htm" title="Giraffe">giraffe</a>, with a short body and an extremely long neck. In comparison, the brachiosaur could probably raise its head 13.5 meters (45 ft) into the air, and the previous record holder, <i><a href="../../wp/d/Diplodocus.htm" title="Diplodocus">Diplodocus</a></i>, might have been able to raise its head 15 m.<p><i>Sauroposeidon&#39;s</i> shoulders were probably 7 meters off the ground. Its estimated length is just under 30 meters (100 ft).<p>The mass of <i>Sauroposeidon</i> is estimated at 50 to 60 <!--del_lnk--> metric tonnes (55 to 65 <!--del_lnk--> tons). While the vertebrae of <i>Sauroposeidon</i> are 25&ndash;33% longer than <i>Brachosaurus&#39;</i>s, they are only 10&ndash;15% larger in diameter. This means that while <i>Sauroposeidon</i> probably has a larger body than <i>Brachiosaurus</i> its body is smaller in comparison to the size of its neck, so it did not weigh as much as a scaled-up <i>Brachiosaurus</i>. By comparison, <i>Brachiosaurus</i> might have weighed 36 to 40 tonnes (40 to 44 tons). This estimate of the <i>Brachiosaurus</i> is an average of several different methodologies.<p>However, <i>Sauroposeidon</i> has a relatively gracile neck compared to <i>Brachiosaurus</i>. If the rest of the body turns out to be similarly slender, the mass estimate may be too high. This could be similar to the way the relatively robust <i><a href="../../wp/a/Apatosaurus.htm" title="Apatosaurus">Apatosaurus</a></i> weighs far more than the longer but much slimmer <i>Diplodocus</i>. In addition, it is possible that sauropods may have an air sac system, like those in <a href="../../wp/b/Bird.htm" title="Bird">birds</a>, which could reduce all sauropod mass estimates by 20% or more.<p><a id="Environment" name="Environment"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Environment</span></h2>

       <dd>&quot;Sauroposeidon was an unexpected discovery, because it was a huge, gas-guzzling barge of an animal in an age of subcompact sauropods.&quot; <dl>
         <dd>&mdash;Matt Wedel, <i>Sauroposeidon</i> team leader</dl>
      </dl>
      <p><i>Sauroposeidon</i> may be the last of the giant <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North American</a> sauropods. Sauropods, which include the largest terrestrial animals of all time, were a very wide ranging and successful group. They first appeared in the Early <a href="../../wp/j/Jurassic.htm" title="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> and it wasn&#39;t long before they spread across the world. By the time of the late Jurassic, North America and <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a> were dominated by the diplodocids and brachiosaurids and, by the end of the Late Cretaceous, <!--del_lnk--> titanosaurids were widespread. Between these periods, in the Early Cretaceous, the fossil record is sparse. Most of the other sauropods at the time were dying out and, as a result, few specimens have been found in North America from that time and those specimens that do exist are often fragmentary or represent juvenile members of their species. Most of the surviving sauropods at the time were also shrinking in size (to a mere 15 m, or 50 ft, in length, and maybe 10 to 15 tons or tonnes), which makes the discovery of an extremely specialized super-giant like <i>Sauroposeidon</i> very unusual.<p><i>Sauroposeidon</i> lived on the shores of the <a href="../../wp/g/Gulf_of_Mexico.htm" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, which ran through Oklahoma at that time, in a vast <!--del_lnk--> river delta, similar to the <!--del_lnk--> Mississippi delta today. There were probably no predators who could take down a full-grown <i>Sauroposeidon</i> but juveniles were likely prey to <i><!--del_lnk--> Acrocanthosaurus</i> (a <!--del_lnk--> carnosaur a little smaller than a <i><a href="../../wp/t/Tyrannosaurus.htm" title="Tyrannosaurus rex">T. rex</a></i>) and to &#39;packs&#39; of <i><a href="../../wp/d/Deinonychus.htm" title="Deinonychus">Deinonychus</a></i>.<p>A giant brachiosaurid, similar to <i>Sauroposeidon</i>, was described in 2004 by <!--del_lnk--> Darren Naish and colleagues and is from the Early <a href="../../wp/c/Cretaceous.htm" title="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> period of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>. Known only from two neck vertebrae, it was apparently similar in some details to <i>Sauroposeidon</i> and perhaps similar in size. Its discovery highlights the similarity seen between Early Cretaceous North American and European dinosaurs.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauroposeidon&quot;</div>
