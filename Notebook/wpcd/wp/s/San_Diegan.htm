      <p>The <i><b>San Diegan</b></i> was one of the <!--del_lnk--> named <a href="../../wp/t/Train.htm" title="Train">passenger trains</a> of the <!--del_lnk--> Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, and a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> workhorse&quot; of the railroad. Its 126-<!--del_lnk--> mile (203-<!--del_lnk--> kilometer) route ran from <a href="../../wp/l/Los_Angeles%252C_California.htm" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles, California</a> south to <!--del_lnk--> San Diego. It was assigned train Nos. 70&ndash;79 (Nos. 80&ndash;83 were added in 1952 when <!--del_lnk--> RDCs began operating on the line).<p>The Los Angeles-San Diego corridor (popularly known as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Surf Line&quot; &mdash; officially, the <b>Fourth District</b> of the <b>Los Angeles Division</b>) was to the Santa Fe as the <!--del_lnk--> New York&ndash;<a href="../../wp/p/Philadelphia.htm" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> corridor was to the <a href="../../wp/p/Pennsylvania_Railroad.htm" title="Pennsylvania Railroad">Pennsylvania Railroad</a>. Daily traffic could reach a density of ten trains (each way) during the summer months. The first <i>San Diegan</i> ran on <!--del_lnk--> March 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1938 as one set of equipment making two round trips each way.<p>A second <!--del_lnk--> trainset delivered in 1941 made possible four <!--del_lnk--> streamlined trains each way. In addition, a third set of <!--del_lnk--> heavyweight equipment made a fifth trip in each direction. During and after the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">Second World War</a>, furlough business from San Diego&#39;s military bases necessitated extra (albeit heavyweight) sections of <i>San Diegans</i>, and racetrack specials to <!--del_lnk--> Del Mar added to passenger train miles.<p><a href="../../wp/a/Amtrak.htm" title="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> continued to operate the <i>San Diegan</i> when it took over operation of the nation&#39;s passenger service on <!--del_lnk--> May 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1971, and it retired the name on <!--del_lnk--> June 1, <!--del_lnk--> 2001. Today the route of the <i>San Diegan</i> (the second busiest rail line in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>) is served by Amtrak&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Pacific Surfliner</i>.<p>

      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> October 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1880: The <!--del_lnk--> California Southern Railroad Company is officially organized. Initial plans are made to construct 18 <!--del_lnk--> miles (29 <!--del_lnk--> km) of main line track extending north from <!--del_lnk--> National City.<li><!--del_lnk--> January 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1882: The California Southern begins regular passenger and freight service between its National City terminus and <b><!--del_lnk--> Fallbrook Junction</b>, just north of <!--del_lnk--> Oceanside.<li><!--del_lnk--> August 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1888: Santa Fe completes the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Surf Line&quot; run between Los Angeles and San Diego under the auspices of its subsidiary, the California Southern. The line is initially referred to as the Los Angeles &mdash; San Diego &quot;Short Line&quot; as it replaces the circuitous inland route through <!--del_lnk--> Temecula Canyon.<li><!--del_lnk--> January 13, <!--del_lnk--> 1913: Locomotive No. 1275 (a <!--del_lnk--> Baldwin-built <!--del_lnk--> 4-6-2), bound for <b>La Grande Station</b> in <a href="../../wp/l/Los_Angeles%252C_California.htm" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a>, leads the <i><!--del_lnk--> Saint</i> out of San Diego and derails as it descends the <b>Sorrento Grade</b> due to excessive speed. The engineer and 21 passengers are killed, and the fireman suffers a broken leg; all of the railroad equipment is essentially destroyed in the mishap. Public pressure is brought upon the railroad to construct a tunnel through the <!--del_lnk--> Soledad Mountains in order to guard against similar accidents in the future.<li><!--del_lnk--> 1924: The Santa Fe submits plans for the <b>Soledad Tunnel</b> to the <!--del_lnk--> California Railroad Commission for approval. Owing to a post&ndash;<a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> backlog, it takes nearly a year for the Commission to review the request, which is ultimately denied due to fears that the technology did not yet exist to construct a structure that would withstand the effects of an 8.0 magnitude <a href="../../wp/e/Earthquake.htm" title="Earthquake">earthquake</a>.<li><!--del_lnk--> April 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1925: Southbound train No. 76, led by Engine No. 1332 (a Baldwin 4-6-2), leaves the tracks while ascending the Sorrento Grade at virtually the same location that the 1913 derailment took place. As in the 1913 tragedy, most of the railroad equipment is either severely damaged or destroyed outright, though in this instance the only fatal injury is suffered by the engineer; it takes several days to clear the wreckage and reopen the line to traffic.<li><!--del_lnk--> 1936: The Santa Fe orders a six-car train from <!--del_lnk--> Budd Company specifically for the initiation of <i>San Diegan</i> service.<li><!--del_lnk--> March 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1938: The <!--del_lnk--> Santa Fe inaugurates the <i>San Diegan</i> route, operating on a two hour and 45 minute schedule.</ul>

No one is killed in the accident, and it is many days before all of the wreckage can be pulled out of the sea.<li><!--del_lnk--> June 8, <!--del_lnk--> 1941: A second lightweight train consisting of six coaches, a baggage-mail car, a tavern lunch-counter car, and a round-end observation car is added to the line. Service is increased to four daily round trips utilizing streamliners and one round trip using conventional equipment.<li><!--del_lnk--> October 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1941: A fifth, steam-powered train is added to the schedule, due in part to the need to transport military personnel to and from San Diego&#39;s bases. This semi-streamlined train carries a full buffet car, a diner, and three coaches that had all previously run as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Valley Flyer</i> between <!--del_lnk--> Oakland and <!--del_lnk--> Bakersfield. The number of daily trains servicing the route increases to 16, on average.<li><!--del_lnk--> 1942: The average number of trains per day increases to 42. Consist size expands to 13 cars, and each logs 512 daily miles. Trains consisting of 10-12 former <!--del_lnk--> Southern Pacific-<!--del_lnk--> Pacific Electric non-electrified <!--del_lnk--> interurban cars, owned by the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Maritime Commission but bearing ATSF markings, are fitted with conventional knuckle <!--del_lnk--> couplers at each end of the trainset and pressed into service to handle the additional passenger loads.<li><!--del_lnk--> April 18, <!--del_lnk--> 1942: A packed, northbound <i>San Diegan</i> collides with a local, steam-powered (Atlantic 1468) freight train at the <b>Orange Junction</b>, located in the City of <!--del_lnk--> Orange. Several passengers receive minor injuries, and rail traffic must be rerouted via <!--del_lnk--> Atwood and the <b>Olive District</b> until the wreckage is cleared and the tracks repaired. Locomotives #3 and #3A are badly damaged in the incident.<li><!--del_lnk--> May 13, <!--del_lnk--> 1942: Locomotives #2L and #2A, operating as the first section of train No. 73, strike a gasoline tanker at a grade crossing in <!--del_lnk--> Hobart. Both units are damaged by fire.<li>April <!--del_lnk--> 1943: The &quot;over-the-road&quot; time is lengthened to three hours due to ever-increasing military movements.<li><!--del_lnk--> May 10, <!--del_lnk--> 1943: Santa Fe adds a second mainline track along the San Diego line between <!--del_lnk--> La Mirada and <!--del_lnk--> Fullerton to accommodate increased wartime traffic. <!--del_lnk--> Centralized Traffic Control (CTC) is installed on the line.<li><!--del_lnk--> December 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1943: Train No. 77 is struck by a tractor-trailer rig in <!--del_lnk--> Santa Ana. &quot;Chair&quot; car #3094 sustains damage in the collision.</ul>

This was the units&#39; last run on the &quot;Surf Line.&quot;&nbsp; The radio reports of this accident were one of the first major uses of the <!--del_lnk--> Sigalert (known at the time as a <!--del_lnk--> &quot;Sigmon Traffic Alert&quot;).<li>March 1956: <!--del_lnk--> General Motors&#39; <i><!--del_lnk--> Aerotrain</i> makes a series of experimental runs as a <i>San Diegan</i> consist. Thoughts of placing it in permanent service are quickly abandoned as the entire trainset has to be turned at each end of the line, and requires helper locomotives on the Sorrento Grade.<li><!--del_lnk--> April 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1956: Heavyweight local trains Nos. 70 and 75 are discontinued due to operational losses.<li>Summer 1956: Santa Fe&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> El Capitan</i> makes three demonstration runs to San Diego to promote its new &quot;Hi-Level&quot; cars. The railroad begins placing illuminated <!--del_lnk--> drumheads (formerly mounted on round-end <!--del_lnk--> observation cars) on the vestibule gate of the trailing cars of the <i>San Diegan</i>. Service on the line is reduced to six daily round trips.<li>Summer 1958: Service is further reduced to five daily round trips and weekend extra trains.<li><!--del_lnk--> September 3, <!--del_lnk--> 1958: Train No. 70 strikes a motor truck at a grade crossing in <!--del_lnk--> San Juan Capistrano; locomotive #340L sustains moderate damage.</ul>
