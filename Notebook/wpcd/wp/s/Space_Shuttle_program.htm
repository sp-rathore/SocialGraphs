      <p><!--del_lnk--> NASA&#39;s <b>Space Shuttle</b>, officially called <b>Space Transportation System</b> (<b>STS</b>), is the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> government&#39;s current <!--del_lnk--> manned <!--del_lnk--> launch vehicle. The winged Shuttle Orbiter is launched vertically, usually carrying five to seven <!--del_lnk--> astronauts (although eight have been carried) and up to 50,000&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> lb (22&nbsp;700&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> kg) of payload into <!--del_lnk--> low earth orbit. When its mission is complete, the Shuttle can independently move itself out of orbit (by means of its maneuvering thrusters) and <!--del_lnk--> re-enter the <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a>&#39;s atmosphere. During descent and landing, the Shuttle Orbiter acts as a glider and makes a completely unpowered landing.<p>The Shuttle is the only winged manned spacecraft to achieve orbit and land. Its <!--del_lnk--> missions involve carrying large payloads to various orbits (including segments to be added to the <a href="../../wp/i/International_Space_Station.htm" title="International Space Station">International Space Station</a> (ISS)), providing crew rotation for the International Space Station, and performing service missions. The orbiter can also recover <!--del_lnk--> satellites and other payloads from orbit and return them to <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a>, but its use in this capacity is rare. However, the Shuttle has previously been used to return large payloads from the ISS to Earth, as the Russian <!--del_lnk--> Soyuz spacecraft has limited capacity for return payloads. Each vehicle was designed with a projected lifespan of 100 launches, or 10 years&#39; operational life.<p>The program started in the late 1960s and has dominated NASA&#39;s manned operations since the mid-1970s. According to the <!--del_lnk--> Vision for Space Exploration, use of the Space Shuttle will be focused on completing assembly of the ISS by 2010, after which it will be replaced by the new <!--del_lnk--> Orion spacecraft.<p>

      <p>Even before the <!--del_lnk--> Apollo moon landing in 1969, in October 1968 NASA began early studies of space shuttle designs. The early studies were denoted &quot;Phase A&quot;, and in June 1970, &quot;Phase B&quot;, which were more detailed and specific.<p>In 1969 President <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_Nixon.htm" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> formed the Space Task Group, chaired by vice president <!--del_lnk--> Spiro T. Agnew. They evaluated the shuttle studies to date, and <!--del_lnk--> recommended a national space strategy including building a space shuttle.<p>In October 1969, at a Space Shuttle symposium held in Washington, George Mueller (NASA deputy administrator) presented opening remarks: <!--del_lnk-->  &quot;The goal we have set for ourselves is the reduction of the present costs of operating in space from the current figure of $1,000 a pound for a payload delivered in orbit by the Saturn V, down to a level of somewhere between $20 and $50 a pound. By so doing we can open up a whole new era of space exploration. Therefore, the challenge before this symposium and before all of us in the Air Force and NASA in the weeks and months ahead is to be sure that we can implement a system that is capable of doing just that. Let me outline three areas which, in my view, are critical to the achievement of these objectives.<dl>
       <dd>One is the development of an engine that will provide sufficient <!--del_lnk--> specific impulse, with adequate margin to propel its own weight and the desired payload.<dd>A second technical problem is the development of the reentry heat shield, so that we can reuse that heat shield time after time with minimal refurbishment and testing.<dd>The third general critical development area is a checkout and control system which provides autonomous operation by the crew without major support from the ground and which will allow low cost of maintenance and repair.</dl>
      <p>Of the three, the latter may be a greater challenge than the first two.&quot;<p>The 1972 NASA/GAO REPORT TO THE CONGRESS, Cost-Benefit Analysis Used In Support Of The Space Shuttle Program<!--del_lnk-->  states: NASA has proposed that a space shuttle be developed for U.S. Space Transportation needs for NASA, the Department of Defense (DOD), and other users in the 1980&#39;s.The primary objective of the Space Shuttle Program is to provide a new space transportation capability that will:<ul>
       <li>reduce substantially the cost of space operations and<li>provide a future capability designed to support a wide range of scientific, defense, and commercial uses.</ul>
      <p><a id="Development" name="Development"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Development</span></h2>
      <p>During early shuttle development there was great debate about the optimal shuttle design that best balanced capability, development cost and operating cost. Ultimately the current design was chosen, using a reusable winged orbiter, <!--del_lnk--> solid rocket boosters, and an expendable <!--del_lnk--> external tank.<p>The Shuttle program was formally launched on <!--del_lnk--> January 5, <!--del_lnk--> 1972, when President Nixon announced that NASA would proceed with the development of a reusable Space Shuttle system. The final design was less costly to build and less technically ambitious than earlier fully reusable designs.<p>The prime contractor for the program was <!--del_lnk--> North American Aviation (later <!--del_lnk--> Rockwell International, now <!--del_lnk--> Boeing), the same company responsible for the <!--del_lnk--> Apollo Command/Service Module. The contractor for the <!--del_lnk--> Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters was <!--del_lnk--> Morton Thiokol (now part of <!--del_lnk--> Alliant Techsystems), for the <!--del_lnk--> external tank, <!--del_lnk--> Martin Marietta (now <!--del_lnk--> Lockheed Martin), and for the <!--del_lnk--> Space shuttle main engines, <!--del_lnk--> Rocketdyne.<p>The first complete orbiter was originally named <i>Constitution</i>, but a massive write-in campaign from fans of the <i><a href="../../wp/s/Star_Trek.htm" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a></i> television series convinced the White House to change the name to <i><!--del_lnk--> Enterprise</i>. Amid great fanfare, the <i>Enterprise</i> was rolled out on <!--del_lnk--> September 17, <!--del_lnk--> 1976, and later conducted a successful series of glide-approach and landing tests that were the first real validation of the design.<p>The first fully functional Shuttle Orbiter was the <i><a href="../../wp/s/Space_Shuttle_Columbia.htm" title="Space Shuttle Columbia">Columbia</a></i>, built in <!--del_lnk--> Palmdale, California. It was delivered to <!--del_lnk--> Kennedy Space Centre on <!--del_lnk--> March 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1979, and was first launched on <!--del_lnk--> April 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1981&mdash;the 20th anniversary of <a href="../../wp/y/Yuri_Gagarin.htm" title="Yuri Gagarin">Yuri Gagarin</a>&#39;s space flight&mdash;with a crew of two. <i><a href="../../wp/s/Space_Shuttle_Challenger.htm" title="Space Shuttle Challenger">Challenger</a></i> was delivered to KSC in July 1982, <i><!--del_lnk--> Discovery</i> in November 1983, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Atlantis</i> in April 1985. <i>Challenger</i> was destroyed during ascent due to O-Ring failure on the right SRB on <!--del_lnk--> January 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1986, with the loss of all seven astronauts on board. <i><a href="../../wp/s/Space_Shuttle_Endeavour.htm" title="Space Shuttle Endeavour">Endeavour</a></i> was built to replace <i>Challenger</i> (using spare parts originally intended for the other Orbiters) and delivered in May 1991; it was first launched a year later. Seventeen years after <i>Challenger</i>, <i>Columbia</i> was lost, with all seven crew members, during reentry on <!--del_lnk--> February 1, <!--del_lnk--> 2003, and has not been replaced. Out of five functional shuttle orbiters only three remain for use.<p><a id="Shuttle_applications" name="Shuttle_applications"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Shuttle applications</span></h2>

       <li><i><a href="../../wp/s/Space_Shuttle_Challenger.htm" title="Space Shuttle Challenger">Challenger</a></i> &mdash; lost 73 seconds after liftoff, <!--del_lnk--> STS-51-L, <!--del_lnk--> January 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1986</ul>

      <p>This gives a 2% death rate per astronaut per flight, and an average failure rate of almost 1 every 60 missions. The original disaster potential, though disaster is not defined as fatal or non-fatal, was estimated during Shuttle development at one every 75 missions. 87 successful missions were flown between STS-51-L and STS-107.<p><a id="Current_status" name="Current_status"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Current status</span></h2>
      <p>Since the <a href="../../wp/s/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster.htm" title="Space Shuttle Columbia disaster">Space Shuttle <i>Columbia</i> disaster</a> in 2003, the ISS had been operating on a skeleton crew of two and is currently being serviced primarily by Russian space vehicles. While the &quot;return to flight&quot; mission <!--del_lnk--> STS-114 in 2005 was successful, a similar piece of foam from a different portion of the tank was shed. Although the debris did not strike the Orbiter, the program was grounded once again for this reason.<p>The second &quot;Return to Flight&quot; mission, <!--del_lnk--> STS-121, launched on <!--del_lnk--> July 4, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, at 2:37:55 p.m. (EDT), after two previous launches were scrubbed because of lingering thunderstorms and high winds around the launch pad and the launch took place despite objections from its chief engineer and safety head. This mission increased the ISS crew to three. A five-inch (13&nbsp;cm) crack in the foam insulation of the external tank gave cause for concern; however, the Mission Management Team gave the go for launch.  Space Shuttle Discovery touched down successfully on <!--del_lnk--> July 17, <!--del_lnk--> 2006 at 9:14:43 a.m. (EDT) on Runway 15 at the <!--del_lnk--> Kennedy Space Centre.<p>Following the success of <!--del_lnk--> STS-121, <!--del_lnk--> STS-115 launched on <!--del_lnk--> September 9, <!--del_lnk--> 2006 at 11:15 a.m. EST, following two weeks of delays.

      <p>The total cost of the Shuttle program has been $145 billion as of early 2005 , and is estimated to be $174 billion when the Shuttle retires in 2010. <!--del_lnk--> NASA&#39;s budget for 2005 allocated 30%, or $5 billion, to Space Shuttle operations;  this was decreased in 2006 to a request of $4.3 billion. <p>Per-launch costs can be measured by dividing the total cost over the life of the program (including buildings, facilities, training, salaries, etc) by the number of launches. With 115 missions (as of <!--del_lnk--> 6 August <!--del_lnk--> 2006), and a total cost of $150 billion ($145 billion as of early 2005 + $5 billion for 2005 , this gives approximately $1.3 billion per launch. Another method is to calculate the incremental (or marginal) cost differential to add or subtract one flight &mdash; just the immediate resources expended/saved/involved in that one flight. This is about $60 million <!--del_lnk--> <!--del_lnk--> .<p>Early cost estimates of $118 per pound ($260/kg) of payload were based on marginal or incremental launch costs, and based on 1972 dollars and assuming a 65,000 pound (30&nbsp;000 kg) payload capacity.<!--del_lnk-->  <!--del_lnk-->  Correcting for inflation, this equates to roughly $36 million incremental per launch costs. Compared to this, today&#39;s actual incremental per launch costs are about two thirds more, or $60 million per launch.<p><a id="Criticism" name="Criticism"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Criticism</span></h2>

      <p>The Space Shuttle program has been criticized for failing to achieve its promised cost and utility goals, as well as design, cost, management, and safety issues.<p>After both the <a href="../../wp/s/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster.htm" title="Space Shuttle Challenger disaster"><i>Challenger</i> disaster</a> and the <a href="../../wp/s/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster.htm" title="Space Shuttle Columbia disaster"><i>Columbia</i> disaster</a>, high profile boards convened to investigate the accidents with both committees returning praise and serious critiques to the program and NASA management. One of the most famous of these criticisms came from <!--del_lnk--> Nobel Prize winner <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_Feynman.htm" title="Richard Feynman">Richard Feynman</a>.<p><a id="Terrestrial_transportation_vehicles" name="Terrestrial_transportation_vehicles"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Terrestrial transportation vehicles</span></h2>

Either can fly an Orbiter from alternative landing sites back to <a href="../../wp/c/Cape_Canaveral.htm" title="Cape Canaveral">Cape Canaveral</a>.<li>A 36-wheeled transport trailer, originally built for the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Air Force&#39;s launch facility at <!--del_lnk--> Vandenberg Air Force Base in <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a> (since then converted for <!--del_lnk--> Delta IV rockets) that would transport the Orbiter from the landing facility to the launch pad, which allowed both &quot;stacking&quot; and launch without utilizing a separate VAB-style building and crawler-transporter roadway. Prior to the closing of the Vandenberg facility, Orbiters were transported from the OPF to the VAB on its undercarriage, only to be raised when the Orbiter was being lifted for attachment to the SRB/ET stack. The trailer allows the transportation of the Orbiter from the OPF to either the SCA-747 &quot;Mate-Demate&quot; stand or the VAB without placing any additional stress on the undercarriage.</ul>
