      <p>Most of what is known about Socrates is derived from information that recurs across various contemporary sources: the <!--del_lnk--> dialogues written by <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a>, one of Socrates&#39; students; the works of <!--del_lnk--> Xenophon, one of his contemporaries; and writings by <!--del_lnk--> Aristophanes and <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>. Nothing Socrates wrote himself has survived. Additionally, Aristophanes&#39; account of Socrates is in fact a satirical attack on philosophers and does not purport to be a factual account of events in the life of Socrates. Another complication is the Ancient Greek tradition of scholars attributing their own ideas, theories and sometimes even personal traits to their mentors, a tradition Plato appears to have followed. Gabriele Giannantoni, in his monumental 1991 work <i><!--del_lnk--> Socratis et Socraticorum Reliquiae</i>, attempts to compile every scrap of evidence regarding Socrates, including material attributed to <!--del_lnk--> Aeschines Socraticus, <!--del_lnk--> Antisthenes and a number of others supposed to have known him.<p>From Plato and Xenophon, we know the following facts about Socrates&#39; family. His father was <!--del_lnk--> Sophroniscus and his mother <!--del_lnk--> Phaenarete, a <!--del_lnk--> midwife. Socrates married <!--del_lnk--> Xanthippe, who bore him three sons &ndash; Lamprocles, Sophroniscus and Menexenus &ndash; who were all quite young at the time of his death. Traditionally, Xanthippe is thought to have been an ill-tempered scold, mainly due to her characterization by Xenophon.<p>It is unclear how Socrates earned a living. If we believe <!--del_lnk--> Timon of Phlius and later sources, Socrates took over the profession of stonemasonry from his father. But no earlier sources corroborate this story. According to Xenophon&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> <i>Symposium</i>, Socrates is reported as saying he devotes himself only to what he regards as the most important art or occupation: discussing philosophy. Xenophon and Aristophanes respectively portray Socrates as accepting payment for teaching and running a <!--del_lnk--> sophist school with <!--del_lnk--> Chaerephon, while in Plato&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Apology of Socrates</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Symposium</i> Socrates explicitly denies accepting payment for teaching. It is possible Socrates relied on the generosity of wealthy and powerful friends such as Crito.<p>Plato&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Apology of Socrates</i> indicates that Socrates served in the Athenian army as a <!--del_lnk--> hoplite during the <!--del_lnk--> Peloponnesian War. Plato&#39;s <i>Symposium</i> indicates that he was also decorated for bravery. In one instance, Socrates is said to have stayed on the battlefield to protect <a href="../../wp/a/Alcibiades.htm" title="Alcibiades">Alcibiades</a>, probably saving his life; he then sought Alcibiades&#39; recognition rather than accepting any of his own. Victor Davis Hanson, a professor of classics, describes Socrates&#39; fighting at Delium, a disastrous loss for the Athenians in 424 B.C. in the book &quot;<!--del_lnk--> What If? 2&quot;, indicating that it was influential in the philosopher&#39;s later thinking about absolutes in ethics. It is also claimed he showed great hardiness during these military campaigns, such as walking without shoes or coat during winter.<p><a id="Trial_and_death" name="Trial_and_death"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Trial and death</span></h2>

      <p>Socrates lived during the time of the transition from the height of the <!--del_lnk--> Athenian Empire to its decline after its defeat by <!--del_lnk--> Sparta and its allies in the <!--del_lnk--> Peloponnesian War. At a time when <a href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Athens">Athens</a> was seeking to stabilize and recover from its humiliating defeat, the Athenian public court was induced by three leading public figures to try Socrates for impiety and for corrupting the youth of Athens. This was a time in culture when the Greeks thought of gods and goddesses as being associated with protecting particular cities. Athens, for instance, is named after its protecting goddess <a href="../../wp/a/Athena.htm" title="Athena">Athena</a>. The defeat of Athens in the Peloponnesian War was interpreted as Athena judging the city for not being pious. The last thing Athens needed was more punishment from Athena for one man inciting its citizens to question her or the other gods. In the <i><!--del_lnk--> Apology</i>, Socrates insists that this is a false charge.<p>Socrates was critical of Athenian democracy, and preached to his students, who were mostly young aristocrats, that a monarchy was preferable. He also praised the laws and government of <!--del_lnk--> Sparta. One of his students was <a href="../../wp/a/Alcibiades.htm" title="Alcibiades">Alcibiades</a>, who betrayed Athens for Sparta. Another student was <!--del_lnk--> Critias (uncle of <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a>), who was one the <!--del_lnk--> Thirty Tyrants who overthrew Athens democratic government, setting up a pro-Spartan <a href="../../wp/o/Oligarchy.htm" title="Oligarchy">oligarchy</a> until it was overthrown.<p>Socrates had been preaching against democracy to young aristocrats for decades, without much interference from Athens. This changed with his students&#39; betrayal of Athens to Sparta and their replacement of Athenian democracy with a pro-Spartan oligarchical junta. This is seen as the catalyst for his trial after decades of him saying the same thing, the words turned into action.<p>According to the version of his defense speech presented in Plato&#39;s <i>Apology</i>, Socrates&#39; life as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> gadfly&quot; of Athens began when his friend Chaerephon asked the <!--del_lnk--> oracle at <!--del_lnk--> Delphi if anyone was wiser than Socrates; the Oracle responded negatively. Socrates, interpreting this as a riddle, set out to find men who were wiser than he was. He questioned the men of Athens about their knowledge of <!--del_lnk--> good, <!--del_lnk--> beauty, and <!--del_lnk--> virtue. Finding that they knew nothing and yet believed themselves to know much, Socrates came to the conclusion that he was wise only in so far as he <i>knew</i> that he knew nothing. Socrates&#39; superior intellect made the prominent Athenians he publicly questioned look foolish, turning them against him and leading to accusations of wrongdoing.<p>He was nevertheless found guilty as charged, and sentenced to death by drinking a silver goblet of <!--del_lnk--> hemlock. Socrates turned down the pleas of his disciples to attempt an escape from prison, drinking the hemlock and dying in the company of his friends. According to the <i>Phaedo</i>, Socrates had a calm death, enduring his sentence with fortitude. The Roman philosopher <!--del_lnk--> Seneca attempted to emulate Socrates&#39; death by hemlock when forced to commit suicide by the Emperor Nero.<p>According to Xenophon and Plato, Socrates had an opportunity to escape, as his followers were able to bribe the prison guards. After escaping, Socrates would have had to flee from Athens. In the painting &quot;Death Of Socrates&quot;, under the death bed, there is an irregularly-shaped tile, which many believe is an escape hatch. Socrates refused to escape for several reasons. 1. He believed that such a flight would indicate a fear of death, which he believed no true philosopher has. 2. Even if he did leave, he, and his teaching, would fare no better in another country. 3. Having knowingly agreed to live under the city&#39;s laws, he implicitly subjected himself to the possibility of being accused of crimes by its citizens and judged guilty by its jury. To do otherwise would have caused him to break his &#39;<!--del_lnk--> contract&#39; with the state, and by so doing harming it, an act contrary to Socratic principle.<p>After Socrates&#39;s death, Plato described it in the dialogue <i><!--del_lnk--> Phaedo</i>.<table align="center" cellpadding="10" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p><a id="Socratic_method" name="Socratic_method"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Socratic method</span></h3>
      <p>Perhaps his most important contribution to <!--del_lnk--> Western thought is his <!--del_lnk--> dialectic (answering a question with a question) method of inquiry, known as the <!--del_lnk--> Socratic Method or method of <i>elenchos</i>, which he largely applied to the examination of key moral concepts such as the Good and <!--del_lnk--> Justice. It was first described by <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a> in the <i>Socratic Dialogues</i>. For this, Socrates is customarily regarded as the father of <a href="../../wp/p/Political_philosophy.htm" title="Political philosophy">political philosophy</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Ethics.htm" title="Ethics">ethics</a> or moral philosophy, and as a fountainhead of all the main themes in <!--del_lnk--> Western philosophy in general.<p>In this method, a series of <!--del_lnk--> questions are posed to help a person or group to determine their underlying <!--del_lnk--> beliefs and the extent of their knowledge. The Socratic method is a <i>negative</i> method of <!--del_lnk--> hypothesis elimination, in that better hypotheses are found by steadily identifying and eliminating those which lead to <!--del_lnk--> contradictions. It was designed to force one to examine his own beliefs and the validity of such beliefs. In fact, Socrates once said, &quot;I know you won&#39;t believe me, but the highest form of Human Excellence is to question oneself and others.&quot;<p><a id="Philosophical_beliefs" name="Philosophical_beliefs"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Philosophical beliefs</span></h3>
      <p>The beliefs of Socrates, as opposed to those of Plato, are difficult to discern. Little in the way of concrete evidence demarcates the two. There are some who claim that Socrates had no particular set of beliefs, and sought only to examine; the lengthy theories he gives in the <i>Republic</i> are considered to be the thoughts of Plato. Others argue that he did have his own theories and beliefs, but there is much controversy over what these might have been, owing to the difficulty of separating Socrates from Plato and the difficulty of interpreting even the dramatic writings concerning Socrates. Consequently, distinguishing the philosophical beliefs of Socrates from those of Plato and Xenophon is not easy and it must be remembered that what is attributed to Socrates might more closely reflect the specific concerns of these writers.<p>Evidence from the dialogues suggests Socrates had only two teachers: <!--del_lnk--> Prodicus, a <!--del_lnk--> grammarian, and <!--del_lnk--> Diotima, a priestess from <!--del_lnk--> Mantinea who taught him about <i>eros</i>, or <a href="../../wp/l/Love.htm" title="Love">love</a>. His knowledge of other contemporary thinkers such as <!--del_lnk--> Parmenides and <!--del_lnk--> Anaxagoras is evident from a number of dialogues, and historical sources often include both of them as Socrates&#39; teachers. <!--del_lnk--> John Burnet argued that his principal teacher was the Anaxagorean <!--del_lnk--> Archelaus but that his ideas were as Plato described them; <!--del_lnk--> Eric A. Havelock, on the other hand, considered Socrates&#39; association with the Anaxagoreans to be evidence of Plato&#39;s philosophical separation from Socrates. Apollo himself may be considered one of his teachers, as Socrates claims (in Plato&#39;s <i>Apology</i>) that his habit of constant conversation was obedience to God. See below for more on the divine sign.<p><a id="Knowledge" name="Knowledge"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Knowledge</span></h4>
      <p>Socrates seems to have often said that his wisdom was limited to an awareness of his own ignorance. Socrates may have believed that wrongdoing was a consequence of ignorance, that those who did wrong knew no better. The one thing Socrates consistently claimed to have knowledge of was &quot;the art of love&quot; which he connected with the concept of &quot;the love of wisdom&quot;, i.e., philosophy. He never actually claimed to be wise, only to understand the path that a lover of wisdom must take in pursuing it. It is debatable whether Socrates believed that humans (as opposed to gods like <a href="../../wp/a/Apollo.htm" title="Apollo">Apollo</a>) could actually become wise. On the one hand, he drew a clear line between human ignorance and ideal knowledge; on the other, Plato&#39;s <i>Symposium</i> (Diotima&#39;s Speech) and <i>Republic</i> (Allegory of the Cave) describe a method for ascending to wisdom.<p>In Plato&#39;s <i>Theaetetus</i> (150a) Socrates compares himself to a true matchmaker (&pi;&rho;&omicron;&mu;&nu;&eta;&sigma;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#x3CC;&sigmaf;), as distinguished from a panderer (&pi;&rho;&omicron;&#x1FB0;&gamma;&omega;&gamma;&#x3CC;&sigmaf;). This distinction is echoed in Xenophon&#39;s <i>Symposium</i> (3.20), when Socrates jokes about his certainty of being able to make a fortune, if he chose to practise the art of pandering. For his part as a philosophical interlocutor, he leads his respondent to a clearer conception of wisdom, although he claims that he is not himself a teacher (Apology). His role, he claims, is more properly to be understood as analogous to a <i><!--del_lnk--> midwife</i> (&mu;&alpha;&#x1FD6;&alpha;). Socrates explains that he is himself barren of theories, but knows how to bring the theories of others to birth and determine whether they are worthy or mere &quot;wind eggs&quot; (&#x1F00;&nu;&epsilon;&mu;&iota;&alpha;&#x1FD6;&omicron;&nu;). Perhaps significantly, he points out that midwives are barren due to age, and women who have never given birth are unable to become midwives; a truly barren woman would have no experience or knowledge of birth and would be unable to separate the worthy infants from those that should be left on the hillside to be exposed. To judge this, the midwife must have experience and knowledge of what she is judging.<p><a id="Virtue" name="Virtue"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Virtue</span></h4>
      <p>Socrates believed that the best way for people to live was to focus on self-development rather than the pursuit of material wealth. (Gross 2). He always invited others to try to concentrate more on friendships and a sense of true community, for Socrates felt that this was the best way for people to grow together as a populace. His actions lived up to this: in the end, Socrates accepted his death sentence when most thought he would simply leave Athens, as he felt he could not run away from or go against the will of his community; as above, his reputation for valor on the battlefield was without reproach.<p>The idea that humans possessed certain virtues formed a common thread in Socrates&#39; teachings. These virtues represented the most important qualities for a person to have, foremost of which were the philosophical or intellectual virtues. Socrates stressed that &quot;virtue was the most valuable of all possessions; the ideal life was spent in search of the Good. Truth lies beneath the shadows of existence, and that it is the job of the philosopher to show the rest how little they really know.&quot; (Solomon 44)<p>Ultimately, virtue relates to the form of the Good; to truly be good and not just act with &quot;right opinion&quot;; one must come to know the unchanging Good in itself. In the <i>Republic</i>, he describes the &quot;divided line&quot;, a continuum of ignorance to knowledge with the Good on top of it all; only at the top of this line do we find true good and the knowledge of such.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h4>
      <p>It is often argued that Socrates believed &quot;ideals belong in a world that only the wise man can understand&quot; making the philosopher the only type of person suitable to govern others. According to Plato&#39;s account, Socrates was in no way subtle about his particular beliefs on government. He openly objected to the <a href="../../wp/d/Democracy.htm" title="Democracy">democracy</a> that ran Athens during his adult life. It was not only Athenian democracy: Socrates objected to any form of government that did not conform to his ideal of a perfect republic led by philosophers (Solomon 49), and Athenian government was far from that. During the last years of Socrates&#39; life, Athens was in continual flux due to political upheaval. Democracy was at last overthrown by a <!--del_lnk--> junta known as the <!--del_lnk--> Thirty Tyrants, led by Plato&#39;s relative, <!--del_lnk--> Critias, who had been a student of Socrates. The Tyrants ruled for about a year before the Athenian democracy was reinstated, at which point it declared an <!--del_lnk--> amnesty for all recent events. Four years later, it acted to silence the voice of Socrates.<p>This argument is often denied, and the question is one of the biggest philosophical debates when trying to determine what, exactly, it was that Socrates believed. The strongest argument of those who claim that Socrates did not actually believe in the idea of philosopher kings is Socrates&#39; constant refusal to enter into politics or participate in government of any sort; he often stated that he could not look into other matters or tell people how to live when he did not yet understand himself. He believed he was a philosopher engaged in the pursuit of Truth, and did not claim to know it fully. Socrates&#39; acceptance of his <!--del_lnk--> death sentence, after his conviction by the <i><!--del_lnk--> Boule</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Senate), can also be seen to support this view. It is often claimed that much of the anti-democratic leanings are from Plato, who was never able to overcome his disgust at what was done to his teacher. In any case, it is clear that Socrates thought that the rule of the Thirty Tyrants was at least as objectionable as democracy; when called before them to assist in the arrest of a fellow Athenian, Socrates refused and narrowly escaped death before the Tyrants were overthrown. He did however fulfill his <i>duty</i> to serve as <i>prytanie</i> when a trial of a group of generals who presided over a disastrous naval campaign were judged; even then he maintained an uncompromising attitude, being one of those who refused to proceed in a manner not supported by the laws, despite intense pressure.  Judging by his actions, he considered the rule of the Thirty Tyrants less legitimate than that of the democratic senate who sentenced him to death.<p><a id="Mysticism" name="Mysticism"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Mysticism</span></h4>
      <p>As depicted in the dialogues of Plato, Socrates often seems to manifest a <!--del_lnk--> mystical side, discussing <!--del_lnk--> reincarnation and the mystery religions; however, this is generally attributed to Plato. Regardless, this cannot be dismissed out of hand, as we cannot be sure of the differences between the views of Plato and Socrates; in addition, there seem to be some corollaries in the works of <!--del_lnk--> Xenophon. In the culmination of the philosophic path as discussed in Plato&#39;s <i>Symposium</i> and <i>Republic</i>, one comes to the <!--del_lnk--> Sea of Beauty or to the sight of the form of the Good in an experience akin to <a href="../../wp/m/Mysticism.htm" title="Mysticism">mystical</a> <!--del_lnk--> revelation; only then can one become wise. (In the <i>Symposium</i>, Socrates credits his speech on the philosophic path to his teacher, the priestess <!--del_lnk--> Diotima, who is not even sure if Socrates is capable of reaching the highest mysteries). In the <i>Meno</i>, he refers to the <!--del_lnk--> Eleusinian Mysteries, telling Meno he would understand Socrates&#39; answers better if only he could stay for the initiations next week.<p>Perhaps the most interesting facet of this is Socrates&#39; reliance on what the Greeks called his &quot;<!--del_lnk--> daemonic sign&quot;, an averting (&#x1F00;&pi;&omicron;&tau;&rho;&epsilon;&pi;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#x3CC;&sigmaf;) inner voice that Socrates heard only when Socrates was about to make a mistake. It was this <i>sign</i> that prevented Socrates from entering into politics. In the <i>Phaedrus</i>, we are told Socrates considered this to be a form of &quot;divine madness&quot;, the sort of <!--del_lnk--> insanity that is a gift from the gods and gives us <a href="../../wp/p/Poetry.htm" title="Poetry">poetry</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Mysticism.htm" title="Mysticism">mysticism</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Love.htm" title="Love">love</a>, and even <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> itself. Alternately, the <i>sign</i> is often taken to be what we would call &quot;intuition&quot;; however, Socrates&#39; characterization of the phenomenon as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> daemonic&quot; suggests that its origin is divine, mysterious, and independent of his own thoughts.<p><a id="Satirical_playwrights" name="Satirical_playwrights"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Satirical playwrights</span></h2>
      <p>He was prominently lampooned in <!--del_lnk--> Aristophanes&#39; <!--del_lnk--> comedy <i><!--del_lnk--> The Clouds</i>, produced when Socrates was in his mid-forties; he said at his trial (in Plato&#39;s version) that the laughter of the <!--del_lnk--> theatre was a harder task to answer than the arguments of his accusers. In the play he is ridiculed for his dirtiness, which is associated with the <!--del_lnk--> Laconizing fad; also in plays by <!--del_lnk--> Callias, <!--del_lnk--> Eupolis, and <!--del_lnk--> Telecleides. In all of these, Socrates and the <!--del_lnk--> Sophists were criticised for &quot;the moral dangers inherent in contemporary thought and literature&quot;.<p><a id="Prose_sources" name="Prose_sources"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates&quot;</div>
