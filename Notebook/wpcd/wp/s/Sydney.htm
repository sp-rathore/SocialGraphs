      <p><b>Sydney</b> (<!--del_lnk--> pronounced <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/&#x2C8;s&#x26A;d.ni&#x2D0;/</span>) is the most populous city in <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a> with a <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan area population of over 4.2 million people (2006). Sydney is the <!--del_lnk--> state capital of <!--del_lnk--> New South Wales and is located on the country&#39;s south-east coast.<p>The first European <!--del_lnk--> colony in Australia, Sydney was established in 1788 at <!--del_lnk--> Sydney Cove by <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Phillip who led the <!--del_lnk--> First Fleet from Britain. Built around <!--del_lnk--> Port Jackson, which includes Sydney Harbour, the city of Sydney has been called the &quot;Harbour City&quot;. It is Australia&#39;s largest <a href="../../wp/f/Finance.htm" title="Finance">financial centre</a> and a major international <!--del_lnk--> tourist destination, notable for <!--del_lnk--> its beaches and twin landmarks: the <!--del_lnk--> Sydney Opera House and the <!--del_lnk--> Harbour Bridge.

      <p>It has been speculated that the Sydney region has been occupied by <!--del_lnk--> indigenous Australians for at least 30 000 years. At the time of the arrival of the <!--del_lnk--> First Fleet in 1788, 4000 - 8000 Aboriginal people lived in the region. There were three different language groups in the Sydney region; these were further refined into dialects spoken by smaller clans. The principal languages were <!--del_lnk--> Darug (the <i><!--del_lnk--> Cadigal</i>, original inhabitants of the City of Sydney, spoke a coastal dialect of Darug), <!--del_lnk--> Dharawal and <!--del_lnk--> Guringai. Each clan had a territory; the location of that territory determined the resources available. Although <!--del_lnk--> urbanisation has destroyed most evidence of these settlements (such as <!--del_lnk--> shell middens), rock carvings still exist in several locations.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>European interest in colonising Australia arose with the landing of British sea captain, Lieutenant <a href="../../wp/j/James_Cook.htm" title="James Cook">James Cook</a> in <!--del_lnk--> Botany Bay in 1770. Under instruction from the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> government, a <!--del_lnk--> convict settlement was founded by <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Phillip in 1788. Phillip founded the colony at <!--del_lnk--> Sydney Cove on <!--del_lnk--> Port Jackson. He named it after the British <!--del_lnk--> Home Secretary, <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Townshend, Lord Sydney, in recognition of Sydney&#39;s role in issuing the charter authorising Phillip to establish a colony. In April 1789 a disease, thought to be <a href="../../wp/s/Smallpox.htm" title="Smallpox">smallpox</a>, decimated the indigenous population of Sydney; a conservative estimate says that 500 to 1000 Aboriginal people died in the area between <!--del_lnk--> Broken and Botany Bays. There was violent resistance to British settlement, notably by the warrior <!--del_lnk--> Pemulwuy in the area around Botany Bay, and conflicts were common in the area surrounding the <!--del_lnk--> Hawkesbury River. By 1820 there were only a few hundred Aborigines and <!--del_lnk--> Governor Macquarie had begun initiatives to &#39;civilise, christianise and educate&#39; the Aborigines by removing them from their clans.<div class="thumb tright">

      </div>
      <p>Macquarie&#39;s tenure as <!--del_lnk--> Governor of New South Wales was a period when Sydney was improved from its basic beginnings. Roads, bridges, wharves and public buildings were constructed by British and Irish convicts, and by 1822 the town had banks, markets, well-established thoroughfares and an organised constabulary. The 1830s and 1840s were periods of urban development, including the development of the first suburbs, as the town grew rapidly when ships began arriving from the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Isles.htm" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> with immigrants looking to start a new life in a new country. On July 20 1842 the municipal council of Sydney was incorporated and the town was declared the first city in Australia, Charles H. Chambers was the first mayor. The first of several <!--del_lnk--> gold rushes started in 1851, and the port of Sydney has since seen many waves of people arriving from around the world. Rapid suburban development began in the last quarter of the 19th century with the advent of steam powered tramways and railways. With industrialisation Sydney expanded rapidly, and by the early 20th century it had a population well in excess of one million. The <!--del_lnk--> Great Depression hit Sydney badly. One of the highlights of the Depression era, however, was the completion of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932.<p>Throughout the 20th century Sydney continued to expand with various new waves of <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European</a> and (later) <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asian</a> immigration, resulting in its highly cosmopolitan atmosphere. The majority of Sydneysiders are of British and Irish background. More recent arrivals have included Italians, Greeks, Jews, Lebanese, South Africans, South Asians (including Indians, Sri Lankans and Pakistanis), Sudanese, Turks, Macedonians, Croatians, Serbs, South Americans (Brazilians, Chileans and Argentinians), Armenians, Eastern Europeans (Czech, Poles, Russians, Ukrainians and Hungarians) and East Asians (including Chinese, Koreans and Vietnamese).<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>Sydney is in a coastal basin bordered by the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> to the east, the <!--del_lnk--> Blue Mountains to the west, the <!--del_lnk--> Hawkesbury River to the north and the <!--del_lnk--> Woronora Plateau to the south. Sydney lies on a <!--del_lnk--> submergent coastline, where the ocean level has risen to flood deep river valleys (<!--del_lnk--> rias) carved in the sandstone. One of these drowned valleys, <!--del_lnk--> Port Jackson, better known as Sydney Harbour, is the largest <!--del_lnk--> natural harbour in the world. There are more than 70 harbour and ocean beaches, including the famous <!--del_lnk--> Bondi Beach, in the urban area. Sydney&#39;s urban area covers 1687&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> square&nbsp;kilometres (651&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mi&sup2;) as at 2001. The Sydney Statistical Division, used for census data, is the unofficial metropolitan area and covers 12,145&nbsp;square&nbsp;kilometres (4,689&nbsp;mi&sup2;). This area includes the <!--del_lnk--> Central Coast and <!--del_lnk--> Blue Mountains as well as broad swathes of national park and other unurbanised land.<p>Geographically, Sydney sprawls over two major regions: the Cumberland Plain, a relatively flat region lying to the south and west of the harbour, and the <!--del_lnk--> Hornsby Plateau, a sandstone plateau lying mainly to the north of the harbour, dissected by steep valleys. The oldest parts of the city are located in the flat areas south of the harbour; the <!--del_lnk--> North Shore was slower to develop because of its hilly topography, and was mostly a quiet <!--del_lnk--> backwater until the <!--del_lnk--> Sydney Harbour Bridge was opened in 1932, linking it to the rest of the city.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>
      <p>Sydney has an <!--del_lnk--> oceanic climate with warm summers and mild <a href="../../wp/w/Winter.htm" title="Winter">winters</a>, with rainfall spread throughout the year. The weather is moderated by proximity to the ocean, and more extreme temperatures are recorded in the inland western suburbs. The warmest month is January, with an average air temperature range at <!--del_lnk--> Observatory Hill of 18.6&nbsp;&deg;C&ndash;25.8&nbsp;&deg;C and an average of 14.6 days a year over 30&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> &deg;C. The maximum recorded temperature was 45.3&nbsp;&deg;C on <!--del_lnk--> 14 January 1939 at the end of a 4 day nationwide <!--del_lnk--> heat wave. The winter is mildly cool, with temperatures rarely dropping below 5&nbsp;&deg;C in coastal areas. The coldest month is July, with an average range of 8.0&nbsp;&deg;C&ndash;16.2&nbsp;&deg;C. The lowest recorded minimum was 2.1&nbsp;&deg;C. Rainfall is fairly evenly divided between summer and winter, but is slightly higher during the first half of the year, when easterly winds dominate. The average annual rainfall, with moderate to low variability, is 1217.0&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> millimetres (47.9&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> in), falling on an average 138.0 days a year. <!--del_lnk--> Snowfall last occurred in the Sydney City area in the 1830&#39;s.<p>Although the city does not suffer from <a href="../../wp/t/Tropical_cyclone.htm" title="Tropical cyclone">cyclones</a> or significant <a href="../../wp/e/Earthquake.htm" title="Earthquake">earthquakes</a>, the <a href="../../wp/e/El_Ni%25C3%25B1o-Southern_Oscillation.htm" title="El Ni&ntilde;o">El Ni&ntilde;o Southern Oscillation</a> plays an important role in determining Sydney&#39;s weather patterns: drought and bushfire on the one hand, and storms and flooding on the other, associated with the opposite phases of the oscillation. Many areas of the city bordering bushland have experienced <!--del_lnk--> bushfires, notably in 1994 and 2002 &mdash; these tend to occur during the spring and summer. The city is also prone to severe <!--del_lnk--> hail storms and wind storms. One such storm occurred in Sydney&#39;s eastern and city suburbs on the evening of <!--del_lnk--> 14 April 1999, producing massive hailstones of at least 9&nbsp;centimetres (3.5&nbsp;in) in diameter and resulting in insurance losses of around $1.5 billion in less than one hour. The city is also prone to <!--del_lnk--> flash flooding from enormous amounts of rain caused by East Coast Lows (a low pressure depression which deepens off the state usually in winter and early spring which can bring significant damage due to heavy rain, cyclonic winds and huge swells). The most notable event was the great Sydney flood which occurred on <!--del_lnk--> 6 August <!--del_lnk--> 1986 and dumped a record 327.6&nbsp;millimetres (12.9&nbsp;in) on the city in 24 hours. This caused major traffic chaos and damage in many parts of the metropolitan area.<p>Recent research by a Macquarie University atmospheric scientist suggests that land clearing in western Sydney has contributed to major changes in the city&#39;s climate. The <!--del_lnk--> Bureau of Meteorology have reported that the last four years in Sydney have been the warmest on record (since 1859). 2004 had an average daily maximum temperature of 23.39&nbsp;&deg;C, 2005 - 23.35&nbsp;&deg;C, 2002 - 22.91&nbsp;&deg;C and 2003 - 22.65&nbsp;&deg;C. The average daily maximum between 1859 and 2004 was 21.6&nbsp;&deg;C. For the first nine months of 2006 the mean temperature was 18.41&nbsp;&deg;C; the warmest year previously was 2004 with 18.51&nbsp;&deg;C. Since the beginning of 2002, there have been only two months in which the average daily maximum was below average: March 2005 (0.43&nbsp;&deg;C below average) and June 2006 (0.25&nbsp;&deg;C below average).<table class="wikitable" style="width: 75%; margin: 0 auto 0 auto;">

      <p>The extensive area covered by urban Sydney is formally divided into more than 300 suburbs (for addressing and postal purposes), and administered as 38 local government areas. There is no city-wide government, but the <!--del_lnk--> Government of New South Wales and its agencies have extensive responsibilities in providing metropolitan services. The <!--del_lnk--> City of Sydney itself covers a fairly small area comprising the central business district and its neighbouring inner-city suburbs. In addition, regional descriptions are used informally to conveniently describe larger sections of the urban area. These include <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Suburbs, <!--del_lnk--> Hills District, <!--del_lnk--> Inner West, <!--del_lnk--> Lower North Shore, <!--del_lnk--> Northern Beaches, <!--del_lnk--> North Shore, <!--del_lnk--> Southern Sydney, <!--del_lnk--> South-eastern Sydney, <!--del_lnk--> South-western Sydney, <!--del_lnk--> Sutherland Shire and <!--del_lnk--> Western Sydney. However, many suburbs are not conveniently covered by any of these categories.<p><!--del_lnk--> Sydney&#39;s central business district (CBD) extends southwards for about 2&nbsp;kilometres (1.25&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mi) from <!--del_lnk--> Sydney Cove, the point of the first European settlement. Densely concentrated <!--del_lnk--> skyscrapers and other buildings including historic sandstone buildings such as the <!--del_lnk--> Sydney Town Hall and <!--del_lnk--> Queen Victoria Building are interspersed by several parks such as <!--del_lnk--> Wynyard and <!--del_lnk--> Hyde Park. The Sydney CBD is bounded on the east side by a chain of parkland that extends from <!--del_lnk--> Hyde Park through <!--del_lnk--> the Domain and <!--del_lnk--> Royal Botanic Gardens to <!--del_lnk--> Farm Cove on the harbour. The west side is bounded by <!--del_lnk--> Darling Harbour, a popular tourist and nightlife precinct while <!--del_lnk--> Central station marks the southern end of the CBD. <!--del_lnk--> George Street serves as the Sydney CBD&#39;s main north-south thoroughfare.<p>Although the CBD dominated the city&#39;s business and cultural life in the early days, other business/cultural districts have developed in a radial pattern since <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. As a result, the proportion of white-collar jobs located in the CBD declined from more than 60 per cent at the end of World War II to less than 30 per cent in 2004. Together with the commercial district of <!--del_lnk--> North Sydney, joined to the CBD by the Harbour Bridge, the most significant outer business districts are <!--del_lnk--> Parramatta in the central-west, <!--del_lnk--> Blacktown in the west, <!--del_lnk--> Bondi Junction in the east, <!--del_lnk--> Liverpool in the southwest, <!--del_lnk--> Chatswood to the north, and <!--del_lnk--> Hurstville to the south.<p><a id="Governance" name="Governance"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Governance</span></h2>
      <p>Apart from the limited role of the <!--del_lnk--> Cumberland County Council from 1945&ndash;1964, there has never been an overall governing body for the Sydney metropolitan area; instead, the metropolitan area is divided into <!--del_lnk--> local government areas (LGAs). These areas have elected councils which are responsible for functions delegated to them by the <!--del_lnk--> New South Wales State Government, such as planning and garbage collection.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> City of Sydney includes the central business area and some adjoining inner suburbs, and has in recent years been expanded through amalgamation with adjoining local government areas, such as South Sydney. It is led by the elected <!--del_lnk--> Lord Mayor of Sydney and a council. The Lord Mayor, however, is sometimes treated as a representative of the whole city, for example during the Olympics.<p>The 38 LGAs in Sydney are:<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="" style="background-color: transparent; width: 100%">

      <p>Most citywide government activities are controlled by the state government. These include public transport, main roads, traffic control, policing, education above preschool level, and planning of major infrastructure projects. Because a large proportion of New South Wales&#39; population lives in Sydney, state governments have traditionally been reluctant to allow the development of citywide governmental bodies, which would tend to rival the state government. For this reason, Sydney has always been a focus for the politics of both State and <!--del_lnk--> Federal Parliaments. For example, the boundaries of the City of Sydney LGA have been significantly altered by state governments on at least four occasions since 1945, with expected advantageous effect to the governing party in the <!--del_lnk--> New South Wales Parliament at the time.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>

      <p>The largest economic sectors in Sydney, measured by numbers of people employed, include property and business services, retail, manufacturing, and health and community services. Since the 1980s, jobs have moved from manufacturing to the services and information sectors. Sydney provides approximately 25% of the country&#39;s total <!--del_lnk--> GDP.<p>Sydney is the largest corporate and financial centre in Australia and is also an important financial centre in the <!--del_lnk--> Asia Pacific. The <!--del_lnk--> Australian Stock Exchange and the <!--del_lnk--> Reserve Bank of Australia are located in Sydney, as are the headquarters of 90 banks and more than half of Australia&#39;s top companies, and the regional headquarters for around 500 multinational corporations. <!--del_lnk--> Fox Studios Australia has large <!--del_lnk--> movie studios in the city.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) is one of the <!--del_lnk--> Asia Pacific&#39;s largest financial futures and options exchanges, with 64.3 million contracts traded during 2005. In global terms it is the 12th largest <!--del_lnk--> futures market in the world and the 19th largest including options. With the increasing commercial role of Sydney&#39;s many medical laboratories and research centres, science and research is another strong growth sector.<p>Tourism plays an important role in Sydney&#39;s economy, with 7.8 million domestic visitors and 2.5 million international visitors in 2004.<p>As of September 2003, the unemployment rate in Sydney was 5.3%. According to <i><!--del_lnk--> The Economist</i> Intelligence Unit&#39;s Worldwide <!--del_lnk--> cost of living survey, Sydney is the sixteenth most expensive city in the world, while a <!--del_lnk--> UBS survey ranks Sydney as 26th in the world in terms of net earnings.<p>As of December 2005, Sydney has the highest median <!--del_lnk--> house price of any Australian capital city at <!--del_lnk--> $485 000. A report published by the OECD in November 2005, shows that Australia has the Western World&#39;s highest housing prices when measured against rental yields.<p>Sydney has been classified as a &quot;Beta&quot; <a href="../../wp/g/Global_city.htm" title="Global city">global city</a> by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>Most Sydney residents travel by car through the system of roads, <!--del_lnk--> freeways and <!--del_lnk--> tollways (known as motorways). The most important <!--del_lnk--> trunk routes in the urban area form the <!--del_lnk--> Metroad system. Sydney is also served by extensive train, bus and ferry networks.<p><!--del_lnk--> Sydney trains are run by <!--del_lnk--> CityRail, a corporation of the <!--del_lnk--> New South Wales State Government. Trains run as suburban <!--del_lnk--> commuter rail services in the outer suburbs, then converge in an underground city loop service in the CBD. In the years following the 2000 Olympics, CityRail&#39;s performance declined significantly. In 2005, CityRail introduced a revised timetable and employed more drivers. A large infrastructure project, the <!--del_lnk--> Clearways project, is scheduled to be completed by 2010.<p>Sydney has one privately operated <!--del_lnk--> light rail line, the <!--del_lnk--> Metro Light Rail, running from <!--del_lnk--> Central Station to <!--del_lnk--> Lilyfield along a former goods train line. There is also a small <!--del_lnk--> monorail which runs in a loop around the main shopping district and <!--del_lnk--> Darling Harbour. Sydney was formerly served by an extensive <!--del_lnk--> tram network, which was progressively closed in the 1950s and 1960s. Most parts of the metropolitan area are served by buses, many of which follow the pre-1961 tram routes. In the city and inner <!--del_lnk--> suburbs the <!--del_lnk--> state-owned <!--del_lnk--> Sydney Buses has a monopoly. In the outer suburbs, service is contracted to many private bus companies. Construction of a network of <!--del_lnk--> rapid bus transitways in areas not previous well served by public transport began in 1999, and the first of these, the <!--del_lnk--> Liverpool-Parramatta Rapid Bus Transitway opened in February 2003. <!--del_lnk--> Sydney Ferries, another State government-owned organisation, runs numerous commuter and tourist ferry services on Sydney Harbour and the <!--del_lnk--> Parramatta River.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Kingsford Smith International Airport, located in the suburb of <!--del_lnk--> Mascot, is Sydney&#39;s main airport, and the oldest continuously operating <!--del_lnk--> commercial airport in the world. The smaller <!--del_lnk--> Bankstown Airport mainly serves private and <!--del_lnk--> general aviation. There are light aviation airfields at <!--del_lnk--> Hoxton Park and <!--del_lnk--> Camden. <!--del_lnk--> RAAF Base Richmond lies to the north-west of the city. The question of whether Sydney needs a second international airport has raised much controversy. A 2003 study found that Kingsford Smith can manage as Sydney&#39;s sole <!--del_lnk--> international airport for 20 years with a significant increase in airport traffic predicted. The resulting expansion of the airport will have a substantial impact on the community, including additional <!--del_lnk--> aircraft noise affecting residents. Land has been acquired at <!--del_lnk--> Badgerys Creek for a second airport and alternative sites have been mooted.<p><a id="Utilities" name="Utilities"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Utilities</span></h3>
      <p>Water storage and supply for Sydney is managed by the <!--del_lnk--> Sydney Catchment Authority, which is an agency of the NSW Government that sells bulk water to <!--del_lnk--> Sydney Water and other agencies. Water in the Sydney catchment is chiefly stored in dams in the <!--del_lnk--> Upper Nepean Scheme, the <!--del_lnk--> Blue Mountains, <!--del_lnk--> Woronora Dam, <!--del_lnk--> Warragamba Dam and the <!--del_lnk--> Shoalhaven Scheme. Historically low water levels in the catchment have led to water use restrictions and the NSW government is investigating alternative <!--del_lnk--> water supply options, including <!--del_lnk--> grey water recycling and the construction of a seawater <!--del_lnk--> reverse osmosis desalination plant at Kurnell. Sydney Water also collects the wastewater and sewerage produced by the city.<p>Three companies supply natural gas and electricity to Sydney: <!--del_lnk--> Energy Australia, <!--del_lnk--> AGL and <!--del_lnk--> Integral Energy. Numerous telecommunications companies operate in Sydney providing terrestrial and mobile telecommunications services.<div class="center">
