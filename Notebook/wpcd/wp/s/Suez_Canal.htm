      <p>Perhaps as early as the <!--del_lnk--> 12th Dynasty, <!--del_lnk--> Pharaoh <!--del_lnk--> Senusret III (<!--del_lnk--> 1878 BC - <!--del_lnk--> 1839 BC) may have had a <i>west-east</i> canal dug through the <!--del_lnk--> Wadi Tumilat, joining the <a href="../../wp/n/Nile.htm" title="Nile">Nile</a> with the <a href="../../wp/r/Red_Sea.htm" title="Red Sea">Red Sea</a>, for direct trade with <!--del_lnk--> Punt, and thus allowing trade indirectly between the Red Sea and <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>.

It later fell into disrepair, and according to the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Histories</i> of the Greek historian <a href="../../wp/h/Herodotus.htm" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>, re-excavation was undertaken about 600 BC by <!--del_lnk--> Necho II; though Necho II never completed his project.<p>The canal was finally completed by <!--del_lnk--> Darius I, the <!--del_lnk--> Persian conqueror of Egypt. According to <a href="../../wp/h/Herodotus.htm" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>, the completed canal was wide enough such that two <!--del_lnk--> triremes could pass each other with oars extended, and that the length of the canal was a voyage of 4 days.

      </div>
      <p>More than a thousand years elapsed before the next attempt was made to dig a canal. At the end of the 18th century, <!--del_lnk--> Napoleon Bonaparte, while in Egypt, contemplated the construction of a canal to join the Mediterranean and Red Seas. His project was abandoned, however, after a first survey erroneously concluded that the waters of the Red Sea were 10 meters higher than those of the Mediterranean, making a giant locks based canal much too expensive and very long to construct. The Napoleonic survey commission&#39;s error came from fragmented readings mostly done during wartime, which therefore resulted in imprecise calculations.<p>In 1854 and 1856 <!--del_lnk--> Ferdinand de Lesseps obtained a concession from <!--del_lnk--> Said Pasha, the <!--del_lnk--> viceroy of Egypt. (De Lesseps had come to know Said as a French diplomat in the 1830s and had a very friendly relationship with him, which he used to his advantage in getting the concession.) Said Pasha authorized the creation of a company for the purpose of constructing a maritime canal open to ships of all nations according to plans created by <a href="../../wp/a/Austria.htm" title="Austria">Austrian</a> engineer <!--del_lnk--> Alois Negrelli. By way of a lease of the relevant land, the company was to operate the canal for 99 years from its opening to navigation. The Suez Canal Company (<i><!--del_lnk--> Compagnie Universelle du Canal Maritime de Suez</i>) came into being on <!--del_lnk--> December 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1858.<p>The excavation of the canal took nearly eleven years, mostly through the forced labor of Egyptians workers &mdash; a form of labor which was not unique to the French, nor the British before them, but had been in use in Egypt for millennia, since the construction of the <a href="../../wp/p/Pyramid.htm" title="Pyramid">pyramids</a>. It is estimated that during the decade of work, over 30,000 people were forced to work on the canal.<!--del_lnk-->  The British, willing to stop the French project at any cost, sent armed <!--del_lnk--> bedouins to start a revolt among workers. Involuntary labor ceased on the project, and shortly thereafter, the Viceroy condemned the slavery and the project was stopped  The British government officially condemned the forced work.<p>The British Empire&#39;s power increased during the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> and it was the first global naval force. The British recognized the canal as an important trade route and the French project was perceived as a direct menace to their geopolitical and financial interests. Angered by the British opportunism, de Lesseps sent a letter to the British government remarking on the British lack of remorse only a few years earlier when 80,000 <!--del_lnk-->  Egyptian forced workers died in similar conditions in order to build the British railtrack in Egypt.<p>At first, the international opinion was sceptical and the Suez Canal Company shares did not sell well overseas (e.g. Britain, United States, Austria and Russia did not buy a single one). All French shares were quickly sold in France though. A contemporary British sceptic claimed:<br />

      <p>Although numerous technical, political (due to the British rivalry), and financial problems were overcome, the final cost was more than double the original estimate. The canal opened to traffic on <!--del_lnk--> November 17, <!--del_lnk--> 1869.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The canal had an immediate and dramatic effect on world trade. Combined with the completion of the <a href="../../wp/f/First_Transcontinental_Railroad.htm" title="First Transcontinental Railroad">American Transcontinental Railroad</a> six months earlier, the entire world could be circled in record time. It played an important role in increasing European penetration and colonization of Africa. External debts forced Said Pasha&#39;s successor, <!--del_lnk--> Isma&#39;il Pasha, to sell his country&#39;s share in the canal for &pound;4,000,000 to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> in 1875, but France still remained as the majority shareholder. The <!--del_lnk--> Convention of Constantinople in 1888 declared the canal a neutral zone under the protection of the British; British troops had moved in to protect it during a civil war in Egypt in <!--del_lnk--> 1882. Under the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, the United Kingdom insisted on retaining control over the canal. In 1951, Egypt repudiated the treaty, and by 1954 the United Kingdom had agreed to pull out.<p>After the United Kingdom and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> withdrew their pledge to support the construction of the <!--del_lnk--> Aswan Dam, Egyptian President <!--del_lnk--> Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the Canal in 1956, intending to finance the dam project using revenue from the Canal. This provoked the week-long <!--del_lnk--> Suez Crisis, in which a <!--del_lnk--> military alliance between the United Kingdom, France, and <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israel</a> invaded Egypt. The threat of intervention on behalf of Egypt by the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> and pressure from the United States ended the crisis.<p>As a result of damage and sunken ships, the canal was closed until April 1957, when it had been cleared with <!--del_lnk--> UN assistance. A <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> force (<!--del_lnk--> UNEF) was established to maintain the neutrality of the canal and the <!--del_lnk--> Sinai Peninsula.<p>After the <!--del_lnk--> Six Day War in 1967, the canal was closed until <!--del_lnk--> June 5, <!--del_lnk--> 1975. In 1973, during the <a href="../../wp/y/Yom_Kippur_War.htm" title="Yom Kippur War">Yom Kippur War</a>, the canal was the scene of <!--del_lnk--> a major crossing by the Egyptian army into Israeli-controlled Sinai; later, the Israeli army crossed the canal westward.<p>A multinational observer force (<!--del_lnk--> MFO), mostly consisting of U.S. Army troops, currently monitors the Sinai. After a U.N. mandate expired in 1979, negotiations began for a new observer force. In 1981, the MFO was stationed in the Sinai in coordination with a phased Israeli withdrawal. This force is not under United Nations <!--del_lnk--> auspices. It is there under agreements between the U.S., Israel, Egypt, and other participating nations.

      <p>The canal has no <!--del_lnk--> locks due to the flatness of the terrain it passes through, and sea level at both ends being the same. The canal allows the passage of ships of up to some 150,000 tons <!--del_lnk--> displacement, with cargo. It permits ships of up to 16 m (53 ft) <!--del_lnk--> draft to pass, and improvements are planned to increase this to 22 m (72 ft) by 2010 to allow <!--del_lnk--> supertanker passage. Presently, supertankers can offload part of their cargo onto a canal-owned boat and reload at the other end of the canal. There is one shipping lane with several passing areas. Three convoys transit the canal on a typical day, two southbound and one northbound. The first southbound convoy enters the canal in the early morning hours and proceeds to the Great Bitter Lake, where the ships anchor out of the fairway and await the passage of the northbound convoy. The northbound convoy passes the second southbound convoy, which moors to the canal bank in a by-pass, in the vicinity of El Qantara. Egypt&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Suez Canal Authority (SCA) reported that in 2003 17,224 ships passed through the canal. The canal averages about 8% of the world shipping traffic. The passage takes between 11 and 16 hours at a speed of around 8 <!--del_lnk--> knots. The low speed helps prevent erosion of the canal banks by ship&#39;s wakes.<p><a id="Connections_between_the_shores" name="Connections_between_the_shores"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Connections between the shores</span></h2>
