<h2>SOS Children in South Korea</h2>
<img src="../../wp/s/South_Korea_Sponsorship_Locations.gif" width="350" height="359" alt="Sponsorship sites in South Korea" class="left" /><p>The Republic of South Korea was established in 1948 following partition of the Korean peninsula after World War II by the United States in the south and the USSR in the north. Conflicts and strained relations between the USA and the USSR in the early 1950s led to the Korean War which devastated the whole country. Even with foreign aid, the Korean government was unable to rebuild the country let alone provide care for the thousands of children who had been orphaned and were living on the streets. </p><p>The charity opened its first community in Daegu which opened in 1965. Daegu is a city of 1.5 million people in the south-east of the country and the village is situated on the edge of the city, near the airport. The original thirteen family houses and kindergarten for 120 children have since been extended to include a youth house, where the older children live while completing their education or vocational training and taking their first guided steps towards independence. The latest SOS facility at Daegu went into operation in 1999 with the establishment of a educational therapy centre for children with behavioural problems. </p><p>The SOS Children Seoul was built in 1982, on the western edge of the capital, Seoul, a city of almost 10 million people. The fifteen family houses are home to 140 children and their SOS mothers. There is also a youth house for 30 boys. An SOS social centre provides child-care for local working families as well as a youth club for older children. </p><p>The charity opened its third Korean community in 1982 in Suncheon, which is approximately 200 km from Daegu. It has ten family houses and a youth house which together are home to over 125 children and young people. An SOS Vocational Training Centre in Pohang, completed in 1991, provides training for potential SOS mothers as well as in-service training for established SOS staff.</p><h3>Local contacts</h3>
