      <p>In 1972, the official <!--del_lnk--> name of the country was changed to &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Free, <!--del_lnk--> Sovereign and <!--del_lnk--> Independent <!--del_lnk--> Republic of Sri Lanka&quot; (&#xDC1;&#xDCA;&zwj;&#xDBB;&#xDD3; &#xDBD;&#xD82;&#xD9A;&#xDCF; <i>&#x15B;r&#x12B; lank&#x101;</i> in <!--del_lnk--> Sinhala (whereas the island itself is referred to as &#xDBD;&#xD82;&#xD9A;&#xDCF;&#xDC0; <i>lank&#x101;va</i>), &#xB87;&#xBB2;&#xB99;&#xBCD;&#xB95;&#xBC8; <i>ila&#x1E45;kai</i> in <!--del_lnk--> Tamil). In 1978 it was changed to &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka&quot;. Prior to 1972, Sri Lanka <!--del_lnk--> was known by a variety of names: ancient Greek geographers called it <i>Taprobane</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Arabs referred to it as <i>Serendib</i>, <i>Ceil&atilde;o</i> was the name given to Sri Lanka when the Portuguese arrived on the island, but perhaps the best known is <i>Ceylon</i>. &quot;Sri Lanka&quot; (originally <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>) is translated as &quot;venerable Lanka&quot;, &quot;&#x15B;r&#x12B;&quot; meaning &quot;venerable&quot; and &quot;la&#x1E43;k&#x101;&quot; being the ancient name of the island as attested in the <a href="../../wp/m/Mahabharata.htm" title="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a> and the <a href="../../wp/r/Ramayana.htm" title="Ramayana">Ramayana</a>.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Paleolithic human settlements have been discovered at excavations in several cave sites in the Western Plains region and the South-western face of the Central Hills region. <a href="../../wp/a/Anthropology.htm" title="Anthropology">Anthropologists</a> believe that some discovered burial rites and certain decorative artifacts exhibit similarities between the first inhabitants of the island and the early inhabitants of <!--del_lnk--> southern India. One of the first written references to the island is found in the Indian epic <a href="../../wp/r/Ramayana.htm" title="Ramayana">Ramayana</a>, which described the emperor <!--del_lnk--> Ravana as monarch of the powerful kingdom of <i><!--del_lnk--> Lanka</i>. The main written accounts of the country&#39;s history are the <!--del_lnk--> Buddhist chronicles of <!--del_lnk--> Mahavansa and <!--del_lnk--> Dipavamsa.<p>The earliest-known inhabitants of the island now known as Sri Lanka were probably the ancestors of the <!--del_lnk--> Wanniyala-Aetto people, also known as <i>Veddahs</i> and numbering roughly 3,000. Linguistic analysis has found a correlation of the <!--del_lnk--> Sinhalese language with the languages of the <!--del_lnk--> Sindh and <!--del_lnk--> Gujarat, although most historians believe that the Sinhala community emerged well after the assimilation of various ethnic groups. <!--del_lnk--> Dravidian people may have begun migrating to the island from the pre-historic period. From the ancient period date some remarkable archaeological sites including the ruins of <!--del_lnk--> Sigiriya, the so-called &quot;Fortress in the Sky&quot;, and huge public works. Among the latter are large &quot;tanks&quot; or <!--del_lnk--> reservoirs, important for conserving water in a climate that alternates rainy seasons with dry times, and elaborate <!--del_lnk--> aqueducts, some with a slope as finely calibrated as one inch to the mile. Ancient Sri Lanka was also the first in the world to have established a dedicated hospital in <!--del_lnk--> Mihintale in the 4th century BCE. Ancient Sri Lanka was also the world&#39;s leading exporter of <!--del_lnk--> cinnamon, which was exported to <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> as early as 1400 BCE. Sri Lanka was also the first Asian nation to have a female ruler in <!--del_lnk--> Queen Anula (<!--del_lnk--> 47&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 42 BC)<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="toccolours" style="float: right; border-sollapse: collapse; margin: 0 0 1.5em 1.5em;">

      <p>Ancient Sri Lanka was ruled by various small kingdoms that dominated different regions. The island was also infrequently invaded by South Indian kingdoms and parts of the island were ruled intermittently by the <a href="../../wp/c/Chola_dynasty.htm" title="Chola dynasty">Chola dynasty</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Pandya dynasty, the <!--del_lnk--> Chera dynasty and the <!--del_lnk--> Pallava dynasty. The island was also invaded by the kingdoms of <!--del_lnk--> Kalinga (modern <!--del_lnk--> Orissa) and those from the <!--del_lnk--> Malay Peninsula. <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> arrived from India in the <!--del_lnk--> 3rd century BCE, brought by <!--del_lnk--> Bhikkhu <!--del_lnk--> Mahinda, who is believed to have been either the son or brother of <!--del_lnk--> Mauryan emperor <!--del_lnk--> Ashoka. Mahinda&#39;s mission won over the Sinhalese monarch <!--del_lnk--> Devanampiyatissa of <!--del_lnk--> Mihintale, who embraced the faith and propagated it throughout the Sinhalese population. The Buddhist kingdoms of Sri Lanka would maintain a large number of Buddhist schools and monasteries, and support the propagation of Buddhism into <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asia.<p>Sri Lanka had always been an important port and trading post in the ancient world, and was increasingly frequented by merchant ships from the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Persia, <a href="../../wp/m/Myanmar.htm" title="Burma">Burma</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Malaysia.htm" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> and other parts of Southeast Asia. The island were known to the first European explorers of South Asia and settled by many groups of Arab and Malay merchants. A Portuguese colonial mission arrived on the island in 1505. At that point the island consisted of three kingdoms, namely Yarlpanam (Anglicised <!--del_lnk--> Jaffna) in the north, <!--del_lnk--> Kandy in the central hills and <!--del_lnk--> Kotte at the Western coast. The <!--del_lnk--> Dutch arrived in the 17th century. Although much of the island came under the domain of European powers, the interior, hilly region of the island remained independent, with its capital in <!--del_lnk--> Kandy. The <a href="../../wp/b/British_East_India_Company.htm" title="British East India Company">British East India Company</a> established control of the island in 1796, declaring it a <!--del_lnk--> crown colony in 1802, although the island would not be officially connected with <!--del_lnk--> British India. The fall of the kingdom of Kandy in 1815 unified the island under British rule.<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="toccolours" style="float: right; border-sollapse: collapse; margin: 0 0 1.5em 1.5em;">

The British also brought a large number of <!--del_lnk--> indentured workers from <!--del_lnk--> Tamil Nadu to work in the plantation economy. The city of <a href="../../wp/c/Colombo.htm" title="Colombo">Colombo</a> was established as the administrative centre, and the British established modern schools, colleges, roads and churches that brought Western-style education and culture to the native people. Increasing grievances over the denial of <a href="../../wp/c/Civil_rights.htm" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a>, mistreatment and abuse of natives by colonial authorities gave rise to a <!--del_lnk--> struggle for independence in the 1930s, when the <!--del_lnk--> Youth Leagues opposed the &quot;Ministers&#39; Memorandum,&quot; which asked the colonial authority to increase the powers of the board of ministers without granting popular representation or civil freedoms. During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the island served as an important Allied military base. A large segment of the British and American fleet were deployed on the island, as were tens of thousands of soldiers committed to the war against <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> in Southeast Asia. Following the war, popular pressure for independence intensified. On <!--del_lnk--> February 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1948 the country won its independence as the Commonwealth of Ceylon. <!--del_lnk--> Don Stephen Senanayake became the first <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. In 1972, the country became a <!--del_lnk--> republic within the Commonwealth, and the name was changed to Sri Lanka. On <!--del_lnk--> July 21, <!--del_lnk--> 1960 <!--del_lnk--> Sirimavo Bandaranaike became the first female <!--del_lnk--> head of government in post-colonial Asia when she took office as prime minister. In the 1970s, political conflicts emerged between the Sinhalese and Tamil communities. The Tamil community cited extensive institutional discrimination and political disenfranchisement, and sought increased regional autonomy and <!--del_lnk--> affirmative action. In the 1980s, the island&#39;s long-standing peace and stability was shattered by the Tamil separatist movement led by the <!--del_lnk--> Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which demanded an independent state of <!--del_lnk--> Ealam in northeastern Sri Lanka. A 1986 peace accord brokered by India failed by 1988 when Indian peacekeepers were drawn into a direct military conflict with the LTTE while attempting to disarm the militants. Sri Lankan nationalists sought the exit of Indian troops, and by 2000 as many as 50,000 people were killed in battles between the <!--del_lnk--> Sri Lankan Army and the LTTE, which controls parts of the northeast. A tentative ceasefire has restored peace to the island as the government and the LTTE engage in diplomacy under the mediation of <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a>. The <a href="../../wp/2/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake.htm" title="2004 Indian Ocean earthquake">2004 Indian Ocean earthquake</a> created powerful tsunamis that devastated the south and east of the island, killing and displacing close to 40,000 people.<p><a id="Geography_and_climate" name="Geography_and_climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography and climate</span></h2>

      <p>The island of Sri Lanka lies in the <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Ocean.htm" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>, to the southwest of the <a href="../../wp/b/Bay_of_Bengal.htm" title="Bay of Bengal">Bay of Bengal</a> and to the southeast of the <!--del_lnk--> Arabian Sea. It is separated from the <!--del_lnk--> Indian subcontinent by the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf of Mannar and the <!--del_lnk--> Palk Strait. According to <!--del_lnk--> Hindu mythology, a land bridge to the Indian mainland, known as <!--del_lnk--> Rama&#39;s Bridge, was constructed during the time of <a href="../../wp/r/Rama.htm" title="Rama">Rama</a> by the <!--del_lnk--> vanara architect <!--del_lnk--> Nala. Often referred to as Adam&#39;s Bridge, it now amounts to only a chain of limestone shoals remaining above <!--del_lnk--> sea level. According to temple records, this natural <!--del_lnk--> causeway was formerly complete, but was breached by a violent storm (probably a <!--del_lnk--> cyclone) in 1480. The width of the Palk Strait is small enough for the coast of Sri Lanka to be visible from the furthest point near the Indian town of <!--del_lnk--> Rameswaram. The <!--del_lnk--> pear-shaped island consists mostly of flat-to-rolling coastal plains, with mountains rising only in the south-central part. Amongst these are <!--del_lnk--> Sri Pada and the highest point <!--del_lnk--> Pidurutalagala (also known as Mt Pedro), at 2,524 <!--del_lnk--> meters (8,281 <!--del_lnk--> ft). The <!--del_lnk--> Mahaweli ganga (Mahaweli river) and other major rivers provide fresh water.<p>Sri Lanka&#39;s climate can be described as tropical, and quite hot. Its position between 5 and 10 north latitude endows the country with a warm climate, moderated by ocean winds and considerable moisture. The mean temperature ranges from a low of 16&deg;C in Nuwara Eliya in the Central Highlands (where frost may occur for several days in the winter) to a high of 32&deg; C in Trincomalee on the northeast coast (where temperatures may reach 38 &deg;C). The average yearly temperature for the country as a whole ranges from 28 to 30 &deg;C. Day and night temperatures may vary by 4 to 7. In January, the coolest month, many people wear coats and sweaters in the highlands and elsewhere. May, the hottest period, precedes the summer monsoon rains. The rainfall pattern is influenced by the monsoon winds of the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal, which encounter the slopes of the <!--del_lnk--> Central Highlands, they unload heavy rains on the mountain slopes and the southwestern sector of the island. Some of the windward slopes receive up to 2500 mm of rain per month, but the leeward slopes in the east and northeast receive little rain. Periodic squalls occur and sometimes tropical cyclones bring overcast skies and rains to the southwest, northeast, and eastern parts of the island. Between December to March, monsoon winds come from the northeast, bringing moisture from the Bay of Bengal. Humidity is typically higher in the southwest and mountainous areas and depends on the seasonal patterns of rainfall. At Colombo, for example, daytime humidity stays above 70% all year, rising to almost 90 percent during the monsoon season in June. Anuradhapura experiences a daytime low of 60% during the monsoon month of March, but a high of 79% during the November and December rains. In the highlands, Kandy&#39;s daytime humidity usually ranges between 70 and 79%.<p><a id="Flora_and_fauna" name="Flora_and_fauna"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Flora and fauna</span></h2>

      <p>The pattern of life in Sri Lanka depends directly on the availability of rainwater. The mountains and the southwestern part of the country, known as the &quot;wet zone,&quot; receive ample rainfall (an annual average of 250 centimeters). Most of the southeast, east, and northern parts of the country comprise the &quot;dry zone, which receives between 1200 and 1900 mm of rain annually. Much of the rain in these areas falls from October to January; during the rest of the year there is very little precipitation, and all living creatures must conserve precious moisture. The arid northwest and southeast coasts receive the least amount of rain &mdash; 600 to 1200 mm per year &mdash; concentrated within the short period of the winter monsoon. Varieties of flowering <!--del_lnk--> acacias are well adapted to the arid conditions and flourish on the <!--del_lnk--> Jaffna Peninsula. Among the trees of the dry-land forests are some valuable species, such as <!--del_lnk--> satinwood, <a href="../../wp/e/Ebony.htm" title="Ebony">ebony</a>, <!--del_lnk--> ironwood, and <!--del_lnk--> mahogany. In the wet zone, the dominant vegetation of the lowlands is a tropical evergreen forest, with tall trees, broad foliage, and a dense undergrowth of vines and creepers. Subtropical evergreen forests resembling those of temperate climates flourish in the higher altitudes. Forests at one time covered nearly the entire island, but by the late 20th century lands classified as forests and forest reserves covered only one-fifth of the land. <!--del_lnk--> Ruhunu National Park in the southeast protects herds of elephant, deer, and peacocks, and Wilpattu National Park in the northwest preserves the habitats of many water birds, such as storks, pelicans, ibis, and spoonbills. During the Mahaweli Ganga Program of the 1970s and 1980s in northern Sri Lanka, the government set aside four areas of land totalling 1,900 km&sup2; as national parks. The island has three <!--del_lnk--> biosphere reserves, <!--del_lnk--> Hurulu, <!--del_lnk--> Sinharaja, and the <!--del_lnk--> Kanneliya-Dediyagala-Nakiyadeniya.<p><a id="Government_and_politics" name="Government_and_politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Government and politics</span></h2>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Constitution of Sri Lanka establishes a <!--del_lnk--> democratic, <!--del_lnk--> socialist <!--del_lnk--> republic in Sri Lanka, which is also a <!--del_lnk--> unitarian state. The government is a mixture of the <!--del_lnk--> presidential system and the <a href="../../wp/p/Parliamentary_system.htm" title="Parliamentary system">parliamentary system</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> President of Sri Lanka is the <!--del_lnk--> head of state, the <!--del_lnk--> commander in chief of the <!--del_lnk--> armed forces, as well as <!--del_lnk--> head of government, and is popularly elected for a six-year term. In the exercise of duties, the President is responsible to the <!--del_lnk--> Parliament of Sri Lanka, which is a <!--del_lnk--> unicameral 225-member <!--del_lnk--> legislature. The President appoints and heads a <!--del_lnk--> cabinet of <!--del_lnk--> ministers composing of elected members of parliament. The President&#39;s deputy is the <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister, who leads the ruling party in parliament and shares many executive responsibilities, mainly in domestic affairs. Sri Lanka is divided into 9 <b><!--del_lnk--> provinces</b> and subdivided into 25 <b><!--del_lnk--> districts</b>. Each province is administered by a directly-elected provincial council. The provinces are (capitals in parentheses):<p>

      <p>Members of parliament are elected by universal (adult) suffrage based on a modified <!--del_lnk--> proportional representation system by district to a six-year term. The primary modification is that the party that receives the largest number of valid votes in each constituency gains a unique &quot;bonus seat.&quot; The president may summon, suspend, or end a legislative session and dissolve Parliament any time after it has served for one year. The parliament reserves the power to make all laws. On <!--del_lnk--> July 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1960 the people of Sri Lanka elected the first-ever female head of government in Prime Minister Srimavo Bandaranaike. Her daughter <!--del_lnk--> Chandrika Kumaratunga has served multiple terms as prime minister and as president from 1999 to 2005.

There are also many smaller Buddhist, socialist and Tamil nationalist political parties that oppose the separatism of the LTTE but demand regional autonomy and increased civil rights.

      <p>In the 19th and 20th centuries, Sri Lanka became a <!--del_lnk--> plantation economy, famous for its production and export of <!--del_lnk--> cinnamon, <!--del_lnk--> rubber and <!--del_lnk--> Ceylon tea, which remains a trademark national export. The development of modern ports under British rule raised the strategic importance of the island as a centre of trade. During World War II, the island hosted important military installations and Allied forces. However, the plantation economy aggravated poverty and economic inequality. From 1948 to 1977 <a href="../../wp/s/Socialism.htm" title="Socialism">socialism</a> strongly influenced the government&#39;s economic policies. Colonial plantations were dismantled, industries were nationalised and a <!--del_lnk--> welfare state established. While the standard of living and literacy improved significantly, the nation&#39;s economy suffered from inefficiency, slow growth and lack of foreign investment.<p>From 1977 the UNP government began incorporating <!--del_lnk--> privatisation, deregulation and promotion of <!--del_lnk--> private enterprise. While the production and export of tea, rubber, coffee, sugar and other agricultural commodities remains important, the nation has moved steadily towards an industrialised economy with the development of <!--del_lnk--> food processing, <!--del_lnk--> textiles, <!--del_lnk--> telecommunications and <a href="../../wp/f/Finance.htm" title="Finance">finance</a>. By 1996, plantation crops made up only 20% of exports (compared with 93% in 1970), while textiles and garments have reached 63%. The <!--del_lnk--> GDP grew at an average annual rate of 5.5% during the early 1990s, until a drought and a deteriorating security situation lowered growth to 3.8% in 1996. The economy rebounded in 1997-2000, with average growth of 5.3%. The year of 2001 saw the first economic contraction in the country&#39;s history, as a result of power shortages, budgetary problems, the global slowdown, and <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lankan_Civil_War.htm" title="Ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka">continuing civil strife</a>. Signs of recovery appeared after the 2002 ceasefire. The <!--del_lnk--> Colombo Stock Exchange reported the highest growth in the world for 2003, and today Sri Lanka has the highest <!--del_lnk--> per capita income in South Asia.<p>In April 2004, there was a sharp reversal in economic policy after the government headed by Ranil Wickremesinghe of the <!--del_lnk--> United National Party was defeated by a coalition made up of <!--del_lnk--> Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the leftist-nationalist <!--del_lnk--> Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna called the <!--del_lnk--> United People&#39;s Freedom Alliance. The new government stopped the privatization of <!--del_lnk--> state enterprises and reforms of state <!--del_lnk--> utilities such as power and <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a>, and embarked on a subsidy program called the Rata Perata economic program. Its main theme to support the rural and suburban SMEs and protect the domestic economy from external influences, such as oil prices, the <!--del_lnk--> World Bank and the <!--del_lnk--> International Monetary Fund. But this policy of subsidizing imported commodities like fuel, <!--del_lnk--> fertiliser and <a href="../../wp/w/Wheat.htm" title="Wheat">wheat</a> soon unravelled the fiscal sector. In 2004 alone Sri Lanka spent approximately <!--del_lnk--> US$ 180 million on a fuel subsidy, as fixing fuel prices had been an election promise. To finance the expanded <!--del_lnk--> budget deficit arising from a range of subsidies and a public sector recruitment drive, the government eventually had to print <a href="../../wp/r/Rupee.htm" title="Rupee">Rs</a> 65 billion (US$ 650 million) or around 3% of GDP. The expansionary fiscal policy, coupled with loose <!--del_lnk--> monetary policy eventually drove <!--del_lnk--> inflation up to 18% by January 2005, as measured by the Sri Lanka <!--del_lnk--> Consumer Price Index.<p><a id="Transport" name="Transport"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transport</span></h2>

      <p>Most Sri Lankan cities and towns are connected by the <!--del_lnk--> Sri Lanka Railways, the state-run national railway operator. The first railway line was inaugurated on <!--del_lnk--> April 26, <!--del_lnk--> 1867, linking Colombo with Kandy. The total length of Sri Lankan roads exceeds 11,000 kilometres, with a vast majority of them being paved. The government has launched several highway projects to bolster the economy and national transport system, including the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway, the Colombo-Kandy (Kadugannawa) Expressway, the Colombo-Padeniya Expressway and the Outer Circular Highway to ease Colombo&#39;s traffic congestion. There are also plans to build a major bridge connecting <!--del_lnk--> Jaffna to the Indian city of <a href="../../wp/c/Chennai.htm" title="Chennai">Chennai</a>.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Ceylon Transport Board is the state-run agency responsible for operating public bus services across the island.

Sri Lanka has a birth rate of 15.63 births per 1,000 people and a death rate of 6.49 deaths per 1,000 people. Population density is the greatest in western Sri Lanka, especially in and around Colombo. There is a small population on the island of the <!--del_lnk--> Wanniyala-Aetto people, also known as <i>Veddahs</i>. These are believed to be the oldest and indigenous ethnic group to inhabit the island. The <!--del_lnk--> Sinhalese people form the largest ethnic group in the nation, composing approximately 74% of the total population. <!--del_lnk--> Sri Lankan Tamils form 18% of the population, and are mainly concentrated in the northeastern part of the country. Tamils who were brought as indentured labourers from India by British colonists to work on estate plantations, are called &quot;Indian Origin&quot; Tamils.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Sinhalese and <a href="../../wp/t/Tamil_language.htm" title="Tamil language">Tamil</a> are the two official languages of Sri Lanka. <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> is spoken by approximately 10% of the population, and is widely used for education, scientific and commercial purposes. Members of the Burgher community speak variant forms of <!--del_lnk--> Portuguese Creole and <a href="../../wp/d/Dutch_language.htm" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a> with varying proficiency. Sri Lanka also enjoys significant religious diversity. Approximately 68% of Sri Lankan peoples are adherents of Buddhism. <!--del_lnk--> Theravada Buddhism is the predominant school, with distinctive sects such as <!--del_lnk--> Ramanna Nikaya, <!--del_lnk--> Amarapura Nikaya and <!--del_lnk--> Siam Nikaya being widely followed. Buddhism in Sri Lanka has been deeply influenced by indigenous faiths and traditions, as well as the influences of prevailing Buddhist schools in South East Asia. The ancient and famous <!--del_lnk--> Sri Dalada Maligawa or &quot;Temple of the Tooth&quot; is the principal <!--del_lnk--> Buddhist Temple in Sri Lanka, and by tradition houses the Tooth of <a href="../../wp/b/Buddha.htm" title="Buddha">Buddha</a>. It is visited every year by millions of pilgrims. There are many other famous religious institutions in Sri Lanka that attract many visitors daily. <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> is practiced by 18% of the population, mainly from the Tamil community. <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> is practiced by 7-8% of the population, especially by the Portuguese and Dutch <!--del_lnk--> Burgher people. While most Sri Lankan Christians are <!--del_lnk--> Catholics, there are also significant numbers who adhere to <!--del_lnk--> Dutch Reformed Church and the <a href="../../wp/a/Anglican_Communion.htm" title="Anglican Communion">Anglican Communion</a>.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

      <p>The island is the home of two main traditional cultures: the Sinhalese (centered in the ancient cities of Kandy and Anuradhapura) and the Tamil (centered in the city of Jaffna, where the public library that was destroyed in 1983 was the world centre of Tamil archives and scholarship). In more recent times a British colonial culture was added, and lately Sri Lanka, particularly in the urban areas, has experienced a dramatic makeover in the western mold. Until recently, for example, most Sri Lankans, certainly those in the villages, have eaten traditional food, engaged in traditional crafts and expressed themselves through traditional arts. But economic growth and intense economic competition in developed countries has spilled over even to much of Sri Lanka, producing changes that might variously be identified as progress, westernisation or a loss of identity and assimilation.<p>Sri Lankans have added western influences to the customary diet such as <a href="../../wp/r/Rice.htm" title="Rice">rice</a> and curry, pittu (mixture of fresh rice meal, very lightly roasted and mixed with fresh grated coconut, then steamed in a bamboo mould). Kiribath (cooked in thick coconut cream for this unsweetened rice-pudding which is accompanied by a sharp chili relish called &quot;;lunumiris&quot;), wattalapam (rich pudding of Malay origin made of coconut milk, jaggery, cashew nuts, eggs, and various spices including cinnamon cloves and <a href="../../wp/n/Nutmeg.htm" title="Nutmeg">nutmeg</a>), <!--del_lnk--> kottu, and <!--del_lnk--> hoppers (&quot;appa&quot;), batter cooked rapidly in a hot curved pan, accompanied by eggs, milk or savouries. Sri Lankan food also has Dutch and Portuguese influences, with the island&#39;s Burgher community preserving this culture through traditional favourites such as Lamprais (rice cooked in stock and baked in a banana leaf), Breudher (Dutch Christmas cake) and Bolo Fiado (Portuguese-style layer cake).<div class="thumb tright">

The <!--del_lnk--> Buddhist majority observe Poya Days, once per month according to the <!--del_lnk--> Lunar calendar. The <!--del_lnk--> Hindus and <!--del_lnk--> Muslims also observe their own holidays. There are many <!--del_lnk--> Buddhist temples in Sri Lanka and many <!--del_lnk--> mosques, <!--del_lnk--> Hindu temples and <!--del_lnk--> churches all across the island. The North and the East of the island have many mosques and Hindu temples because a large <a href="../../wp/t/Tamil_people.htm" title="Tamil people">Tamil</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Muslim population resides in those areas. Many churches can be found along the southern coast line because of a concentration of Christians, particularly <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholics, in that region. The interior of the island is mostly Buddhist, and indeed there are many Buddhists in all parts of the island.<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h2>

      <p>Sri Lanka enjoys the highest literacy rate in South Asia and much of the developing world, with more than 96% of the population being literate. A <!--del_lnk--> free education system was initiated by Dr. <!--del_lnk--> C. W. W. Kannangara, Sri Lanka&#39;s education minister. Mr. Kannangara led the establishment of the <!--del_lnk--> Maha Vidyalayas (Great Central Schools) in different parts of the country in order to provide education to Sri Lanka&#39;s rural population. In 1942 a special education committee proposed extensive reforms to establish an efficient and quality education system for the people. In recent decades, a large number of private and international schools have been established across the nation. The <!--del_lnk--> International Baccalaureate and <!--del_lnk--> Edexcel General Certificate of Secondary Education are popular education programmes.<p>There are many schools and academies run by Buddhist and Christian missions. Buddhist and Christian missions provide religious as well as modern education. There are also a growing number of <!--del_lnk--> madrassahs in the country. Sri Lanka also has a large number of public and private universities. Most of these schools are modelled on British colleges and universities. <!--del_lnk--> Royal College, Colombo is the oldest modern college in Sri Lanka, founded in 1835. The most reputed and distinguished educational institutions in Sri Lanka include the <!--del_lnk--> University of Colombo, the <!--del_lnk--> University of Kelaniya, the <!--del_lnk--> University of Sri Jayewardenepura, <!--del_lnk--> University of Moratuwa, the <!--del_lnk--> University of Peradeniya, the <!--del_lnk--> University of Jaffna, the <!--del_lnk--> University of Ruhuna, and the <!--del_lnk--> Eastern University of Sri Lanka.<p><a id="Sports" name="Sports"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sports</span></h2>

Premadasa Stadium and the <!--del_lnk--> Rangiri Dumbulla Stadium in Colombo as well as the <!--del_lnk--> Galle International Stadium in Galle.<p>Although cricket and football matches are sometimes disrupted by heavy rains or security concerns owing to the LTTE militancy, Sri Lanka has hosted the <!--del_lnk--> Asia Cup tournament on numerous occasions. It co-hosted the <!--del_lnk--> 1996 Cricket World Cup with India and <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, and will co-host the <!--del_lnk--> 2011 Cricket World Cup.
