<h2>FIFA 6 villages for 2006 - Team up with SOS Children and score a Hat Trick!</h2><p><strong>29/03/2006</strong></p>
<img src="../../wp/f/FA_CREST_4C.jpg" width="277" height="400" alt="FA Crest" class="left" /><p><strong>More news on our campaign to build six new SOS Children's Villages... </strong></p><p> We are delighted to say that we have been chosen as an official charity partner of The Football Association for 2006. Due to the scale and scope of SOS Children's work with orphaned children and their communities around the world. The FA was keen to support our work further. </p><p>The FA Chairman Geoff Thompson commented, &quot;We have spent a long time reviewing our charitable donations, mainly to ensure there's a logical connection between the organisations we support and the areas The FA can directly and positively influence&quot;. </p><p>2006 looks like being the perfect footballing year as we are working hard on the '6 villages for 2006' World Cup campaign. The campaign aims to construct six new SOS Children's Villages - one each in Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa, Ukraine and Vietnam. These villages will provide hundreds of orphaned, abandoned and destitute children with a new family home. </p><p>The FA joins an impressive team, which already includes FIFA/SOS Ambassadors Wayne Rooney and Gordon Strachan as well as Celtic Football Club, alongside international ambassadors such as Andriy Shevchenko, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Jay Jay Okocha, Fabio Cannavaro, Juninho Pernambucano, Lucas Radebe and Mahmoud El-Khatieb.</p><img src="../../wp/c/CV_Cape_Town.jpg" width="400" height="267" alt="joining the team for SOS Children" class="right" /><p>The FA is supporting one of the new houses being built as part of the new South African village at Rustenburg, although its support will be more than simply financial. Andrew Cates, Chief Executive SOS Children UK commented: &quot;We are delighted to be working with The FA, particularly during a World Cup year. Football unites people from around the world and I'm sure that football supporters here in England will generously support SOS Children's Villages in providing a future for children who have nowhere else to turn.&quot; </p><p>With The FA's support, SOS Children hopes to make 2006 the year that sees football help the world's orphans. </p><p>If you or your local school would like to get involved please call 01223 365589 for our Football Fundraising pack or download resources from here.</p><h3>Keepy Uppy</h3>
<img src="../../wp/f/FIFAposter_UK.jpg" width="350" height="247" alt="FIFA 6 villages for 2006 Keepy Uppy Challenge" class="left" /><p>Why not organise a Keepy Uppy Challenge or test your dribbling skills? Our penalty shoot out could test your scoring abilities! Get sponsored to see how many penalties you can shoot in one minute. Don't forget the spectators though and you could have faces covered with the flags of the 32 participating countries. Or why not try a football themed day - the possibilities are endless! </p><p>For more details about how you can support our '6 villages for 2006' campaign and join our team for the SOS Keepy Uppy Challenge please email caroline@soschildren.org or call 01223 365589. </p><p>Join our SOS team this summer and help us reach our goal!</p>
