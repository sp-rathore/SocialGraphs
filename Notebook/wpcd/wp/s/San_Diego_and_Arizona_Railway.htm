      <p>The <b>San Diego and Arizona Railway</b> was a <!--del_lnk--> short line <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">American</a> <!--del_lnk--> railroad (<!--del_lnk--> AAR <!--del_lnk--> reporting mark <b>SDA</b>) founded by &quot;sugar heir,&quot; developer, and entrepreneur <!--del_lnk--> John D. Spreckels, and dubbed <b>&quot;The Impossible Railroad&quot;</b> by many engineers of its day due to the immense logistical challenges involved. Established in part to provide San Diego with a direct transcontinetal rail link to the east by connecting with the <!--del_lnk--> Southern Pacific Railroad (which secretly provided the funding for the endeavor) lines in <!--del_lnk--> El Centro, <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a>, the 148-<!--del_lnk--> mile (238-<!--del_lnk--> kilometer) route of the SD&amp;A originated in <!--del_lnk--> San Diego, <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a> and terminated in the <!--del_lnk--> Imperial County town of <!--del_lnk--> Calexico.<p>The company charter was executed on <!--del_lnk--> December 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1906, and the groundbreaking ceremony was held on the following September. Numerous delays (including government intervention during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>) delayed the completion of the line to <!--del_lnk--> November 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1919. Damage to the lines from both natural disasters and sabotage exerted great financial pressure on the company, and in <!--del_lnk--> 1932 Spreckels&#39; heirs sold their interests in the railroad to the Southern Pacific, which was theafter named the <!--del_lnk--> San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway (SD&amp;AE).<p>

      <p>The company was chartered on <!--del_lnk--> December 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1906, and groundbreaking ceremonies held at the intersection of San Diego&#39;s Main and 26th Streets on <!--del_lnk--> September 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1907. Construction delays, attacks by <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexican</a> revolutionaries, and government intervention during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> all served to push the construction completion to <!--del_lnk--> November 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1919 when the &quot;golden spike&quot; was finally driven by none other than John Spreckels himself.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The first through SD&amp;A <!--del_lnk--> passenger train left Campo on the morning of <!--del_lnk--> December 30, and made the full run from El Centro to San Diego&#39;s downtown <a href="../../wp/u/Union_Station_%2528San_Diego%2529.htm" title="Union Station (San Diego)">Union Station</a> for the official opening of the line on <!--del_lnk--> December 1, 1919. The total construction cost of the 146.4 miles of track laid was approximately $18 million, or some $123,000 per mile; the original estimate was $6 million. The 11-mile long segment through <!--del_lnk--> Carrizo Gorge (which included 13,385 feet of tunnels, 17 in all) alone cost over $4 million to construct; the three miles of tunnels (21 total) along the entire line ran another $1.8 million. Almost 2.5 miles of bridges and trestles were built as well.<p>The tracks departed downtown San Diego south where they crossed the <!--del_lnk--> U.S.-Mexico border at <!--del_lnk--> San Ysidro. From there the line traversed eastward through <a href="../../wp/t/Tijuana.htm" title="Tijuana">Tijuana</a>, then headed northeast through <!--del_lnk--> Tecate and back over the border to the town of <!--del_lnk--> Campo. To construct and maintain the 44-mile (72 kilometer) stretch through <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> the <i>SD&amp;A</i> formed the <b>Tijuana and Tecate Railway</b>, at the behest of the Mexican government. East of Campo the road traveled through Clover Flats, across the Coast Range (elevation 3,660 feet), then descended through the breathtaking but treacherous <!--del_lnk--> Carrizo Gorge, the builders&#39; most significant obstacle. Though the SD&amp;A line ended in <!--del_lnk--> Seeley, trackage rights gave the railroad the ability to run trains as far east as El Centro and as far south as <!--del_lnk--> Calexico. Branch lines ran from downtown to as far north and east as the community of <!--del_lnk--> Lakeside, with a separate line which circumvented San Diego Bay to service <!--del_lnk--> Coronado Heights, <!--del_lnk--> Coronado, and North Island.<p>Damage to the lines from heavy rainstorms, landslides, and fires took a financial toll on the railroad, as did border closings with Mexico. Clashes with the <!--del_lnk--> IWW resulted in acts of vandalism as well. In <!--del_lnk--> 1932, financial difficulties forced Spreckels&#39; heirs to sell their interests in the firm for $2.8 million to the Southern Pacific, which renamed the railroad the <!--del_lnk--> San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway (SD&amp;AE).<p><a id="Timeline" name="Timeline"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Timeline</span></h2>
