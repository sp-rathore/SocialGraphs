      <p>Saladin was born in 1138 into a <!--del_lnk--> Kurdish  family in <!--del_lnk--> Tikrit and was sent to <a href="../../wp/d/Damascus.htm" title="Damascus">Damascus</a> to finish his education. His father, <!--del_lnk--> Najm ad-Din Ayyub, was governor of <!--del_lnk--> Baalbek. For ten years Saladin lived in Damascus and studied <!--del_lnk--> Sunni Theology, at the court of <!--del_lnk--> Nur ad-Din (Nureddin). After an initial military education under the command of his uncle, Nur ad-Din&#39;s lieutenant <!--del_lnk--> Shirkuh, who was representing Nur ad-Din on campaigns against a faction of the <!--del_lnk--> Fatimid <!--del_lnk--> caliphate of Egypt in the <!--del_lnk--> 1160s, Saladin eventually succeeded the defeated faction and his uncle as <!--del_lnk--> vizier in <!--del_lnk--> 1169. There, he inherited a difficult role defending Egypt against the incursions of the Latin <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Jerusalem, under <!--del_lnk--> Amalric I. His position was tenuous at first; no one expected him to last long in Egypt where there had been many changes of government in previous years due to a long line of child caliphs fought over by competing viziers. As the leader of a foreign army from <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a>, he also had no control over the <!--del_lnk--> Shi&#39;ite Egyptian army, which was led in the name of the now otherwise powerless caliph <!--del_lnk--> Al-Adid. When the caliph died, in September <!--del_lnk--> 1171, Saladin had the imams pronounce the name of <!--del_lnk--> Al-Mustadi, the <!--del_lnk--> Abbassid caliph in <a href="../../wp/b/Baghdad.htm" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>, at sermon before Friday prayers, and the weight of authority simply deposed the old line. Now Saladin ruled Egypt, but officially as the representative of Nur ad-Din, who himself conventionally recognised the Abbassid caliph. Saladin revitalized the economy of <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, reorganized the military forces and, following his father&#39;s advice, stayed away from any conflicts with Nur ad-Din, his formal lord, after he had become the real ruler of Egypt. He waited until Nur ad-Din&#39;s death before starting serious military actions: at first against smaller Muslim states, then directing them against the Crusaders. With Nur ad-Din&#39;s death (<!--del_lnk--> 1174), he assumed the title of <a href="../../wp/s/Sultan.htm" title="Sultan">sultan</a> in Egypt. There he declared independence from the <!--del_lnk--> Seljuks, and he proved to be the founder of the <!--del_lnk--> Ayyubid dynasty and restored <!--del_lnk--> Sunnism in Egypt. He extended his territory westwards in the <a href="../../wp/m/Maghreb.htm" title="Maghreb">maghreb</a>, and when his uncle was sent up the <a href="../../wp/n/Nile.htm" title="Nile">Nile</a> to pacify some resistance of the former Fatimid supporters, he continued on down the <a href="../../wp/r/Red_Sea.htm" title="Red Sea">Red Sea</a> to conquer <a href="../../wp/y/Yemen.htm" title="Yemen">Yemen</a>. He is also regarded as a Waliullah which means the friend of God to the Sunni Muslims.<p><a id="Fighting_the_Crusaders" name="Fighting_the_Crusaders"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Fighting the Crusaders</span></h2>

      <p>On two occasions, in 1171 and 1173, Saladin retreated from an invasion of the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Jerusalem. These had been launched by Nur ad-Din, and Saladin hoped that the Crusader kingdom would remain intact, as a <!--del_lnk--> buffer state between Egypt and Syria, until Saladin could gain control of Syria as well. Nur ad-Din and Saladin were headed towards open war on these counts when Nur ad-Din died in 1174. Nur ad-Din&#39;s heir <!--del_lnk--> as-Salih Ismail al-Malik was a mere boy, in the hands of court eunuchs, and died in 1181.<p>Immediately after Nur ad-Din&#39;s death, Saladin marched on <a href="../../wp/d/Damascus.htm" title="Damascus">Damascus</a> and was welcomed into the city. He reinforced his legitimacy there in the time-honoured way -- by marrying Nur ad-Din&#39;s widow. <!--del_lnk--> Aleppo and <!--del_lnk--> Mosul, on the other hand, the two other largest cities that Nur ad-Din had ruled, were never taken, but Saladin managed to impose his influence and authority on them in 1176 and 1186 respectively. While he was occupied in besieging Aleppo, on <!--del_lnk--> May 22, <!--del_lnk--> 1176 the elite shadowy assassin group &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Hashshashins&quot; attempted to murder him.<p>While Saladin was consolidating his power in Syria, he usually left the Crusader kingdom alone, although he was generally victorious whenever he did meet the Crusaders in battle. One exception was the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Montgisard on <!--del_lnk--> November 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1177. He was defeated by the combined forces of <!--del_lnk--> Baldwin IV of Jerusalem, <!--del_lnk--> Raynald of Chatillon and the <!--del_lnk--> Knights Templar. Only one tenth of his army made it back to Egypt.<p>A truce was declared between Saladin and the Crusader States in 1178. Saladin spent the subsequent year recovering from his defeat and rebuilding his army, renewing his attacks in 1179 when he defeated the Crusaders at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Jacob&#39;s Ford. Crusader counter-attacks provoked further responses by Saladin. Raynald of Chatillon, in particular, harassed Muslim <!--del_lnk--> trading and <!--del_lnk--> pilgrimage routes with a fleet on the <a href="../../wp/r/Red_Sea.htm" title="Red Sea">Red Sea</a>, a water route that Saladin needed to keep open. Raynald threatened to attack the holy cities of <a href="../../wp/m/Mecca.htm" title="Mecca">Mecca</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Medina. In retaliation, Saladin <!--del_lnk--> besieged Kerak, Raynald&#39;s fortress in <!--del_lnk--> Oultrejordain, in 1183 and 1184. Raynald responded by looting a caravan of pilgrims on the <!--del_lnk--> Hajj in 1185.<p>In July, 1187, Saladin invaded the Kingdom of Jerusalem. On <!--del_lnk--> July 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1187, he faced at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Hattin the combined forces <!--del_lnk--> Guy of Lusignan, <!--del_lnk--> King consort of Jerusalem, and <!--del_lnk--> Raymond III of Tripoli. In the battle alone the Crusader army was largely annihilated by the motivated army of Saladin in what was a major disaster for the Crusaders and a turning point in the history of the Crusades. Saladin captured Raynald de Chatillon and was personally responsible for his <!--del_lnk--> execution. (According to the chronicle of <!--del_lnk--> Ernoul, Raynald had captured Saladin&#39;s so called &#39;sister&#39; in a raid on a caravan, although this is not attested in Muslim Sources. According to Muslim Sources, Saladin never had a &#39;sister,&#39; but only mentioned the term when referring to &#39;any&#39; fellow female Muslim woman.) Guy of Lusignan was also captured but his life was spared. Two days after the Battle of Hattin, Saladin ordered the execution of all prisoners of the military orders by beheading. According to Imad al-Din, Saladin watched the executions &ldquo;with a glad face.&rdquo; The execution of prisoners at Hattin was not the first by Saladin. On <!--del_lnk--> 29 August <!--del_lnk--> 1179, Saladin captured the castle at Bait al-Ahazon and approximately 700 prisoners were captured.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Soon Saladin had taken back almost every Crusader city. He recaptured <a href="../../wp/j/Jerusalem.htm" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> on <!--del_lnk--> October 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1187, after 88 years of Crusader rule (see <!--del_lnk--> Siege of Jerusalem). Saladin initially was unwilling to grant terms of quarter to the occupants of Jerusalem until <!--del_lnk--> Balian of Ibelin threatened to kill every Muslim in the city, estimated between 3,000 to 5,000, and to destroy Islam&rsquo;s holy shrines of the Dome of the Rock and the Aqsa Mosque if quarter was not given. Saladin consulted his council and these terms were accepted. Ransom was to be paid for each Frank in the city whether man, woman, or child. Saladin allowed many to leave without having the required amount for ransom for others. According to Imad al-Din, approximately 7,000 men and 8,000 women could not make their ransom and were taken into slavery.<p>Only <!--del_lnk--> Tyre held out. The city was now commanded by the formidable <!--del_lnk--> Conrad of Montferrat. He strengthened Tyre&#39;s defences and withstood two sieges by Saladin. In 1188, Saladin released Guy of Lusignan and returned him to his wife <!--del_lnk--> Queen regnant <!--del_lnk--> Sibylla of Jerusalem. Both rulers were allowed to seek refuge at Tyre, but were turned away by Conrad, who did not recognise Guy as King. Guy then set about besieging <!--del_lnk--> Acre (see <!--del_lnk--> Siege of Acre).<p>Hattin and the fall of Jerusalem prompted the <!--del_lnk--> Third Crusade, financed in England by a special &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Saladin tithe&quot;. This Crusade took back Acre, and Saladin&#39;s army met King <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_I_of_England.htm" title="Richard I of England">Richard I of England</a> at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Arsuf on <!--del_lnk--> September 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1191 at which Saladin was defeated. Saladin&#39;s relationship with Richard was one of chivalrous mutual respect as well as military rivalry; both were celebrated in the <!--del_lnk--> courtly romances that developed in <!--del_lnk--> Northern Europe. When Richard was wounded, Saladin offered the services of his personal physician. At Arsuf, when Richard lost his horse, Saladin sent him two replacements. Saladin also sent him fresh fruit with snow, to keep his drinks cold. Richard had suggested to Saladin that his sister could marry Saladin&#39;s brother - and Jerusalem could be their wedding gift.<p>The two came to an agreement over Jerusalem in the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Ramla in 1192, whereby the city would remain in Muslim hands but would be open to Christian <!--del_lnk--> pilgrimages; the treaty reduced the Latin Kingdom to a strip along the coast from Tyre to <!--del_lnk--> Jaffa.<p>Saladin died on <!--del_lnk--> March 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1193 at <a href="../../wp/d/Damascus.htm" title="Damascus">Damascus</a>, not long after Richard&#39;s departure. When they opened Saladin&#39;s treasury they found there was not enough money to pay for his funeral; he had given most of his money away in charity. His tomb is in Damascus, at the <!--del_lnk--> Umayyad Mosque, and is a popular attraction.<p><a id="Recognition" name="Recognition"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Recognition</span></h2>
      <p>Despite his fierce struggle to the Christian incursion, Saladin achieved a great reputation in Europe as a <!--del_lnk--> chivalrous <!--del_lnk--> knight, so much so that there existed by the fourteenth century an <!--del_lnk--> epic poem about his exploits, and <a href="../../wp/d/Dante_Alighieri.htm" title="Dante Alighieri">Dante</a> included him among the virtuous <!--del_lnk--> pagan <!--del_lnk--> souls in <!--del_lnk--> Limbo. The noble Saladin appears in a sympathetic light in Sir <a href="../../wp/w/Walter_Scott.htm" title="Walter Scott">Walter Scott</a>&#39;s <i>The Talisman</i> (1825). Despite the Crusaders&#39; slaughter when they originally conquered Jerusalem in 1099, Saladin granted amnesty and free passage to all common <!--del_lnk--> Catholics and even to the defeated Christian army, as long as they were able to pay the aforementioned ransom (the <a href="../../wp/e/Eastern_Orthodox_Church.htm" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Greek Orthodox</a> Christians were treated even better, because they often opposed the western Crusaders). An interesting view of Salah ad-Din and the world in which he lived is provided by Tariq Ali&#39;s novel <i>The Book of Saladin</i> (London: Verso, 1998).<p>Despite the differences in beliefs, the Muslim Saladin was respected by Christian lords, Richard especially. Richard once praised Saladin as a great prince, saying that he was without doubt the greatest and most powerful leader in the Islamic world. Saladin in turn stated that there was not a more honorable Christian lord than Richard. After the treaty, Saladin and Richard sent each other many gifts as tokens of respect, but never met face to face.<p>The name <i>Salah ad-Din</i> means &quot;Righteousness of Faith&quot;, and through the ages Saladin has been an inspiration for Muslims in many respects. Modern Muslim rulers have sought to capitalise on the reputation of Saladin. A <!--del_lnk--> governorate centred around Tikrit in modern <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq.htm" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Salah ad Din, is named after Saladin, as is <!--del_lnk--> Salahaddin University in <!--del_lnk--> Arbil.<p>Few structures associated with Saladin survive within modern cities. Saladin first fortified the <!--del_lnk--> Citadel of Cairo (1175 - 1183), which had been a domed pleasure pavilion with a fine view in more peaceful times. In Syria even the smallest cities centred on a defensible <!--del_lnk--> citadel, and Saladin introduced this essential feature to Egypt.<p>Among the forts he built was Qalaat Al-Gindi, a mountaintop fortress and <!--del_lnk--> caravanserai in the <!--del_lnk--> Sinai. The fortress overlooks a large <!--del_lnk--> wadi which was the convergence of several caravan routes that linked Egypt and the Middle East. Inside the structure are a number of large vaulted rooms hewn out of rock, including the remains of shops and a water cistern. A notable archaeological site, it was investigated in 1909 by a French team under <!--del_lnk--> Jules Barthoux.<!--del_lnk--> <p>According to The French Writer Rene Grousse:<p>&quot;It is equally true that his generosity, his piety, devoid of fanaticism, that flower of liberality and courtesy which had been the model of our old chroniclers, won him no less popularity in Frankish Syria than in the lands of Islam&quot;<p>Renee Grousse The Epic of the Crusades Orion Press 1970 Translated from the French by Noel Lindsay<p><a id="Burial_site" name="Burial_site"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Burial site</span></h2>
