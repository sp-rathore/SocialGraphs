      <p>Suleiman was born at Trabzon in modern day Turkey. At the age of seven he was sent to study science, history, literature, theology, and military techniques in the schools of the <a href="../../wp/i/Istanbul.htm" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> palace, and as a young man maintained a close friendship with <!--del_lnk--> Pargal&#x131; &#x130;brahim Pasha, a slave who would become one of his most trusted advisors.<p>Suleiman&#39;s early experience of government was as governor of several provinces, most notably Bolu in northern <!--del_lnk--> Anatolia, and his mother&#39;s homeland of <!--del_lnk--> Caffa in <!--del_lnk--> Crimea.<p>During the rule of his father, <!--del_lnk--> Selim I (1512&ndash;20), the Ottoman Empire destroyed the rival <!--del_lnk--> Mamluk Sultanate, which led to the annexation of <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Palestine and <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, and conquered the holy cities of <a href="../../wp/m/Mecca.htm" title="Mecca">Mecca</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Medina. Selim claimed the title of the <i>Khadim ul Haremeyn</i>, &quot;The Servant of The Two Holy Shrines&quot;, (the <!--del_lnk--> Great Mosque in Mecca and the <!--del_lnk--> Mosque of the Prophet in Medina, the holiest places in Islam), and also claimed to be the <!--del_lnk--> Caliph, the &quot;guardian of Islam&quot; considered to be the chief civil and religious ruler of all <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a>, both Shi&#39;ite and Sunni. Selim also subjugated <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Persia</a>, whose ruler <!--del_lnk--> Shah Ismail (1501&ndash;24) also claimed to be the Caliph, and captured Egypt along with <!--del_lnk--> Al-Mutawakkil III (1509&ndash;17), the last Caliph of the <a href="../../wp/a/Abbasid.htm" title="Abbasid">Abbasid dynasty</a>, enabling Selim to acquire the emblems of the Caliph, the sword and the mantle of the Prophet Muhammad.<p>Thus, at the age of 26, upon the death of his father, Suleiman ruled a substantially more powerful Empire and Sultanate, which he would continue to expand until his death in <!--del_lnk--> 1566.<p><a id="Military_Achievements" name="Military_Achievements"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Military Achievements</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Capture_of_Belgrade" name="Capture_of_Belgrade"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Capture of Belgrade</span></h3>
      <p>Upon succeeding his father, Suleiman began a series of military conquests, first putting down a revolt led by the Ottoman-appointed governor of <a href="../../wp/d/Damascus.htm" title="Damascus">Damascus</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1521. By August, <!--del_lnk--> 1521, he had completed the capture of the city of <!--del_lnk--> Belgrade from The <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Hungary, penetrating deeper into the heart of <!--del_lnk--> Central Europe.<p><a id="Rebuilding_of_the_walls_of_Jerusalem" name="Rebuilding_of_the_walls_of_Jerusalem"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem</span></h3>
      <p>By <!--del_lnk--> 1517 the Islamic Ottoman Empire, ruled by Selim I, took <!--del_lnk--> Palestine from the Egyptian <!--del_lnk--> Mamelukes. Suleiman was so taken with the city of <a href="../../wp/j/Jerusalem.htm" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and its plight (having suffered centuries of neglect under Mameluke rule), that he ordered the construction of a magnificent surrounding fortress-wall that still stands around the <!--del_lnk--> Old City.<p><a id="Rhodes" name="Rhodes"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Rhodes</span></h3>
      <p>Selim had planned to assault the <!--del_lnk--> Christian stronghold of <!--del_lnk--> Rhodes prior to his death. In <!--del_lnk--> 1522, Suleiman accomplished his father&#39;s goal as 400 ships delivered 200,000 men to the island. Against this force the <!--del_lnk--> Knights of St. John had about 7,000 men-at-arms, and the walls of the city. The resulting siege lasted six months, at the end of which Suleiman I permitted the survivors to leave and retreat to the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Sicily. In exchange, the Knights promised to leave Suleiman&#39;s subjects in peace; a promise they would soon violate.<p><a id="Hungary" name="Hungary"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Hungary</span></h3>

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> August 29, <!--del_lnk--> 1526 Suleiman I defeated <!--del_lnk--> Louis II of Hungary (1516&ndash;26) at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Moh&aacute;cs, and Ottoman forces occupied most of <a href="../../wp/h/Hungary.htm" title="Hungary">Hungary</a> in 1541. Louis was killed, and upon encountering the lifeless body of the twenty-year-old King, Suleiman is said to have lamented, &quot;I came in arms against him but it was not my wish that he should be thus cut off while he scarcely tasted the sweets of life and royalty.&quot;. (Severy, p. 580)<p>Under the Ottoman attacks central authority collapsed and a power struggle ensued, with some Hungarian nobles proposing that <!--del_lnk--> Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria (1519&ndash;64), who was ruler of neighbouring <a href="../../wp/a/Austria.htm" title="Austria">Austria</a> and tied to Louis II&#39;s family by marriage, be King of Hungary, citing previous agreements that the Habsburgs would take the Hungarian throne if Louis died without heirs. However, other nobles turned to the nobleman <!--del_lnk--> John Z&aacute;polya, who was supported by Suleiman, and who remained unrecognized by the Christian powers of Europe. A three-sided conflict ensued as Ferdinand moved to assert his rule over as much of the Hungarian kingdom as he could, resulting in a three-way partition of the Kingdom by 1541: Suleiman claimed most of present-day Hungary, known as the <!--del_lnk--> Great Alf&ouml;ld, for the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, and installed Z&aacute;polya&#39;s family as rulers of the independent principality of <!--del_lnk--> Transylvania, a <!--del_lnk--> vassal state of the Empire. Ferdinand claimed &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Royal Hungary&quot;, including present-day <a href="../../wp/s/Slovakia.htm" title="Slovakia">Slovakia</a>, western <a href="../../wp/c/Croatia.htm" title="Croatia">Croatia</a>, and adjacent territories, temporarily fixing the border between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans.<p>Under <!--del_lnk--> Charles V and his brother Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria, the Habsburgs took Hungary. Suleiman twice re-invaded, but was repulsed after <!--del_lnk--> besieging Vienna in <!--del_lnk--> 1529 and <!--del_lnk--> 1532. In 1533 a treaty was signed with Ferdinand, splitting Hungary between the Habsburgs and Zapolya, but on Zapolya&#39;s death, Ferdinand was left the Hungarian territories, prompting another struggle to annex Hungary and several peace treaties restoring the status-quo.<p><a id="Persia" name="Persia"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Persia</span></h3>

      <p>As conflict raged along the European borders of Suleiman&#39;s domain, success continued on another front: the longstanding rivalry with the <!--del_lnk--> Shi&#39;a <!--del_lnk--> Safavid dynasty of <!--del_lnk--> Persia (<a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a>). Suleiman waged three campaigns against the <!--del_lnk--> Safavids. In the earliest, the historically important city of <a href="../../wp/b/Baghdad.htm" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> fell to his forces in <!--del_lnk--> 1534, and the city, once the most populous in the Middle East, fell into decline, eclipsed by the growing population and wealth of the Sultan&#39;s <a href="../../wp/i/Istanbul.htm" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>.<p>The second campaign, <!--del_lnk--> 1548&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 1549, resulted in temporary Ottoman gains in <!--del_lnk--> Tabriz and <a href="../../wp/a/Azerbaijan.htm" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>, and a lasting presence in the province of <!--del_lnk--> Van, and some forts in <a href="../../wp/g/Georgia_%2528country%2529.htm" title="Georgia (country)">Georgia</a>.<p>In his third campaign, in <!--del_lnk--> 1555, his forces failed to eliminate the <!--del_lnk--> Shah&#39;s army, which withdrew into the mountains of Luristan, and eventually signed a <!--del_lnk--> treaty at <!--del_lnk--> Amasya, in which the Shah recognized the existing borders and promised to end his raids into Ottoman territory.<p><a id="North_Africa_and_the_Middle_East" name="North_Africa_and_the_Middle_East"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">North Africa and the Middle East</span></h3>
      <p>Huge territories of <a href="../../wp/n/North_Africa.htm" title="North Africa">North Africa</a> east to <a href="../../wp/m/Morocco.htm" title="Morocco">Morocco</a> were annexed. The <!--del_lnk--> Barbary States of <!--del_lnk--> Tripolitania, <a href="../../wp/t/Tunisia.htm" title="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Algeria.htm" title="Algeria">Algeria</a>, and <a href="../../wp/m/Morocco.htm" title="Morocco">Morocco</a> became autonomous provinces of the Empire, and served as the leading edge of Suleiman&#39;s conflict with Charles V, whose attempt to drive out the Turks failed in 1541. The piracy carried on thereafter by the <!--del_lnk--> Barbary pirates of North Africa remained part of the wars against Spain, and the Ottoman expansion was associated with naval dominance for a short period in the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>.<p>Ottoman navies also controlled the <a href="../../wp/r/Red_Sea.htm" title="Red Sea">Red Sea</a>, and held the <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Gulf.htm" title="Persian Gulf">Persian Gulf</a> until <!--del_lnk--> 1554, when their ships were defeated by the navy of the <!--del_lnk--> Portuguese Empire. The Portuguese would continue to contest Suleiman I&#39;s forces for control of <!--del_lnk--> Aden.<p><a id="Tunis" name="Tunis"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Tunis</span></h3>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1533 <!--del_lnk--> Khair ad Din known to Europeans as <!--del_lnk--> Barbarossa, was made Admiral-in-Chief of the Ottoman navies which were actively fighting the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish navy. In <!--del_lnk--> 1535 the Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V (Charles I of Spain, ruled 1516&ndash;56)) won an important victory against the Ottomans at <a href="../../wp/t/Tunis.htm" title="Tunis">Tunis</a>, but in <!--del_lnk--> 1536 Francis I of France allied himself with Suleiman against Charles. In <!--del_lnk--> 1538, the Spanish fleet was defeated at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Preveza by Khair ad Din, securing the eastern Mediterranean for the Turks for 33 years (1538&ndash;71).<p>Francis I was persuaded to sign a peace treaty with Charles V in <!--del_lnk--> 1538, however he again allied himself with the Suleiman in <!--del_lnk--> 1542. In <!--del_lnk--> 1543 Charles allied himself with <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_VIII_of_England.htm" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII of England</a> and forced Francis to sign the <!--del_lnk--> Truce of Crepy-en-Laonnois. Charles signed a humilating treaty with Suleiman to gain some respite from the huge expenses of the war.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1544, when <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> declared war on <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, the French King Francis asked for help from Suleiman. He then sent a fleet headed by Khair ad Din who was victorious over the Spaniards, and managed to retake <!--del_lnk--> Naples from them. Suleiman bestowed on him the title of <i>Baylar Bey</i> (Commander General). One result of the alliance was the fierce sea duel between <!--del_lnk--> Dragut and <!--del_lnk--> Andrea Doria, which left the northern Mediterranean European and the southern Mediterranean in Islamic hands.<p><a id="Malta.2C_a_turning_point" name="Malta.2C_a_turning_point"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Malta, a turning point</span></h3>

      <p>When the Knights Hospitallers were re-established as the <!--del_lnk--> Knights of Malta in <!--del_lnk--> 1530, their actions against Muslim navies quickly drew the ire of the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottomans</a>, who assembled another massive army in order to dislodge the Knights from Malta. In <!--del_lnk--> 1565 they invaded, starting the <!--del_lnk--> Great Siege of Malta, which began on May 18 and lasted until September 8, and is portrayed vividly in the frescoes of <!--del_lnk--> Matteo Perez d&#39;Aleccio in the <!--del_lnk--> Hall of St. Michael and St. George. At first the battle looked to be a repeat of the one on Rhodes, with most of the cities destroyed and about half the Knights killed in battle, but a relief force from <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> entered the battle, resulting in the loss of 30,000 Ottoman troops.<p>After this Suleiman turned his eye to <a href="../../wp/h/Hungary.htm" title="Hungary">Hungary</a> again. He died of a <a href="../../wp/s/Stroke.htm" title="Stroke">stroke</a> during the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Szigetv&aacute;r in Szigetv&aacute;r, Hungary, (1566, September 5 or 6).<p><a id="The_lawgiver" name="The_lawgiver"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The lawgiver</span></h2>
      <p>&quot;The primacy of Suleiman as a law-giver is at the foundation of his place in Islamic history and world view.&quot;. The Ottomans called Suleiman <i>Kanuni</i>, or &quot;The Lawgiver,&quot; and the inscription on the Suleymanie Mosque constructed for him, describes him as <i>Nashiru kawanin al-Sultaniyye</i>, or &quot;Propagator of the Sultanic Laws,&quot; based on Suleiman&#39;s revision and application of Sultanic &quot;<!--del_lnk--> kanun&quot; laws used in situations not explicitly covered under Islamic <!--del_lnk--> Shari&#39;ah: &quot;In Islamic tradition, if a case fell outside the parameters of the Shari&#39;ah, then a judgement or rule in the case could be arrived at through analogy with rules or cases that are covered by the Shari&#39;ah... [a] method of juridical thinking... accepted by the most liberal school of Shari&#39;ah, <!--del_lnk--> Hanifism&quot;, which &quot;dominated Ottoman law&quot;. After Suleiman the Kanun laws attained their final form, and the code of laws became known as the <i>kanun-i Osmani</i>, the &quot;Ottoman laws&quot;.<p><a id="Justice_and_equity" name="Justice_and_equity"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Justice and equity</span></h3>
      <p>Suleiman was renowned as a just and fair ruler, choosing his subordinates according to merit rather than social status or popularity. The Austrian Ambassador, Ghiselain de Busbecq, wrote of him, &quot;In making his appointments, the Sultan pays no regard to any pretensions on the score of wealth or rank, nor does he take into consideration recommendations or popularity; he considers each case on its own merits, and examines carefully into the character, ability and disposition of the man whose promotion is in question.&quot;.<p>In 1553 Suleiman declared a law to stop the persecution of Jews via <!--del_lnk--> Blood libels, decreeing that all accusations of the slaughter of Christian children by Jews be referred to the Imperial Divan where the courts would expose these lies. The preparation of the law included the input of Moses Hamon, a favorite doctor and dentist of the Sultan. Another symbol of the Muslim-<a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> tolerance was the building of a <!--del_lnk--> synagogue and <a href="../../wp/m/Mosque.htm" title="Mosque">mosque</a> which was built by Suleiman.<p><a id="Cultural_Achievements" name="Cultural_Achievements"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Cultural Achievements</span></h2>
      <p>Under Suleiman&#39;s rule, hundreds of imperial artistic societies (called the <i>Ehl-i Hiref</i>, &quot;Community of the Talented&quot;) were administered at the Imperial seat, the <!--del_lnk--> Topkapi Palace.<p>After an apprenticeship, artists and craftsmen could advance in rank within their field and were paid commensurate wages in quarterly annual installments. Payroll registers that survive testify to the breadth of Suleiman&#39;s patronage of the arts: &quot;The earliest document, drawn up in 1526, lists 40 societies with over 600 members; by the 17th century the number of societies had increased and their membership had risen to some 2,000. In addition to the artists employed in the imperial societies, Istanbul, like all the major centers of the empire, had diverse guilds of artisans which supplied both domestic and foreign needs.&quot;<p><a id="The_Poet" name="The_Poet"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Poet</span></h3>

Gibb wrote that &quot;at no time, even in Turkey, was greater encouragement given to poetry than during the reign of this Sultan.&quot;<p>Some of Suleiman&#39;s verses, composed under the <!--del_lnk--> nom de plume <i>&quot;Muhibbi&quot;</i>, have become Turkish proverbs, including the well-known &quot;Everyone aims at the same meaning, but many are the versions of the story,&quot; and &quot;In this world a spell of good health is the best state.&quot;. He wrote in Turkish, Persian, and Arabic.<dl>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Diwani is a <!--del_lnk--> calligraphic variety of <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> script, a <!--del_lnk--> cursive style developed by <!--del_lnk--> Housam Roumi that reached the height of its popularity under Suleiman&#39;s reign. It was used in the Ottoman <!--del_lnk--> divan for the writing of all royal <!--del_lnk--> decrees, <!--del_lnk--> endowments, and <!--del_lnk--> resolutions, and was one of the secrets of the Sultan&#39;s palace: the rules of this script were not known to everyone, but confined to its masters and a few bright students.<center><a class="image" href="../../images/278/27841.png.htm" title="Diwani font"><img alt="Diwani font" height="105" longdesc="/wiki/Image:Diwani.png" src="../../images/278/27841.png" width="390" /></a></center>

      <p>Some Christian slaves in the Ottoman Empire under Suleiman rose to positions of great prominence. <!--del_lnk--> Ibrahim Pasha became <!--del_lnk--> Grand Vizier for thirteen years.<p>Suleiman continued the policy of religious tolerance toward <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jews">Jews</a> initiated by <!--del_lnk--> Bayezid II (1481&ndash;1512), who had welcomed Jews expelled from <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1492.<p>In a letter to <!--del_lnk--> Pope Paul IV (1555&ndash;59) in <!--del_lnk--> 1556, Suleiman asked for the immediate release of the <!--del_lnk--> Ancona Marranos, who faced persecution after falling under Papal authority; Suleiman declared them to be Ottoman citizens. The Pope had no alternative but to release them, thus demonstrating the influence of the Ottoman Empire. Suleiman also employed a Jewish personal <!--del_lnk--> physician, <!--del_lnk--> Rabbi <!--del_lnk--> Moshe Hamon.<p>In the city of Jerusalem, the rule of Suleiman and the following Ottoman Sultans brought an age of religious peace; Jews, Christians and Muslims enjoyed the freedom of religion that the Ottomans granted them and it was possible to find a synagogue, a church and a mosque in the same street. The city remained open to all three religions.<p><a id="Relationship_with_Ibrahim_Pasha" name="Relationship_with_Ibrahim_Pasha"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Relationship with Ibrahim Pasha</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Pargal&#x131; &#x130;brahim Pasha was the boyhood friend of Suleiman. As the Sultan&#39;s male favorite, he shared Suleiman&#39;s quarters and his tent while at home and on campaign. Suleiman made him the royal falconer, then promoted him to first officer of the Royal Bedchamber, which was most irregular. Eventually, Ibrahim Pasha became the <!--del_lnk--> Grand Vizier and commander-in-chief of all the armies.<p>There have been scholars that have suggested that the two men may have shared an intimate relationship, which is quite contrary to both Islam and Turkish culture. Eventually Ibrahim may have become too close to the Sultan and may have attained too much power, because Suleiman eventually had him killed, presumably to keep him silent about the true nature of their relationship. This theory would fit with characteristics of Suleiman&#39;s personality. Ibrahim was Greek and not originally Muslim, though he did convert. Suleiman repeatedly was attracted and infatuated with the foreign and the unusual, see Roxelana, who was ethnically Slavic and religiously Orthodox.<p><a id="Relationship_with_Roxelana" name="Relationship_with_Roxelana"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Relationship with Roxelana</span></h2>

      <p>Anastasia Lisovska, also known as <!--del_lnk--> Roxelana or H&uuml;rrem, a captured daughter of an <a href="../../wp/e/Eastern_Orthodox_Church.htm" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Orthodox</a> priest (from Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), rose through the ranks of the <!--del_lnk--> Harem to become Suleiman&#39;s favorite wife, to the surprise of the Empire and the international community. Breaking with 300 years of Ottoman tradition, Suleiman married Roxelana in a formal ceremony, making her the first former slave to gain legitimacy as the Sultan&#39;s legal wife.<p>By her he had one daughter, <!--del_lnk--> Mihrimar (<i>Mihrum&acirc;h</i>), and the sons Mehmed (who died young), Selim (later Sultan <!--del_lnk--> Selim II (1566&ndash;74)), Bayezid and Cihangir (born physically disabled). He allowed her to remain with him at court for the rest of her life, despite another tradition that when imperial heirs became of age, they would be sent along with the imperial concubine who bore them to govern remote provinces of the Empire, never to return unless their progeny succeeded to the throne.<p>He composed this poem for Roxelana:<dl>
       <dd><i>&quot;Throne of my lonely niche, my wealth, my love, my moonlight.</i><dd><i>My most sincere friend, my confidant, my very existence, my Sultan</i><dd><i>The most beautiful among the beautiful...</i><dd><i>My springtime, my merry faced love, my daytime, my sweetheart, laughing leaf...</i><dd><i>My plants, my sweet, my rose, the one only who does not distress me in this world...</i><dd><i>My Istanbul, my Caraman, the earth of my Anatolia</i><dd><i>My Badakhshan, my Baghdad and Khorasan</i><dd><i>My woman of the beautiful hair, my love of the slanted brow, my love of eyes full of mischief...</i><dd><i>I&#39;ll sing your praises always</i><dd><i>I, lover of the tormented heart, Muhibbi of the eyes full of tears, I am happy</i>.&quot;</dl>

      <p>Suleiman&#39;s son <!--del_lnk--> Mustafa, by his consort the Sultana &quot;Rose of Spring,&quot; preceded Roxelana&#39;s children in the order of succession, and was supported by <!--del_lnk--> Pargal&#x131; &#x130;brahim Pasha, who was by this time Suleiman&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Grand Vizier. In power struggles apparently instigated by Roxelana, Suleiman had Ibrahim murdered and replaced with her son-in-law, Rustem Pasha. Later, Suleiman, apparently believing that Mustafa&#39;s popularity with the <!--del_lnk--> army threatened his own position, had Mustafa strangled.<p>Suleiman&#39;s son Bayezid suppressed a major revolt in <!--del_lnk--> Macedonia and <!--del_lnk--> Thrace, led by a man purporting to be Suleiman&#39;s son Mustafa: &quot;This Mustafa gathered around him discontented holders of timars (military fiefs), peasants, and members of the religious establishment unhappy with the dominance of the devshirme (slave) class in Istanbul.&quot; The pretender was executed after the revolt failed.<p>In anticipation of Suleiman&#39;s death, in <!--del_lnk--> 1559 his sons by Roxelana, Selim and Bayezid, engaged in a series of battles for the succession, in part, due to the Ottoman practice of <!--del_lnk--> fratricide of rival successors, in which one of the two would be ordered strangled. The resultant turmoil led Suleiman to order the death of Bayezid on <!--del_lnk--> September 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1561, after he was repatriated by the Shah of <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Empire.htm" title="Persian Empire">Persia</a>, after having fled there for protection, leaving Suleiman&#39;s son Selim the <!--del_lnk--> heir presumptive.<p>Suleiman&#39;s Grand <!--del_lnk--> Vizier <!--del_lnk--> Mehmed-pa&scaron;a Sokolovi&#x107; was a <!--del_lnk--> Serbian convert from <a href="../../wp/b/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina.htm" title="Bosnia and Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>.
