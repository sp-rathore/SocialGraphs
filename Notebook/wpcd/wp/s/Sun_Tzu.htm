      <p>The only surviving source on the life of Sun Tzu is the biography written in the <!--del_lnk--> 2nd century BC by the historian <!--del_lnk--> Sima Qian, who describes him as a general who lived in the <!--del_lnk--> state of Wu in the <!--del_lnk--> 6th century BC, and therefore a contemporary of one of the great Chinese thinkers of ancient times&mdash;<a href="../../wp/c/Confucius.htm" title="Confucius">Confucius</a>. According to tradition, Sun Tzu was a member of the landless Chinese aristocracy, the <i>shi</i>, descendants of nobility who had lost their dukedoms during the consolidation of the <!--del_lnk--> Spring and Autumn Period. Unlike most <i>shi</i>, who were traveling academics, Sun Tzu worked as a mercenary. According to tradition, <!--del_lnk--> King Hel&uuml; of Wu hired Sun Tzu as a general approximately 512 BC after finishing his military treatise, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Bing Fa</i> (<i>The Art of War</i>). After his hiring, the kingdom of Wu, previously considered a semi-barbaric state, went on to become the most powerful state of the period by conquering Chu, one of the most powerful states in the Spring and Autumn Period. Sun Tzu suddenly disappeared when King Helu finally conquered Chu. Therefore his date of death remained unknown. The title <i>Bing Fa</i> can be translated as &quot;military methods&quot;, &quot;army procedures&quot;, or &quot;martial arts&quot;. Around 298 B.C., the historian Zhuang Zi, writing in the state of Zhao, recorded that Sun Tzu&rsquo;s theory had been incorporated into the martial arts techniques of both offense and defense and of both armed and unarmed combat. His <i>Bing Fa</i> was the philosophical basis of what we now know as the <!--del_lnk--> Asian martial arts.<p>The historicity of Sun Tzu is discussed extensively in the introduction to <!--del_lnk--> Lionel Giles&#39; 1910 translation of <i>The Art of War</i> available as a <!--del_lnk--> Project Gutenberg online text. In Giles&#39; introduction to his translation, he expands on the doubt and confusion which has surrounded the historicity of Sun Tzu.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1972 a set of bamboo engraved texts were discovered in a grave near Linyi in Shandong. These have helped to confirm parts of the text which were already known and have also added new sections. This version has been dated to between 134&ndash;118 BC, and so rules out older theories that parts of the text had been written much later.<p><!--del_lnk--> Sun Bin, also known as Sun the Mutilated, allegedly a crippled descendent of Sun Tzu, also wrote a text known as the <i>Art of War</i>. A more accurate title might be the <i>Art of Warfare</i> since this was more directly concerned with the practical matters of warfare, rather than military strategy. At least one translator has used the title <i>The Lost Art of War</i>, referring to the long period of time during which Sun Bin&#39;s book was lost. There is, however, no commonality between the content or writing style in Sun Bin and Sun Tzu.<p><i>The Art of War</i> has been one of the most popular combat collections in history. Ancient Chinese have long viewed this book as one of the entrance test materials, and it is one of the most important collections of books in the Chinese literature. It is said that <a href="../../wp/m/Mao_Zedong.htm" title="Mao Zedong">Mao Zedong</a> and <a href="../../wp/j/Joseph_Stalin.htm" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> both read this book while in war.<p>Sun Tzu also is rumored to be an ancestor of <!--del_lnk--> Sun Quan, the founder of the <!--del_lnk--> Wu Kingdom, which was one of the three competing dynasties during the <!--del_lnk--> Three Kingdoms era. <p><a id="Books_written_by_Sun_Tzu" name="Books_written_by_Sun_Tzu"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Books written by Sun Tzu</span></h2>
