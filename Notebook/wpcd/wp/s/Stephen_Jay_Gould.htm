      <p>Gould was born and raised in the <!--del_lnk--> Queens <!--del_lnk--> borough of <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a>, <!--del_lnk--> New York. His father Leonard was a <!--del_lnk--> court stenographer, and his mother Eleanor was an <!--del_lnk--> artist. When Gould was five years old, his father took him to the Hall of Dinosaurs in the <!--del_lnk--> American Museum of Natural History, where he first met <i><a href="../../wp/t/Tyrannosaurus.htm" title="Tyrannosaurus rex">Tyrannosaurus rex</a></i>. &quot;I had no idea there were such things&mdash;I was awestruck,&quot; Gould once recalled.<small></small> In that moment he decided to become a paleontologist.<p>Raised in a <!--del_lnk--> nominally <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jew">Jewish</a> home, Gould did not formally practice organized <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religion</a> and preferred to be called an <!--del_lnk--> agnostic.<small></small> Politically, though he &quot;had been brought up by a Marxist father,&quot; he is quoted as saying that his father&#39;s politics were &quot;very different&quot; from his own.<small></small> Throughout his career and writings he spoke out against <a href="../../wp/o/Oppression.htm" title="Oppression">cultural oppression</a> in all its forms, especially what he saw as <!--del_lnk--> pseudoscience in the service of <!--del_lnk--> racism and <!--del_lnk--> sexism. In the early <!--del_lnk--> 1970s Gould joined a group called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Science for the People,&quot; which was a left-wing organization that emerged from the <!--del_lnk--> antiwar movement.<p>Gould was twice married. His first marriage, to Deborah Lee in <!--del_lnk--> 1965 ended in divorce. His second marriage was to artist Rhonda Roland Shearer in <!--del_lnk--> 1995. Gould had two children, Jesse and Ethan, by his first marriage, and two stepchildren, Jade and London, by his second.<p>In July <!--del_lnk--> 1982 Gould was diagnosed with <!--del_lnk--> abdominal <!--del_lnk--> mesothelioma, an often terminal form of cancer affecting the abdominal lining (which is sometimes caused by <!--del_lnk--> asbestos exposure). After a difficult recovery, Gould published a column for <!--del_lnk--> <i>Discover</i> magazine, titled <!--del_lnk--> &quot;The Median Isn&#39;t the Message,&quot; in which he discusses his discovery that <!--del_lnk--> mesothelioma patients had a median lifespan of only eight months after diagnosis. He then describes the true significance behind this number, and his relief upon realizing that <a href="../../wp/s/Statistics.htm" title="Statistics">statistics</a> are just useful abstractions, not destiny. After an experimental treatment of radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery, Gould lived for another twenty years, and his column became a source of comfort for many cancer patients.<p>Gould was also an advocate for <!--del_lnk--> medical marijuana. During his bout with <!--del_lnk--> abdominal mesothelioma, he smoked the illegal drug to alleviate the nausea associated with his cancer treatments. According to Gould, his use of <!--del_lnk--> marijuana had the &quot;most important effect&quot; on his eventual recovery.<small></small> In <!--del_lnk--> 1998 he testified in the case of Jim Wakeford, a Canadian medical-marijuana user and activist.<p>Stephen Jay Gould died on <!--del_lnk--> May 20, <!--del_lnk--> 2002 from a <!--del_lnk--> metastatic <!--del_lnk--> adenocarcinoma of the <!--del_lnk--> lung (a form of <a href="../../wp/l/Lung_cancer.htm" title="Lung cancer">lung cancer</a>, which had spread to his brain). This cancer was unrelated to his <!--del_lnk--> abdominal mesothelioma, from which he had fully recovered twenty years earlier. He died in his home &quot;in a bed set up in the library of his <!--del_lnk--> Soho loft, surrounded by his wife Rhonda, his mother Eleanor, and the many books he loved.&quot; <p><a id="Gould_as_a_scientist" name="Gould_as_a_scientist"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Gould as a scientist</span></h2>
      <p>Gould began his higher education at <!--del_lnk--> Antioch College, a distinguished <!--del_lnk--> liberal arts school in <!--del_lnk--> Ohio, graduating with a degree in <a href="../../wp/g/Geology.htm" title="Geology">geology</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1963. During this time he also studied abroad at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Leeds in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>.<small></small> After completing his graduate work at <!--del_lnk--> Columbia University in <!--del_lnk--> 1967 under the guidance of <!--del_lnk--> Norman Newell, he was immediately hired by <!--del_lnk--> Harvard University where he worked until the end of his life (<!--del_lnk--> 1967-<!--del_lnk--> 2002). In <!--del_lnk--> 1973 Harvard promoted him to Professor of Geology and <!--del_lnk--> Curator of <!--del_lnk--> Invertebrate Paleontology at the institution&#39;s Museum of Comparative Zoology, and in <!--del_lnk--> 1982 he was awarded the title of <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology. In <!--del_lnk--> 1983 he was awarded fellowship into the <!--del_lnk--> American Association for the Advancement of Science, where he later served as president (<!--del_lnk--> 1999-<!--del_lnk--> 2001). The AAAS news release cited his &quot;numerous contributions to both scientific progress and the public understanding of science.&quot; He also served as president of the Paleontological Society (<!--del_lnk--> 1985-<!--del_lnk--> 1986) and the Society for the Study of Evolution (<!--del_lnk--> 1990-<!--del_lnk--> 1991). In <!--del_lnk--> 1989 Gould was elected into the body of the <!--del_lnk--> National Academy of Sciences. He was also <!--del_lnk--> Vincent Astor Visiting Research Professor of Biology at <!--del_lnk--> New York University from <!--del_lnk--> 1996-<!--del_lnk--> 2002.<p>Most of Gould&#39;s empirical research was on land snails. His early work was on the <a href="../../wp/b/Bermuda.htm" title="Bermuda">Bermudian</a> genus <!--del_lnk--> <i>Poecilozonites</i>, while his later work concentrated on the <!--del_lnk--> West Indian genus <i>Cerion</i>.<p>Early in his career Gould developed with <!--del_lnk--> Niles Eldredge the theory of <a href="../../wp/p/Punctuated_equilibrium.htm" title="Punctuated equilibrium">punctuated equilibrium</a>, where evolutionary change occurs relatively rapidly to comparatively longer periods of evolutionary stability. According to Gould, punctuated equilibrium revised a key pillar &quot;in the central logic of <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">Darwinian theory</a>.&quot;<small></small> Some evolutionary biologists have argued that while punctuated equilibrium was &quot;of great interest to biology,&quot;<small></small> it merely modified <!--del_lnk--> neo-Darwinism in a manner which was fully compatible with what had been known before.<small></small> Others however emphasized its theoretical novelty, and argued that evolutionary stasis had been &quot;unexpected by most evolutionary biologists&quot;<small></small> and &quot;had a major impact on paleontology and evolutionary biology.&quot;<small></small><p>In addition to his work on <a href="../../wp/p/Punctuated_equilibrium.htm" title="Punctuated equilibrium">punctuated equilibrium</a> and <!--del_lnk--> evolutionary developmental biology, Gould championed biological constraints and other non-selectionist forces in evolution. With <!--del_lnk--> Richard Lewontin he wrote an influential <!--del_lnk--> 1979 paper critical of the overuse of adaptation in biology.<small></small> Their paper introduced the evolutionary concept <!--del_lnk--> spandrel, borrowed from the architectural term &quot;<!--del_lnk--> spandrel&quot;. Gould and Lewontin used it to mean a feature of an organism that exists as a necessary consequence of other features and not built directly, piece by piece, by natural selection.<small></small> The relative frequency of spandrels, so defined, versus adaptive features in nature, remains a controversial topic in <!--del_lnk--> evolutionary biology.<p>Gould is also one of the most highly cited scientists in the field of evolutionary theory. His <!--del_lnk--> 1979 &quot;spandrels&quot; paper has been cited more than 1,600 times. In <i>Palaeobiology</i>&mdash;the flagship journal of his own speciality&mdash;only <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_Darwin.htm" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> and <!--del_lnk--> G.G. Simpson have been cited more often.<small></small> Gould was also a considerably respected historian of science. Historian <!--del_lnk--> Ronald Numbers has been quoted as saying: &quot;I can&#39;t say much about Gould&#39;s strengths as a scientist, but for a long time I&#39;ve regarded him as the second most influential historian of science (next to <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Kuhn).&quot;<small></small><p>Shortly before his death, Gould published a long treatise recapitulating his version of modern evolutionary theory, written primarily for the technical audience of evolutionary biologists: <i><!--del_lnk--> The Structure of Evolutionary Theory</i> (2002).<p><a id="Gould_as_a_public_figure" name="Gould_as_a_public_figure"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Gould as a public figure</span></h2>
      <p>Gould became widely known through his popular science essays in <i><!--del_lnk--> Natural History</i> magazine and his <!--del_lnk--> best-selling <!--del_lnk--> books on <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">evolution</a>. Many of his essays were reprinted in collected volumes, such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Ever Since Darwin</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Panda&#39;s Thumb</i>, while his popular treatises included books such as <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Mismeasure_of_Man.htm" title="The Mismeasure of Man">The Mismeasure of Man</a></i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Wonderful Life</i> and <i>Full House</i>.<p>Gould was a passionate advocate of evolutionary theory and wrote prolifically on the subject, trying to communicate his understanding of contemporary evolutionary biology to a wide audience. A recurring theme in his writings is the history and development of evolutionary, and pre-evolutionary, <!--del_lnk--> thought. He was also an enthusiastic <a href="../../wp/b/Baseball.htm" title="Baseball">baseball</a> fan and made frequent references to the sport in his essays.<small></small><p>Although a proud <!--del_lnk--> Darwinist, his emphasis was less <!--del_lnk--> gradualist and <!--del_lnk--> reductionist than most <!--del_lnk--> neo-Darwinists. He also opposed many aspects of <!--del_lnk--> sociobiology and its intellectual descendant <!--del_lnk--> evolutionary psychology. He spent much of his time fighting against <a href="../../wp/c/Creationism.htm" title="Creationism">creationism</a> (and the related constructs <!--del_lnk--> Creation Science and <!--del_lnk--> Intelligent Design) and other forms of <!--del_lnk--> pseudoscience. Most notably, Gould provided expert testimony against the equal-time creationism law in <!--del_lnk--> McLean v. Arkansas. Gould used the term <!--del_lnk--> &quot;Non-Overlapping Magisteria&quot; (NOMA) to describe how, in his view, science and religion could not comment on each other&#39;s realm.<small></small>. Gould had become a noted public face of science, and often appeared on <a href="../../wp/t/Television.htm" title="Television">television</a>. He once <!--del_lnk--> voiced a <!--del_lnk--> cartoon version of himself on an episode of <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Simpsons.htm" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i>, a widely popular <a href="../../wp/a/Animation.htm" title="Animation">animated</a> <!--del_lnk--> television program. <a href="../../wp/t/The_Simpsons.htm" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a> also paid tribute to him after his death. In an episode entitled <!--del_lnk--> Papa&#39;s Got a Brand New Badge, at the beginning of the credits, the message &quot;Dedicated to the memory of Stephen Jay Gould&quot; appears with a picture from the episode he was in. In addition, he is one of several luminaries who are heroes of the climax of the science fiction novel <i><!--del_lnk--> Ancient Shores</i>.<p>Gould was also featured prominently as a guest in <!--del_lnk--> Ken Burns&#39; <!--del_lnk--> PBS documentary, <i><!--del_lnk--> Baseball.</i><p>He was on the Board of Advisors to the influencial <!--del_lnk--> Children&#39;s Television Workshop television show, <!--del_lnk--> 3-2-1 Contact.<p><a id="Controversies" name="Controversies"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Controversies</span></h2>
      <p>Gould received many accolades for his scholarly work<small></small> and popular expositions of natural history,<small></small> but was criticized by some in the biological community who felt his public presentations were, in various respects, out of step with mainstream evolutionary theory.<small></small> The public debates between those that agreed with Gould and those that criticized him have been so quarrelsome that they have been dubbed &quot;The Darwin Wars&quot; by several commentators.<small></small><p>The eminent <!--del_lnk--> John Maynard Smith was among Gould&#39;s strongest critics. Maynard Smith thought that Gould trivialized the role of adaptation, and criticised Gould&#39;s periodic invocation of large scale mutations.<small></small> In a recent review of <!--del_lnk--> Daniel Dennett&#39;s book <i><!--del_lnk--> Darwin&#39;s Dangerous Idea</i>, Maynard Smith wrote that Gould &quot;is giving non-biologists a largely false picture of the state of evolutionary theory.&quot;<small></small> But Maynard Smith has not been consistently negative, writing in a review of <i>The Panda&#39;s Thumb</i> that often &quot;he infuriates me, but I hope he will go right on writing essays like these.&quot;<small></small> Maynard Smith was also among those who welcomed Gould&#39;s reinvigoration of evolutionary paleontology.<small></small><p>One reason for such criticism was that Gould appeared to be presenting his ideas as a revolutionary way of understanding evolution, which relegated <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_selection.htm" title="Natural selection">natural selection</a> to a much less important position. As a result, many non-specialists inferred from his early writings that Darwinian explanations had been proven to be unscientific (which Gould never wanted to imply). His works were sometimes used out of context as a &quot;proof&quot; that scientists no longer understood how organisms evolved, giving <a href="../../wp/c/Creationism.htm" title="Creationism">creationists</a> ammunition in their battle against evolutionary theory.<small></small>Gould himself corrected some of these misinterpretations and distortions of his writings in later works.<small></small>.<p>Gould also had a long-running feud with <!--del_lnk--> E. O. Wilson, <!--del_lnk--> Richard Dawkins and other evolutionary biologists over <!--del_lnk--> sociobiology and its descendant <!--del_lnk--> evolutionary psychology, which Gould strongly opposed but Dawkins, <!--del_lnk--> Daniel Dennett, <!--del_lnk--> Steven Pinker and others strongly advocated.<small></small> Gould and Dawkins also disagreed over the importance of <!--del_lnk--> gene selection in evolution: Dawkins argued that all evolution is ultimately caused by gene competition, while Gould advocated the importance of higher-level competition including, but certainly not limited to, <!--del_lnk--> species selection. Strong criticism of Gould can be found in Dawkins&#39; <i><!--del_lnk--> The Blind Watchmaker</i> and Dennett&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Darwin&#39;s Dangerous Idea</i>. Dennett&#39;s criticism has tended to be harsher, while Dawkins praises Gould in evolutionary topics other than those of contention. Pinker accuses Gould, <!--del_lnk--> Lewontin and other opponents of evolutionary psychology of being &quot;radical scientists,&quot; whose stance on human nature is influenced by politics rather than science.<small></small> Gould countered that sociobiologists and evolutionary psychologists are often heavily influenced, perhaps unconsciously, by their own prejudices and interests.<small></small>.<p>Gould&#39;s interpretation of the <a href="../../wp/c/Cambrian.htm" title="Cambrian">Cambrian</a> <!--del_lnk--> Burgess Shale fossils in his book <i><!--del_lnk--> Wonderful Life</i> was criticized by <!--del_lnk--> Simon Conway Morris in his 1998 book <i>The Crucible Of Creation</i>.<small></small> Gould had emphasized the &quot;weirdness&quot; of the Burgess Shale fauna, and the role of unpredictable, contingent phenomena in determining which members of this fauna survived and flourished. Conway Morris stressed the phylogenetic linkages between the Burgess Shale forms and modern taxa, particularly, the importance of <!--del_lnk--> convergent evolution in producing general predictable responses to similar environmental circumstances. Paleontologist Richard Fortey has noted that prior to the release of <i><!--del_lnk--> Wonderful Life</i>, Conway Morris shared many of Gould&#39;s sentiments and views. It was only after publication of <i><!--del_lnk--> Wonderful Life</i> that Conway Morris revised his interpretation and adopted a more <!--del_lnk--> progressive stance towards the history of life.<small></small><p><a id="Non-Overlapping_Magisteria_.28NOMA.29" name="Non-Overlapping_Magisteria_.28NOMA.29"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Non-Overlapping Magisteria (NOMA)</span></h2>
      <p>In his book <i>Rocks of Ages</i> Gould put forward what he described as &quot;a blessedly simple and entirely conventional resolution to ... the supposed conflict between science and religion&quot;  He defines the term <i>magisterium</i> as &quot;a domain where one form of teaching holds the appropriate tools for meaningful discourse and resolution&quot;  and the NOMA principle is &quot;the magisterium of science covers the empirical realm: what the Universe is made of (fact) and why does it work in this way (theory). The magisterium of religion extends over questions of ultimate meaning and moral value. These two magisteria do not overlap, nor do they encompass all inquiry (consider, for example, the magisterium of art and the meaning of beauty).&quot; <p>In his view, &quot;Science and religion do not glower at each other ... [they] interdigitate in patterns of complex fingering, and at every <a href="../../wp/f/Fractal.htm" title="Fractal">fractal</a> scale of <!--del_lnk--> self-similarity&quot; . He suggests, with examples, that &quot;NOMA enjoys strong and fully explicit support, even from the primary cultural stereotypes of hard-line traditionalism&quot; and that it is &quot;a sound position of general consensus, established by long struggle among people of goodwill in both magisteria&quot; <p>A similar position has been adopted by the <!--del_lnk--> National Academy of Sciences. Its publication <i>Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences, Second Edition (1999)</i> states that &quot;Scientists, like many others, are touched with awe at the order and complexity of nature. Indeed, many scientists are deeply religious. But science and religion occupy two separate realms of human experience. Demanding that they be combined detracts from the glory of each.&quot;  This was subsequently signed by then-President <!--del_lnk--> Bruce Alberts.<p><!--del_lnk--> Richard Dawkins though, in his book <!--del_lnk--> The God Delusion, is critical of Gould&rsquo;s concept of non-overlapping magisteria as Dawkins argues that the concept cannot be used to defend theologians from criticism. Dawkins presents that &quot;the God Hypothesis&quot;, which he defines as &quot;there exists a super-human, supernatural intelligence who deliberately designed and created the universe and everything in it, including us&quot; is a scientific hypothesis about the universe and one that should be treated with as much scepticism as any other theory.<p><a id="Mismeasure_of_Man" name="Mismeasure_of_Man"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Mismeasure of Man</i></span></h2>
