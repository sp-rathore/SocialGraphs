<h2>FIFA/SOS Ambassador Castro and Mexican team support 6 villages for 2006</h2><p><strong>13/06/2006</strong></p>
<img src="../../wp/c/Castro_Mexico.jpg" width="199" height="180" alt="FIFA/SOS Ambassador for Mexico José Antonio Castro" class="left" /><p>Jos&eacute; Antonio Castro took time off after a Mexican World Cup team training session last week to receive his FIFA/SOS Ambassador certificate and pledge his support for &quot;6 villages for 2006&quot;. Other Mexican footballers and team officials joined Castro and were keen to underline the importance of helping children in need.</p><p>With only five days to go before the start of the 2006 World Cup in Germany, Mexico's World Cup team warmly greeted children and staff from SOS Children's Villages to their open training session. After training for approximately three hours in front of many cheering fans at the Jahn stadium in G&ouml;ttingen, the Mexican team delighted the children by allowing them onto the pitch to meet the players. </p><p>Mexican defender Jos&eacute; Antonio Castro also received his &quot;FIFA for SOS Children's Villages&quot; certificate and pledged to support SOS Children in whichever way he could. &quot;I am delighted to be an Ambassador for such a good cause. It is important to help vulnerable children and I will help SOS Children's Villages in doing so whenever I can,&quot; said Castro, who joins a list of almost 100 football greats who have become FIFA/SOS ambassadors. </p><p>Castro and his Mexican team mates spent time signing autographs and posing for photographs. The players were particularly impressed that as part of the &quot;6 villages for 2006&quot; campaign, one of the six new children's villages will be built in Morelia, in the Mexican state of Michoac&aacute;n, where the number of children at risk of abandonment and in danger of facing a life in poverty is increasing steadily. </p><p>More than 100 orphaned and abandoned children will find a new family at the village in Morelia, the eighth in Mexico, and hundreds more youths from the neighbouring community will benefit from services offered at the nearby SOS social centre.</p><p><a href="../../wp/s/Six_Villages_News.htm">Back to SOS World Cup news</a></p><p><strong>Relevant Countries:</strong> <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico_A.htm">Mexico</a>.</p>
