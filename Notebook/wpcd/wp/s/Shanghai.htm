Widely regarded as the citadel of China&#39;s modern <!--del_lnk--> economy, the city also serves as one of the most important cultural, commercial, financial, industrial and communications centers of China. Administratively, Shanghai is a <!--del_lnk--> municipality of the People&#39;s Republic of China that has <!--del_lnk--> province-level status. Shanghai is also one of the world&#39;s busiest <!--del_lnk--> ports, and became the largest cargo port in the world in 2005.<p>Originally a sleepy fishing town, Shanghai became China&#39;s most important city by the 20th century and was the centre of <a href="../../wp/p/Popular_culture.htm" title="Popular culture">popular culture</a>, <!--del_lnk--> vice, intellectual discourse and political intrigue during the <a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_China.htm" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a>.

After the <!--del_lnk--> communist takeover in <!--del_lnk--> 1949, Shanghai languished under heavy central government taxation and much of its <!--del_lnk--> bourgeois elements were purged. Following the central government&#39;s authorization of <!--del_lnk--> market-economic redevelopment of Shanghai in <!--del_lnk--> 1992, Shanghai quickly surpassed early-starters <!--del_lnk--> Shenzhen and <a href="../../wp/g/Guangzhou.htm" title="Guangzhou">Guangzhou</a>, and has since led China&#39;s economic growth. Some challenges remain for Shanghai at the beginning of the 21st century, as the city struggles to cope with increased worker migration, and a huge wealth gap. However, these challenges aside, Shanghai&#39;s skyscrapers and modern lifestyle mark the pinnacle of China&#39;s recent economic development.<p>

      <p>The two <!--del_lnk--> Chinese characters in the name &quot;Shanghai&quot; (see left) literally mean &quot;on&quot;/&quot;top&quot; and &quot;sea&quot;. The local <!--del_lnk--> Shanghainese pronunciation of Shanghai is <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/z&#x251;&#x303;.&#39;he/</span>, while the <!--del_lnk--> Standard Mandarin pronunciation in <!--del_lnk--> Hanyu Pinyin is Sh&agrave;ngh&#x1CE;i. The earliest occurrence of this name dates from the <!--del_lnk--> Song Dynasty (<a href="../../wp/1/11th_century.htm" title="11th century">11th century</a>), at which time there was already a river confluence and a town with this name in the area. There are disputes as to how the name should be interpreted, but official local histories have consistently said that it means &quot;the upper reaches of the sea&quot; (&#x6D77;&#x4E4B;&#x4E0A;&#x6D0B;). However, another reading, especially in Mandarin, also suggests the sense of &quot;go onto the sea,&quot; which is consistent with the seaport status of the city. The more poetic name for Shanghai switches the order of the two characters, i.e., <b>Haishang</b> (&#x6D77;&#x4E0A;), and is often used for terms related to Shanghainese art and culture. In the West, Shanghai has also been spelled Schanghai (in <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a>), Sjanghai (in <a href="../../wp/d/Dutch_language.htm" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a>), Xangai (in <a href="../../wp/p/Portuguese_language.htm" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a>) and Changha&iuml; (in <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a>), but since the 1990s the Hanyu Pinyin spelling of &quot;Shanghai&quot; has become universal in the West. In <!--del_lnk--> Japanese, Shanghai is written using the same two Chinese characters (&#x4E0A;&#x6D77;), and the Japanese pronunciation <i>Shanhai</i> (&#x30B7;&#x30E3;&#x30F3;&#x30CF;&#x30A4;) is an approximate of the Mandarin pronunciation.<p>Shanghai&#39;s abbreviations in Chinese are <i>H&ugrave;</i> (&#x6CAA;) and <i>Sh&#x113;n</i> (&#x7533;). The former is derived from the ancient name Hu Du (&#x6CAA;&#x6E0E;) of the river now known as <!--del_lnk--> Suzhou Creek. The latter is derived from the name of Chun<i>shen</i> Jun (&#x6625;&#x7533;&#x541B;), a nobleman of the <!--del_lnk--> Chu Kingdom (&#x695A;&#x56FD;) in the 3rd century B.C. whose territory included the Shanghai area and has locally been revered as a hero. Sports teams and newspapers in Shanghai often use the character <i>Sh&#x113;n</i> (&#x7533;) in their names. Shanghai is also commonly called <i>Sh&#x113;nch&eacute;ng</i> (&#x7533;&#x57CE;, &quot;City of Sh&#x113;n&quot;).<p>The city has had various nicknames in English, including &quot;Paris of the East&quot;, &quot;Queen of the Orient&quot;, &quot;Pearl of the Orient&quot;, and even &quot;The Whore of Asia&quot; (a reference to widespread corruption of vice, drugs, and prostitution in the 1920s and 1930s).<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>Before the formation of Shanghai city, Shanghai was part of Songjiang county (&#x677E;&#x6C5F;&#x7E23;), governed by <!--del_lnk--> Suzhou <!--del_lnk--> prefecture (&#x8607;&#x5DDE;&#x5E9C;). From the time of the <!--del_lnk--> Song Dynasty (960-1279), Shanghai gradually became a busy <!--del_lnk--> seaport, outgrowing its original political jurisdictions. For instance, <!--del_lnk--> Songjiang (&#x6DDE;&#x6C5F;) today is one of 18 districts <i>within</i> Shanghai.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>A <!--del_lnk--> city wall was built in AD <!--del_lnk--> 1553, which is generally accepted as the start of the city of Shanghai. However, before the 19th century, Shanghai was not considered a major city of China. Therefore, compared to most other major Chinese cities today, there are few <!--del_lnk--> ancient Chinese landmarks to be found in the city. The few cultural landmarks to be found are very ancient and typically date to the <!--del_lnk--> Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history. This is mostly due to the fact that present-day Shanghai is within the historic cultural centre of the <!--del_lnk--> Wu Kingdom (222-280).<p>During the <!--del_lnk--> Qianlong era of the <a href="../../wp/q/Qing_Dynasty.htm" title="Qing Dynasty">Qing Dynasty</a>, Shanghai became an important regional port for the <a href="../../wp/y/Yangtze_River.htm" title="Yangtze River">Yangtze</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Huangpu rivers. It also became a major seaport for the nearby <!--del_lnk--> Jiangsu and <!--del_lnk--> Zhejiang provinces, although overseas commerce was still forbidden at that time. A historically important area of this era is Wujiaochang (&#x4E94;&#x89D2;&#x573A;) (now in the <!--del_lnk--> Yangpu District), the foundation of the city centre. Around the end of the Qianlong era, Shiliupu (&#x5341;&#x516D;&#x94FA;) (now in the <!--del_lnk--> Huangpu District) became the largest port in <!--del_lnk--> East Asia.<p><a name="19th_to_early_20th_century"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">19th to early 20th century</span></h3>
      <p>The importance of Shanghai grew radically in the 19th century, as the city&#39;s strategic position at the mouth of the <a href="../../wp/y/Yangtze_River.htm" title="Yangtze River">Yangtze River</a> made it an ideal location for trade with the West.<p>During the <!--del_lnk--> First Opium War in the early-<a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a>, British forces temporarily held Shanghai. The war ended with the <!--del_lnk--> 1842 <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Nanjing, which saw the <!--del_lnk--> treaty ports, Shanghai included, opened for international trade. The <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of the Bogue signed in <!--del_lnk--> 1843, and the <!--del_lnk--> Sino-American Treaty of Wangsia signed in <!--del_lnk--> 1844 together saw foreign nations achieve extraterritoriality on Chinese soil, which officially lasted until 1943 but was essentially defunct by the late <!--del_lnk--> 1930s. From the <!--del_lnk--> twenties to the late 30s Shanghai was a so-called &#39;<!--del_lnk--> sin city&#39;. <!--del_lnk--> Gangsters wielded a great deal of power and ran <!--del_lnk--> casinos and <!--del_lnk--> brothels.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Taiping Rebellion broke out in <!--del_lnk--> 1850, and in <!--del_lnk--> 1853 Shanghai was occupied by a <!--del_lnk--> triad offshoot of the rebels, called the <!--del_lnk--> Small Swords Society. The fighting destroyed the countryside but left the foreigners&#39; settlements untouched, and Chinese arrived seeking refuge. Although previously Chinese were forbidden to live in foreign settlements, <!--del_lnk--> 1854 saw new regulations drawn up making land available to Chinese. Land prices rose substantially.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>1854 also saw the first annual meeting of the <!--del_lnk--> Shanghai Municipal Council, created in order to manage the foreign settlements. In <!--del_lnk--> 1863, the British settlement, located along the western bank of the Huangpu river to the south of Suzhou creek (Huangpu district), and American settlement, located on the western bank of the Huangpu river and to the north of Suzhou creek (Hankou district) joined in order to form the International Settlement. The French opted out of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and instead maintained its own French Concession, located to the west of the International Settlement. This period saw a large influx of migrants from <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>, who called themselves &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Shanghighlanders&quot;.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Sino-Japanese War fought <!--del_lnk--> 1894-<!--del_lnk--> 95 over control of <a href="../../wp/k/Korea.htm" title="Korea">Korea</a> concluded with the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Shimonoseki, which saw <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> emerge as an additional foreign power in Shanghai. Japan built the first factories in Shanghai, which were soon copied by other foreign powers to effect the emergence of Shanghai industry. Shanghai was then the biggest financial city in the <!--del_lnk--> Far East. Under the <a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_China.htm" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a>, Shanghai was made a <!--del_lnk--> special city in 1927, and a municipality in May <!--del_lnk--> 1930. The Japanese Navy bombed Shanghai on <!--del_lnk--> January 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1932, nominally in an effort to crush down Chinese student protests of the <!--del_lnk--> Manchurian Incident and the subsequent Japanese occupation. The Chinese fought back in what was known as the <!--del_lnk--> January 28 Incident. The two sides fought to a standstill and a ceasefire was brokered in May. In the <!--del_lnk--> Second Sino-Japanese War, the city fell after the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Shanghai in <!--del_lnk--> 1937, and was occupied until Japan&#39;s surrender in <!--del_lnk--> 1945.

      <p>Shanghai had been a centre for <!--del_lnk--> refugees as early as 1919 when large numbers of White Russians fleeing revolution and civil war took up residence there. Russians comprised the second largest foreign community in Shanghai (after the Japanese) and played a important role in the economy and policing of the International Settlement until the end of World War II.<p>During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Shanghai became again a centre for <!--del_lnk--> refugees from <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>. It was the only city in the world that was open unconditionally to the <!--del_lnk--> Jews at the time. As a result, approximately 32,000 Jews, who like the other foreign communities termed themselves &quot;Shanghailanders,&quot; settled in this fascinating Chinese city. However, under pressure from their <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazi">Nazi</a> allies, the Japanese ghettoised the <!--del_lnk--> Jewish refugees in late 1941 in what came to be known as the <!--del_lnk--> Shanghai ghetto, and hunger and <!--del_lnk--> infectious diseases such as <!--del_lnk--> amoebic dysentery became rife. Nevertheless, the Japanese government refused Nazi requests to deport the Jewish population.<p><a id="Communist_rule" name="Communist_rule"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Communist rule</span></h3>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> May 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1949, Shanghai came under <!--del_lnk--> communist control and was one of the only two former <a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_China.htm" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a> (ROC) municipalities not merged into neighbouring provinces over the next decade (the other being <a href="../../wp/b/Beijing.htm" title="Beijing">Beijing</a>). It underwent a series of changes in the boundaries of its subdivisions, especially in the next decade.<p>After the communist takeover in 1949, most foreign firms moved their offices from Shanghai to <a href="../../wp/h/Hong_Kong.htm" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>. During the <!--del_lnk--> 1950s and <!--del_lnk--> 1960s, Shanghai became an industrial center and centre for revolutionary <!--del_lnk--> leftism. Yet, even during the most tumultuous times of the <!--del_lnk--> Cultural Revolution, Shanghai was able to maintain high economic productivity and relative social stability. In most of the history of the <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">People&#39;s Republic of China</a> (PRC), Shanghai has been the largest contributor of tax revenue to the central government compared with other Chinese provinces and municipalities. This came at the cost of severely crippling Shanghai&#39;s infrastructure and capital development. Its importance to China&#39;s fiscal well-being also denied it economic liberalizations that were started in the far southern provinces such as <!--del_lnk--> Guangdong during the mid-1980s. At that time Guangdong province paid nearly no taxes to the central government, and thus was perceived as fiscally expendable for experimental economic reforms. Shanghai was not permitted to initiate economic reforms until <!--del_lnk--> 1991.<p>Political power in Shanghai has traditionally been seen as a stepping stone to higher positions within the PRC central government. In the 1990s, there was what was often described as the politically <!--del_lnk--> right-of-centre &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Shanghai clique,&quot; which included the president of the PRC <!--del_lnk--> Jiang Zemin and the <!--del_lnk--> premier of the PRC <!--del_lnk--> Zhu Rongji. Starting in <!--del_lnk--> 1992, the central government under Jiang Zemin, a former <!--del_lnk--> Mayor of Shanghai, began reducing the tax burden on Shanghai and encouraging both foreign and domestic investment in order to promote it as the economic hub of <!--del_lnk--> East Asia and to encourage its role as gateway of investment to the Chinese interior. Since then it has experienced continuous economic growth of between 9&ndash;15% annually.<p><a id="Politics_and_Administration" name="Politics_and_Administration"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Politics and Administration</span></h2>

      <p>Shanghai has been a <!--del_lnk--> political hub of China for many years. Many of China&#39;s top government officials in Beijing are known to have risen in Shanghai in the 1980s on a platform that was critical of the extreme leftism of the <!--del_lnk--> Cultural Revolution, giving them the tag &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Shanghai Clique&quot; during the 1990s. Many observers of Chinese politics view the more right-leaning Shanghai Clique as an opposing and competing faction of the current Chinese administration under President <!--del_lnk--> Hu Jintao and Premier <!--del_lnk--> Wen Jiabao. Shanghai&#39;s top jobs, the Party Chief and the position of Mayor, have always been prominent on a national scale. Four Shanghai mayors eventually went on to take prominent Central Government positions, including former President <!--del_lnk--> Jiang Zemin and former Premier <!--del_lnk--> Zhu Rongji. The top administrative jobs are always appointed directly by the Central Government.<p>The current Shanghai government under Mayor <!--del_lnk--> Han Zheng has openly advocated transparency in the city&#39;s government. However, in previous years a complicated system of relationships between Shanghai&#39;s government, banks, and other civil institutions has been under scrutiny for corruption, motivated by faction politics in Beijing; these allegations from Beijing did not go anywhere until late 2006.<p>In September 2006, the Shanghai Communist Party Chair <!--del_lnk--> Chen Liangyu and a number of his followers were removed from their positions after a probe into the city&#39;s pension fund. Over a hundred investigators, sent by the Central Government, reportedly uncovered clues of money diversion from the city&#39;s pension fund to unapproved loans and investments. Chen Liangyu, a member of former President Jiang Zemin&#39;s Shanghai Clique, was seen as a major rival of President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao. Chen&#39;s abrupt removal is viewed by many Chinese as a political maneuver by Hu Jintao to further secure his power in the country. See the <!--del_lnk--> article on Chen Liangyu for more information regarding his dismissal.<p><a id="Subdivisions" name="Subdivisions"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Subdivisions</span></h3>

      <p>Shanghai is administratively equal to a <!--del_lnk--> province and is divided into 19 <!--del_lnk--> county-level divisions: 18 <!--del_lnk--> districts and 1 <!--del_lnk--> county. There is no single downtown district in Shanghai, the urban core is scattered across several districts. Prominent central business areas include <!--del_lnk--> Lujiazui on the east bank of the <!--del_lnk--> Huangpu River, and <!--del_lnk--> The Bund and <!--del_lnk--> Hongqiao areas in the west bank of the Huangpu River. The city hall and major administration units are located in <!--del_lnk--> Huangpu District, which also serve as a commercial area, including the famous <!--del_lnk--> Nanjing Road. Other major commercial areas include the classy <!--del_lnk--> Xintiandi and Huaihai Road in <!--del_lnk--> Luwan district and <!--del_lnk--> Xujiahui in <!--del_lnk--> Xuhui District. Many universities in Shanghai are located in residential areas of <!--del_lnk--> Yangpu District and <!--del_lnk--> Putuo District.<p>Nine of the districts govern <!--del_lnk--> Puxi (literally West Bank), or the older part of urban Shanghai on the west bank of the <!--del_lnk--> Huangpu River. These nine districts are collectively referred to as Shanghai Proper (&#x4E0A;&#x6D77;&#x5E02;&#x533A;) or the core city (&#x5E02;&#x4E2D;&#x5FC3;):<ul>

      <p>Shanghai is often regarded as the centre of finance and trade in mainland China. Modern development began with economic reforms in <!--del_lnk--> 1992, a decade later than many of the Southern Chinese provinces. Prior to then, much of the city&#39;s tax revenue went directly to the capital, <a href="../../wp/b/Beijing.htm" title="Beijing">Beijing</a>, with little return. Even with a decreased tax burden after 1992, Shanghai&#39;s tax contribution to the central government is around 20-25% of the national total (Shanghai&#39;s annual tax burden pre-1990s was on average 70% of the national total). Shanghai today is still the most populous and well developed city in <!--del_lnk--> mainland China.<p>Shanghai is one of the world&#39;s busiest ports. In 2005, Shanghai ranked first of the world&#39;s busiest ports in terms of cargo throughput, handling a total of 443 million tons of cargo. In terms of container traffic, it is the third busiest port in the world, following <a href="../../wp/s/Singapore.htm" title="Singapore">Singapore</a> and <a href="../../wp/h/Hong_Kong.htm" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> 2000 census put the population of Shanghai Municipality to 16.738 million, including the floating population, which made up 3.871 million. Since the 1990 census the total population has increased by 3.396 million, or 25.5%. Males accounted for 51.4%, females for 48.6% of the population. 12.2% were in the age group of 0-14, 76.3% between 15 and 64 and 11.5% were older than 65. 5.4% of the inhabitants were illiterate. As of 2003, the official registered population is 13.42 million; however, more than 5 million more people work and live in Shanghai undocumented, and of the 5 million, some 4 million belong to the floating population of temporary migrant workers, a large proportion of whom are from <!--del_lnk--> Anhui Province as well as <!--del_lnk--> Jiangsu and <!--del_lnk--> Zhejiang Provinces. The average life expectancy in 2003 was 79.80 years, 77.78 for men and 81.81 for women.<p>Shanghai and <a href="../../wp/h/Hong_Kong.htm" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> have had a recent rivalry over which city is to be the <!--del_lnk--> economic centre of China. The city had a <!--del_lnk--> GDP of &yen;46,586 (ca. US$ 5,620) per capita in 2003, ranked no. 13 among all 659 Chinese cities. <a href="../../wp/h/Hong_Kong.htm" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> on the other hand, possessed an unparalleled <!--del_lnk--> GDP of &yen;310,021 (ca. US$ 37,400). Hong Kong has the advantage of a stronger <!--del_lnk--> legal system, <!--del_lnk--> international market integration, superior <!--del_lnk--> economic freedom, greater <!--del_lnk--> banking and service expertise. Shanghai has stronger links to both the Chinese interior and the central government, in addition to a stronger base in <a href="../../wp/m/Manufacturing.htm" title="Manufacturing">manufacturing</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Technology.htm" title="Technology">technology</a>. Shanghai has increased its role in <a href="../../wp/f/Finance.htm" title="Finance">finance</a>, banking, and as a major destination for corporate headquarters, fueling demand for a highly educated and modernized workforce. Shanghai has recorded a double-digit growth for 14 consecutive years since 1992. In 2005, Shanghai&#39;s nominal GDP posted an 11.1% growth to 912.5 billion yuan (US$114 billion).<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>As in many other areas in China, Shanghai is undergoing a building boom. In Shanghai the modern <a href="../../wp/a/Architecture.htm" title="Architecture">architecture</a> is notable for its unique style, especially in the highest floors, with several top floor restaurants which resemble flying saucers. <i>For a gallery of these unique architecture designs, see <!--del_lnk--> Shanghai (architecture images)</i>.<p>The bulk of Shanghai buildings being constructed today are high-rise apartments of various height, colour and design. There is now a strong focus by city planners to develop more &quot;green areas&quot; (public parks) among the apartment complexes in order to increase the quality of life for Shanghai&#39;s residents, quite in accordance to the &quot;Better City - Better Life&quot; theme of Shanghai&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Expo 2010.<p>Historically very Western in lifestyle, Shanghai is increasingly a critical centre of communication with the Western world. Examples include the opening of the <!--del_lnk--> Pac-Med Medical Exchange in June of 2004, a clearinghouse of medical data and a link between the Chinese and westernized medical infrastructures. In medicine and other humanitarian fields, China is actively seeking input of first world nations to improve living conditions and trade status. Arguments for and against modern Chinese leadership question the genuine influence the influx of western culture and technology will have on vast Chinese interior, outside of the densely populated, often visited urban centres. The Pudong district of Shanghai contains contemporary architecture and &quot;modern&quot;-feeling districts, in close proximity to major international trade and hospitality zones. Visitors to Shanghai find free public parks manicured to startling perfection; in distinct contrast to the massive industrial installations which reveal China&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> emerging environmental concerns. Shanghai&#39;s international diversity is perhaps the world&#39;s foremost window into the rich, historic and complex society of today&#39;s China.<p><a id="Geography_and_climate" name="Geography_and_climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography and climate</span></h2>

Temperatures extremes of -10C (14F) and +41C (105F) have been recorded. Heavy rain is frequent in early summer. Spring starts in March, summer in June, autumn in September and winter in December. The weather in spring, although considered the most beautiful season, is highly variable, with frequent rain and alternating spells of warmth and cold. Summer is the peak tourist season, but is hot and oppressive, as the humidity makes it almost impossible for people not used to the environment to breathe properly.

According to the development schedule of the municipal government, by the year 2010, another 8 lines will be built in Shanghai. Bus and metro fares run from &yen;1 to &yen;4 depending on distance (or between 12 to 50 US cents). <!--del_lnk--> Taxis in Shanghai are plentiful and market competition has driven taxi fare down to affordable prices for the average resident (&yen;11 or a little over one US dollar for 3&nbsp;km). Before the 1990s, bicycling was the most ubiquitous form of transportation in Shanghai, but the city has since banned bicycles on many of the city&#39;s main roads to ease congestion. However, many streets have bicycle lanes and intersections are monitored by &quot;Traffic Assistants&quot; who help provide for safe crossing. Further, most motorists in China were raised riding bikes and so are fairly careful of them. Further, the city government has pledged to add 180&nbsp;km of cycling lanes over the next few years. With rising disposable incomes, private car ownership in Shanghai has also been rapidly increasing in recent years. The number of cars is limited, however, by the number of available number plates available at public auction.<p>Shanghai has two airports: <!--del_lnk--> Hongqiao and <!--del_lnk--> Pudong International, which has the second highest (combined) traffic in China, following <!--del_lnk--> Hong Kong International Airport. In cooperation with the Shanghai municipality and the Shanghai Maglev Transportation Development Co. (SMT), German <!--del_lnk--> Transrapid constructed the <!--del_lnk--> first commercial maglev railway in the world in 2002, from Shanghai&#39;s Longyang Road subway station to Pudong International Airport. Commercial operation started in <!--del_lnk--> 2003. The 30&nbsp;km trip takes 7 minutes and 21 seconds and reaches a maximum speed of 431&nbsp;km/h (267.8 miles per hour).<p>As of <!--del_lnk--> December 2005, Shanghai&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> port, including the newly opened <!--del_lnk--> Yangshan deep water port (&#x6D0B;&#x5C71;&#x6DF1;&#x6C34;&#x6E2F;), is the largest in the world. The <!--del_lnk--> Donghai Bridge (&#x4E1C;&#x6D77;&#x5927;&#x6865;) with a total length 32.5&nbsp;km, is the longest cross-sea bridge of the world. It links Shanghai on the mainland to the <!--del_lnk--> Yangshan islands.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Two <!--del_lnk--> railways intersect in Shanghai: <!--del_lnk--> Jinghu Railway (Beijing-Shanghai) Railway passing through <!--del_lnk--> Nanjing (&#x4EAC;&#x6CAA;&#x7EBF;), and Shanghai-<!--del_lnk--> Hangzhou Railway (&#x6CAA;&#x676D;&#x7EBF; Hu Hang Line). Shanghai has two main railway stations, <!--del_lnk--> Shanghai Railway Station and <!--del_lnk--> Shanghai South Railway Station. A maglev train route to <!--del_lnk--> Hangzhou (<!--del_lnk--> Shanghai-Hangzhou Maglev Train &#x6CAA;&#x676D;&#x78C1;&#x60AC;&#x6D6E;&#x7EBF;) will begin construction in 2006 and is planned to be finished in 2008. A high-speed railroad to Beijing is also in the works. More than six national expressways (prefixed with &quot;G&quot;) from <a href="../../wp/b/Beijing.htm" title="Beijing">Beijing</a> and from the region around Shanghai connect to the city. Shanghai itself has six toll-free elevated expressways (skyways) in the urban core and 18 municipal expressways (prefixed with &quot;A&quot;). There are ambitious plans to build expressways connecting Shanghai&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Chongming Island with the urban core.<p>Within Shanghai itself, there are elevated roads, which appear expressway-like in road conditions (direction-separated lanes). Tunnels and bridges are used to link Puxi to Pudong.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Language" name="Language"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Language</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> vernacular language is <!--del_lnk--> Shanghainese, a dialect of <!--del_lnk--> Wu Chinese; while the official language is <!--del_lnk--> Standard Mandarin. The local dialect is mutually unintelligible with Mandarin, and is an inseparable part of the Shanghainese identity. The <!--del_lnk--> Shanghainese dialect today is a mixture of standard Wu Chinese as spoken in <!--del_lnk--> Suzhou, with the dialects of <!--del_lnk--> Ningbo and other nearby regions whose peoples have migrated to Shanghai in large numbers since the 20th Century.<p>Nearly all Shanghainese under the age of 40 can speak Mandarin fluently. Fluency in foreign languages is unevenly distributed. Most senior residents who received a <a href="../../wp/u/University.htm" title="University">university</a> education before the revolution, and those who worked in foreign enterprises, can speak English. Those under the age of 26 have had contact with English since primary school, as English is taught as a mandatory course starting at Grade 1.<p><a id="Art" name="Art"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Art</span></h3>

      <p>Songjiang School (&#x6DDE;&#x6C5F;&#x6D3E;) is a small painting school during the <a href="../../wp/m/Ming_Dynasty.htm" title="Ming Dynasty">Ming Dynasty</a>. It is commonly considered as a further development of the Wu School, or Wumen School (&#x5434;&#x95E8;&#x753B;&#x6D3E;), in the then cultural centre of the region, <!--del_lnk--> Suzhou. Huating School (&#x534E;&#x4EAD;&#x6D3E;) was another important art school during the middle to late Ming Dynasty. Its main achievements were in traditional Chinese painting, calligraphy and poetry, and especially famous for its Renwen painting (&#x4EBA;&#x6587;&#x753B;). <!--del_lnk--> Dong Qichang (&#x8463;&#x5176;&#x660C;) is one of the masters from this school.<p><a id="Shanghai_School" name="Shanghai_School"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Shanghai School</span></h4>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Shanghai School (&#x6D77;&#x4E0A;&#x753B;&#x6D3E; <i>Haishang Huapai</i> or &#x6D77;&#x6D3E; <i>Haipai</i>) is a very important Chinese school of traditional arts during the <a href="../../wp/q/Qing_Dynasty.htm" title="Qing Dynasty">Qing Dynasty</a> and the whole of the <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a>. Under efforts of masters from this school, traditional Chinese art reached another climax and continued to the present in forms of the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Chinese painting&quot; (&#x4E2D;&#x56FD;&#x753B;) or <i>guohua</i> (&#x56FD;&#x753B;) for short. The Shanghai School challenged and broke the literati tradition of Chinese art, while also paying technical homage to the ancient masters and improving on existing traditional techniques. Members of this school were themselves educated literati who had come to question their very status and the purpose of art, and had anticipated the impending modernization of Chinese society. In an era of rapid social change, works from the Shanghai School were widely innovative and diverse, and often contained thoughtful yet subtle social commentary. The most well-known figures from this school are <!--del_lnk--> Ren Xiong (&#x4EFB;&#x718A;), <!--del_lnk--> Ren Yi (&#x4EFB;&#x4F2F;&#x5E74;), <!--del_lnk--> Zhao Zhiqian (&#x8D75;&#x4E4B;&#x8C26;), <!--del_lnk--> Wu Changshuo (&#x5434;&#x660C;&#x7855;), <!--del_lnk--> Sha Menghai (&#x6C99;&#x5B5F;&#x6D77;, calligraphist), <!--del_lnk--> Pan Tianshou (&#x6F58;&#x5929;&#x5BFF;), <!--del_lnk--> Fu Baoshi (&#x5085;&#x62B1;&#x77F3;).<p>In literature, the term was used in the 1930s by some <!--del_lnk--> May Fourth Movement intellectuals, notably <!--del_lnk--> Zhou Zuoren and <!--del_lnk--> Shen Congwen, as a derogatory label for the literature produced in Shanghai at the time. They argued that so-called Shanghai School literature was merely commercial and therefore did not advance social progress. This became known as the jingpai/haipai debate.<p><a id="Modern_China" name="Modern_China"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Modern China</span></h3>
      <p>Because of Shanghai&#39;s status as the cultural and economic centre of East Asia for the first half of the twentieth century, it is popularly seen as the birthplace of everything considered modern in China. It was in Shanghai, for example, that the first motor car was driven and the first train tracks and modern sewers were laid. It was also the intellectual battleground between socialist writers who concentrated on critical realism (pioneered by <!--del_lnk--> Lu Xun and <!--del_lnk--> Mao Dun) and the more &quot;<!--del_lnk--> bourgeois&quot;, more romantically and aesthetically inclined writers (such as <!--del_lnk--> Shi Zhecun, <!--del_lnk--> Shao Xunmei, <!--del_lnk--> Ye Lingfeng, <!--del_lnk--> Eileen Chang).<div class="thumb tright">

      </div>
      <p>Besides literature, Shanghai was also the birthplace of <!--del_lnk--> Chinese cinema &amp; theatre. China&rsquo;s first short film, <i>The Difficult Couple</i> (<i>Nanfu nanqi</i>, 1913), and the country&rsquo;s first fictional feature film, <i>Orphan Rescues Grandfather</i> (<i>Gu&#39;er jiu zuji</i>, 1923) were both produced in Shanghai. These two films were very influential, and established Shanghai as the centre of Chinese film-making. Shanghai&rsquo;s film industry went on to blossom during the early Thirties, generating Marilyn Monroe-like stars such as <!--del_lnk--> Zhou Xuan. Another film star, <!--del_lnk--> Jiang Qing, went on to become Madame <a href="../../wp/m/Mao_Zedong.htm" title="Mao Zedong">Mao Zedong</a>. The talent and passion of Shanghainese filmmakers following World War II and the Communist Revolution contributed enormously to the development of the Hong Kong film industry.<p>Much of Shanghainese popular culture (&quot;Shanghainese Pops&quot;) were transferred to <a href="../../wp/h/Hong_Kong.htm" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> by the numerous Shanghainese emigrants and refugees after the Communist Revolution. The movie <i><!--del_lnk--> In the Mood for Love</i> (<i>Huayang nianhua</i>) directed by <!--del_lnk--> Wong Kar-wai (a native Shanghainese himself) depicts one slice of the displaced Shanghainese community in Hong Kong and the nostalgia for that era, featuring 1940s music by Zhou Xuan.<p><a id="Popular_stereotypes" name="Popular_stereotypes"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Popular stereotypes</span></h3>
      <p>Shanghainese people have often been stereotyped by other Chinese (both urban and rural) as being materialistic, pretentious, and disdainful of provincials; and at the same time, however, they are admired for their meticulous attention to detail, faithfulness in contract, professionalism, and style.<p>It is a belief of many Chinese from other provinces of China that Shanghainese men can be very henpecked (nagged or controlled by their wives). Husbands in Shanghai often simultaneously play the roles of a bread-winner, father, cook, plumber, carpenter, etc. Interestingly, this view, though outmoded in the context of the modern age, is still one of the first things these people think of at the mention of Shanghai. Shanghainese people counter this stereotype with the view that other provinces, especially northern provinces are <!--del_lnk--> Androcentric.<p><a id="People_of_other_provinces" name="People_of_other_provinces"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">People of other provinces</span></h3>
      <p>Only very few residents are descended from original inhabitants of the old walled city. Nearly all registered Shanghainese residents are descendants of immigrants from the two adjacent provinces of <!--del_lnk--> Jiangsu and <!--del_lnk--> Zhejiang who moved to Shanghai in the late <!--del_lnk--> 19th and the early <!--del_lnk--> 20th Century. These are regions that generally speak the same family of dialects as Shanghainese - <!--del_lnk--> Wu Chinese. Much of pre-modern Shanghainese culture is an integration of cultural elements from these two regions. The Shanghainese dialect reflects this as well.<p>Despite this somewhat heterogeneous origin to the Shanghainese population, there has been a strong sense of Shanghainese identity, founded upon cultural and economical superiority up to the <!--del_lnk--> Revolution and to the present day. The Revolution was a humbling experience for Shanghai as a whole, as it was brought into line by the <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communist">Communist</a> regime, whose ideology favoured grass-root agriculture and industry, and opposed <!--del_lnk--> bourgeois excesses, which Shanghai stood for in the eyes of many. While most in China viewed the Shanghainese as bourgeois and arrogant, the Shanghainese reciprocally eyed the rest of the country as &quot;provincials&quot; (&#x4E61;&#x4E0B;&#x4EBA;; <i>xiangwonin</i> in Shanghainese). After the nationwide chaos of the <!--del_lnk--> Cultural Revolution and towards the 1980s, perception of Shanghai was greatly improved among other Chinese.<p>Tensions have been refueled in the past decade by migrants from all over China, who do not speak the local dialect and are therefore forced to use Mandarin as a <!--del_lnk--> lingua franca. Rising crime rates, littering, harassive panhandling, and an overloading of the basic infrastructure (mainly public transportation and public schools) associated with the rise of these migrant populations (over 3 million new migrants in 2003 alone) have been generating some ill will from the Shanghainese. The new migrants are easy to spot by the Shanghainese, and are often targets of both intentional and unintentional discrimination. Efforts have been made by the local Shanghai municipal government to provide adequate welfare for the migrant populations in Shanghai, while also being cautious not to further increase the burdens of the native population.<p><a id="Shikumen" name="Shikumen"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Shikumen</span></h3>

      <p>One uniquely Shanghainese cultural element is the <!--del_lnk--> shikumen (&#x77F3;&#x5E93;&#x95E8;) residences, which are two or three-story <!--del_lnk--> townhouses, with the front yard protected by a high brick wall. Each residence is connected and arranged in straight alleys, known as a <i>l&ograve;ngtang</i> (&#x5F04;&#x5802;), pronounced <i>longdang</i> in Shanghainese. The entrance to each alley is usually surmounted by a stylistic stone arch. The whole resembles <!--del_lnk--> terrace houses or <!--del_lnk--> townhouses commonly seen in Anglo-American countries, but distinguished by the tall, heavy brick wall in front of each house. The name &quot;shikumen&quot; literally means &quot;stone storage door&quot;, referring to the strong gateway to each house.<p>The shikumen is a cultural blend of elements found in Western architecture with traditional <!--del_lnk--> Lower Yangtze (Jiangnan) Chinese architecture and social behaviour. All traditional Chinese dwellings had a courtyard, and the shikumen was no exception. Yet, to compromise with its urban nature, it was much smaller and provided an &quot;interior haven&quot; to the commotions in the streets, allowing for raindrops to fall and vegetation to grow freely within a residence. The courtyard also allowed sunlight and adequate ventilation into the rooms.<p>This style of housing originally developed when local developers adapted terrace houses to Chinese conditions. The wall was added to protect against fighting and looting during the <!--del_lnk--> Taiping rebellion, and later burglars and vandals during the social upheavals of the early twentieth century. By <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, more than 80% of the population in the city lived in these kinds of dwellings. Many of these were hastily built and were akin to slums, while others were of sturdier construction and featured all modern amenities such as the <!--del_lnk--> flush toilet.<p>During and after <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, massive population increases in Shanghai led many shikumen houses to be heavily subdivided. For example, the spacious living room is often divided into three or four rooms, each lent out to a family. These cramped conditions continue to exist in many of the shikumen districts that have survived recent development.<p>The landlords who leased (subletted) the shikumen out to other families were called &quot;erfangdong&quot;(&#x4E8C;&#x623F;&#x4E1C;), or &quot;second landlord&quot; as many of them acquired the shikumen buildings from its original owner (&quot;dafangdong&quot;&#x5927;&#x623F;&#x4E1C;). These landlords families usually share the same shikumen building with the tenants.<p><a id="Fashion" name="Fashion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Fashion</span></h3>
      <p>Other Shanghainese cultural artifacts include the cheongsam (Shanghainese: <i>zansae</i>), a modernization of the traditional Chinese/Manchurian <!--del_lnk--> qipao (<a href="../../wp/c/Chinese_language.htm" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a>: <span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x65D7;&#x888D;</span>; Shanghainese: <i>jib&ocirc;</i>) garment which first appeared in the 1910s in Shanghai. The cheongsam dress was slender with high cut sides, and tight fitting. This contrasts sharply with the traditional qipao which was designed to conceal the figure and be worn regardless of age. The cheongsam went along well with the western overcoat and the scarf, and portrayed a unique East Asian modernity, epitomizing the Shanghainese population in general. As Western fashions changed, the basic cheongsam design changed, too, introducing high-necked sleeveless dresses, bell-like sleeves and, the black lace frothing at the hem of a ball gown. By the 1940s, cheongsams came in transparent black, beaded bodices, matching capes and even velvet. And later, checked fabrics became also quite common. The 1949 Communist Revolution ended the cheongsam and other fashions in Shanghai. However, the Shanghainese styles have seen a recent revival as stylish party dresses. The fashion industry has been rapidly revitalizing in the past decade, there is on average one fashion show per day in Shanghai today. Like Shanghai&#39;s architecture, local fashion designers strive to create a fusion of western and traditional designs, often with innovative if not controversial results.<p><a id="Cultural_sites" name="Cultural_sites"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cultural sites</span></h3>
