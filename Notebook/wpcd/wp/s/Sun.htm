      <p>About 74% of the Sun&#39;s mass is <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, 25% is <a href="../../wp/h/Helium.htm" title="Helium">helium</a>, and the rest is made up of trace quantities of heavier elements. The Sun has a <!--del_lnk--> spectral class of G2V. &quot;G2&quot; means that it has a surface temperature of approximately 5,500&nbsp;K, giving it a <!--del_lnk--> white colour, which because of atmospheric <!--del_lnk--> scattering appears yellow. Its spectrum contains <!--del_lnk--> lines of ionized and neutral metals as well as very weak hydrogen lines. The &quot;V&quot; suffix indicates that the Sun, like most stars, is a <!--del_lnk--> main sequence star. This means that it generates its energy by <!--del_lnk--> nuclear fusion of <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> nuclei into <a href="../../wp/h/Helium.htm" title="Helium">helium</a> and is in a state of <!--del_lnk--> hydrostatic balance, neither contracting nor expanding over time. There are more than 100 million G2 class stars in our galaxy. Because of logarithmic size distribution, the Sun is actually brighter than 85% of the stars in the Galaxy, most of which are <!--del_lnk--> red dwarfs.<p>The Sun orbits the centre of the <a href="../../wp/m/Milky_Way.htm" title="Milky Way">Milky Way</a> <a href="../../wp/g/Galaxy.htm" title="Galaxy">galaxy</a> at a distance of approximately 25,000 to 28,000 <!--del_lnk--> light-years from the <!--del_lnk--> galactic centre, completing one revolution in about <!--del_lnk--> 225&ndash;250 million years. The <!--del_lnk--> orbital speed is 217&nbsp;km/s, equivalent to one light-year every 1,400 years, and one <!--del_lnk--> AU every 8 days.<p>The Sun is a <!--del_lnk--> third generation star, whose formation may have been triggered by shockwaves from a nearby <!--del_lnk--> supernova. This is suggested by a high <!--del_lnk--> abundance of <!--del_lnk--> heavy elements such as <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a> and <a href="../../wp/u/Uranium.htm" title="Uranium">uranium</a> in the solar system; these elements could most plausibly have been produced by <!--del_lnk--> endergonic nuclear reactions during a supernova, or by <!--del_lnk--> transmutation via <a href="../../wp/n/Neutron.htm" title="Neutron">neutron</a> absorption inside a massive second-generation star.<p>Sunlight is the main source of energy near the surface of Earth. The <!--del_lnk--> solar constant is the amount of power that the Sun deposits per unit area that is directly exposed to sunlight. The solar constant is equal to approximately 1,370&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> watts per square meter of area at a distance of one <!--del_lnk--> AU from the Sun (that is, on or near Earth). Sunlight on the surface of Earth is <!--del_lnk--> attenuated by the Earth&#39;s atmosphere so that less power arrives at the surface&mdash;closer to 1,000&nbsp;watts per directly exposed square meter in clear conditions when the Sun is near the <!--del_lnk--> zenith. This energy can be harnessed via a variety of natural and synthetic processes&mdash;<a href="../../wp/p/Photosynthesis.htm" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a> by plants captures the energy of sunlight and converts it to chemical form (oxygen and reduced carbon compounds), while direct heating or electrical conversion by <!--del_lnk--> solar cells are used by <!--del_lnk--> solar power equipment to generate <a href="../../wp/e/Electricity.htm" title="Electricity">electricity</a> or to do other useful work. The energy stored in <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> and other <!--del_lnk--> fossil fuels was originally converted from sunlight by photosynthesis in the distant past.<p>Sunlight has several interesting biological properties. <a href="../../wp/u/Ultraviolet.htm" title="Ultraviolet">Ultraviolet</a> light from the Sun has <!--del_lnk--> antiseptic properties and can be used to sterilize tools. It also causes <!--del_lnk--> sunburn, and has other medical effects such as the production of <a href="../../wp/v/Vitamin_D.htm" title="Vitamin D">Vitamin D</a>. Ultraviolet light is strongly attenuated by Earth&#39;s atmosphere, so that the amount of UV varies greatly with <!--del_lnk--> latitude because of the longer passage of sunlight through the atmosphere at high latitudes. This variation is responsible for many biological adaptations, including variations in human <!--del_lnk--> skin colour in different regions of the globe.<p>Observed from Earth, the path of the Sun across the sky varies throughout the year. The shape described by the Sun&#39;s position, considered at the same time each day for a complete year, is called the <!--del_lnk--> analemma and resembles a figure 8 aligned along a North/South axis. While the most obvious variation in the Sun&#39;s apparent position through the year is a North/South swing over 47 degrees of angle (because of the 23.5-degree tilt of the Earth with respect to the Sun), there is an East/West component as well. The North/South swing in apparent angle is the main source of <!--del_lnk--> seasons on Earth.<p>The Sun is a magnetically active star; it supports a strong, changing <!--del_lnk--> magnetic field that varies year-to-year and reverses direction about every eleven years. The Sun&#39;s magnetic field gives rise to many effects that are collectively called <!--del_lnk--> solar activity, including <!--del_lnk--> sunspots on the surface of the Sun, <!--del_lnk--> solar flares, and variations in the <!--del_lnk--> solar wind that carry material through the solar system. The effects of solar activity on Earth include <!--del_lnk--> auroras at moderate to high latitudes, and the disruption of radio communications and <!--del_lnk--> electric power. Solar activity is thought to have played a large role in the <!--del_lnk--> formation and evolution of the <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_System.htm" title="Solar system">solar system</a>, and strongly affects the structure of Earth&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> outer atmosphere.<p>Although it is the nearest star to Earth and has been intensively studied by scientists, many questions about the Sun remain unanswered, such as why its outer atmosphere has a temperature of over a million <!--del_lnk--> K while its visible surface (the <!--del_lnk--> photosphere) has a temperature of less than 6,000 K. Current topics of scientific inquiry include the sun&#39;s regular cycle of <!--del_lnk--> sunspot activity, the physics and origin of <!--del_lnk--> solar flares and <!--del_lnk--> prominences, the magnetic interaction between the <!--del_lnk--> chromosphere and the <!--del_lnk--> corona, and the origin of the <!--del_lnk--> solar wind.<p><a id="Life_cycle" name="Life_cycle"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Life cycle</span></h2>
      <p>The Sun&#39;s current age, determined using <!--del_lnk--> computer models of <!--del_lnk--> stellar evolution and <!--del_lnk--> nucleocosmochronology, is thought to be about 4.57 billion years.<div class="thumb tright">

      </div>
      <p>The Sun is about halfway through its <!--del_lnk--> main-sequence <!--del_lnk--> evolution, during which <!--del_lnk--> nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium. Each second, more than 4 million <!--del_lnk--> tonnes of matter are converted into energy within the Sun&#39;s core, producing <!--del_lnk--> neutrinos and <!--del_lnk--> solar radiation. The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 <!--del_lnk--> billion years as a main sequence star.<p>The Sun does not have enough mass to explode as a <!--del_lnk--> supernova. Instead, in 4-5 billion years, it will enter a <a href="../../wp/r/Red_giant.htm" title="Red giant">red giant</a> phase, its outer layers expanding as the hydrogen fuel in the core is consumed and the core contracts and heats up. Helium fusion will begin when the core temperature reaches about 3&times;10<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;K. While it is likely that the expansion of the outer layers of the Sun will reach the current position of Earth&#39;s orbit, recent research suggests that mass lost from the Sun earlier in its red giant phase will cause the Earth&#39;s orbit to move further out, preventing it from being engulfed. However, Earth&#39;s water and most of the atmosphere will be boiled away.<p>Following the red giant phase, intense thermal pulsations will cause the Sun to throw off its outer layers, forming a <a href="../../wp/p/Planetary_nebula.htm" title="Planetary nebula">planetary nebula</a>. The only object that remains after the outer layers are ejected is the extremely hot stellar core, which will slowly cool and fade as a <!--del_lnk--> white dwarf over many billions of years. This <!--del_lnk--> stellar evolution scenario is typical of low- to medium-mass stars.<p><a id="Structure" name="Structure"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Structure</span></h2>

      <p>While the Sun is an averaged-sized star, it contains approximately 99% of the total mass of the solar system. The Sun is a near-perfect <a href="../../wp/s/Sphere.htm" title="Sphere">sphere</a>, with an <!--del_lnk--> oblateness estimated at about 9 millionths, which means that its polar diameter differs from its equatorial diameter by only 10&nbsp;km. While the Sun does not rotate as a solid body (the rotational period is 25 days at the <!--del_lnk--> equator and about 35 days at the <!--del_lnk--> poles), it takes approximately 28 days to complete one full rotation; the centrifugal effect of this slow <!--del_lnk--> rotation is 18 million times weaker than the surface gravity at the Sun&#39;s equator. Tidal effects from the planets do not significantly affect the shape of the Sun, although the Sun itself orbits the <!--del_lnk--> centre of mass of the solar system, which is located nearly a solar radius away from the centre of the Sun mostly because of the large mass of <!--del_lnk--> Jupiter.<p>The Sun does not have a definite boundary as rocky planets do; the density of its gases drops approximately <!--del_lnk--> exponentially with increasing distance from the center of the Sun. Nevertheless, the Sun has a well-defined interior structure, described below. The Sun&#39;s radius is measured from its centre to the edge of the <!--del_lnk--> photosphere. This is simply the layer below which the gases are thick enough to be <!--del_lnk--> opaque but above which they are <!--del_lnk--> transparent; the photosphere is the surface most readily visible to the <!--del_lnk--> naked eye. Most of the Sun&#39;s mass lies within about 0.7 <!--del_lnk--> radii of the centre.<p>The solar interior is not directly observable, and the Sun itself is opaque to electromagnetic radiation. However, just as <!--del_lnk--> seismology uses waves generated by <a href="../../wp/e/Earthquake.htm" title="Earthquake">earthquakes</a> to reveal the interior structure of the Earth, the discipline of <!--del_lnk--> helioseismology makes use of pressure waves (<!--del_lnk--> infrasound) traversing the Sun&#39;s interior to measure and visualize the Sun&#39;s inner structure. <!--del_lnk--> Computer modeling of the Sun is also used as a theoretical tool to investigate its deeper layers.<p><a id="Core" name="Core"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Core</span></h3>
      <p>The core of the Sun is considered to extend from the centre to about 0.2 solar radii. It has a density of up to 150,000 kg/m<sup>3</sup> (150 times the density of water on Earth) and a temperature of close to 15,000,000 Kelvins (by contrast, the surface of the Sun is close to 6,000 Kelvins). Energy is produced by <!--del_lnk--> exothermic <!--del_lnk--> thermonuclear reactions (<!--del_lnk--> nuclear fusion) that mainly convert <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> into <a href="../../wp/h/Helium.htm" title="Helium">helium</a>, <a href="../../wp/h/Helium.htm" title="Helium">helium</a> into <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon.htm" title="Carbon">carbon</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon.htm" title="Carbon">carbon</a> into <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a>. The core is the only location in the Sun that produces an appreciable amount of <a href="../../wp/h/Heat.htm" title="Heat">heat</a> via fusion: the rest of the star is heated by energy that is transferred outward from the core. All of the energy produced by fusion in the core must travel through many successive layers to the solar photosphere before it escapes into space as <a href="../../wp/s/Sunlight.htm" title="Sunlight">sunlight</a> or <!--del_lnk--> kinetic energy of particles.<p>About 8.9&times;10<sup>37</sup> <a href="../../wp/p/Proton.htm" title="Proton">protons</a> (hydrogen nuclei) are converted into helium nuclei every second, releasing energy at the matter-energy conversion rate of 4.26 million tonnes per second, 383 <!--del_lnk--> yottawatts (383&times;10<sup>24</sup> W) or 9.15&times;10<sup>10</sup> <!--del_lnk--> megatons of <!--del_lnk--> TNT per second. The rate of nuclear fusion depends strongly on density, so the fusion rate in the core is in a self-correcting equilibrium: a slightly higher rate of fusion would cause the core to heat up more and <!--del_lnk--> expand slightly against the <!--del_lnk--> weight of the outer layers, reducing the fusion rate and correcting the <!--del_lnk--> perturbation; and a slightly lower rate would cause the core to cool and shrink slightly, increasing the fusion rate and again reverting it to its present level.<p>The high-energy <a href="../../wp/p/Photon.htm" title="Photon">photons</a> (gamma and X-rays) released in fusion reactions take a long time to reach the Sun&#39;s surface, slowed down by the indirect path taken, as well as by constant absorption and reemission at lower energies in the solar mantle. Estimates of the &quot;photon travel time&quot; range from as much as 50 million years to as little as 17,000 years. After a final trip through the convective outer layer to the transparent &quot;surface&quot; of the photosphere, the photons escape as <!--del_lnk--> visible light. Each gamma ray in the Sun&#39;s core is converted into several million visible light photons before escaping into space. <!--del_lnk--> Neutrinos are also released by the fusion reactions in the core, but unlike photons they very rarely interact with matter, so almost all are able to escape the Sun immediately. For many years measurements of the number of neutrinos produced in the Sun were <!--del_lnk--> much lower than theories predicted, a problem which was recently resolved through a better understanding of the effects of <!--del_lnk--> neutrino oscillation.<p><a id="Radiation_zone" name="Radiation_zone"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Radiation zone</span></h3>
      <p>From about 0.2 to about 0.7 solar radii, solar material is hot and dense enough that thermal radiation is sufficient to transfer the intense heat of the core outward. In this zone there is no thermal <!--del_lnk--> convection; while the material grows cooler as altitude increases, this temperature <!--del_lnk--> gradient is slower than the <!--del_lnk--> adiabatic lapse rate and hence cannot drive convection. Heat is transferred by <!--del_lnk--> radiation&mdash;<!--del_lnk--> ions of hydrogen and helium emit <!--del_lnk--> photons, which travel a brief distance before being reabsorbed by other ions.<p><a id="Convection_zone" name="Convection_zone"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Convection zone</span></h3>

      <p>From about 0.7 solar radii to the Sun&#39;s visible surface, the material in the Sun is not dense enough or hot enough to transfer the heat energy of the interior outward via radiation. As a result, thermal convection occurs as <!--del_lnk--> thermal columns carry hot material to the surface (photosphere) of the Sun. Once the material cools off at the surface, it plunges back downward to the base of the convection zone, to receive more heat from the top of the radiative zone. <!--del_lnk--> Convective overshoot is thought to occur at the base of the convection zone, carrying turbulent downflows into the outer layers of the radiative zone.<p>The thermal columns in the convection zone form an imprint on the surface of the Sun, in the form of the <!--del_lnk--> solar granulation and <!--del_lnk--> supergranulation. The turbulent convection of this outer part of the solar interior gives rise to a &quot;small-scale&quot; dynamo that produces magnetic north and south poles all over the surface of the Sun.<p><a id="Photosphere" name="Photosphere"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Photosphere</span></h3>
      <p>The visible surface of the Sun, the photosphere, is the layer below which the Sun becomes opaque to visible light. Above the photosphere visible sunlight is free to propagate into space, and its energy escapes the Sun entirely. The change in opacity is because of the decreasing overall particle density: the photosphere is actually tens to hundreds of kilometers thick, being slightly less opaque than <a href="../../wp/e/Earth%2527s_atmosphere.htm" title="Air">air</a> on Earth. Sunlight has approximately a <!--del_lnk--> black-body spectrum that indicates its temperature is about 6,000 <!--del_lnk--> K (10,340&deg;F / 5,727&nbsp;&deg;C), interspersed with atomic <!--del_lnk--> absorption lines from the tenuous layers above the photosphere. The photosphere has a particle density of about 10<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>&minus;3</sup> (this is about 1% of the particle density of <a href="../../wp/e/Earth%2527s_atmosphere.htm" title="Earth&#39;s atmosphere">Earth&#39;s atmosphere</a> at sea level).<p>During early studies of the <!--del_lnk--> optical spectrum of the photosphere, some absorption lines were found that did not correspond to any <a href="../../wp/c/Chemical_element.htm" title="Chemical element">chemical elements</a> then known on Earth. In 1868, <!--del_lnk--> Norman Lockyer hypothesized that these absorption lines were because of a new element which he dubbed &quot;<a href="../../wp/h/Helium.htm" title="Helium">helium</a>&quot;, after the Greek Sun god <!--del_lnk--> Helios. It was not until 25 years later that helium was isolated on Earth.<p><a id="Atmosphere" name="Atmosphere"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Atmosphere</span></h3>

      <p>The parts of the Sun above the photosphere are referred to collectively as the <i>solar atmosphere</i>. They can be viewed with telescopes operating across the <!--del_lnk--> electromagnetic spectrum, from radio through <!--del_lnk--> visible light to <!--del_lnk--> gamma rays, and comprise five principal zones: the <i>temperature minimum</i>, the <!--del_lnk--> chromosphere, the <!--del_lnk--> transition region, the <!--del_lnk--> corona, and the <!--del_lnk--> heliosphere. The heliosphere, which may be considered the tenuous outer atmosphere of the Sun, extends outward past the orbit of <a href="../../wp/p/Pluto.htm" title="Pluto">Pluto</a> to the <!--del_lnk--> heliopause, where it forms a sharp <!--del_lnk--> shock front boundary with the <!--del_lnk--> interstellar medium. The chromosphere, transition region, and corona are much hotter than the surface of the Sun; the reason why is not yet known.<p>The coolest layer of the Sun is a temperature minimum region about 500&nbsp;km above the photosphere, with a temperature of about 4,000&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> K. This part of the Sun is cool enough to support simple molecules such as <!--del_lnk--> carbon monoxide and water, which can be detected by their absorption spectra.<p>Above the temperature minimum layer is a thin layer about 2,000&nbsp;km thick, dominated by a spectrum of emission and absorption lines. It is called the <i>chromosphere</i> from the Greek root <i>chroma</i>, meaning colour, because the chromosphere is visible as a colored flash at the beginning and end of <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_eclipse.htm" title="Solar eclipse">total eclipses of the Sun</a>. The temperature in the chromosphere increases gradually with altitude, ranging up to around 100,000&nbsp;K near the top.<p>Above the chromosphere is a <!--del_lnk--> transition region in which the temperature rises rapidly from around 100,000&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> K to coronal temperatures closer to one million K. The increase is because of a <!--del_lnk--> phase transition as <a href="../../wp/h/Helium.htm" title="Helium">helium</a> within the region becomes fully <!--del_lnk--> ionized by the high temperatures. The transition region does not occur at a well-defined altitude. Rather, it forms a kind of <!--del_lnk--> nimbus around chromospheric features such as <!--del_lnk--> spicules and <!--del_lnk--> filaments, and is in constant, chaotic motion. The transition region is not easily visible from Earth&#39;s surface, but is readily observable from <!--del_lnk--> space by instruments sensitive to the <a href="../../wp/u/Ultraviolet.htm" title="Ultraviolet">far ultraviolet</a> portion of the <!--del_lnk--> spectrum.<p>The corona is the extended outer atmosphere of the Sun, which is much larger in volume than the Sun itself. The corona merges smoothly with the <!--del_lnk--> solar wind that fills the <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_System.htm" title="Solar system">solar system</a> and <!--del_lnk--> heliosphere. The low corona, which is very near the surface of the Sun, has a particle density of 10<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>&minus;3</sup>&ndash;10<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>&minus;3</sup>. (Earth&#39;s atmosphere near sea level has a particle density of about 2&times;10<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>&minus;3</sup>.) The temperature of the corona is several million kelvin. While no complete theory yet exists to account for the temperature of the corona, at least some of its heat is known to be from <!--del_lnk--> magnetic reconnection.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> heliosphere extends from approximately 20 solar radii (0.1&nbsp;AU) to the outer fringes of the solar system. Its inner boundary is defined as the layer in which the flow of the <!--del_lnk--> solar wind becomes <i>superalfv&eacute;nic</i>&mdash;that is, where the flow becomes faster than the speed of <!--del_lnk--> Alfv&eacute;n waves. Turbulence and dynamic forces outside this boundary cannot affect the shape of the solar corona within, because the information can only travel at the speed of Alfv&eacute;n waves. The solar wind travels outward continuously through the heliosphere, forming the solar magnetic field into a <!--del_lnk--> spiral shape, until it impacts the <!--del_lnk--> heliopause more than 50 AU from the Sun. In December 2004, the <!--del_lnk--> Voyager 1 probe passed through a <!--del_lnk--> shock front that is thought to be part of the heliopause. Both of the Voyager probes have recorded higher levels of energetic particles as they approach the boundary.<p><a id="Solar_activity" name="Solar_activity"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Solar activity</span></h2>

      <p>When observing the Sun with appropriate filtration, the most immediately visible features are usually its <!--del_lnk--> sunspots, which are well-defined surface areas that appear darker than their surroundings because of lower temperatures. Sunspots are regions of intense magnetic activity where <!--del_lnk--> convection is inhibited by strong magnetic fields, reducing energy transport from the hot interior to the surface. The magnetic field gives rise to strong heating in the corona, forming <!--del_lnk--> active regions that are the source of intense <!--del_lnk--> solar flares and <!--del_lnk--> coronal mass ejections. The largest sunspots can be tens of thousands of kilometers across.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The number of sunspots visible on the Sun is not constant, but varies over a 10-12 year cycle known as the <!--del_lnk--> Solar cycle. At a typical solar minimum, few sunspots are visible, and occasionally none at all can be seen. Those that do appear are at high solar latitudes. As the sunspot cycle progresses, the number of sunspots increases and they move closer to the equator of the Sun, a phenomenon described by <!--del_lnk--> Sp&ouml;rer&#39;s law. Sunspots usually exist as pairs with opposite magnetic polarity. The polarity of the leading sunspot alternates every solar cycle, so that it will be a north magnetic pole in one solar cycle and a south magnetic pole in the next.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The solar cycle has a great influence on <!--del_lnk--> space weather, and seems also to have a strong influence on the Earth&#39;s climate. Solar minima tend to be correlated with colder temperatures, and longer than average solar cycles tend to be correlated with hotter temperatures. In the 17th century, the solar cycle appears to have stopped entirely for several decades; very few sunspots were observed during this period. During this era, which is known as the <!--del_lnk--> Maunder minimum or <!--del_lnk--> Little Ice Age, Europe experienced very cold temperatures. Earlier extended minima have been discovered through analysis of <!--del_lnk--> tree rings and also appear to have coincided with lower-than-average global temperatures.<p><a id="Effects_on_Earth" name="Effects_on_Earth"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Effects on Earth</span></h3>
      <p>Solar activity has several effects on the Earth and its surroundings. Because the Earth has a magnetic field, charged particles from the solar wind cannot impact the atmosphere directly, but are instead deflected by the magnetic field and aggregate to form the <!--del_lnk--> Van Allen belts. The Van Allen belts consist of an inner belt composed primarily of <a href="../../wp/p/Proton.htm" title="Proton">protons</a> and an outer belt composed mostly of <a href="../../wp/e/Electron.htm" title="Electron">electrons</a>. Radiation within the Van Allen belts can occasionally damage <!--del_lnk--> satellites passing through them.<p>The Van Allen belts form arcs around the Earth with their tips near the north and south poles. The most energetic particles can &#39;leak out&#39; of the belts and strike the Earth&#39;s upper atmosphere, causing auroras, known as <i><!--del_lnk--> aurorae borealis</i> in the <!--del_lnk--> northern hemisphere and <i>aurorae australis</i> in the <!--del_lnk--> southern hemisphere. In periods of normal solar activity, aurorae can be seen in oval-shaped regions centered on the <!--del_lnk--> magnetic poles and lying roughly at a <!--del_lnk--> geomagnetic latitude of 65&deg;, but at times of high solar activity the auroral oval can expand greatly, moving towards the equator. Aurorae borealis have been observed from locales as far south as <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>.<p><a id="Theoretical_problems" name="Theoretical_problems"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Theoretical problems</span></h2>

      <p>For many years the number of solar <!--del_lnk--> electron neutrinos detected on Earth was only a third of the number expected, according to theories describing the nuclear reactions in the Sun. This anomalous result was termed the <!--del_lnk--> solar neutrino problem. Theories proposed to resolve the problem either tried to reduce the temperature of the Sun&#39;s interior to explain the lower neutrino flux, or posited that electron neutrinos could <!--del_lnk--> oscillate, that is, change into undetectable <!--del_lnk--> tau and <!--del_lnk--> muon neutrinos as they traveled between the Sun and the Earth. Several neutrino observatories were built in the 1980s to measure the solar neutrino flux as accurately as possible, including the <!--del_lnk--> Sudbury Neutrino Observatory and <!--del_lnk--> Kamiokande. Results from these observatories eventually led to the discovery that neutrinos have a very small <!--del_lnk--> rest mass and can indeed oscillate.. Moreover, the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory was able to detect all three types of neutrinos directly, and found that the Sun&#39;s <i>total</i> neutrino emission rate agreed with the Standard Solar Model, although only one-third of the neutrinos seen at Earth were of the electron type.<p><a id="Coronal_heating_problem" name="Coronal_heating_problem"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Coronal heating problem</span></h3>
      <p>The optical surface of the Sun (the <!--del_lnk--> photosphere) is known to have a temperature of approximately 6,000 <!--del_lnk--> K. Above it lies the solar corona at a temperature of 1,000,000&nbsp;K. The high temperature of the corona shows that it is heated by something other than direct heat <!--del_lnk--> conduction from the photosphere.<p>It is thought that the energy necessary to heat the corona is provided by turbulent motion in the convection zone below the photosphere, and two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain coronal heating. The first is <a href="../../wp/w/Wave.htm" title="Wave">wave</a> heating, in which sound, gravitational and magnetohydrodynamic waves are produced by turbulence in the convection zone. These waves travel upward and dissipate in the corona, depositing their energy in the ambient gas in the form of heat. The other is <!--del_lnk--> magnetic heating, in which magnetic energy is continuously built up by photospheric motion and released through <!--del_lnk--> magnetic reconnection in the form of large <!--del_lnk--> solar flares and myriad similar but smaller events.<p>Currently, it is unclear whether waves are an efficient heating mechanism. All waves except Alfven waves have been found to dissipate or refract before reaching the corona. In addition, Alfv&eacute;n waves do not easily dissipate in the corona. Current research focus has therefore shifted towards flare heating mechanisms. One possible candidate to explain coronal heating is continuous flaring at small scales, but this remains an open topic of investigation.<p><a id="Faint_young_sun_problem" name="Faint_young_sun_problem"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Faint young sun problem</span></h3>

      <p>Theoretical models of the sun&#39;s development suggest that 3.8 to 2.5 billion years ago, during the <!--del_lnk--> Archean period, the Sun was only about 75% as bright as it is today. Such a weak star would not have been able to sustain liquid water on the Earth&#39;s surface, and thus life should not have been able to develop. However, the geological record demonstrates that the Earth has remained at a fairly constant temperature throughout its history, and in fact that the young Earth was somewhat warmer than it is today.

But satellite observations show that it is about 100 times greater at around 10<sup>-9</sup> tesla. <!--del_lnk--> Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) theory predicts that the motion of a conducting fluid (e.g., the interplanetary medium) in a magnetic field, induces electric currents which in turn generates magnetic fields, and in this respect it behaves like an <!--del_lnk--> MHD dynamo.<p><a id="History_of_solar_observation" name="History_of_solar_observation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History of solar observation</span></h2>

      <p>Humanity&#39;s most fundamental understanding of the Sun is as the luminous disk in the <!--del_lnk--> heavens, whose presence above the <!--del_lnk--> horizon creates day and whose absence causes night. In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the Sun was thought to be a <!--del_lnk--> solar deity or other <!--del_lnk--> supernatural phenomenon, and <!--del_lnk--> worship of the Sun was central to civilizations such as the <a href="../../wp/i/Inca_Empire.htm" title="Inca">Inca</a> of <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a> and the <a href="../../wp/a/Aztec.htm" title="Aztec">Aztecs</a> of what is now <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. Many ancient monuments were constructed with solar phenomena in mind; for example, stone <!--del_lnk--> megaliths accurately mark the <!--del_lnk--> summer solstice (some of the most prominent megaliths are located in <!--del_lnk--> Nabta Playa, <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, and at <a href="../../wp/s/Stonehenge.htm" title="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a> in <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>); the pyramid of <!--del_lnk--> El Castillo at <!--del_lnk--> Chich&eacute;n Itz&aacute; in Mexico is designed to cast shadows in the shape of serpents climbing the pyramid at the vernal and autumn <!--del_lnk--> equinoxes. With respect to the <!--del_lnk--> fixed stars, the Sun appears from Earth to revolve once a year along the <!--del_lnk--> ecliptic through the <!--del_lnk--> zodiac, and so the Sun was considered by Greek astronomers to be one of the seven <a href="../../wp/p/Planet.htm" title="Planet">planets</a> (Greek <i>planetes</i>, &quot;wanderer&quot;), after which the seven days of the <!--del_lnk--> week are named in some languages.<p><a id="Development_of_modern_scientific_understanding" name="Development_of_modern_scientific_understanding"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Development of modern scientific understanding</span></h3>

      <p>One of the first people in the Western world to offer a scientific explanation for the sun was the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Greek</a> <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosopher">philosopher</a> <!--del_lnk--> Anaxagoras, who reasoned that it was a giant flaming ball of metal even larger than the <!--del_lnk--> Peloponnesus, and not the <!--del_lnk--> chariot of <!--del_lnk--> Helios. For teaching this <!--del_lnk--> heresy, he was imprisoned by the authorities and <!--del_lnk--> sentenced to death (though later released through the intervention of <a href="../../wp/p/Pericles.htm" title="Pericles">Pericles</a>). <!--del_lnk--> Eratosthenes might have been the first person to have accurately calculated the distance from the Earth to the Sun, in the 3rd century BCE, as 149 million kilometers, roughly the same as the modern accepted figure.<p>Another scientist to challenge the accepted view was <a href="../../wp/n/Nicolaus_Copernicus.htm" title="Nicolaus Copernicus">Nicolaus Copernicus</a>, who in the 16th century developed the theory that the Earth orbited the Sun, rather than the other way around. In the early 17th century, <!--del_lnk--> Galileo pioneered <a href="../../wp/t/Telescope.htm" title="Telescope">telescopic</a> observations of the Sun, making some of the first known observations of sunspots and positing that they were on the surface of the Sun rather than small objects passing between the Earth and the Sun. <a href="../../wp/i/Isaac_Newton.htm" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a> observed the Sun&#39;s light using a <!--del_lnk--> prism, and showed that it was made up of light of many colors, while in 1800 <!--del_lnk--> William Herschel discovered <!--del_lnk--> infrared radiation beyond the red part of the solar spectrum. The 1800s saw spectroscopic studies of the Sun advance, and <!--del_lnk--> Joseph von Fraunhofer made the first observations of <!--del_lnk--> absorption lines in the spectrum, the strongest of which are still often referred to as Fraunhofer lines.<p>In the early years of the modern scientific era, the source of the Sun&#39;s energy was a significant puzzle. <!--del_lnk--> Lord Kelvin suggested that the Sun was a gradually cooling liquid body that was radiating an internal store of heat. Kelvin and <!--del_lnk--> Hermann von Helmholtz then proposed the <!--del_lnk--> Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism to explain the energy output. Unfortunately the resulting age estimate was only 20 million years, well short of the time span of several billion years suggested by geology. In 1890 <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Lockyer, the discoverer of helium in the solar spectrum, proposed a meteoritic hypothesis for the formation and evolution of the sun. Another proposal was that the Sun extracted its energy from friction of its gas masses.<p>It would be 1904 before a potential solution was offered. <a href="../../wp/e/Ernest_Rutherford.htm" title="Ernest Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a> suggested that the energy could be maintained by an internal source of heat, and suggested <!--del_lnk--> radioactive decay as the source. However it would be <a href="../../wp/a/Albert_Einstein.htm" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> who would provide the essential clue to the source of a Sun&#39;s energy with his mass-energy relation <!--del_lnk--> E=mc&sup2;. In 1920 Sir <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Eddington proposed that the pressures and temperatures at the core of the Sun could produce a nuclear fusion reaction that merged hydrogen into helium, resulting in a production of energy from the net change in mass. This theoretical concept was developed in the 1930s by the astrophysicists <!--del_lnk--> Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and <!--del_lnk--> Hans Bethe. Hans Bethe calculated the details of the two main energy-producing nuclear reactions that power the Sun.<p>Finally, in 1957, a paper titled <i>Synthesis of the Elements in Stars</i> was published that demonstrated convincingly that most of the elements in the universe had been created by nuclear reactions inside stars like the Sun.<p><a id="Solar_space_missions" name="Solar_space_missions"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Solar space missions</span></h3>

      <p>The first satellites designed to observe the Sun were <!--del_lnk--> NASA&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Pioneers 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, which were launched between 1959 and 1968. These probes orbited the Sun at a distance similar to that of the Earth&#39;s orbit, and made the first detailed measurements of the solar wind and the solar magnetic field. Pioneer 9 operated for a particularly long period of time, transmitting data until 1987.<p>In the 1970s, <!--del_lnk--> Helios 1 and the <!--del_lnk--> Skylab <!--del_lnk--> Apollo Telescope Mount provided scientists with significant new data on solar wind and the solar corona. The Helios 1 satellite was a joint <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">U.S.</a>-<!--del_lnk--> German probe that studied the solar wind from an orbit carrying the spacecraft inside <a href="../../wp/m/Mercury_%2528planet%2529.htm" title="Mercury (planet)">Mercury</a>&#39;s orbit at <!--del_lnk--> perihelion. The Skylab space station, launched by NASA in 1973, included a solar <!--del_lnk--> observatory module called the Apollo Telescope Mount that was operated by astronauts resident on the station. Skylab made the first time-resolved observations of the solar transition region and of ultraviolet emissions from the solar corona. Discoveries included the first observations of <!--del_lnk--> coronal mass ejections, then called &quot;coronal transients&quot;, and of <!--del_lnk--> coronal holes, now known to be intimately associated with the <!--del_lnk--> solar wind.<p>In 1980, the <!--del_lnk--> Solar Maximum Mission was launched by <!--del_lnk--> NASA. This spacecraft was designed to observe <!--del_lnk--> gamma rays, <!--del_lnk--> X-rays and <!--del_lnk--> UV radiation from <!--del_lnk--> solar flares during a time of high solar activity. Just a few months after launch, however, an electronics failure caused the probe to go into standby mode, and it spent the next three years in this inactive state. In 1984 <!--del_lnk--> Space Shuttle <!--del_lnk--> Challenger mission STS-41C retrieved the satellite and repaired its electronics before re-releasing it into orbit. The Solar Maximum Mission subsequently acquired thousands of images of the solar corona before <!--del_lnk--> re-entering the Earth&#39;s atmosphere in June 1989.<p><a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Yohkoh (<i>Sunbeam</i>) satellite, launched in 1991, observed solar flares at X-ray wavelengths. Mission data allowed scientists to identify several different types of flares, and also demonstrated that the corona away from regions of peak activity was much more dynamic and active than had previously been supposed. Yohkoh observed an entire solar cycle but went into standby mode when an <!--del_lnk--> annular eclipse in 2001 caused it to lose its lock on the Sun. It was destroyed by atmospheric reentry in 2005.<p>One of the most important solar missions to date has been the <!--del_lnk--> Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, jointly built by the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Space_Agency.htm" title="European Space Agency">European Space Agency</a> and <!--del_lnk--> NASA and launched on <!--del_lnk--> December 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1995. Originally a two-year mission, SOHO has now operated for over ten years (as of 2006). It has proved so useful that a follow-on mission, the <!--del_lnk--> Solar Dynamics Observatory, is planned for launch in 2008. Situated at the <!--del_lnk--> Lagrangian point between the Earth and the Sun (at which the gravitational pull from both is equal), SOHO has provided a constant view of the Sun at many wavelengths since its launch. In addition to its direct solar observation, SOHO has enabled the discovery of large numbers of comets, mostly very tiny <!--del_lnk--> sungrazing comets which incinerate as they pass the Sun.<p>All these satellites have observed the Sun from the plane of the ecliptic, and so have only observed its equatorial regions in detail. The <!--del_lnk--> Ulysses probe was launched in 1990 to study the Sun&#39;s polar regions. It first traveled to <a href="../../wp/j/Jupiter.htm" title="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>, to &#39;slingshot&#39; past the planet into an orbit which would take it far above the plane of the ecliptic. Serendipitously, it was well-placed to observe the collision of <a href="../../wp/c/Comet_Shoemaker-Levy_9.htm" title="Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9">Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9</a> with Jupiter in 1994. Once Ulysses was in its scheduled orbit, it began observing the solar wind and magnetic field strength at high solar latitudes, finding that the solar wind from high latitudes was moving at about 750&nbsp;km/s (slower than expected), and that there were large magnetic waves emerging from high latitudes which scattered galactic <!--del_lnk--> cosmic rays.<p>Elemental abundances in the photosphere are well known from <!--del_lnk--> spectroscopic studies, but the composition of the interior of the Sun is more poorly understood. A <!--del_lnk--> solar wind sample return mission, <!--del_lnk--> Genesis, was designed to allow astronomers to directly measure the composition of solar material. Genesis returned to <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a> in 2004 but was damaged by a crash landing after its <!--del_lnk--> parachute failed to deploy on reentry into Earth&#39;s atmosphere. Despite severe damage, some usable samples have been recovered from the spacecraft&#39;s sample return module and are undergoing analysis.<p><a id="Sun_observation_and_eye_damage" name="Sun_observation_and_eye_damage"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sun observation and eye damage</span></h2>
      <p>Sunlight is very bright, and looking directly at the Sun with the <!--del_lnk--> naked eye for brief periods can be painful, but is generally not hazardous. Looking directly at the Sun causes <!--del_lnk--> phosphene visual artifacts and temporary partial blindness. It also delivers about 4&nbsp;milliwatts of sunlight to the retina, slightly heating it and potentially (though not normally) damaging it. <a href="../../wp/u/Ultraviolet.htm" title="Ultraviolet">UV</a> exposure gradually yellows the lens of the eye over a period of years and can cause <!--del_lnk--> cataracts, but those depend on general exposure to solar UV, not on whether one looks directly at the Sun.<p>Viewing the Sun through light-concentrating <!--del_lnk--> optics such as <a href="../../wp/b/Binoculars.htm" title="Binoculars">binoculars</a> is very hazardous without an <!--del_lnk--> attenuating (ND) filter to dim the sunlight. Unfiltered binoculars can deliver over 500 times more sunlight to the retina than does the naked eye, killing retinal cells almost instantly. Even brief glances at the midday Sun through unfiltered binoculars can cause permanent blindness. One way to view the Sun safely is by projecting an image onto a screen using binoculars. This should only be done with a small refracting telescope (or binoculars) with a clean eyepiece. Other kinds of telescope can be damaged by this procedure.<p>Partial <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_eclipse.htm" title="Solar eclipse">solar eclipses</a> are hazardous to view because the eye&#39;s <a href="../../wp/p/Pupil.htm" title="Pupil">pupil</a> is not adapted to the unusually high visual contrast: the pupil dilates according to the total amount of light in the field of view, <i>not</i> by the brightest object in the field. During partial eclipses most sunlight is blocked by the Moon passing in front of the Sun, but the uncovered parts of the photosphere have the same <!--del_lnk--> surface brightness as during a normal day. In the overall gloom, the pupil expands from ~2&nbsp;mm to ~6&nbsp;mm, and each retinal cell exposed to the solar image receives about ten times more light than it would looking at the non-eclipsed sun. This can damage or kill those cells, resulting in small permanent blind spots for the viewer. The hazard is insidious for inexperienced observers and for children, because there is no perception of pain: it is not immediately obvious that one&#39;s vision is being destroyed.<p>During <!--del_lnk--> sunrise and <!--del_lnk--> sunset, sunlight is attenuated through <!--del_lnk--> rayleigh and <!--del_lnk--> mie scattering of light by a particularly long passage through Earth&#39;s atmosphere, and the direct Sun is sometimes faint enough to be viewed directly without discomfort or safely with binoculars (provided there is no risk of bright sunlight suddenly appearing in a break between clouds). Hazy conditions, atmospheric dust, and high humidity contribute to this atmospheric attenuation.<p>Attenuating filters to view the Sun should be specifically designed for that use: some improvised filters pass UV or IR rays that can harm the eye at high brightness levels. In general, filters on telescopes or binoculars should be on the <!--del_lnk--> objective lens or <!--del_lnk--> aperture rather than on the <!--del_lnk--> eyepiece, because eyepiece filters can suddenly shatter due to high heat loads from the absorbed sunlight. Welding glass is an acceptable solar filter, but &quot;black&quot; exposed photographic film is not (it passes too much infrared).<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun&quot;</div>
