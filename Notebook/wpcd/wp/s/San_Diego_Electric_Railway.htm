      <p>The <b>San Diego Electric Railway</b> (<b>SDERy</b>) was a <!--del_lnk--> mass transit system in <!--del_lnk--> Southern California using <!--del_lnk--> streetcars and (in later years) <!--del_lnk--> buses. The SDERy was established by &quot;sugar heir,&quot; developer, and entrepreneur <!--del_lnk--> John D. Spreckels in <!--del_lnk--> 1892. The railroad&#39;s original network consisted of 5 routes, delineated as follows:<ul>
       <li>the Fifth Street and Logan Heights Lines;<li>the First and &quot;D&quot; Streets Lines;<li>the Depot Line;<li>the Ferry Line; and<li>the &quot;K&quot; Street Shuttle.</ul>
      <p>The company would establish additional operating divisions as traffic demands led to the formation of new lines. The company also engaged in limited freight handling primarily as an interchange with Spreckels&#39; <a href="../../wp/s/San_Diego_and_Arizona_Railway.htm" title="San Diego and Arizona Railway">San Diego and Arizona Railway</a> (SD&amp;A) from <!--del_lnk--> 1923 to <!--del_lnk--> 1929.<p>At its peak, the SDERy&#39;s routes would operate throughout the greater <!--del_lnk--> San Diego area over some 165 <!--del_lnk--> miles (266 <!--del_lnk--> kilometers) of track. Steadily-declining ridership, due in large part to the phenomenal rise in popularity of the automobile, ultimately led the company to discontinue all streetcar service in favour of bus routes in <!--del_lnk--> 1949. The demise of some streetcar companies in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> has been tied by some to the alleged <!--del_lnk--> General Motors streetcar conspiracy, in which a consortium of <!--del_lnk--> General Motors, <!--del_lnk--> Standard Oil, and others formed a front company, <!--del_lnk--> National City Lines, in order to buy streetcar lines, shut them down, and replace them with buses. The plot of <!--del_lnk--> Touchstone Pictures&#39; <!--del_lnk--> 1988 film <i><!--del_lnk--> Who Framed Roger Rabbit</i> is loosely based on this theory.<p>The few surviving pieces of rolling stock are on display at the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Southwest Railway Museum in Campo, the <!--del_lnk--> San Diego Electric Railway Association in <!--del_lnk--> National City, and the <!--del_lnk--> Orange Empire Railway Museum in <!--del_lnk--> Perris, California.<dl>
       <dd>&quot;<i>Before you can hope to get people to live anywhere...you must first of all show them that they can get there quickly, comfortably, and above all, cheaply. Transportation determines the flow of population.</i>&quot; <b>J.D. Spreckels</b></dl>

The <i>Third Avenue Streetcar Line</i> begins operation. The SDERy logs 798,152 car miles.<li><!--del_lnk--> 1907: The Third Avenue Streetcar Line is extended to the future community of <!--del_lnk--> Mission Hills, and is briefly renamed the <i>Mission Hills Line</i>.<li><!--del_lnk--> 1910: Spreckels forces a ballot initiative to amend his charter with the City of San Diego to give him more than 25 years on his leases to operate streetcar service. With this greater security he is able to acquire major loans for service expansion and infrastructure.<li><!--del_lnk--> 1911: The Imperial Avenue operating division is established in downtown. Spreckels builds second power generating plant at Kettner Boulevard and &quot;E&quot; Street when the plant built in 1905 can no longer provide sufficient capacity.<li><!--del_lnk--> 1913: Construction of a new brick car barn located at Adams Avenue and Florida Street is completed.<li><!--del_lnk--> December 31, <!--del_lnk--> 1914: The SDERy owns 38.9 miles of single track and 22.4 miles of double track, for a total of 83.7 miles of &quot;equivalent single track.&quot;<li><!--del_lnk--> 1915: The <!--del_lnk--> Panama-California Exposition in <!--del_lnk--> Balboa Park spurs the next phase of transportation growth. A new electric car line is constructed up 12th Street to the Park&#39;s entrance with 101 new cars from the <!--del_lnk--> St. Louis Car Company and the Adams Avenue operating division is established in <!--del_lnk--> Normal Heights. San Diego&#39;s original <!--del_lnk--> Victorian style train depot is demolished and replaced with a new <!--del_lnk--> Mission Revival Style <!--del_lnk--> Santa Fe depot building. The SDERy logs 3,521,571 car miles.<li><!--del_lnk--> 1916: The &quot;Great Flood&quot; washes out several rail lines. <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> increases the cost of railway construction materials by 50 to 150 percent. There is a significant increase in the private ownership of automobiles and the <i>SDERy</i> begins to lose revenue to private &quot;Jitney Buses.&quot;<li><!--del_lnk--> November 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1919: The &quot;golden spike&quot; is driven and construction of the SD&amp;A is ceremonially completed at a cost of $18 million (three times the original estimate).<li><!--del_lnk--> 1920: Spreckels announces plans to discontinue service on several rail lines to offset expenses, leading to approval of &quot;zone fares&quot;. The SDERy purchases new streetcars that requires only one driver/conductor instead of two; older cars are retrofitted to reduce labor costs. Spreckels sells his power generating plants to the <b>Consolidated Gas and Electric Company</b>.<li><!--del_lnk--> 1921: The first motor bus goes into service operating between <!--del_lnk--> National City and <!--del_lnk--> Chula Vista. &quot;Number One&quot; has hard rubber tires, two-wheel mechanical brakes, a four-cylinder engine, and a plywood body.<li><!--del_lnk--> March 17, <!--del_lnk--> 1923: The SDERy begins its last major rail line expansion to <!--del_lnk--> Mission Beach (&quot;Belmont Park&quot;), <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Beach, and <!--del_lnk--> La Jolla. $2.5 million is spent on rails, Mission Revival Style terminals and substations, and <!--del_lnk--> Egyptian Revival Style stations, and $800,000 is spent on the acquisition of 50 new cars. Construction is completed in <!--del_lnk--> 1925.<li><!--del_lnk--> December 18, 1923: Car No. 400, an all-steel model with a closed body and the first on the SDERy to feature a <!--del_lnk--> pantograph-type current collector, is delivered. All 50 pantograph-equipped cars would eventually have trolley poles installed at each end due to the pantographs&#39; poor performance.<li><!--del_lnk--> 1930: Buses begin to replace street cars from <!--del_lnk--> Ocean Beach to <!--del_lnk--> La Jolla, and 222 new buses are added to the fleet. Ridership and revenue goes down but the SDERy is able to weather the economic downturn.<li><!--del_lnk--> 1935: The <!--del_lnk--> California Pacific International Exposition opens in <!--del_lnk--> Balboa Park without the need for expanded transit service.<li><!--del_lnk--> 1936: The <i>SDERy</i> orders 25 single-end <!--del_lnk--> Presidents Conference Committee (P.C.C.) cars from the <!--del_lnk--> St. Louis Car Company, becoming the first streetcar system in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> to utilize <!--del_lnk--> streamlined units. The cars are designated as Class 6. An order for 3 additional units is placed the following year.<li><!--del_lnk--> 1941: <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> turns San Diego into a &quot;boom town&quot; again. Defense related industries revitalize the city, as does an influx of military personnel. Ridership on public transit increases 600 percent during the war years. Used transit vehicles are purchased from around the nation, and more electrical power is needed and substations are built (one in the basement of the Spreckels Theatre Building on Broadway). The $2.5 million rail line built in the <!--del_lnk--> 1920s to the beaches is ripped out along with the elaborate stations and terminals and replaced with a bus line.<li><!--del_lnk--> 1942: The combined streetcar and bus lines carry 94 million people. Additional streetcars are brought in on loan from <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Salt_Lake_City%252C_Utah.htm" title="Salt Lake City, Utah">Salt Lake City, Utah</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania to help keep up with demand.<li><!--del_lnk--> 1944: Combined ridership increases lead to more than 146 million trips.<li><!--del_lnk--> 1945: Cars No. 502 and No. 503 are painted red and blue (in lieu of the standard golden yellow) to the <!--del_lnk--> American Red Cross blood donation campaign.<li><!--del_lnk--> 1946: The <i>SDERy</i> begins to phase out <!--del_lnk--> streetcar lines and replace them with <!--del_lnk--> bus routes. By the following year, only 3 street car lines will remain in operation.<li><!--del_lnk--> July 26, <!--del_lnk--> 1948: The <b>Western Transit Company (WTC)</b> purchases the SDERy.<li>August 1948: 13 new 45-passenger buses are placed into service.<li><!--del_lnk--> September 9, 1948: The WTC announces that the SDERy will henceforth be known as the <b>San Diego Transit System (SDTS)</b>, for $5.5 million. A new emblem (consisting of a pair of wings with a shield in the centre) and slogan, <i>&quot;Safety, Courtesy, Service,&quot;</i> are adopted.<li><!--del_lnk--> January 13, <!--del_lnk--> 1949: The SDTS borrows $720,000 for the purchase of additional new buses, and makes an application to the State <!--del_lnk--> Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to discontinue streetcar service.<li><!--del_lnk--> March 3, 1949: The PUC grants authority to the SDTS to abandon its remaining streetcar lines.<li><!--del_lnk--> March 27, 1949: A &quot;farewell to the streetcars&quot; excursion, operated over the remaining trackage, is sponsored by the <b>Pacific Railroad Society</b> of Los Angeles.<li><!--del_lnk--> April 23, 1949: 45 new <!--del_lnk--> GM buses (each costing $20,000) parade down Broadway to mark the retirement of the street cars; free rides are offered during the procession.<li><!--del_lnk--> April 24, 1949: Rail service on the <i>SDERy</i> comes to an end at 5:45 a.m. as Car No. 446 pulls into the Adams Avenue car barn, making San Diego the first major <!--del_lnk--> Southwestern United States city to eliminate streetcars and convert to an all-bus transit system.<li><!--del_lnk--> May 23, 1949: Work crews begin removing the overhead trolley lines and tracks on the loop at downtown&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Union Station.<li><!--del_lnk--> 1950: 17 of the P.C.C. model cars are sold to the <b>El Paso City Lines (EPCL)</b> for service on the international loop between <!--del_lnk--> El Paso, Texas and the Mexican border town of <!--del_lnk--> Juarez, <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>.<li><!--del_lnk--> 1952: Three more P.C.C.&#39;s are sold to EPCL. All remaining Class 5 cars and the 3 &quot;service&quot; cars are purchased by the Allied Salvage Company for scrap.<li>August <!--del_lnk--> 1957: The 8 remaining P.C.C.&#39;s are purchased by the San Diego Mill Supply Company. Car No. 508 is acquired by the <b>Orange Empire Traction Company</b> for display at its museum in <!--del_lnk--> Perris, California, and Car No. 528 is obtained by the <b>Railway Historical Society</b> of San Diego for preservation and exhibition.<li><!--del_lnk--> July 19, <!--del_lnk--> 1981: After years of planning and development, the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> San Diego Trolley&quot; (a new <!--del_lnk--> interurban <!--del_lnk--> light rail mass transit system) makes its inaugural run on the 15.9-mile long &quot;South Line&quot; between the U.S. International Border and Centre City San Diego.<li><!--del_lnk--> July 26, 1981: The San Diego Trolley begins revenue service; San Diego will become known in transit circles as &quot;<i>The city that started the &#39;light rail craze&#39; in the United States.</i>&quot;<li><!--del_lnk--> February 14, <!--del_lnk--> 2005: The <!--del_lnk--> San Diego Electric Railway Association salvages the body shell of Car No. 357 (formerly of the <!--del_lnk--> Bellingham, Washington streetcar system) from a Centre City San Diego restaurant site where it had been used as a &quot;dining room&quot; since 1972.<li><!--del_lnk--> December 14, 2005: The <b>San Diego Vintage Trolley Co.</b> purchases two former <!--del_lnk--> San Francisco Municipal Railway PCC cars.
