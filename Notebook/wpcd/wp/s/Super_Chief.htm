      <p>The <i><b>Super Chief</b></i> was one of the <!--del_lnk--> named <a href="../../wp/t/Train.htm" title="Train">passenger trains</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> flagship of the <!--del_lnk--> Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. It was often referred to as &quot;The Train of the Stars&quot; because of the many celebrities who traveled on the streamliner between <a href="../../wp/c/Chicago.htm" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago, Illinois</a> and <a href="../../wp/l/Los_Angeles%252C_California.htm" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles, California</a>.<p>The streamlined <i>Super Chief</i> (assigned train Nos. 17 &amp; 18) was the first diesel-powered, all-<!--del_lnk--> Pullman <!--del_lnk--> sleeping car train in America, and it eclipsed the <i>Chief</i> as Santa Fe&#39;s standard bearer. The extra-fare <i>Super Chief-1</i> commenced its maiden run from <!--del_lnk--> Dearborn Station in Chicago on <!--del_lnk--> May 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1936. Just over a year later, on <!--del_lnk--> May 18, <!--del_lnk--> 1937 the much-improved <i>Super Chief-2</i> traversed the 2,227.3 <!--del_lnk--> miles (3,584.5 <!--del_lnk--> kilometers) from Los Angeles over recently upgraded tracks in just 39 hours and 49 minutes (averaging 60.8 miles-per-hour (90.0 km/h), often exceeding 100 miles-per-hour in the process).<p>With only one set of equipment, the train initially operated but once a week from both Chicago and Los Angeles. From that day forward the <i>Super Chief</i> set a new standard for luxury rail travel in America. At the height of its popularity, the trains of the <i>Super Chief</i> would make daily departures from both ends of the line. Adding to the train&#39;s mystique were its gourmet meals and <!--del_lnk--> Hollywood clientele.<p>Direct competitors to the <i>Super Chief</i> during its lifetime were the <i><!--del_lnk--> City of Los Angeles</i>, a streamlined passenger train jointly operated by the <a href="../../wp/c/Chicago_and_North_Western_Railway.htm" title="Chicago and North Western Railway">Chicago and North Western Railway</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Union Pacific Railroad, and (to a lesser extent) the <i><!--del_lnk--> Golden State</i>, a streamlined passenger train jointly operated by the <!--del_lnk--> Rock Island and <!--del_lnk--> Southern Pacific railroads. Santa Fe&#39;s route from Chicago to Los Angeles was the lengthiest of the high-speed, long distance trains of the day, making its way through mostly sparsely populated areas (which enhanced the train&#39;s already distinctive aura). The Santa Fe Super Chief was the last passenger train in the United States to carry an all-Pullman consist.<p>When <a href="../../wp/a/Amtrak.htm" title="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> took over operation of the nation&#39;s passenger service on <!--del_lnk--> May 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1971 it ended the 35-year run of the <i>Super Chief</i> on the Santa Fe, though Amtrak would continue to use the name for another three years. In 1974 the Santa Fe forced Amtrak to drop the trains name due to a perceived decline in service. Amtrak replaced the train over the same route with its <i><!--del_lnk--> Southwest Limited</i>. Later the Santa Fe compromised with Amtrak and the train became the <i><!--del_lnk--> Southwest Chief</i> in 1984.<p>

       <li>August <!--del_lnk--> 1935: <!--del_lnk--> General Motors Electro-Motive Division (EMD) delivers two blunt-nosed diesel-electric units Nos. 1 and 1A, which would ultimately power the <i>Super Chief</i>.<li><!--del_lnk--> September 9, <!--del_lnk--> 1935: Nos. 1 and 1A make their first test run under load with eight heavyweight passenger cars and a <!--del_lnk--> dynamometer car.<li><!--del_lnk--> May 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1936: The <!--del_lnk--> Santa Fe inaugurates the all-diesel powered <i>Super Chief-1</i> amid much fanfare. <!--del_lnk--> Eleanor Powell, <!--del_lnk--> Hollywood&#39;s legendary dancer, christens it &quot;The Train of the Stars.&quot; <li><!--del_lnk--> May 10, <!--del_lnk--> 1937: The last of four &quot;preview&quot; runs of the <i>Super Chief-2</i>, which utilizes an improved 3,600 hp (2.7 MW), two-unit, streamlined diesel locomotive set built by EMD as motive power, concludes as the train pulls into Los Angeles. All heavyweight wood cars used on the <i>Super Chief</i> are replaced with lightweight stainless steel cars. The general public is invited to tour the new train at Santa Fe&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> La Grande Station on <!--del_lnk--> May 11 and <!--del_lnk--> 12.<li><!--del_lnk--> May 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1937: The <i>Super Chief-2</i> departs Los Angeles at 7:30 p.m. PST. The train completes its maiden run in just 36 hours and 49 minutes (2 hours and 56 minutes ahead of schedule), setting a new Santa Fe speed record in the process, one that would never be broken. It would subsequently be determined that both of the new E1 units suffered mechanical damage during the trip east, and they would be taken out of service for repairs.<li><!--del_lnk--> May 18, <!--del_lnk--> 1937: The <i>Super Chief-2</i> commences its first regular run, led by Unit 1A and EMD demonstrator Unit 512 (a.k.a. AT&amp;SF Unit 1C), as it departs Chicago&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Dearborn Station. The passenger list includes <!--del_lnk--> ventriloquist <!--del_lnk--> Edgar Bergen and his &quot;sidekick&quot; <!--del_lnk--> Charlie McCarthy.<li>January <!--del_lnk--> 1938: E1 Units 3 and 3A are added to the Santa Fe roster and placed into service on the <i>Super Chief-2</i>.<li><!--del_lnk--> February 26, <!--del_lnk--> 1938: A &quot;borrowed&quot; six-car <i><!--del_lnk--> Chief</i> consist begins operating as the <i>Super Chief-2&frac12;</i> due to production delays in order to provide twice-weekly service on the line.<li><!--del_lnk--> July 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1938: A second, all-lightweight trainset built by <!--del_lnk--> Pullman-Standard enters service as the <i>Super Chief-3</i> and officially replaces the <i>Super Chief-2&frac12;</i>.<li><!--del_lnk--> 1941: The Santa Fe takes delivery of its only 2,000 hp (1.5 MW) <!--del_lnk--> ALCO DL-109/<!--del_lnk--> 110 model locomotives, Units 50 and 50A respectively, which become the primary motive power for the <i>Super Chief-3</i>.<li><!--del_lnk--> July 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1942: The <i>Super Chief</i> goes on a wartime schedule of 41 hours, 45 minutes. Consist size expands to 12 cars, and each logs 636 daily miles.<li><!--del_lnk--> June 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1946: The line reverts to its prewar schedule of 39 hours and 45 minutes.<li><!--del_lnk--> September 29, <!--del_lnk--> 1946: The <i>Super Chief</i> begins an every-other-day departure schedule from Chicago and Los Angeles. <li><!--del_lnk--> January 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1948: Locomotive #19L, leading the <i>Super Chief</i>, loses braking ability while preparing to depart Los Angeles&#39; Union Passenger Terminal (<!--del_lnk--> LAUPT). The train crashes through a steel bumper post and then a concrete wall located at the end of the dead-end track, and ultimately comes to rest with the front half of the locomotive dangling 20 feet (6 m) above the street below. Although there are no injuries, the engineer loses his job over the incident.<li><!--del_lnk--> February 29, <!--del_lnk--> 1948: The AT&amp;SF receives the first post-War equipment order from Pullman-Standard and places these into service on the <i>Super Chief</i>. The railroad now has five <i>Super Chief</i> trainsets and the frequency of operation is upgraded to daily.<li><!--del_lnk--> December 29, <!--del_lnk--> 1949: Train No. 17, led by locomotive set #37L/A/B/C, collides with a tanker truck in <!--del_lnk--> Azusa, California. All four locomotives, baggage car #3409, and railway post office #88 are damaged by fire.<li><!--del_lnk--> 1950&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 1951: The <i>Super Chief</i> is reequipped with new sleeping cars built by the Budd Company and the <!--del_lnk--> American Car and Foundry Company (ACF), and dining cars from Pullman-Standard. Santa Fe also adds the Pullman-built &quot;Pleasure <!--del_lnk--> Dome&quot;-Lounge car (one of the most luxurious ever made for any train) to its <i>Super Chief</i> consists, billing it as the &quot;<i>...only dome car between Chicago and Los Angeles.</i>&quot; A speedometer located in the front of the car allowed passengers to monitor the train&#39;s velocity.<li>June <!--del_lnk--> 1952: The <i>Super Chief</i> is prominently featured in the <!--del_lnk--> Warner Bros. film <i>Three for Bedroom C</i> starring <!--del_lnk--> Gloria Swanson.<li><!--del_lnk--> 1954: The <!--del_lnk--> General Tire and Rubber Company utilizes the <i>Super Chief</i> as the centerpiece of a print advertisement for its new &quot;Nygen Cord&quot; tire, in which the train is towed by an AT&amp;SF <!--del_lnk--> switcher utilizing one of the tires as a connecting link.<li><!--del_lnk--> January 10, <!--del_lnk--> 1954: The $15.00 extra-fare charge is reduced to $7.50; the barbershop, shower-bath, and coast-to-coast Pullman (which ran through to <!--del_lnk--> New York by way of <i><!--del_lnk--> The Broadway Limited</i> and the <i><!--del_lnk--> 20th Century Limited</i>) are all discontinued.<li><!--del_lnk--> 1956: Santa Fe transfers <i>Transcontinental Sleeping Car Service</i> to the <i>Chief</i>. Round-end observation cars are removed from <i>Super Chief</i> service, blunt-ended at Pullman&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Calumet, Illinois shops, and returned to train Nos. 17 and 18 until early 1958 (when they are permanently removed from <i>Super Chief</i> service).<li><!--del_lnk--> January 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1957: The <i>Super Chief</i> and <i>El Capitan</i> are combined into one train during the off-peak travel season on a 39&frac12;-hour schedule.<li><!--del_lnk--> 1958: All five <i>Super Chief</i> trainsets are refurbished and redecorated.<li><!--del_lnk--> August 21, <!--del_lnk--> 1964: A rail from a passing train &quot;spears&quot; coach #2804 in <!--del_lnk--> Kingman, Arizona.<li><!--del_lnk--> January 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1969: Locomotives #46L, #39C, #310B, #45B, and #44A derail due to unknown causes in <!--del_lnk--> Holcomb, Kansas. Cars #2924, #2866, #1563, #539, #713, #714, #650, #578, #712, #716, #707, and #526 leave the tracks as well.<li><!--del_lnk--> May 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1971: <a href="../../wp/a/Amtrak.htm" title="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> is formed and takes over operation of the nation&#39;s passenger service, thus ending 35 years of the Santa Fe <i>Super Chief</i>.

      <p>The first motive power set on <i>Super Chief-1</i> consisted of a pair of blunt-nosed, diesel-electric units (<!--del_lnk--> EMD 1800 hp B-B) designated as Nos. 1 and 1A. Santa Fe employees quickly hung the nicknames &quot;One-Spot Twins&quot; and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Amos &amp; Andy&quot; (from the popular radio show of the day) on the units, which were always paired and ran back-to-back. In a little over a year the <!--del_lnk--> EMD E1, a new and improved 3,600 hp (2.7 MW) streamlined diesel-electric <!--del_lnk--> locomotive set (one hood unit and the other a cabless booster unit) would be pulling <i>Super Chief</i> consists.<p>A variety of state-of-the-art locomotives (including <!--del_lnk--> ALCO PAs, <!--del_lnk--> EMD E6s, <!--del_lnk--> FTs, <!--del_lnk--> F3s, <a href="../../wp/e/EMD_F7.htm" title="EMD F7">F7s</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> FP45s, along with Santa Fe&#39;s only <!--del_lnk--> ALCO DL-109/<!--del_lnk--> 110s and <!--del_lnk--> FM Erie-built units) would make their appearances on the line in the succeeding years. All wore the now-familiar <i>Warbonnet</i> paint scheme devised by <!--del_lnk--> Leland Knickerbocker of the <!--del_lnk--> GM &quot;Art and Colour Section&quot; that debuted on the <i>Super Chief-2</i>.<p>The <i>Super Chief-1&#39;s</i> mostly-<!--del_lnk--> heavyweight original consist included:<ul>

      <p>In May <!--del_lnk--> 1937, the heavyweight equipment used on the <i>Super Chief</i> was replaced with all <!--del_lnk--> lightweight <!--del_lnk--> stainless steel cars built by the <!--del_lnk--> Budd Company (the heavyweight cars were placed back in service with the <i>Chief</i>).

      <p>The railroad also added another <!--del_lnk--> trainset (the <i>Super Chief-2&frac12;</i>) utilizing sleeping cars borrowed from the <i>Chief</i> in order to handle the high demand for passage aboard the train. Its original consist was as follows:<ul>

      <p>The world-famous <i>Super Chief</i> was an almost-instant success among travelers who appreciated its modern, air conditioned equipment, high amenity levels, and smooth ride, all of which lent the train a certain &quot;snob appeal.&quot; The train was staffed with top-of-the-line crews who were engrained in the best traditions of the railroad, and not only drew passengers from competing railroads but from other Santa Fe trains such as the <i>Chief</i> as well. Patrons took pleasure in the ability to &quot;<i><b>...Travel Santa Fe &mdash; all the way</b></i>&quot; to their destinations without the need to change trains, or at least railroads, en route.<p>The <i>Super Chief</i> quickly became &quot;the&quot; train to ride between Chicago and Los Angeles, much as <!--del_lnk--> New York Central&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> 20th Century Limited</i> was the favored travel option of the time for the East Coast-bound. To acquaint passengers with the various points-of-interest located along the route, Santa Fe constructed a series of seven signs marking such notable features as the <!--del_lnk--> Continental Divide and <!--del_lnk--> Raton Pass.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>In the mid-<!--del_lnk--> 1940s, company president <!--del_lnk--> Fred G. Gurley went to great lengths to solicit business from California&#39;s motion picture industry. To that end, a passenger agent was located in <!--del_lnk--> Hollywood specifically for the purpose of maintaining close contact with the movie studios. Furthermore, the train stopped at the <!--del_lnk--> Pasadena station solely for the purpose of allowing celebrities the opportunity to board or disembark away from the &quot;hustle and bustle&quot; of Los Angeles&#39; Union Passenger Terminal (<!--del_lnk--> LAUPT). When the Santa Fe was notified that a particular celebrity was going to be traveling on board the <i>Super Chief</i>, a press release was issued to allow the media the opportunity to interview and photograph the star.<p>In time, the passenger list would resemble a veritable &quot;who&#39;s who&quot; of Hollywood stars: <!--del_lnk--> Richard Burton and <!--del_lnk--> Elizabeth Taylor, <!--del_lnk--> Humphrey Bogart and <!--del_lnk--> Lauren Bacall, <!--del_lnk--> Dean Martin and <!--del_lnk--> Jerry Lewis, <!--del_lnk--> Desi Arnaz and <!--del_lnk--> Lucille Ball, <!--del_lnk--> James Cagney, <!--del_lnk--> Judy Garland, and <!--del_lnk--> Bing Crosby (to name but a few) all rode the <i>Super Chief</i>. The train&#39;s appeal was not limited to those in the entertainment industry, though, as it also played host to <a href="../../wp/r/Ronald_Reagan.htm" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>, former presidents <a href="../../wp/h/Harry_S._Truman.htm" title="Harry S.

      <p>In June, 1952 <!--del_lnk--> Warner Bros. Pictures released <i>Three for Bedroom C</i>, a romantic comedy starring <!--del_lnk--> Gloria Swanson, <!--del_lnk--> James Warren, <!--del_lnk--> Fred Clark, <!--del_lnk--> Hans Conried, and <!--del_lnk--> Steve Brodie. In the film, an aging movie star (Swanson) and her precocious daughter hide out in the compartment of a scientist (Warren) during a cross-country journey from New York to Los Angeles aboard the <i>Super Chief</i>.<p>Swanson&#39;s first colour film also bears the distinction of being one of very few to be shot entirely aboard actual railroad equipment. Santa Fe transported actual passenger cars from the <i>Super Chief</i> to the production company&#39;s studio lot for filming. The film met with lukewarm reviews and did not, as had been hoped, revitalize Swanson&#39;s career. It did, however, nicely showcase the many features of the <i>Super Chief</i>, which many train buffs feel is the real star of the motion picture.<p><a id="Playback" name="Playback"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Playback</i></span></h3>

      <p>Most railroads began offering some form of meal service on their trains as an alternate to the poor fare typically found at trackside establishments even before the completion of the <a href="../../wp/f/First_Transcontinental_Railroad.htm" title="First Transcontinental Railroad">First Transcontinental Railroad</a>. By the mid-<!--del_lnk--> 1880s, dedicated <!--del_lnk--> dining cars were a normal part of all long-distance train consists departing from <a href="../../wp/c/Chicago.htm" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago</a> for points westward, save for those of the Santa Fe, who relied on America&#39;s first interstate network of restaurants to feed its passengers en route. The legendary &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Harvey Houses,&quot; located strategically along the line, served top-quality meals to railroad patrons during water stops and other planned layovers and were favored over in-transit facilities for all trains operating west of <a href="../../wp/k/Kansas_City%252C_Missouri.htm" title="Kansas City, Missouri">Kansas City</a>.<p>Nevertheless, the <i>Super Chief</i> included dining cars, staffed by Fred Harvey Company personnel, as part of its standard passenger car complement right from the outset. The units typically operated as &quot;semi-permanent&quot; two-car sets, one containing 36 seats at 12 tables in four-and-two seating arrangements, and the other equipped with a slightly larger <!--del_lnk--> galley, a passenger lounge, and <!--del_lnk--> dormitory facilities for the train crew (a staff of 3-4 cooks and 6-7 stewards was required for a three-day trip). With upwards of 300 passengers traveling at any given time, as many as eight or ten dinner seatings were required to feed everyone on board; when the 600-series dining cars were introduced in the <!--del_lnk--> 1950s, the <!--del_lnk--> seating capacity was increased to 48 at 16 tables in an effort to reduce wait times.<p>When Santa Fe rolled out its new &quot;Pleasure <!--del_lnk--> Dome&quot;-Lounge cars in <!--del_lnk--> 1951, the railroad introduced the traveling public to the <b>Turquoise Room</b>, promoted as &quot;<i>The only private dining room in the world on rails</i>.&quot; The room accommodated 12 guests, and could be reserved anytime for private dinner or cocktail parties, or other special functions. The room was often used by the era&#39;s celebrities and dignitaries while traveling on the <i>Super Chief</i>. As was the case on other railroads, dining car service proved to be a losing proposition financially. Santa Fe, more than any of its competitors, took the concept of using onboard meal service as a &quot;loss leader&quot; to the highest level in order to attract and retain customers. Consequently, the name <i>Super Chief</i> became synonymous with the finest fare available on wheels.<p><a id="Menu" name="Menu"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Menu</span></h3>
      <p>The Continental cuisine offered aboard the <i>Super Chief</i> went beyond the typical American fare found on other trains, and often rivaled that served in many five-star restaurants, befitting the train&#39;s upscale clientele. A &quot;<i>Wake-Up Cup</i>&quot; of coffee was brought to one&#39;s private bedroom each morning, on request, a service exclusive to the <i>Super Chief</i>. Breakfast and lunch were served <i><!--del_lnk--> &agrave; la carte</i>, while dinner could be ordered either <i>&agrave; la carte</i> or <i><!--del_lnk--> table d&#39;h&ocirc;te</i>.<p>The elaborate dinner offerings generally included <!--del_lnk--> caviar and other gourmet delicacies, cold salads, grilled and saute&eacute;d fish, sirloin steaks and filet mignon, lamb chops, and the like. For the truly discerning palates, elegant <!--del_lnk--> champagne dinners were also an option. Ironically, one of the <i>Super Chief</i>&#39;s most popular signature dishes was the AT&amp;SF version of <i>pain perdue</i>, simply and appropriately named <!--del_lnk--> Santa Fe French Toast.<p><a id="Mimbre.C3.B1o_china" name="Mimbre.C3.B1o_china"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Mimbre&ntilde;o china</span></h3>
      <p>The decor, linens, and other dining car accoutrements reflected the same <!--del_lnk--> Southwestern flair that was prevalent throughout the rest of the train. <!--del_lnk--> Mary Colter (<!--del_lnk--> architect, Indian art expert, and 35-year veteran of the Fred Harvey Company) designed the china and silverware used on the <i>Super Chief</i>. Colter, who also designed the interiors of Fred Harvey&rsquo;s opulent <i>La Fonda</i>, <i>La Posada</i>, and <i>El Tovar</i> hotels, based her dinnerware motif on the <!--del_lnk--> Native American <!--del_lnk--> pictographs of animals and geometric patterns left behind on clay <a href="../../wp/p/Pottery.htm" title="Pottery">pots</a> by the ancient inhabitants of the <!--del_lnk--> Rio Mimbres Valley in southwestern <!--del_lnk--> New Mexico, around 1100 <a href="../../wp/a/Anno_Domini.htm" title="Anno Domini">A.D.</a>.<p>The &quot;Mimbre&ntilde;o&quot; pattern was produced between 1936 and 1970 by the Onondaga Pottery Co. of <!--del_lnk--> Syracuse, New York under its better-known trade name, <b>Syracuse China</b>. The bottoms carried the inscription &quot;<i>Made expressly for Santa Fe Dining Car Service</i>.&quot; These distinctive pieces made their debut on the dining car <i>Cochiti</i> in 1937. Used on the <i>Super Chief</i> and other named trains until the end of Santa Fe passenger service in 1971, original Mimbre&ntilde;o dinnerware can still be found today in service on <!--del_lnk--> BNSF Railway business cars.<p>Mimbre&ntilde;o has been dubbed &quot;<i>the oldest of all railroad china</i>&quot; as its design concept dates back nearly ten centuries. Demand for surviving original pieces has created a substantial collector&#39;s market, and led to the issuance of authorized reproductions in recent years.<p><a id="Trivia" name="Trivia"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Trivia</span></h2>
