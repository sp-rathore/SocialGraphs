      <p><b>Scanian</b> (<span class="unicode audiolink"><!--del_lnk--> <i>sk&aring;nska</i></span>&nbsp;) is a closely related group of <!--del_lnk--> dialects spoken in the <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Southern-Swedish</a> region <!--del_lnk--> Sk&aring;ne (Scania). It is considered by some Scandinavian linguists to be a dialect of <!--del_lnk--> Swedish, by other Scandinavian linguists to be a dialect of <!--del_lnk--> Danish, while many early linguists, including Adolf Noreenand G. Sj&ouml;stedt, classified it as &quot;South-Scandinavian&quot;. It is however classified as a separate <a href="../../wp/l/Language.htm" title="Language">language</a> by <!--del_lnk--> SIL International (<!--del_lnk--> ISO 639-3:scy) and is assumed to include not only the dialect of Sk&aring;ne but also those of <!--del_lnk--> Halland (<i>hall&auml;ndska</i>), <!--del_lnk--> Blekinge (<i>blekingska</i>), and the Danish island of <!--del_lnk--> Bornholm (<i>bornholmsk</i>).<p>

      <p>Scanian is considered a separate language mainly from a historical, cultural or ethnic point of view. It is not regarded as a separate language by a majority of Swedes, but with the establishment of the Scanian Academy and with recent heritage conservation programs funded by the Swedish Government, there is a renewed interest in the region for Scanian as a cultural language and as a regional identity, especially among younger generations of Scanians. Many of the genuine rural dialects have been in decline subsequent to the <!--del_lnk--> industrial revolution and <!--del_lnk--> urbanization in Sweden. However, Scanian regionalist debaters express the view that Scanian is a suppressed <!--del_lnk--> minority language, and that it therefore should be considered an <!--del_lnk--> official minority language.<p>It is classified as a separate <a href="../../wp/l/Language.htm" title="Language">language</a> by <!--del_lnk--> SIL International (<!--del_lnk--> ISO 639-3:scy) and is assumed to include not only the dialect of Sk&aring;ne but also those of <!--del_lnk--> Halland (<i>hall&auml;ndska</i>), <!--del_lnk--> Blekinge (<i>blekingska</i>), and the Danish island of <!--del_lnk--> Bornholm (<i>bornholmsk</i>). This larger definition coincides with the extent of <a href="../../wp/s/Sk%25C3%25A5neland.htm" title="Sk&aring;neland">Sk&aring;neland</a> (<i>Terra Scaniae</i>), a medieval term which has regionalist overtones but also historical substance. The medieval <!--del_lnk--> Sk&aring;nske Lov (Codex Runicus) applied to all four provinces and in the <!--del_lnk--> Landsting (Thing), the governing assembly, the four provinces chose and paid homage to the king as a unity. According to <!--del_lnk--> SIL International there were 80.000 people who spoke the Scanian language in Sweden in 2002, with <!--del_lnk--> Scania, <!--del_lnk--> Halland and <!--del_lnk--> Blekinge having a combined population of about 1,6 million people.<p>The population of Sk&aring;ne consists of around 13% of the total population in <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>. Scanian is one of the most distinctive dialects in Sweden. In an internet poll on the website of a major newspaper in which more than 30,000 people have voted, Scanian is currently ranked in second place (12,5%) for most beautiful dialect, but also considered the dialect most people consider ugly (39,4%).<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>After the Swedish acquisition of the <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Danish</a> districts <!--del_lnk--> Sk&aring;ne, <!--del_lnk--> Blekinge, and <!--del_lnk--> Halland (collectively known as <a href="../../wp/s/Sk%25C3%25A5neland.htm" title="Sk&aring;neland">Sk&aring;neland</a>) with the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Roskilde in 1658, a process of <!--del_lnk--> Swedification was introduced, including a switch of languages used in churches and restrictions imposed on cross border travel and trade. A similar change occurred within other newly acquired provinces along the west coast and along the border with <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Bornholm was once part of Sk&aring;neland, but it was lost by Sweden in 1659. Scanian remained in use in Bornholm as a functioning transitional stage before <!--del_lnk--> Standard Danish became dominant in official contexts. In Scania, the Swedish government officially limited the use of Scanian in 1719 by nullifying the self-rule granted in The <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Roskilde, where Scania had initially been granted the right to continue with the old privileges, laws and customs. The assimilation has accelerated during the 20th century with the dominance of <!--del_lnk--> Standard Swedish language radio and television, urbanization, and movement of people to and from the other regions of Sweden.<p><a id="Historic_shifts" name="Historic_shifts"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Historic shifts</span></h3>
      <p>The gradual transition to Swedish has resulted in a local creolisation, with many new Swedish characteristics introduced since the <a href="../../wp/1/18th_century.htm" title="18th century">18th century</a>. The result of this slow shift is a distinct Scanian form of pronunciation, with details of grammar and vocabulary that in some aspects differ from <!--del_lnk--> Standard Swedish. The degree of contrast between Scanian and Swedish could be considered comparable to the differences between <a href="../../wp/a/American_English.htm" title="American English">American</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Australian_English.htm" title="Australian English">Australian English</a>. As pointed out by the researchers involved in the project <i>Comparative Semantics for Nordic Languages</i>, it is difficult to quantify and analyze the fine degrees of semantic differences that exist, even between Danish, Swedish and Norwegian: &quot;[S]ome of the Nordic languages [..]are historically, lexically and structurally very similar.[...]Are there systematic semantic differences between these languages? If so, are the formal semantic analytic tools that have been developed mainly for English and German sufficiently fine-grained to account for the differences among the Scandinavian languages?&quot;<p>The characteristic Scanian <!--del_lnk--> diphthongs, which do not occur in Danish or Swedish, are in popular belief often seen as signs of Scanian natives&#39; efforts to adapt from a Danish to a &quot;proper&quot; Swedish pronunciation. However, linguists reject this explanation for the sound change; at present, there are no universally-accepted theories for <i>why</i> sound changes occur. Danish research supports the assertion that Scanian was a distinct dialect before the Swedish acquisition of most of old Sk&aring;neland. One of the artifacts supporting this is a letter from the 16th century, where the Danish Bible translators were advised not to employ Scanian translators since their language was not proper Danish.<p><a id="Historic_preservation" name="Historic_preservation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Historic preservation</span></h3>
      <p>Scanian once possessed many unique words which do not exist in neither Swedish nor Danish. In attempts to preserve the unique aspects of Scanian, these words have been recorded and documented by the <!--del_lnk--> Institute for Dialectology, Onomastics and Folklore Research. Preservation is also accomplished through comparative studies, such as the Scanian-Swedish-Danish dictionary project, commissioned by the Scanian Academy. This project is led by Dr. Helmer L&aring;ng and involves a group of scholars from different fields, including Professor Birger Bergh, linguistics, Professor Inger Elkj&aelig;r and Dr. Inge Lise Pedersen, researcher in Danish dialects. Many specialty Scanian dictionaries have been published through the years, including one by Dr. Sten Bertil Vide, who wrote his doctoral thesis on the names of flowers in Scanian. This publication, and a variety of other Scanian dictionaries are available through <!--del_lnk--> Department of Dialectology and Onomastics in Lund.<p>The words and pronunciation differ around Scania, as they were sometimes only spoken by a small number of people in remote villages. Villages close to the sea, for example, such as <!--del_lnk--> Falsterbo and <!--del_lnk--> Limhamn, had many unique words connected to fishing. Most of these words no longer have any use in the spoken language.<p><a id="Modern_history" name="Modern_history"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Modern history</span></h3>
      <p>General public and academic interest in protecting the Scanian dialect or language was first established in the early 19th century with the advent of <!--del_lnk--> folkloristics and romantic nationalism in Scandinavia (see for example <!--del_lnk--> Norwegian romantic nationalism). According to <!--del_lnk--> Helmer L&aring;ng, Scanian and the folklore of the region had not been given proper attention because the Swedes considered them Danish, and the Danes, on the other hand, avoided dealing with this area which they had lost.<p>An early advocate was <!--del_lnk--> Henrik Wran&eacute;r (1853-1908) who wrote books on Scanian (<i>Kivikja Snackk...</i>, 1901). His contribution was manifested with his <i>Selected Works</i> (<i>Valda Verk</i>) which was published in 1922-23. His primary successor was <!--del_lnk--> Axel Ebbe (1869-1941), who wrote <i>Rijm &aring; rodevelske</i> in Scanian along with a witty translation of the <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">Bible</a> (<i>Bibelsk historie</i>, 1949).<p>Scanian was not well known north of Sk&aring;neland and its adjacent districts until the Scanian movie actor <!--del_lnk--> Edvard Persson sang his way into the hearts of the Swedish nation during the <!--del_lnk--> 1930s and <!--del_lnk--> 1940s. More recently, radio voices <!--del_lnk--> Kjell Stensson and <!--del_lnk--> Sten Broman have popularized the dialect.<p>

      <p>There are a sizable number of singers and other celebrities who speak Scanian and use it in their professional life. Artist <!--del_lnk--> Mikael Wiehe, voted &quot;Scanian of the Year&quot; in 2000, explained his relation to Scanian by referring a &quot;love, knowledge of and pride in Scania&#39;s history and uniqueness&quot;: &quot;To be a Scanian, to love Scania, to take an interest in its history and to cherish its uniqueness [...] has helped me to understand and respect other people&#39;s love for and pride over their native area. [...] In the same way, I love the Scanian language. Not because it is better than other languages, but because it is the language I express myself best in. This love for my native region and my language has given me a security and confidence which has made it possible for me to go out and explore the world without fear.&quot; Wiehe received the Swedish <!--del_lnk--> Martin Luther King Award of 2005 for his work at home and internationally for peace, freedom, justice and solidarity. <!--del_lnk--> Hans Alfredson, a popular showman, producer, singer and performer during the last 50 years, has produced several movies with Scanian dialogue, including the internationally recognized movie &quot;The Simple-Minded Murder&quot;, starring Scanian-speaking <!--del_lnk--> Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd who grew up in <!--del_lnk--> Malm&ouml;. <!--del_lnk--> Thomas &Ouml;berg, the singer of Swedish rock group <!--del_lnk--> bob hund, is a notable speaker of Scanian, who also sings in Scanian. The rock band <!--del_lnk--> Kal P. Dal, considered a cult favourite in some areas, <!--del_lnk--> Bj&ouml;rn Afzelius, rock artist <!--del_lnk--> Peps Persson and the band <!--del_lnk--> Joddla med Siv are also popular examples of Scanian artists. The folk-singer <!--del_lnk--> Danne Str&aring;hed is very popular in some regions, not the least due to his trademark song <i>N&auml;r en flicka talar sk&aring;nska</i> (&quot;When a girl speaks Scanian&quot;).<p>Recently, several humorously written Scanian dictionaries have been published. As there is no Scanian language standard, the choice of words to be included is always under debate.<p><a id="Sounds" name="Sounds"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sounds</span></h2>
      <p>Scanian realizes the phoneme /r/ as a <!--del_lnk--> uvular trill, <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[&#x280;]</span> in clear articulation, but in everyday speech more commonly as a <!--del_lnk--> voiceless, <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[&chi;]</span> or <!--del_lnk--> voiced uvular fricative, <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[&#x281;]</span>, depending on phonetic context. This is in contrast to the <!--del_lnk--> alveolar articulations and <!--del_lnk--> retroflex assimilations in most Swedish dialects north of <!--del_lnk--> Sm&aring;land. The realizations of the highly variable and uniquely Swedish fricative <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/&#x267;/</span> also tend to be more velar and less <!--del_lnk--> labialized than in other dialects. Though the <!--del_lnk--> phonemes of Scanian correspond to those of <!--del_lnk--> Standard Swedish and most other Swedish dialects, long vowels have developed into diphthongs which are unique to the region. In the southern parts of Sk&aring;ne many diphthongs also have a <!--del_lnk--> pharyngeal quality, similar to <!--del_lnk--> Danish vowels.<p><a id="Vocabulary" name="Vocabulary"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Vocabulary</span></h2>
      <p>While the general vocabulary does not differ considerably from Standard Swedish, a few specifically Scanian words exist which are known in all of Scania, occurring frequently among a majority of the speakers. These are some examples:<ul>
       <li><i>p&aring;g</i> , &quot;boy&quot; (Standard Swedish: <i>pojke</i>, former Danish: <i>poge / pog</i>)<li><i>t&ouml;s</i>, &quot;girl&quot; (Standard Swedish: <i>flicka</i>, Danish: <i>t&oslash;s</i>)<li><i>r&auml;lig</i>, &quot;disgusting&quot;, &quot;ugly&quot; (Standard Swedish <i>&auml;cklig, ful</i>, dialect Danish: <i>r&aelig;rlig</i>)</ul>
      <p>There are other Scanian words that are well-known in Scania but could be considered old-fashioned or extremely rural in general usage:<ul>
       <li><i>pantoffel</i>, &quot;potatoe&quot; (Standard Swedish: <i>potatis</i>, Danish: <i>kartoffel</i>)</ul>
