      <p>Sony has historically been notable for creating its own in-house standards for new recording and storage technologies instead of adopting those of other manufacturers and standards bodies. The most infamous of these was the <!--del_lnk--> videotape format war of the early <!--del_lnk--> 1980s, when Sony marketed its <!--del_lnk--> Betamax system for <!--del_lnk--> video cassette recorders against the <!--del_lnk--> VHS format developed by <!--del_lnk--> JVC. In the end, VHS gained critical mass in the marketplace and became the worldwide standard for consumer VCRs and Sony adopted the format. Since then, Sony has continued to introduce its own versions of storage technologies, with varying success. A * denotes a proprietary format.<p>Early Sony products included <!--del_lnk--> reel-to-reel tape recorders and <!--del_lnk--> transistor radios.<p>In 1968 Sony introduced its <!--del_lnk--> Trinitron <!--del_lnk--> brand name for its line of <!--del_lnk--> aperture grille <!--del_lnk--> cathode ray tube <a href="../../wp/t/Television.htm" title="Television">televisions</a> and later <!--del_lnk--> computer monitors. Trinitron displays are still produced.<p>Sony launched the <!--del_lnk--> Betamax <!--del_lnk--> videocassette recording format in 1975. The <!--del_lnk--> Walkman brand was introduced in 1979.<p>1982 saw the launch of Sony&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Betacam videotape family and the collaborative <a href="../../wp/c/Compact_Disc.htm" title="Compact Disc">Compact Disc</a> format. In 1983 Sony introduced 90mm micro floppy diskettes (better known as 3.5-inch <a href="../../wp/f/Floppy_disk.htm" title="Floppy disk">floppy disks</a>), which it had developed at a time when there were 4&quot; floppy disks and a lot of variations from different companies to replace the then on-going 5.25&quot; floppy disks. Sony had great success and the format became dominant; 3.5&quot; floppy disks gradually became obsolete as they were replaced by more current media formats. In 1984 Sony launched the <!--del_lnk--> Discman series which extended their Walkman brand to portable CD products. In 1985 Sony launched their Handycam products and the <!--del_lnk--> Video8 format. Video8 became popular in the consumer camcorder market.<p>In the early 1990s two high-density optical storage standards were being developed: one was the MultiMedia Compact Disc (MMCD), backed by Philips and Sony, and the other was the Super Density disc (SD), supported by Toshiba and many others. Philips and Sony abandoned their MMCD format and agreed upon Toshiba&#39;s SD format with two modifications based on MMCD technology.<p>Sony introducted the <!--del_lnk--> MiniDisc* format in 1992. Since the introduction of the format, Sony has attempted to promote its own audio compression technologies under the <!--del_lnk--> ATRAC brand, against more widely used formats like MP3. Until late <!--del_lnk--> 2004, Sony&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Network Walkman line of digital portable music players did not support the MP3 de facto standard natively, although the software <!--del_lnk--> SonicStage provided with them would convert MP3 files into the ATRAC or ATRAC3 formats.<p>In 1993, Sony challenged the industry standard <!--del_lnk--> Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound format with its newer and more advanced proprietary motion picture digital audio format called <!--del_lnk--> SDDS (Sony Dynamic Digital Sound). This format employed eight channels (7.1) of audio opposed to just six used in Dolby Digital 5.1 at the time. Unlike Dolby Digital, SDDS utilized a method of backup by having mirrored arrays of bits on both sides of the film which acted as a measure of reliability in case the film was partially damaged. Ultimately, SDDS has been vastly overshadowed by the preferred DTS (<!--del_lnk--> Digital Theatre System) and Dolby Digital standards in the motion picture industry. SDDS was solely developed for use in the theatre circuit; Sony never intended to develop a home theatre version of SDDS.<p>Sony and Philips jointly developed the Sony-Philips digital interface format (<!--del_lnk--> S/PDIF) and the high-fidelity audio system <!--del_lnk--> SACD. The latter has since been entrenched in a format war with <!--del_lnk--> DVD-Audio. At present, neither has gained a major foothold with the general public. CDs are preferred by consumers because of their ubiquitous presence in consumer devices.<p>In 1994 Sony launched its <!--del_lnk--> PlayStation (later <i>PS one</i>). This successful console was succeeded by the <!--del_lnk--> PlayStation 2 in 2000, itself succeeded by the <!--del_lnk--> PlayStation 3 in 2006. The PlayStation brand was extended to the portable games market in 2004 by the <!--del_lnk--> PlayStation Portable*. Sony developed the <!--del_lnk--> Universal Media Disc (UMD) optical disc medium for use on the PlayStation Portable.<p>Sony is currently touting its <!--del_lnk--> Blu-ray Disc optical disc format, which is likely to compete with <!--del_lnk--> Toshiba&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> HD DVD. As of quarter one of 2006, Blu-ray Disc has the backing of every major motion picture studio except Universal.<p><a id="Management" name="Management"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Management</span></h2>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> March 7, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, Sony Corp. announced that Nobuyuki Idei will step down as Chairman and Group CEO and will be replaced by British/American Sir <!--del_lnk--> Howard Stringer, current Chairman and CEO of Sony Corporation of America, Corporate Executive Officer, Vice Chairman and COO Sony Entertainment Business Group. Sony&#39;s decision to replace Idei with the British Howard Stringer will mark the first time that a foreigner will run a major Japanese electronics firm. Sony Corp. also announced on the same date that current president, Kunitake Ando, will step down and be replaced by Ryoji Chubachi. <p><a id="Mergers_and_acquisitions" name="Mergers_and_acquisitions"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Mergers and acquisitions</span></h3>

      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> October 2005, it was revealed by <!--del_lnk--> Mark Russinovich of <!--del_lnk--> Sysinternals that <!--del_lnk--> Sony BMG Music Entertainment&#39;s music CDs had installed a <!--del_lnk--> rootkit on the user&#39;s computer as a <!--del_lnk--> DRM measure (called <!--del_lnk--> Extended Copy Protection by its creator, British company <!--del_lnk--> First 4 Internet), which was extremely difficult to detect or to remove. This constitutes a crime in many countries, and poses a major security risk to affected users, as well as a small drain on computer system resources. The uninstaller Sony initially provided removed the rootkit, but in turn installed a <!--del_lnk--> dial-home program that posed an even greater security risk &mdash; a fact that drew further criticism of Sony&#39;s actions. Sony eventually provided an actual uninstaller that removed all of Sony&#39;s DRM program from the user&#39;s computer. Sony BMG is facing several class action lawsuits regarding this matter.<p><a id="Advertisements" name="Advertisements"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Advertisements</span></h3>
      <p>To commemorate the tenth anniversary of the <!--del_lnk--> PlayStation (PS) gaming console in <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>, Sony released an ad depicting a man smiling towards the camera and wearing on his head a crown of thorns with button symbols (Triangle, O, X, Square). At the bottom, the copy read as &quot;Ten Years of Passion&quot;. This outraged the <!--del_lnk--> Vatican as well as many local Catholics, prompting comments such as &quot;Sony went too far&quot; and &quot;Vatican excommunicates Sony&quot;. After the incident, the campaign was quickly discontinued.<p>Sony also admitted in late 2005 to hiring <!--del_lnk--> graffiti artists to spray paint advertisements for their <!--del_lnk--> PlayStation Portable game system in seven major U.S. cities including <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Philadelphia, and <a href="../../wp/s/San_Francisco%252C_California.htm" title="San Francisco, California">San Francisco</a>. The mayor of Philadelphia has filed a <!--del_lnk--> cease and desist order and may file a criminal complaint. According to Sony, they are paying businesses and building owners for the right to graffiti their walls. As of early January 2006, Sony has no plans to keep or withdraw them.<p>In July 2006, Sony released a Dutch advertising campaign featuring a white model dressed entirely in white and a black model garbed in black. The first ad featured the white model clutching the face of the black model. The words &quot;White is coming&quot; headlined one of the ads. The ad has been viewed as racist by critics. A Sony spokesperson responded that the ad does not have a racist message, saying that it was only trying to depict the contrast between the black PSP model and the new ceramic white PSP. Other pictures of the ad campaign include the black model overpowering the white model.<p><a id="bleem.21" name="bleem.21"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">bleem!</span></h3>

      <p>In 1999 Sony took legal action against bleem!, Sony started these law suits after they launched their policy to prevent any developer shipping software that runs <!--del_lnk--> PlayStation software.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> April <!--del_lnk--> 1999, a <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a> court denied Sony&#39;s case against Bleem that would keep the company from publishing its PlayStation emulator for the <!--del_lnk--> Dreamcast. Bleem sued Sony for allegedly using its influence to halt the company&#39;s ability to successfully sell its emulator. Bleemcast was a software program that would allow some PlayStation One games to be played on the Sega Dreamcast console. Although <!--del_lnk--> bleem won all of its court cases the time and money lost during the cases caused the company to close down in November of 2001.<p><a id="Legal" name="Legal"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Legal</span></h3>
      <p>In 2002, Sony Computer Entertainment America, marketer of the popular <!--del_lnk--> PlayStation game consoles, was sued by <!--del_lnk--> Immersion Corp. of <a href="../../wp/s/San_Jose%252C_California.htm" title="San Jose, California">San Jose</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a> which claimed that Sony&#39;s PlayStation &quot;Dual Shock&quot; controllers infringed on Immersion&#39;s patents. In 2004, a federal jury agreed with Immersion, awarding the company US$82 million in damages. A U.S. district court judge ruled on the matter in March, 2005 and not only agreed with the federal jury&#39;s ruling but also added another US$8.7 million in damages. This is likely the reason that the controller for the PlayStation 3 has no rumble feature. Microsoft Corp. was also sued for its Xbox controller, however, unlike Sony, they settled out of court. <i>Washington Post:</i> <!--del_lnk--> Pay Judgment Or Game Over, Sony Warned<p><a id="Batteries" name="Batteries"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Batteries</span></h3>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> August 14, 2006, Sony and <!--del_lnk--> Dell admitted to major flaws in several Sony batteries that could result in the battery overheating and catching fire. As a result they recalled over 4.1 million laptop batteries in the largest computer-related recall to that point in history. The cost of this recall is being shared between <!--del_lnk--> Dell and Sony. Dell also confirmed that one of its laptops caught fire in Illinois.  This recall also prompted Japan&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry to order the companies to investigate the troubles with the batteries.

      <p>In August of 2005, Sony engaged in a legal tussle with Hong Kong import/export firm <!--del_lnk--> Lik-Sang, a distributor of Asian electronics. Lik-Sang had sold imported <!--del_lnk--> PSPs to UK customers before the UK release date, which Sony alleged was a breach of their trademark rights. Lik-Sang continued shipping PSPs, claiming <a href="../../wp/h/Hong_Kong.htm" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>&#39;s laws allow an item to be traded freely once it appears in a market anywhere in the world. On October 23, 2006, the High Court in London ruled the shipments of PSPs were indeed in breach of Sony&#39;s rights and that it was illegal for the firm to import the Japanese version of <!--del_lnk--> PlayStation 3&#39;s into Europe ahead of its official release in March 2007. The following day, Lik-Sang posted a message on their website claiming they had been forced out of business due to Sony&#39;s legal action. Sony responded in a statement saying that Lik-Sang had not contested the case, thus incurring no legal fees, and had not paid any damages or costs to Sony.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony&quot;</div>
