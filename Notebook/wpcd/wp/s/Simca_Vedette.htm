      <p>The <b>Simca Vedette</b> was a large <a href="../../wp/a/Automobile.htm" title="Automobile">car</a>, manufactured from 1954 to 1961 by the French <!--del_lnk--> automaker <!--del_lnk--> Simca, at their factory in <!--del_lnk--> Poissy, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>. The Vedette was Simca&#39;s largest model at that time and it spawned a more economical version, the <!--del_lnk--> Simca Ariane.<p>Simca acquired the Poissy factory from <!--del_lnk--> Ford France (Ford <!--del_lnk--> Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Anonyme Fran&ccedil;aise, the French subsidiary of the <!--del_lnk--> Ford Motor Company), along with the model line, in 1954. The Vedette was therefore initially still marketed as the <b><!--del_lnk--> Ford Vedette</b>.<p>The Vedette was manufactured in Poissy until 1961 and the Ariane until 1963. After that, production continued in Brazil, where the Vedette finally evolved into the <!--del_lnk--> Chrysler Esplanada, following Simca&#39;s takeover by <!--del_lnk--> Chrysler.<p>

      <p>In the early 1950s, <!--del_lnk--> Henri Th&eacute;odore Pigozzi was looking to expand the manufacturing operations of his <!--del_lnk--> Simca company, which was enjoying much success at the time, thanks to the popular <!--del_lnk--> Aronde. At the same time, Ford was seeking to divest itself of its French subsidiary, Ford SAF, which had a factory in Poissy, close to <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>, where it had been manufacturing a large car called the Ford Vedette. The Poissy plant was large and there was capacity for further expansion. The Vedette was a larger car than anything that Simca had on offer at that time. These points attracted Pigozzi, who decided to take over the entire factory, along with the rights to the cars manufactured there.<p><a id="The_first_Vedettes" name="The_first_Vedettes"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The first Vedettes</span></h2>

      <p>The acquisition by Pigozzi took place in July 1954, just when Ford was poised to launch its new, modern Vedette, with a 4-door <!--del_lnk--> saloon body of &#39;<a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">American</a>&#39; style, much like the contemporary British Fords or <!--del_lnk--> Vauxhalls. The car was powered by an unusually small 2,351&nbsp;cc displacement <!--del_lnk--> sidevalve <!--del_lnk--> V8 unit called <i>Aquillon</i> in France, which stemmed from Ford&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> <i>Flathead</i> engine family. Equipped with a <!--del_lnk--> two-barrel <i><!--del_lnk--> Zenith 32NX</i> <!--del_lnk--> carburetor, it produced 80&nbsp;hp, which slotted the car into the &#39;13&nbsp;CV&#39; French tax class. Power was transferred to the rear <!--del_lnk--> live axle through a 3-speed <!--del_lnk--> manual transmission with <!--del_lnk--> column shift. The Vedette had <!--del_lnk--> independent front suspension (by <!--del_lnk--> MacPherson struts) and <!--del_lnk--> drum brakes on all four wheels.<p>As with the Aronde, Simca marketed different trim levels of the Vedette under different model names, this time with references to the grand period of baroque in French history. The basic version was called the <b>Simca <!--del_lnk--> Trianon</b>, the mid-level was the <b>Simca <!--del_lnk--> Versailles</b> and, atop the range, sat the <b>Simca <!--del_lnk--> R&eacute;gence</b>. An interesting option on all those versions was a large glass <!--del_lnk--> moonroof that would slide into the roof, called <i>Vistadome</i> The Vedette range was still marketed under the Ford brand in some markets, including the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>, until 1956.. As the new model caught on, Simca was able to increase production from the 150 daily achieved during Ford&#39;s ownership of the factory to 250 cars a day.<p>Pigozzi maintained a schedule of year-to-year model revisions, much like American manufacturers. For 1956, an <!--del_lnk--> estate version joined the line-up, called the <b>Simca <!--del_lnk--> Marly</b> and the whole range was revised. A new <!--del_lnk--> license plate holder was added to the front bumper and the rear license plate now concealed the <!--del_lnk--> fuel tank filler. A peculiar addition was a pedal-operated <!--del_lnk--> windscreen washer, while other more ordinary changes included a second <!--del_lnk--> odometer, also known as a &#39;trip meter&#39;, for measuring partial distances. The Versailles and R&eacute;gence were made even more comfortable, with the addition of central armrests (Versailles in the rear only, R&eacute;gence in front and rear), while the Trianon was simplified, losing <!--del_lnk--> bumper guards and chrome windscreen decor. In 1957, an option of the <i>Gravina</i> automatic clutch was added, along with more effective brakes and more direct steering. The Trianon regained the chrome decor around the windscreen, while the other models acquired slimmer tail lights and the front ornament was replaced with a new design. Fender-mounted <i>V8</i> badges were introduced but, although the whole range featured the same V8 engine, the new badges appeared on the fenders of only the R&eacute;gence and Marly.<p><a id="Production_figures" name="Production_figures"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Production figures</span></h3>

      <p>After three years in production, the Vedette was given a new, elongated body, with a more ornate front end and large <!--del_lnk--> tailfins, making it even more American-looking than before. This was part of a styling trend shown by most large <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European</a> cars of that period, which were, to some extent, inspired by American styling, as tailfins appeared on <!--del_lnk--> Peugeots, <!--del_lnk--> Fiats, <!--del_lnk--> BMC models (<!--del_lnk--> Pinin Farina-styled), Fords and even <!--del_lnk--> Mercedes-Benz cars of that era. The engine was uprated to 84&nbsp;hp (now called <i>Aquillon 84</i>) but the fiscal qualification of the car remained unchanged.<p>The three-year-old body of the previous Vedette found a new use, in April 1957. Fitted with the 1.3-litre Aronde engine, it became a new model in the Simca range &mdash; the <!--del_lnk--> Simca Ariane. Later, in October 1957, a V8 version with the <i>Aquillon 84</i>, called the Ariane 8, joined the range, replacing the Trianon. The Versailles was replaced by <b>Simca <!--del_lnk--> Beaulieu</b> and the <!--del_lnk--> R&eacute;gence by the <b><!--del_lnk--> Chambord</b>, while the estate retained the Marly name.<p>1959 brought a new option - the <i>Rush-Matic</i> <!--del_lnk--> automatic transmission. This transmission featured two modes: <i>Rush</i> (fully automatic) and <i>Road</i> (manual gear selection). The same year, assembly of the Vedette started at Simca do Brasil. Also during 1959, a new top-of-the-line model joined the Vedette range - the <b>Pr&eacute;sidence</b>, featuring a luxurious interior, a <!--del_lnk--> radiotelephone (a European first) and a <!--del_lnk--> continental kit. French <!--del_lnk--> coachbuilder <!--del_lnk--> Chapron built two 2-door Pr&eacute;sidence <!--del_lnk--> convertibles for a governor of one of the French <!--del_lnk--> colonies. Chapron had another order the next year, to build two four-door convertibles for the French President <!--del_lnk--> Charles de Gaulle himself. The Beaulieu was dropped in autumn 1960 but the other models remained unchanged until the 1961 model year, when they received new seats and new chrome decor and the engine was fitted with a new anti-vibration crankshaft.<p>Production of the Vedette ended in the Summer of 1961, with a total of 173,288 cars having been produced, although the model was continued for longer in <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>. The Ariane survived until 1963, with 166,363 produced.<p><a id="Production_figures_2" name="Production_figures_2"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Production figures</span></h3>
