      <p>The majestic appearance of St. Petersburg is achieved through a variety of architectural details including long, straight boulevards, vast spaces, gardens and parks, decorative wrought-iron fences, monuments and decorative sculptures. The Neva River itself, together with its many canals and their granite <!--del_lnk--> embankments and <a href="../../wp/s/Saint_Petersburg.htm" title="Bridges in Saint Petersburg">bridges</a> gives the city a unique and striking ambience. These bodies of water led to St. Petersburg being given the name of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Venice of the North&quot;.<div class="thumb tleft">

This celebrated phenomenon is known as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> white nights&quot;. The white nights are closely linked to another attraction &mdash; the eight drawbridges spanning the Neva. Tourists flock to see the <a href="../../wp/b/Bridge.htm" title="Bridge">bridges</a> drawn and lowered again at night to allow shipping to pass up and down the river. Bridges open from May to late October according to a special schedule between approximately 2 a.m. and 4:30 a.m.<p>The historical centre of St. Petersburg, sometimes called the outdoor museum of <a href="../../wp/n/Neoclassicism.htm" title="Neoclassicism">Neoclassicism</a>, was the first Russian patrimony inscribed on the <!--del_lnk--> UNESCO list of <!--del_lnk--> World Heritage Sites.<p><a id="The_Palaces" name="The_Palaces"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Palaces</span></h3>
      <p>St. Petersburg has been known as the city of <!--del_lnk--> palaces. One of the earliest of these is the <!--del_lnk--> Summer Palace, a modest house built for <a href="../../wp/p/Peter_I_of_Russia.htm" title="Peter I of Russia">Peter I</a> in the <!--del_lnk--> Summer Garden (1710&ndash;1714). Much more imposing are the <a href="../../wp/b/Baroque.htm" title="Baroque">baroque</a> <!--del_lnk--> residences of his associates, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Kikin Hall and the <!--del_lnk--> Menshikov Palace on the Neva Embankment, constructed from designs by <!--del_lnk--> Domenico Trezzini over the years 1710 to 1716. A residence adjacent to the Menshikov palace was redesigned for <!--del_lnk--> Peter II and now houses the <!--del_lnk--> State University.<p>Probably the most illustrious of imperial palaces is the baroque <!--del_lnk--> Winter Palace (1754&ndash;1762), a huge building with dazzlingly luxurious interiors, now housing the <!--del_lnk--> Hermitage Museum. The same architect, <!--del_lnk--> Bartolomeo Rastrelli, was also responsible for three residences in the vicinity of the <!--del_lnk--> Nevsky Prospekt: the <!--del_lnk--> Stroganov palace (1752&ndash;1754, now a wax museum), the <!--del_lnk--> Vorontsov palace (1749&ndash;1757, now a military school), and the <!--del_lnk--> Anichkov Palace (1741&ndash;1750, many times rebuilt, now a palace for children). Other baroque palaces include the <!--del_lnk--> Sheremetev house on the <!--del_lnk--> Fontanka embankment (also called the Fountain House), and the <!--del_lnk--> Beloselsky-Belozersky Palace (1846&ndash;1848) on the Nevsky Prospekt, formerly a residence of the <!--del_lnk--> Grand Duke Sergey Aleksandrovich.<div class="center">

      <p>Of <a href="../../wp/n/Neoclassicism.htm" title="Neoclassicism">Neoclassical</a> palaces, the foremost is St Michael&#39;s (or Engineers&#39;) <!--del_lnk--> Castle, constructed for <!--del_lnk--> Emperor Paul in 1797&ndash;1801 to replace the earlier Summer Palace. The <!--del_lnk--> Tauride Palace of <!--del_lnk--> Prince Potemkin (1783&ndash;1789), situated nearby, used to be a seat of the <!--del_lnk--> first Russian parliament. Just to the left from the Hermitage buildings is the <!--del_lnk--> Marble Palace, commissioned by <!--del_lnk--> Count Orlov and built in 1768&ndash;1785 from various sorts of <!--del_lnk--> marble to a Neoclassical design by <!--del_lnk--> Antonio Rinaldi. The Michael Palace (1819&ndash;1825), famed for its opulent interiors and named after its first lodger, Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich, now houses the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Museum. Also built in the Neoclassical style are the <!--del_lnk--> Yusupov palace (the 1790s), where <!--del_lnk--> Rasputin was killed; the <!--del_lnk--> Razumovsky palace (1762&ndash;1766); the <!--del_lnk--> Shuvalov palace (1830&ndash;1838); and the <!--del_lnk--> Yelagin Palace (1818&ndash;1822), a sumptuous summer <!--del_lnk--> dacha of the imperial family, situated on the <!--del_lnk--> Yelagin Island.<p>The last important residences were built for <!--del_lnk--> Nicholas I&#39;s children: the <!--del_lnk--> Mariinsky Palace (1839&ndash;1844), located just opposite St Isaac&#39;s Cathedral and housing a <!--del_lnk--> city council, the <!--del_lnk--> Nicholas Palace (1853&ndash;61), and the <!--del_lnk--> New Michael Palace (1857-1861).<p><a id="The_churches" name="The_churches"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The churches</span></h3>
      <p>Most of the church buildings belong to the Russian government, since their seizure in 1917. The largest <!--del_lnk--> church in the city is <!--del_lnk--> St Isaac&#39;s Cathedral (1818&ndash;1858), one of the biggest <!--del_lnk--> domed buildings in the world, constructed for 40 years under supervision of its architect, <!--del_lnk--> Auguste de Montferrand. Another magnificent church in the <!--del_lnk--> Empire style is the <!--del_lnk--> Kazan Cathedral (1801&ndash;1811), situated on the Nevsky Prospekt and modeled after <!--del_lnk--> St Peter&#39;s, Vatican. No tourist can miss the <!--del_lnk--> Church of the Savior on Blood (1883&ndash;1907), a gorgeous monument in the <!--del_lnk--> old Russian style which marks the spot of <!--del_lnk--> Alexander II&#39;s assassination. The <!--del_lnk--> Peter and Paul Cathedral (1712&ndash;1732), a long-time <!--del_lnk--> symbol of the city, contains the <!--del_lnk--> sepulchers of <a href="../../wp/p/Peter_I_of_Russia.htm" title="Peter I of Russia">Peter the Great</a> and other <!--del_lnk--> Russian emperors. Apart from these four principal cathedrals, which operate today primarily as <!--del_lnk--> museums, there are numerous other churches.<p>Of baroque structures, the grandest is the white-and-blue <!--del_lnk--> Smolny Convent (1748&ndash;1764), a striking design by <!--del_lnk--> Bartolomeo Rastrelli, but never completed. It is followed by the <!--del_lnk--> Naval Cathedral of St Nicholas (1753&ndash;1762), a lofty structure dedicated to the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Navy, the outside being covered with <!--del_lnk--> plaques to sailors lost at sea. The church of Sts Simeon and Anna (1731&ndash;1734), St Sampson Cathedral (1728&ndash;1740), St Pantaleon church (1735&ndash;1739), and <!--del_lnk--> St Andrew Cathedral (1764&ndash;1780) are all worth mentioning.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The Neoclassical churches are too numerous to count. Many of them are intended to dominate vast <!--del_lnk--> squares, like St. Vladimir&#39;s Cathedral (1769&ndash;1789), not to be confused with <!--del_lnk--> the church of Our Lady of Vladimir (1761&ndash;1783). The <!--del_lnk--> Transfiguration Cathedral (1827&ndash;29) and the <!--del_lnk--> Trinity Cathedral (1828&ndash;1835, fire-damaged) were both designed by <!--del_lnk--> Vasily Stasov. Smaller churches include the Konyushennaya (1816&ndash;1823), also by Stasov, the &quot;Easter Cake&quot; church (1785&ndash;1787), noted for its droll appearance, St Catherine church on the <!--del_lnk--> Vasilievsky Island (1768&ndash;1771), and numerous non-Orthodox churches on the Nevsky Prospekt.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Nevsky Monastery, intended to house the relics of St <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Nevsky, contains two cathedrals and several smaller churches in various styles. It is also remarkable for the <!--del_lnk--> Tikhvin Cemetery, where many notable Russians are buried.<p>The city has two small churches in the early <!--del_lnk--> Gothic Revival style, those of St John the Baptist (1776&ndash;1781) and the Chesmenskaya (1777&ndash;1780), both designed by <!--del_lnk--> Yury Velten. The late 19th-century and early 20th-century temples are all constructed from <!--del_lnk--> Russian Revival or <!--del_lnk--> Byzantine Revival designs. <!--del_lnk--> The cathedral mosque (1909&ndash;1920), reputedly the largest in Europe, is built after the model of <a href="../../wp/t/Timur.htm" title="Timur">Timurid</a> temples in <!--del_lnk--> Samarkand.<p>St Petersburg Buddhist temple was the first in Europe. Construction was funded by subscriptions of the <!--del_lnk--> Dalai Lama and Russian and Mongolian Buddhists; the structure was inaugurated in the presence of <!--del_lnk--> Itigilov in 1914 and served as a valuable resource to transient <!--del_lnk--> Buryats and <!--del_lnk--> Kalmyks during World War I. It functioned until 1935 when the lamas passed into gulags. The temple and its grounds were used for secular purposes until 1991, when the <!--del_lnk--> datsan was eventually reopened for worship.<p><a id="Public_buildings" name="Public_buildings"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Public buildings</span></h3>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Peter and Paul Fortress, formerly a political <!--del_lnk--> prison, occupies a dominant position in the centre of the city. A <!--del_lnk--> boardwalk was built along a portion of the fortress wall, giving visitors a clear view of the city across the river to the south. On the other bank of the Neva, the spit of the Vasilievsky island is graced by the <!--del_lnk--> former Bourse building (1805&ndash;1810), reminiscent of a classic <!--del_lnk--> Greek temple, with two great <!--del_lnk--> Rostral Columns, decorated with ships&#39; prows, standing in front of it.<p>Undoubtedly the most famous of St. Petersburg&#39;s museums is the <!--del_lnk--> Hermitage, one of the world&#39;s largest and richest collections of <!--del_lnk--> Western European art. Its vast holdings were originally exhibited in the <!--del_lnk--> Greek Revival building (1838&ndash;1852) by <!--del_lnk--> Leo von Klenze, now called the New Hermitage. But the first Russian museum was established by Peter the Great in the <!--del_lnk--> Kunstkammer, erected in 1718&ndash;1734 on the opposite bank of the Neva River and formerly a home to the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Academy of Sciences. Other popular tourist destinations include the <!--del_lnk--> Stieglitz Museum of Applied Arts (1885&ndash;1895), the <!--del_lnk--> Ethnography Museum (1900&ndash;1911), the <!--del_lnk--> Suvorov Museum of Military History (1901&ndash;1904), and the Political History Museum (1904&ndash;06).<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The imperial government institutions were housed in the <!--del_lnk--> General Staff building on the <!--del_lnk--> Palace Square (1820&ndash;1827), with a huge triumphal arch in the centre, the <!--del_lnk--> Senate and <!--del_lnk--> Synod buildings on the <!--del_lnk--> Senate Square (1827&ndash;1843), the Imperial Cabinet (1803&ndash;1805) and the <!--del_lnk--> City Duma (1784-87) on the Nevsky Prospekt, the Assignation Bank (1783&ndash;1790), the Customs Office (1829&ndash;1832), and the splendid <!--del_lnk--> Admiralty (1806&ndash;1823), one of the city&#39;s most conspicuous landmarks. Most of these buildings were designed either by <!--del_lnk--> Giacomo Quarenghi, or by <!--del_lnk--> Carlo Rossi.<p>The former imperial capital is rich in educational institutions. <!--del_lnk--> Saint Petersburg State University occupies several buildings on the Vasilievsky Island, including the spacious baroque edifice of Twelve Collegia (1722&ndash;1744). The <!--del_lnk--> Academy of Arts (1764&ndash;1788), an exceedingly handsome structure, overlooks a <!--del_lnk--> quayside adorned with genuine <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egyptian</a> <!--del_lnk--> griffins and <!--del_lnk--> sphinxes. The <!--del_lnk--> Smolny Institute (1806&ndash;1808), originally the first school for Russian women, was picked up by <a href="../../wp/v/Vladimir_Lenin.htm" title="Lenin">Lenin</a> as his headquarters during the <a href="../../wp/r/Russian_Revolution_of_1917.htm" title="Russian Revolution of 1917">Russian Revolution of 1917</a>. The Catherine Institute (1804&ndash;1807), also designed by Quarenghi, has been affiliated with the <!--del_lnk--> Russian National Library. Another Neoclassical building by Quarenghi, a roomy Horse Guards Riding School (1804&ndash;1807), was recently designated the Central <!--del_lnk--> Exhibition Hall.<p>Some of the city shops and <!--del_lnk--> storehouses are landmarks in their own right. For example, the monumental <!--del_lnk--> New Holland Arch (1779&ndash;1787) and adjacent walls of the <!--del_lnk--> New Holland isle are occupied by commercial enterprises. <!--del_lnk--> The Merchant Court on the <!--del_lnk--> Nevsky Prospekt (1761&ndash;1785), also designed by <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe, houses the largest extant 18th-century supermarket in the world, as well as several coffee bars and a <!--del_lnk--> metro station. Nearby are the Circular Market, erected in 1785&ndash;1790, and <!--del_lnk--> the Passage, one of the great covered <!--del_lnk--> arcades of the mid-19th century. Other <!--del_lnk--> department stores, built in the majestic <!--del_lnk--> Art Nouveau style, line the Nevsky Prospekt and include the Eliseev emporium and the House of Books.<p>St Petersburg is a home to many <a href="../../wp/t/Theatre.htm" title="Theatre">theatres</a>. The oldest is the <!--del_lnk--> Hermitage Theatre, a private palatial theatre of <!--del_lnk--> Catherine the Great, still preserving the complex stage machinery of the 18th-century. The Alexandrine Theatre, built in 1828&ndash;1832 by Carlo Rossi, was named after the wife of <!--del_lnk--> Nicholas I. Much more famous outside Russia is the <!--del_lnk--> Mariinsky Theatre (formerly known as the Kirov Theatre of Opera and Ballet), which has been styled the capital of the world <!--del_lnk--> ballet. Also worthy of note is the <!--del_lnk--> Ciniselli Circus, one of the oldest circus buildings in the world. The <!--del_lnk--> city conservatory, the first in Russia, was opened in 1862 and bears the name of <a href="../../wp/n/Nikolai_Rimsky-Korsakov.htm" title="Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov">Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov</a>; its alumni include <a href="../../wp/p/Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky.htm" title="Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Prokofiev, and <!--del_lnk--> Shostakovich.<p><a id="Public_monuments" name="Public_monuments"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Public monuments</span></h3>

      <p>Probably the most familiar symbol of St Petersburg is the <!--del_lnk--> equestrian statue of <a href="../../wp/p/Peter_I_of_Russia.htm" title="Peter I of Russia">Peter the Great</a>, installed in 1782 on the <!--del_lnk--> Senate Square. Considered the greatest masterpiece of the French-born <!--del_lnk--> Etienne Maurice Falconet, the statue figures prominently in the Russian literature under the name of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Bronze Horseman</i>.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Palace Square is dominated by the unique <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Column (1830&ndash;1834), the tallest of its kind in the world and so nicely set that no attachment to the base is needed. A striking monument to <!--del_lnk--> Generalissimo <!--del_lnk--> Suvorov, represented as a youthful god of war, was erected in 1801 on the <!--del_lnk--> Field of Mars, formerly used for military parades and popular festivities. <!--del_lnk--> Saint Isaac&#39;s Square is graced by the <!--del_lnk--> Monument to Nicholas I (1856&ndash;1859), which was spared by <!--del_lnk--> Bolshevik authorities from destruction as the first <!--del_lnk--> equestrian statue in the world with merely two support points (the rear feet of the horse).<p>The public <!--del_lnk--> monuments of St Petersburg also include <!--del_lnk--> Mikeshin&#39;s circular statue of <!--del_lnk--> Catherine II on the <!--del_lnk--> Nevsky Avenue, fine horse statues on the <!--del_lnk--> Anichkov Bridge, a <a href="../../wp/a/Auguste_Rodin.htm" title="Rodin">Rodin</a>-like equestrian statue of <!--del_lnk--> Alexander III by <!--del_lnk--> Paolo Troubetzkoy, and the Tercentenary monument presented by <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> in 2003 and installed on the <!--del_lnk--> Sennaya Square.<p>Some of the most important events in the city&#39;s history are represented by particular monuments. The <!--del_lnk--> Russian victory over <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleon_I_of_France.htm" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>, for example, was commemorated by the <!--del_lnk--> Narva Triumphal Gate (1827&ndash;1834), and the victory in the <!--del_lnk--> Russo-Turkish War, 1828-1829 &mdash; by the <!--del_lnk--> Moscow Triumphal Gates (1834&ndash;1838). Following this tradition, the <!--del_lnk--> Piskarevskoye Cemetery was opened in 1960 as a monument to the victims of the <!--del_lnk--> 900-Day Siege.<p><a id="Suburbs" name="Suburbs"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Suburbs</span></h3>
      <p>St Petersburg is surrounded by imperial residences, some of which are inscribed in the <!--del_lnk--> World Heritage list. These include: <!--del_lnk--> Peterhof, with the Grand Peterhof Palace and glorious fountain cascades; <!--del_lnk--> Tsarskoe Selo, with the baroque <!--del_lnk--> Catherine Palace and the neoclassical <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Palace; and <!--del_lnk--> Pavlovsk, which contains a domed palace of <!--del_lnk--> Emperor Paul (1782&ndash;1786) and one of the largest English-style parks in Europe.<p>Much of Peterhof and Tsarskoe Selo had to be restored after being dynamited by the retreating Germans in 1944. Other imperial residences have yet to be revived to their former glory. <!--del_lnk--> Gatchina, lying 45 km southwest of St Petersburg, retains a royal <!--del_lnk--> castle with 600 rooms surrounded by a park. <!--del_lnk--> Oranienbaum, founded by <!--del_lnk--> Prince Menshikov, features his spacious baroque residence and the sumptuously decorated Chinese palace. <!--del_lnk--> Strelna has a hunting lodge of <a href="../../wp/p/Peter_I_of_Russia.htm" title="Peter I of Russia">Peter the Great</a> and the reconstructed <!--del_lnk--> Constantine Palace, used for official summits of the Russian president with foreign leaders.<p>Other notable suburbs are <!--del_lnk--> Shlisselburg, with a <!--del_lnk--> medieval fortress, and <!--del_lnk--> Kronstadt, with its 19th-century fortifications and naval monuments. <!--del_lnk--> Catherinehof, originally intended as a garden suburb, was engulfed by the city in the 19th century.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p>Tsar <a href="../../wp/p/Peter_I_of_Russia.htm" title="Peter I of Russia">Peter the Great</a> founded the city on <!--del_lnk--> May 27 (<!--del_lnk--> May 16, <!--del_lnk--> Old Style), 1703 after reconquering the <!--del_lnk--> Ingrian land from <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>. He named it after his patron saint, the apostle <!--del_lnk--> Saint Peter. The original name of <i>SanktPiterburh</i> was actually an imitation of the pronunciation of <a href="../../wp/d/Dutch_language.htm" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a> <i>Sint Petersburg</i>; Peter had lived and studied in the Netherlands for quite some time. The Swedish fortress of <!--del_lnk--> Nyenskans and the city <!--del_lnk--> Nyen had formerly occupied the site, in the <!--del_lnk--> marshlands where the river <!--del_lnk--> Neva drains into the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf of Finland.<p>Since construction began during a time of war, the new city&#39;s first building was a fortification. Known today as the <!--del_lnk--> Peter and Paul Fortress, it originally also bore the name of <i>SanktPiterburh</i>. It was laid down on <i>Zaiachiy</i> (Hare&#39;s) Island, just off the right bank of the Neva, a couple of miles inland from the Gulf. The marshland was drained and the city spread outward from the fortress under the supervision of <!--del_lnk--> German <!--del_lnk--> engineers whom Peter had invited to Russia. Peter forbade the construction of stone buildings in all of Russia outside of St Petersburg, so that all stonemasons would come to help build the new city. <!--del_lnk--> Serfs provided most of the labor for the project. According to one estimate, 30,000 died <!--del_lnk--> .<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>&quot;The most artificial city in the world&quot;, as <!--del_lnk--> Dostoevsky put it, was intended to become the new <a href="../../wp/c/Capital.htm" title="Capital">capital</a> of Russia. By virtue of its position on an arm of the <a href="../../wp/b/Baltic_Sea.htm" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, it was called by <!--del_lnk--> Pushkin a &quot;window on Europe&quot;. It was also a base for Peter&#39;s navy, protected by the island fortress of <!--del_lnk--> Kronstadt, built soon after the city. Indeed, the first person to build a house in Saint Petersburg was <!--del_lnk--> Cornelis Cruys, commander of the <!--del_lnk--> Baltic Fleet. Inspired by example of <!--del_lnk--> Venice and <a href="../../wp/a/Amsterdam.htm" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, Peter the Great envisaged boats and coracles as principal means of transport in his city of canals. No permanent bridges across the Neva were allowed until 1850.<p>In the course of the 18th and 19th centuries, Russia&#39;s elite built lavishly in the city, leaving many palaces that survive to this day. But the city also suffered from regular flooding. The worst such flood occurred in <!--del_lnk--> November 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1824, when the water level rose 4.21 meters above normal. The playwright <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Griboyedov wrote, &quot;<i>The embankments of the various canals had disappeared and all the canals had united into one. Hundred-year-old trees in the Summer Garden were ripped from the ground and lying in rows, roots upward.</i>&quot; When the waters receded 569 dead bodies were found, with thousands more injured or made ill, and more than 300 buildings had been washed away. The 1824 inundation is the setting for <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Pushkin&#39;s famous poem, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Bronze Horseman</i> (1834). Other disastrous floods took place in 1777 and 1924.<p><!--del_lnk--> Alexander II&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> emancipation of the serfs (1861) caused the influx of large numbers of poor into the city. Tenements were erected on the outskirts, and nascent <a href="../../wp/i/Industry.htm" title="Industry">industry</a> sprang up. By the end of the century, St Petersburg had grown up into one of the largest industrial hubs in Europe.<p>With the growth of industry, radical movements were also astir. <a href="../../wp/s/Socialism.htm" title="Socialism">Socialist</a> organizations were responsible for the assassinations of many royal officials, including that of <!--del_lnk--> Alexander II in 1881. The <!--del_lnk--> Revolution of 1905 began here and spread rapidly into the provinces. During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, the name <i>Sankt Peterburg</i> was seen to be too German and, on the initiative of Tsar <!--del_lnk--> Nicholas II, the city was renamed <i>Petrograd</i> on <!--del_lnk--> August 31 (<!--del_lnk--> August 18, <!--del_lnk--> Old Style), 1914.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>1917 saw the beginnings of the Russian Revolution. The first step (the <!--del_lnk--> February Revolution) was the removal of the Tsarist government and the establishment of two centers of political power, the <!--del_lnk--> Provisional government and the <!--del_lnk--> Petrograd Soviet. The Provisional government was overthrown in the <!--del_lnk--> October Revolution, and the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Civil War broke out. The city&#39;s proximity to anti-revolutionary armies, and generally unstable political climate, forced <!--del_lnk--> Bolshevik leader <a href="../../wp/v/Vladimir_Lenin.htm" title="Vladimir Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> to flee to Russia&#39;s historic former capital at <a href="../../wp/m/Moscow.htm" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> on <!--del_lnk--> March 5, <!--del_lnk--> 1918. The move may have been intended as temporary (it was certainly portrayed as such), but Moscow has remained the capital ever since. On <!--del_lnk--> January 24, <!--del_lnk--> 1924, three days after Lenin&#39;s death, Petrograd was renamed <i>Leningrad</i> in his honour. The central committee&#39;s reason for renaming the city again was that Lenin had led the October revolution. Deeper reasons existed at the level of political symbolism: Saint Petersburg had stood as the head of the Tsarist empire. After Moscow it was the largest city and the change gave great prestige to Lenin. The renaming to Leningrad emphatically symbolised the upheaval that had occurred to the social and political system.<p>The government&#39;s removal to <a href="../../wp/m/Moscow.htm" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> caused a reversal of the mass immigration of the latter 19th century. The benefits of capital status had left the city. Petrograd&#39;s population in 1920 was a third of what it had been in 1915 (see table below).<p>During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Leningrad was surrounded and besieged by the German <!--del_lnk--> Wehrmacht in the <!--del_lnk--> Siege of Leningrad from <!--del_lnk--> September 8, <!--del_lnk--> 1941, until <!--del_lnk--> January 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1944, a total of twenty-nine months. A &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Road of Life&quot; was established over <!--del_lnk--> Lake Ladoga (frozen for a large part of the year), but it was open to airstrikes; only one out of three supply trucks that embarked on the journey reached its destination. Another route was opened on <!--del_lnk--> January 18, <!--del_lnk--> 1943 after the <!--del_lnk--> Red Army had succeeded in securing a narrow break-through of the <!--del_lnk--> Wehrmacht encirclement of the city. Some 800,000 of the city&#39;s 3,000,000 inhabitants are estimated to have perished. For the heroic tenacity of the city&#39;s population, Leningrad became the first Soviet city to be awarded the title <!--del_lnk--> Hero City.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>According to some historians, <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> ruler <a href="../../wp/j/Joseph_Stalin.htm" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> delayed the breaking of the siege and stymied the evacuation of the city with the intention of letting its <i><!--del_lnk--> intelligentsia</i> perish at the hands of the Germans. Many of those Leningraders who were evacuated to distant corners of the Soviet Union never returned to their home city.<p>The war damaged the city and killed off many of those old Petersburgers who had not fled after the revolution and did not perish in the mass purges before the war. Nonetheless, Leningrad and many of its suburbs were rebuilt over the following decades to the old drawings. Though changes in the social fabric were more permanent, the city remained an intellectual and arts centre.<p>After the collapse of the Soviet Union, a bare majority (54%) of the population agreed to restore &quot;<i>the original name, Saint Petersburg</i>,&quot; on <!--del_lnk--> September 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1991 (see above). As well as the city, 39 streets, six bridges, three <!--del_lnk--> Saint Petersburg Metro stations and six parks were renamed. Nevertheless, some, especially older people, still use the old names and, for example, use the old addresses on letters. The name releases positive associations particularly in connection with the siege - so that on holidays even authorities call places connected with World War II &quot;Hero city Leningrad&quot;. Among young people the name <i>Leningrad</i> seems to be a vague protest against the new society. One of the most successful bands in Russia, a <!--del_lnk--> Ska punk band from Saint Petersburg, called themselves <!--del_lnk--> Leningrad (not to be confused with <i><!--del_lnk--> Leningrad Cowboys</i> from Finland).<p>After a popular vote the name of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Oblast</i> (administrative province) of which the city is the capital remained <!--del_lnk--> Leningrad Oblast.<p><a id="Population" name="Population"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Population</span></h2>

      <p>St. Petersburg has always been known for its high-quality cultural life. Among the city&#39;s more than forty theaters is the world-famous Kirov Theatre (known now by its pre-revolution name of <!--del_lnk--> Mariinsky Theatre), home to the <!--del_lnk--> Kirov Ballet company and first-class ballet and opera. The <!--del_lnk--> St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra is one of the best in Russia.<p>The Russian composer <!--del_lnk--> Dmitri Shostakovich, who was born in St. Petersburg, dedicated his <!--del_lnk--> Seventh Symphony to the city, calling it the &quot;Leningrad Symphony.&quot; He wrote the symphony during the German siege of the city in 1941.<p>St. Petersburg has also been home to the newest movements in modern music. For example, in 1972 mathematics student <!--del_lnk--> Boris Grebenshchikov founded the band <!--del_lnk--> Aquarium, an underground rock group that grew to huge popularity in the 70s and 80s. St. Petersburg was similarly home to <!--del_lnk--> Kino, headed by the legendary <!--del_lnk--> Viktor Tsoi.

      <p>The end of the cultural predominance of St. Petersburg coincided with <a href="../../wp/m/Moscow.htm" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>&#39;s being chosen as the new capital and the dawn of film industry in Russia.
