      <p>Although 100% sulfuric acid can be made, this loses <!--del_lnk--> SO<sub>3</sub> at the boiling point to produce 98.3% acid. The 98% grade is also more stable for storage, making it the usual form for &quot;concentrated&quot; sulfuric acid. Other <!--del_lnk--> concentrations of sulfuric acid are used for different purposes. Some common concentrations are:<ul>
       <li>10%, dilute sulfuric acid for laboratory use (pH 1)<li>33.5%, battery acid (used in <!--del_lnk--> lead-acid batteries) (pH 0.5)<li>62.18%, chamber or fertilizer acid (pH about 0.4)<li>77.67%, tower or Glover acid (pH about 0.25)<li>98%, concentrated (pH about 0.1)</ul>
      <p>Since sulfuric acid is a <!--del_lnk--> strong acid, a 0.50 <!--del_lnk--> M solution of sulfuric acid has a <!--del_lnk--> pH close to zero.<p>Different purities are also available. Technical grade H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is impure and often colored, but it is suitable for making fertilizer. Pure grades such as US <!--del_lnk--> Pharmacopoeia (USP) grade are used for making <!--del_lnk--> pharmaceuticals and <!--del_lnk--> dyestuffs.<p>When high concentrations of SO<sub>3</sub><i>(<a href="../../wp/g/Gas.htm" title="Gas">g</a>)</i> are added to sulfuric acid, H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> forms. This is called <!--del_lnk--> pyrosulfuric acid, fuming sulfuric acid or <!--del_lnk--> oleum or, less commonly, Nordhausen acid. Concentrations of oleum are either expressed in terms of % SO<sub>3</sub> (called % oleum) or as % H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (the amount made if H<sub>2</sub>O were added); common concentrations are 40% oleum (109% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and 65% oleum (114.6% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>). Pure H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> is in fact a solid, melting point 36 &deg;C.<p><a id="Polarity_and_conductivity" name="Polarity_and_conductivity"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Polarity and conductivity</span></h3>
      <p>Anhydrous H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is a very polar liquid, with a <!--del_lnk--> dielectric constant of around 100. This is due to the fact that it can dissociate by <!--del_lnk--> protonating itself, a process known as <i>autoprotolysis</i>, which occurs to a high degree, more than 10 billion times the level seen in <!--del_lnk--> water:<dl>
       <dd>2 H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> <span class="Unicode">&#x21CC;</span> H<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> + HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>&minus;</sup></dl>
      <p>This allows protons to be highly mobile in H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. It also makes sulfuric acid an excellent solvent for many reactions. In fact, the <!--del_lnk--> equilibrium is more complex than shown above. 100% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> contains the following species at equilibrium (figures shown as mmol per kg solvent): HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> (15.0), H<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (11.3), H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> (8.0), HS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> (4.4), <!--del_lnk--> H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> (3.6), H<sub>2</sub>O (0.1).<p><a id="Chemical_properties" name="Chemical_properties"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Chemical properties</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Reaction_with_water" name="Reaction_with_water"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Reaction with water</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> hydration reaction of sulfuric acid is highly <!--del_lnk--> exothermic. If <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a> is added to concentrated sulfuric acid, it can boil and spit dangerously. One should always add the acid to the water rather than the water to the acid. This can be remembered through <!--del_lnk--> mnemonics such as &quot;Always do things as you oughta, add the acid to the water. If you think your life&#39;s too placid, add the water to the acid&quot;, &quot;A.A.: Add Acid&quot;, or &quot;Drop acid, not water.&quot; Note that part of this problem is due to the relative densities of the two liquids. Water is less <!--del_lnk--> dense than sulfuric acid and will tend to float above the acid. The reaction is best thought of as forming <!--del_lnk--> hydronium ions, by:<dl>
       <dd>H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> + HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup></dl>
      <p>And then:<dl>
       <dd>HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> + SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup></dl>
      <p>Because the hydration of sulfuric acid is <!--del_lnk--> thermodynamically favorable (<!--del_lnk--> &Delta;H = -880 k<!--del_lnk--> J/<!--del_lnk--> mol), sulfuric acid is an excellent dehydrating agent, and is used to prepare many dried fruits. The affinity of sulfuric acid for <!--del_lnk--> water is sufficiently strong that it will take <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> atoms out of other compounds; for example, mixing <!--del_lnk--> starch (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>)<sub>n</sub> and concentrated sulfuric acid will give elemental <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon.htm" title="Carbon">carbon</a> and water which is absorbed by the sulfuric acid (which becomes slightly diluted): (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>)<sub>n</sub> &rarr; 6C + 6H<sub>2</sub>O. The effect of this can be seen when concentrated sulfuric acid is spilled on paper; the starch reacts to give a <!--del_lnk--> burned appearance, the <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon.htm" title="Carbon">carbon</a> appears as soot would in a fire. A more dramatic illustration occurs when sulfuric acid is added to a tablespoon of white <a href="../../wp/s/Sugar.htm" title="Sugar">sugar</a> in a cup when a tall rigid column of black porous carbon smelling strongly of <!--del_lnk--> caramel emerges from the cup.<p><a id="Other_reactions_of_sulfuric_acid" name="Other_reactions_of_sulfuric_acid"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other reactions of sulfuric acid</span></h3>
      <p>As an acid, sulfuric acid reacts with most <!--del_lnk--> bases to give the corresponding <!--del_lnk--> sulfate. For example, <!--del_lnk--> copper(II) sulfate, the familiar blue salt of <a href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper">copper</a> used for <!--del_lnk--> electroplating and as a <!--del_lnk--> fungicide, is prepared by the reaction of <!--del_lnk--> copper(II) oxide with sulfuric acid:<dl>
       <dd><!--del_lnk--> CuO + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; <!--del_lnk--> CuSO<sub>4</sub> + <!--del_lnk--> H<sub>2</sub>O</dl>
      <p>Sulfuric acid can be used to displace weaker acids from their salts, for example <!--del_lnk--> sodium acetate gives <a href="../../wp/a/Acetic_acid.htm" title="Acetic acid">acetic acid</a>:<p>H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + <!--del_lnk--> CH<sub>3</sub>COONa &rarr; <!--del_lnk--> NaHSO<sub>4</sub> + <a href="../../wp/a/Acetic_acid.htm" title="Acetic acid">CH<sub>3</sub>COOH</a><p>Likewise the reaction of sulfuric acid with <a href="../../wp/p/Potassium_nitrate.htm" title="Potassium nitrate">potassium nitrate</a> can be used to produce <!--del_lnk--> nitric acid, along with a precipitate of <!--del_lnk--> potassium bisulfate. With <!--del_lnk--> nitric acid itself, sulfuric acid acts as both an acid and a dehydrating agent, forming the <!--del_lnk--> nitronium ion NO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, which is important in <!--del_lnk--> nitration reactions involving <!--del_lnk--> electrophilic aromatic substitution. This type of reaction where protonation occurs on an <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> atom, is important in many reactions in <!--del_lnk--> organic chemistry, such as <!--del_lnk--> Fischer esterification and <!--del_lnk--> dehydration of alcohols.<p>Sulfuric acid reacts with most metals in a single displacement reaction to produce <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> gas and the metal sulfate.

The reaction with iron (shown) is typical for most of these metals, but the reaction with tin is unusual in that it produces <!--del_lnk--> sulfur dioxide rather than hydrogen.<dl>

      <p>Sulfuric acid is a constituent of <a href="../../wp/a/Acid_rain.htm" title="Acid rain">acid rain</a>, being formed by atmospheric <!--del_lnk--> oxidation of <!--del_lnk--> sulfur dioxide in the presence of <!--del_lnk--> water - i.e. oxidation of <!--del_lnk--> sulfurous acid. Sulfur dioxide is the main product when the sulphur in sulfur-containing fuels such as coal or oil is burned.<p>Sulfuric acid is formed naturally by the oxidation of sulfide minerals, such as iron sulfide. The resulting water can be highly acidic and is called Acid Rock Drainage (ARD). The acidic water so formed can dissolve metals present in sulfide ores, resulting in brightly colored and toxic streams. The oxidation of iron sulfide <a href="../../wp/p/Pyrite.htm" title="Pyrite">pyrite</a> by molecular oxygen produces iron(II), or Fe<sup>2+</sup>:<dl>

      <p>The discovery of sulfuric acid is credited to the 8th century <a href="../../wp/a/Alchemy.htm" title="Alchemy">alchemist</a> <!--del_lnk--> Jabir ibn Hayyan. It was studied later by the 9th century physician and alchemist <!--del_lnk--> Ibn Zakariya al-Razi (Rhases), who obtained the substance by <!--del_lnk--> dry distillation of minerals including <!--del_lnk--> iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate, FeSO<sub>4</sub> &bull; 7H<sub>2</sub>O, and <!--del_lnk--> copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate, CuSO<sub>4</sub> &bull; 5H<sub>2</sub>O. When heated, these compounds decompose to <!--del_lnk--> iron(II) oxide and <!--del_lnk--> copper(II) oxide, respectively, giving off <!--del_lnk--> water and <!--del_lnk--> sulfur trioxide, which combine to produce a dilute solution of sulfuric acid. This method was popularized in Europe through translations of Arabic and Persian treatises and books by European alchemists, such as the 13th-century German <!--del_lnk--> Albertus Magnus.<p>Sulfuric acid was known to medieval European alchemists as <i>oil of vitriol</i>, <i>spirit of vitriol</i>, or simply <i>vitriol</i>, among other names. The word vitriol derives from the Latin vitreus, &#39;glass&#39;, for the glassy appearance of the sulfate salts, which also carried the name vitriol. Salts called by this name included <!--del_lnk--> copper(II) sulfate (blue vitriol, or rarely <!--del_lnk--> Roman vitriol), <!--del_lnk--> zinc sulfate (white vitriol), <!--del_lnk--> iron(II) sulfate (green vitriol), <!--del_lnk--> iron(III) sulfate (vitriol of Mars), and <!--del_lnk--> cobalt(II) sulfate (red vitriol).<p>Vitriol was widely considered the most important <a href="../../wp/a/Alchemy.htm" title="Alchemy">alchemical</a> substance, intended to be used as a <!--del_lnk--> philosopher&#39;s stone. Highly purified vitriol was used as a medium to react substances in. This was largely because the acid does not react with <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a>, often the final aim of alchemical processes. The importance of vitriol to alchemy is highlighted in the alchemical motto <i>Visita Interiora Terrae Rectificando Invenies Occultum Lapidem</i> (&#39;Visit the interior of the earth and rectifying (i.e. purifying) you will find the hidden/secret stone&#39;), found in <i><!--del_lnk--> L&#39;Azoth des Philosophes</i> by the 15th Century alchemist <!--del_lnk--> Basilius Valentinus, which is a <!--del_lnk--> backronym.<p>In the 17th century, the German-Dutch chemist <!--del_lnk--> Johann Glauber prepared sulfuric acid by burning <a href="../../wp/s/Sulfur.htm" title="Sulfur">sulfur</a> together with <!--del_lnk--> saltpeter (<a href="../../wp/p/Potassium_nitrate.htm" title="Potassium nitrate">potassium nitrate</a>, KNO<sub>3</sub>), in the presence of steam. As the saltpeter decomposes, it oxidizes the sulfur to SO<sub>3</sub>, which combines with water to produce sulfuric acid. In 1736, Joshua Ward, a <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> pharmacist, used this method to begin the first large-scale production of sulfuric acid.<p>In 1746 in <a href="../../wp/b/Birmingham.htm" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, <!--del_lnk--> John Roebuck began producing sulfuric acid this way in <a href="../../wp/l/Lead.htm" title="Lead">lead</a>-lined chambers, which were stronger, less expensive, and could be made larger than the glass containers which had been used previously. This <i><!--del_lnk--> lead chamber process</i> allowed the effective industrialization of sulfuric acid production, and with several refinements remained the standard method of production for almost two centuries.<p>John Roebuck&#39;s sulfuric acid was only about 35&ndash;40% sulfuric acid. Later refinements in the lead-chamber process by the French chemist <!--del_lnk--> Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac and the British chemist <!--del_lnk--> John Glover improved this to 78%. However, the manufacture of some <!--del_lnk--> dyes and other chemical processes require a more concentrated product, and throughout the 18th century, this could only be made by <!--del_lnk--> dry distilling minerals in a technique similar to the original <a href="../../wp/a/Alchemy.htm" title="Alchemy">alchemical</a> processes. <a href="../../wp/p/Pyrite.htm" title="Pyrite">Pyrite</a> (<!--del_lnk--> iron disulfide, FeS<sub>2</sub>) was heated in air to yield <!--del_lnk--> iron (II) sulfate, FeSO<sub>4</sub>, which was oxidized by further heating in air to form <!--del_lnk--> iron(III) sulfate, Fe<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, which when heated to 480 &deg;C decomposed to <!--del_lnk--> iron(III) oxide and <!--del_lnk--> sulfur trioxide, which could be passed through <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a> to yield sulfuric acid in any concentration. The expense of this process prevented the large-scale use of concentrated sulfuric acid.<p>In 1831, the British <!--del_lnk--> vinegar merchant Peregrine Phillips patented a far more economical process for producing sulfur trioxide and concentrated sulfuric acid, now known as the <!--del_lnk--> contact process. Essentially all of the world&#39;s supply of sulfuric acid is now produced by this method.<p><a id="Manufacture" name="Manufacture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Manufacture</span></h2>
      <p>Sulfuric acid is produced from <a href="../../wp/s/Sulfur.htm" title="Sulfur">sulfur</a>, <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> and <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a> via the <!--del_lnk--> contact process.<p>In the first step, <a href="../../wp/s/Sulfur.htm" title="Sulfur">sulfur</a> is burned to produce <!--del_lnk--> sulfur dioxide.<dl>

      <p>This is then oxidised to <!--del_lnk--> sulfur trioxide using <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> in the presence of a <!--del_lnk--> vanadium(V) oxide <!--del_lnk--> catalyst.<dl>

      <p>Finally the <!--del_lnk--> sulfur trioxide is treated with water (usually as 97-98% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> containing 2-3% water) to produce 98-99% sulfuric acid.<dl>

      <p>Note that directly dissolving SO<sub>3</sub> in water is impractical due to the highly exothermic nature of the reaction. Mists are formed instead of a liquid. Alternatively, the SO<sub>3</sub> is absorbed into H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to produce <!--del_lnk--> oleum (H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>), which is then diluted to form sulfuric acid.<dl>

      <p>Sulfuric acid is a very important <!--del_lnk--> commodity chemical, and indeed a nation&#39;s sulfuric acid production is a good indicator of its industrial strength. The major use (60% of total worldwide) for sulfuric acid is in the &quot;wet method&quot; for the production of <!--del_lnk--> phosphoric acid, used for manufacture of <!--del_lnk--> phosphate <a href="../../wp/f/Fertilizer.htm" title="Fertilizer">fertilizers</a> as well as <!--del_lnk--> trisodium phosphate for detergents. In this method phosphate rock is used, and more than 100 million tonnes is processed annually. This raw material is shown below as <!--del_lnk--> fluorapatite, though the exact composition may vary. This is treated with 93% sulfuric acid to produce <!--del_lnk--> calcium sulfate, <!--del_lnk--> hydrogen fluoride (HF) and <!--del_lnk--> phosphoric acid. The HF is removed as <!--del_lnk--> hydrofluoric acid. The overall process can be represented as:<dl>
       <dd><!--del_lnk--> Ca<sub>5</sub>F(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> + 5 H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 10 <!--del_lnk--> H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; 5 <!--del_lnk--> CaSO<sub>4</sub>&middot;2 H<sub>2</sub>O + <!--del_lnk--> HF + 3 <!--del_lnk--> H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub></dl>
      <p>Sulfuric acid is used in large quantities in <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Steel.htm" title="Steel">steel</a> making principally as pickling-acid used to remove oxidation, <!--del_lnk--> rust and scale from rolled sheet and billets prior to sale into the <a href="../../wp/a/Automobile.htm" title="Automobile">automobile</a> and white-goods business. The used acid is often re-cycled using a Spent Acid Regeneration (SAR) plant. These plants combust the spent acid with natural gas, refinery gas, fuel oil or other suitable fuel source. This combustion process produces gaseous sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and sulfur trioxide (SO<sub>3</sub>) which are then used to manufacture &quot;new&quot; sulfuric acid. These types of plants are common additions to metal smelting plants, oil refineries, and other places where sulfuric acid is consumed on a large scale, as operating a SAR plant is much cheaper than purchasing the commodity on the open market.<p><!--del_lnk--> Ammonium sulfate, an important nitrogen fertilizer is most commonly produced as a by-product from coking plants supplying the iron and steel making plants, Reacting the <a href="../../wp/a/Ammonia.htm" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a> produced in the thermal decomposition of <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a> with waste sulfuric acid allows the ammonia to be crystalised out as a salt (often brown because of iron contamination) and sold into the agro-chemicals industry.<p>Another important use for sulfuric acid is for the manufacture of <!--del_lnk--> aluminium sulfate, also known as papermaker&#39;s alum. This can react with small amounts of soap on <!--del_lnk--> paper pulp fibres to give gelatinous aluminium <!--del_lnk--> carboxylates, which help to coagulate the pulp fibres into a hard paper surface. It is also used for making <!--del_lnk--> aluminium hydroxide, which is used at <!--del_lnk--> water treatment plants to <!--del_lnk--> filter out impurities, as well as to improve the taste of the <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a>. Aluminium sulfate is made by reacting <!--del_lnk--> bauxite with sulfuric acid:<dl>

      <p>Sulfuric acid is used for a variety of other purposes in the chemical industry. For example, it is the usual acid catalyst for the conversion of <!--del_lnk--> cyclohexanoneoxime to <!--del_lnk--> caprolactam, used for making <!--del_lnk--> nylon. It is used for making <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrochloric_acid.htm" title="Hydrochloric acid">hydrochloric acid</a> from <a href="../../wp/s/Salt.htm" title="Salt">salt</a> via the <!--del_lnk--> Mannheim process. Much H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is used in <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> refining, for example as a catalyst for the reaction of <!--del_lnk--> isobutane with <!--del_lnk--> isobutylene to give <!--del_lnk--> isooctane, a compound that raises the <!--del_lnk--> octane rating of <!--del_lnk--> gasoline (petrol). Sulfuric acid is also important in the manufacture of <!--del_lnk--> dyestuffs.<p>A mixture of sulfuric acid and water is sometimes used as the electrolyte in various types of <!--del_lnk--> lead-acid battery where it undergoes a reversible reaction where <a href="../../wp/l/Lead.htm" title="Lead">lead</a> and <!--del_lnk--> lead dioxide are converted to <!--del_lnk--> lead(II) sulfate. Sulfuric acid is also the principal ingredient in some drain cleaners, used to clear blockages consisting of paper, rags, and other materials not easily dissolved by <a href="../../wp/s/Sodium_hydroxide.htm" title="Sodium hydroxide">caustic</a> solutions.<p>Sulfuric acid is also used as a general dehydrating agent in its concentrated form.

      <p>The sulfur and <a href="../../wp/i/Iodine.htm" title="Iodine">iodine</a> compounds are recovered and reused, hence the consideration of the process as a cycle.

Additionally, the sulfur-iodine cycle has a much lower maximum operating temperature compared to traditional electrolysis.<p>The sulfur-iodine cycle is currently being researched as a feasible method of obtaining hydrogen, but the concentrated, corrosive acid at high temperatures poses currently insurmountable safety hazards if the process were built on large-scale.<p><a id="Safety" name="Safety"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Safety</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Laboratory_hazards" name="Laboratory_hazards"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Laboratory hazards</span></h3>
      <p>The corrosive properties of sulfuric acid are accentuated by its highly <!--del_lnk--> exothermic reaction with <!--del_lnk--> water. Hence burns from sulfuric acid are potentially more serious than those of comparable strong acids (e.g. <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrochloric_acid.htm" title="Hydrochloric acid">hydrochloric acid</a>), as there is additional tissue damage due to dehydration and particularly due to the heat liberated by the reaction with water, i.e. secondary thermal damage. The danger is obviously greater with more concentrated preparations of sulfuric acid, but it should be remembered that even the normal laboratory &quot;dilute&quot; grade (approx. 1&nbsp;M, 10%) will char paper by dehydration if left in contact for a sufficient length of time. The standard first aid treatment for acid spills on the skin is, as for other <a href="../../wp/c/Corrosion.htm" title="Corrosion">corrosive</a> agents, irrigation with large quantities of water: in the case of sulfuric acid it is important that the acid should be removed before washing, as a further heat burn could result from the exothermic dilution of the acid. Washing should be continued for a sufficient length of time&mdash;at least ten to fifteen minutes&mdash;in order to cool the tissue surrounding the acid burn and to prevent secondary damage. Contaminated clothing must be removed immediately and the underlying skin washed thoroughly.<p>Preparation of the diluted acid can also be dangerous due to the heat released in the dilution process. It is essential that the concentrated acid is added to water and not the other way round, to take advantage of the relatively high <!--del_lnk--> heat capacity of water. Addition of water to concentrated sulfuric acid leads at best to the dispersal of a sulfuric acid <!--del_lnk--> aerosol, at worst to an <!--del_lnk--> explosion. Preparation of solutions greater than 6&nbsp;M (35%) in concentration is the most dangerous, as the heat produced can be sufficient to boil the diluted acid: efficient mechanical stirring and external cooling (e.g. an ice bath) are essential.<p><a id="Industrial_hazards" name="Industrial_hazards"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Industrial hazards</span></h3>
      <p>Although sulfuric acid is non-flammable, contact with metals in the event of a spillage can lead to the liberation of <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> gas. The dispersal of acid aerosols and gaseous <!--del_lnk--> sulfur dioxide is an additional hazard of fires involving sulfuric acid. Water should <b>not</b> be used as the extinguishing agent because of the risk of further dispersal of aerosols: <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> is preferred where possible.<p>Sulfuric acid is not considered toxic besides its obvious corrosive hazard, and the main occupational risks are skin contact leading to burns (see above) and the inhalation of aerosols. Exposure to aerosols at high concentrations leads to immediate and severe irritation of the eyes, respiratory tract and mucous membranes: this ceases rapidly after exposure, although there is a risk of subsequent <!--del_lnk--> pulmonary edema if tissue damage has been more severe. At lower concentrations, the most commonly reported symptom of chronic exposure to sulfuric acid aerosols is erosion of the teeth, found in virtually all studies: indications of possible chronic damage to the <!--del_lnk--> respiratory tract are inconclusive as of 1997. In the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> permissible exposure limit (PEL) for sulfuric acid is fixed at 1&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup>: limits in other countries are similar. Interestingly there have been reports of sulfuric acid ingestion leading to vitamin B12 deficiency with subacute combined degeneration. The spinal cord is most often affected in such cases, but the optic nerves may show demyelination, loss of axons and gliosis.<p><a id="In_popular_culture" name="In_popular_culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">In popular culture</span></h2>
