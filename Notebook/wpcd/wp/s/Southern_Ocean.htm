      <p>The Southern Ocean is oceanographically defined as an ocean connected with the <!--del_lnk--> Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which circulates around Antarctica. It includes <!--del_lnk--> Amundsen Sea, <!--del_lnk--> Bellingshausen Sea, part of the <!--del_lnk--> Drake Passage, <!--del_lnk--> Ross Sea, a small part of the <!--del_lnk--> Scotia Sea, and <!--del_lnk--> Weddell Sea. The total area is 20,327,000&nbsp;square&nbsp;kilometers (7,848,000&nbsp;mi&sup2;)<p><a id="Features" name="Features"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Features</span></h2>
      <p>The Southern Ocean is located in the Southern Hemisphere possessing typical depths between 4,000&mdash;5,000 meters (13,000 to 16,000 ft) deep over most of its extent with only limited areas of shallow water. The <!--del_lnk--> Antarctic continental shelf is generally narrow and unusually deep, its edge lying at depths up to 800 meters (2,600 ft), compared to a global mean of 133 meters (436 ft).<p>Solstice to <!--del_lnk--> solstice in line with the sun&#39;s seasonal influence, the Antarctic ice pack fluctuates from an average minimum of 2.6 million square kilometers (1.0 million mi&sup2;) in March to about 18.8 million square kilometers (7.2 million mi&sup2;) in September, more than a sevenfold increase in area.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Antarctic Circumpolar Current moves perpetually eastward&mdash;chasing and joining itself, and at 21,000 kilometers (13,000 mi) in length&mdash; it is the world&#39;s longest ocean current, transporting 130 million cubic meters (4.6 billion ft&sup3;) of water per second&mdash;100 times the flow of all the world&#39;s rivers.<p>Its greatest depth is 7,235&nbsp;meters (23,737 ft) at the southern end of the <!--del_lnk--> South Sandwich Trench, at 60&deg;00&#39;S, 024&deg;W<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h2>

      <p>Sea temperatures vary from about &minus;2 to 10&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> &deg;C (28 to 50 <!--del_lnk--> &deg;F). Cyclonic storms travel eastward around the continent and frequently are intense because of the temperature contrast between ice and open ocean. The ocean area from about latitude 40 south to the Antarctic Circle has the strongest average winds found anywhere on Earth. In winter the ocean freezes outward to 65 degrees south latitude in the Pacific sector and 55 degrees south latitude in the Atlantic sector, lowering surface temperatures well below 0 degrees Celsius; at some coastal points intense persistent drainage winds from the interior keep the shoreline ice-free throughout the winter.<p><a id="Natural_resources" name="Natural_resources"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Natural hazards</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Icebergs can be found at any time of year throughout the ocean. Some may have drafts up to several hundred meters; smaller icebergs, iceberg fragments and sea ice (generally 0.5 to 1 meter thick) are also a problem for ships. The deep continental shelf is floored by glacial deposits varying widely over short distances. High winds and large waves during much of the year, along with ship ice, especially May-October make the area even more dangerous. The remoteness of the region makes sources of search and rescue scarce.<p><a id="Environment" name="Environment"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Environment</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Current_issues" name="Current_issues"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Current issues</span></h3>
      <p>Increased solar <a href="../../wp/u/Ultraviolet.htm" title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet radiation</a> resulting from the Antarctic <!--del_lnk--> ozone hole has reduced marine primary productivity (<!--del_lnk--> phytoplankton) by as much as 15% and is damaging the <a href="../../wp/d/DNA.htm" title="DNA">DNA</a> of some fish. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, especially the landing of an estimated five to six times more <!--del_lnk--> Patagonian toothfish than the regulated fishery, likely affects the sustainability of the stock. There is also a high incidental mortality of seabirds resulting from long-line fishing for toothfish.<p><a id="International_agreements" name="International_agreements"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">International agreements</span></h3>
      <p>The Southern Ocean is subject to all international agreements regarding the world&#39;s oceans. In addition, it is subject to these agreements specific to the region:<ul>
       <li>The <!--del_lnk--> International Whaling Commission prohibits commercial whaling south of 40 degrees south (south of 60 degrees south between 50 degrees and 130 degrees west). <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> regularly does not recognize this provision in regards to its whaling permit and whaling for scientific research and occasionally carries out whale hunts in the region.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals has limited seal hunting.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources regulates fishing in the region.</ul>
      <p>Many nations prohibit <a href="../../wp/m/Mineral.htm" title="Mineral">mineral</a> resource exploration and exploitation south of the fluctuating <!--del_lnk--> Polar Front, which is in the middle of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and serves as the dividing line between the very cold polar surface waters to the south and the warmer waters to the north.<p>Since the <!--del_lnk--> Antarctic Treaty covers the portion of the globe south of sixty degrees south, claims to Antarctica and all islands in the Southern Ocean are suspended.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>
      <p>Fisheries in 1998-99 between <!--del_lnk--> 1 July and <!--del_lnk--> 30 June landed 119,898 <!--del_lnk--> tonnes, of which 85% was krill and 14% Patagonian toothfish. International agreements were adopted in late 1999 to reduce illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, which in the 1998-99 season landed five to six times more Patagonian toothfish than the regulated fishery. In the 1998-99 Antarctic summer 10,013 tourists, most of them seaborne, visited the Southern Ocean and Antarctica, compared to 9,604 the previous year. Nearly 16,000 tourists were expected during the 1999-2000 season.<p><a id="Ports_and_harbors" name="Ports_and_harbors"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Ports and harbors</span></h2>
      <p>Few ports or harbors exist on the southern (Antarctic) coast of the Southern Ocean since ice conditions limit use of most of them to short periods in midsummer; even then some cannot be entered without icebreaker escort. Most Antarctic ports are operated by government research stations and, except in an emergency, are not open to commercial or private vessels; vessels in any port south of 60 degrees south are subject to inspection by Antarctic Treaty observers.<p>The major ones that are operational include: <!--del_lnk--> Esperanza Base,<!--del_lnk--> Villa Las Estrellas,<a href="../../wp/c/Chile.htm" title="Chile">Chile</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Mawson Station, <!--del_lnk--> McMurdo Station, <!--del_lnk--> Palmer Station, <!--del_lnk--> Scott Base, and offshore anchorages in Antarctica<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean&quot;</div>
