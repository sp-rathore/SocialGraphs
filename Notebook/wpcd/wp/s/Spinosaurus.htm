      <p>Although <i>Spinosaurus</i> is well-known to dinosaur enthusiasts due to its unusual features, it is mostly known from remains that have been destroyed, aside from a few more recently discovered teeth and skull elements. Jaw and skull material published in <!--del_lnk--> 2006 show that it had one of the longest skulls of any carnivorous dinosaur, estimated by dal Sasso <i>et al.</i> at about 175 <!--del_lnk--> cm (5.7 <!--del_lnk--> ft).<p>Originally found in the <!--del_lnk--> Bahariya Valley of <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1912, it was named by German paleontologist <!--del_lnk--> Ernst Stromer in <!--del_lnk--> 1915. Some of the fossils were damaged during transport back to the <!--del_lnk--> Deutsches Museum, <a href="../../wp/m/Munich.htm" title="Munich">Munich</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> and the remaining bones were completely lost due to Allied <!--del_lnk--> bombing in <!--del_lnk--> 1944.<p>Aside from its &#39;sail&#39;, notable characteristics of <i>Spinosaurus</i> include:<ul>
       <li>A long, narrow snout, similar to other Spinosaurids and, like them, filled with conical teeth.<li>One enlarged, hook-like claw on each of its front limbs, perhaps for catching fish.<li>Relatively short legs and long &#39;arms&#39;, leading some paleontologists to suggest it may have been quadrupedal, rather than strictly bipedal (though it was undoubtedly capable of at least facultative bipedality).</ul>
      <p>Much of this is speculation based on <i>Baryonyx</i> and other spinosaurids, as no limb material has ever been attributed to <i>Spinosaurus</i> itself.<p>Since its discovery, <i>Spinosaurus</i> has held the record for longest, and possibly largest, theropod dinosaur (though this fact did not reach the public consciousness until its depiction in the film <i><!--del_lnk--> Jurassic Park III</i> and the description of a new specimen in 2006). Both Huene (1926) and Glut (1982) listed it as the most massive theropod in their surveys, at upwards of 6 tons in weight and 15 meters (50 feet) in length. Paul (1988) also listed it as the longest theropod at 15 meters (50 feet), but gave a lower mass estimate. The most recent estimates, based on new specimens described by dal Sasso <i>et al.</i> (2006), list <i>Spinosaurus</i> at 16 - 18 metres (53.3 to 60 feet) long and 7.5 - 9 tons in weight. At least one survey, as-yet unpublished, suggest that <i>Spinosaurus</i> reached sizes of 12 - 19 tons in weight. These high-end weight estimates are based on the fact that the vertebrae of <i>Spinosaurus</i> are unusually massive compared to theropods of comparable size (implying an extremely large overall mass), and that the <!--del_lnk--> holotype specimens are apparently sub-adult. <!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Diet" name="Diet"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Diet</span></h2>
      <p>It is unclear whether <i>Spinosaurus</i> was primarily a cursorial predator or a fisher, as indicated by its elongated jaws, conical teeth and raised nostrils. The only direct evidence for spinosaur diet comes from related <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South American</a> species. <i><!--del_lnk--> Baryonyx</i> was found with both fish scales and bones from juvenile <i><a href="../../wp/i/Iguanodon.htm" title="Iguanodon">Iguanodon</a></i> in its stomach, while a tooth embedded in a South American <a href="../../wp/p/Pterosaur.htm" title="Pterosaur">pterosaur</a> bone suggests that spinosaurs occasionally preyed on these flying archosaurs. <i>Spinosaurus</i> was likely to have been a more generalized and opportunistic predator, possibly a Cretaceous equivalent of large <!--del_lnk--> grizzly bears, being biased toward fishing, though it undoubtedly scavenged and took many kinds of small-to-medium-sized prey (Paul, 1988).<p><a id="Sail" name="Sail"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sail</span></h2>
      <p><i>Spinosaurus</i> sails were unusual, although other dinosaurs of the same time and area, namely the <!--del_lnk--> ornithopod <i><!--del_lnk--> Ouranosaurus</i> and the <!--del_lnk--> sauropod <i><!--del_lnk--> Rebbachisaurus,</i> developed a similar structural adaptation of their dorsal vertebrae. The sail is possibly <!--del_lnk--> analogous (not <!--del_lnk--> homologous) to that of the <a href="../../wp/p/Permian.htm" title="Permian">Permian</a> <!--del_lnk--> mammal-like reptile, <i><a href="../../wp/d/Dimetrodon.htm" title="Dimetrodon">Dimetrodon</a></i>, which lived before the dinosaurs even appeared (these similarities are presumably due to <!--del_lnk--> parallel evolution).<p>The purpose of these sails is uncertain; scientists have proposed several hypotheses:<ul>
       <li><b>Heat regulator</b>. If the sail contained abundant blood vessels, the animal could have used the sail&#39;s large surface area to absorb heat. This would imply that the animal was only partly warm-blooded at best and lived in climates where nighttime temperatures were cool or low and the sky usually not cloudy. It is thought that <i>Spinosaurus</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Ouranosaurus</i> both lived in or at the margins of an earlier version of the <!--del_lnk--> Sahara Desert, which could explain this. It is also possible that the sail was used to radiate excess heat from the body, rather than to collect it. Large animals, due to the relatively small ratio of surface area of their body compared to the overall volume (Haldane&#39;s principle), face far greater problems of dissipating excess heat at higher temperatures than gaining it at lower. Sails of these dinosaurs added considerably to the skin area of the body, with minimum increase of volume. Furthermore, if the sail was turned away from the sun, or positioned at a 90 degree angle towards a cooling wind, the animal would quite effectivly cool itself in the warm climate of Cretaceous Africa.<li><b>Sexual display</b>. Elaborate body structures of many modern-day animals usually serve to attract members of opposite sex during mating. It is quite possible that the sails of these dinosaurus were used for courtship, in a way similar to a <!--del_lnk--> peacock&#39;s tail. If this was the case, the sails may have been brightly colored, but this is purely speculative.<li><b>Intimidating device</b>. The sail was possibly used to intimidate rivals or frighten enemies, making the animal appear to be bigger than it was. The dinosaur could display its sail as a final warning signal, before it would resort to open attack, like modern-day <!--del_lnk--> rattlesnakes use their tail.</ul>
      <p>Finally, since things in nature rarely develop for a singular reason, it is quite possible that the sail combined all these functions, acting normally as a heat regulator, becoming a courting aid during the mating season, being used to cool itself and, on occasions, turning into an intimidating device when an animal was feeling threathened. Conjecture may even allow that the sail may have changed colour, during any of these functions.<p><a id="Species_and_Specimens" name="Species_and_Specimens"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Species and Specimens</span></h2>
      <p>Two species of <i>Spinosaurus</i> have been named: <i>Spinosaurus aegyptiacus</i> (&quot;Egyptian spine lizard&quot;) and <i>Spinosaurus marocannus</i> (&quot;Moroccan spine lizard&quot;). <i>S. marocannus</i> was originally described by Russell as a new species based on the length of its neck vertebrae. However, several later authors considered the length of the neck vertebrae to be variable from individual to individual and therefore consider <i>S. marocannus</i> to be a synonym of <i>S. aegyptiacus</i> <!--del_lnk--> .<p>Five partial specimens of <i>Spinosaurus</i> have been found, the first having been destroyed during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> (luckily, detailed drawings and descriptions of the specimen remain). The probable size of these individual spinosaurs can be estimated using comparison to known material from other <!--del_lnk--> spinosaurid dinosaurs.<ul>

      <p>Rauhut (2003) suggested that Stromer&#39;s <i>Spinosaurus</i> holotype was a <!--del_lnk--> chimera, consisting of dorsal vertebrae from a <!--del_lnk--> carcharodontosaurid similar to <i><!--del_lnk--> Acrocanthosaurus</i> and a dentary from a large theropod similar to <i><!--del_lnk--> Baryonyx</i>. This analysis, however, was rejected by dal Sasso and most other researchers.<p><a id="Spinosaurus_in_Jurassic_Park_III" name="Spinosaurus_in_Jurassic_Park_III"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Spinosaurus</i> in <i>Jurassic Park III</i></span></h2>
      <p><i>Spinosaurus</i> achieved widespread fame as the main antagonist in <i><!--del_lnk--> Jurassic Park III</i>. It is portrayed as larger, more powerful and more vicious than <i><a href="../../wp/t/Tyrannosaurus.htm" title="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a></i>, epitomized by a scene in which the two resurrected predators battle and <i>Spinosaurus</i> emerges victorious by snapping the rex&#39;s neck, establishing itself in the movie as the new main predator.<p>No such battle could ever have taken place in real life, since <i>Spinosaurus</i> and <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> lived thousands of miles and millions of years apart.<p><i>Spinosaurus</i> did, however, share its habitat with two other theropods that equalled or exceeded <i>T. rex</i> in size: the massive <!--del_lnk--> carnosaur <i><!--del_lnk--> Carcharodontosaurus</i> and the large but relatively lightweight <!--del_lnk--> abelisaur <i><!--del_lnk--> Deltadromeus</i>. Although the three gigantic predators probably occupied different ecological niches, they may have occasionally come into conflict over prey or territory.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinosaurus&quot;</div>
