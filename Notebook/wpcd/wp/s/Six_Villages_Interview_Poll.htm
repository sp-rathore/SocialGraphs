<h2>Interview with World Cup Referee Graham Poll</h2><p><strong>23/05/2006</strong></p>
<p><strong>Graham, what made you decide to support SOS Children&rsquo;s Villages?</strong><br />Although the charity is not so well known here in the UK, it is very well respected around the world and has the long-term backing of FIFA. When FIFA told us World Cup referees about the charity, I was more than happy to give my support. </p><p>I will gain a lot of pleasure from being involved in this summer&rsquo;s World Cup - it will be the fulfilment of a dream, so to be able to use what I gain from this experience to give something back is one way in which I can help make a difference.</p><img src="../../wp/g/Graham_Poll_SOS.jpg" width="300" height="243" alt="Graham Poll supporting "6 villages for 2006"" class="right" /><p><strong>I can imagine you&rsquo;re quite excited about the tournament. Which matches are you down to referee?</strong><br />At the moment, each referee only knows that he&rsquo;ll be in charge of one match - none of us know which match that will be nor if we&rsquo;ll be in charge of any others. If I perform well in my first match, then hopefully I&rsquo;ll be in with a chance of refereeing one or two more.</p><p><strong>If you had the choice, would you rather referee the World Cup final or watch England compete in it?</strong><br />I couldn&rsquo;t possibly answer that! I just hope that everyone plays to the best of their ability and the tournament is a success. </p><p><strong>Can you tell us about how did you get into refereeing?</strong><br />I started when I was 16, on the local parks and since then I&rsquo;ve just progressed through the ranks. I began refereeing international matches 11 years ago and was lucky enough to be involved in the 2002 World Cup in Korea-Japan. </p><p><strong>Is there any one person you most respect among your footballing peers?</strong><br />Well, the person I most look up to has to be Pierluigi Collina, who is also an ambassador for SOS Children&rsquo;s Villages. He has such presence on the pitch and his behaviour is always impeccable. He is a truly great referee and I&rsquo;m very lucky to be able to call him a good friend.</p><p><strong>So Graham, with your vast footballing knowledge, can you give us any tips for the tournament?</strong><br />My tip is to watch all the games - there&rsquo;ll be some good football!</p><p><a href="../../wp/s/Six_Villages_News.htm">Back to SOS World Cup news</a></p><p><strong>Relevant Countries:</strong> <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil_A.htm">Brazil</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico_A.htm">Mexico</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/Nigeria_A.htm">Nigeria</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa_A.htm">South Africa</a>, <a href="../../wp/u/Ukraine_A.htm">Ukraine</a>, <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_A.htm">Vietnam</a>.</p>
