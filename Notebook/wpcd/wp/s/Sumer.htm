      <p><b>Sumer</b> (or <i>&Scaron;umer</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Sumerian <i>ki-en-gir</i>, Egyptian <i>Sangar</i>, possibly Biblical <i><!--del_lnk--> Shinar</i>) was one of the early civilizations of the <!--del_lnk--> Ancient Near East, located in the southern part of <a href="../../wp/m/Mesopotamia.htm" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> (modern day southeastern <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq.htm" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>) from the time of the earliest records in the mid <!--del_lnk--> 4th millennium BC until the rise of <a href="../../wp/b/Babylonia.htm" title="Babylonia">Babylonia</a> in the late <!--del_lnk--> 3rd millennium BC. The term &quot;Sumerian&quot; applies to all speakers of the <!--del_lnk--> Sumerian language.

      <p>The term &quot;Sumerian&quot; is an <!--del_lnk--> exonym first applied by the <!--del_lnk--> Akkadians. The Sumerians called themselves SAG.GI.GA &quot;black-headed people&quot; and their land KI.EN.GIR &quot;land of the civilized lords&quot;. The <!--del_lnk--> Akkadian word <i>&Scaron;umer</i> possibly represents this name in dialect.<p>The Sumerians were a non-<!--del_lnk--> Semitic people and were at one time believed to have been invaders, as a number of linguists believed they could detect a substrate language beneath Sumerian. However, the archaeological record shows clear uninterrupted cultural continuity from the time of the Early <!--del_lnk--> Ubaid period (5200-4500 BC <!--del_lnk--> C-14, 6090-5429 <!--del_lnk--> calBC) settlements in southern <a href="../../wp/m/Mesopotamia.htm" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>. The Sumerian people who settled here farmed the lands in this region that were made fertile by silt deposited by the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers.<p><a id="City_states" name="City_states"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">City states</span></h2>
      <p>By the late 4th millennium BC, Sumer was divided into about a dozen independent city-states, whose limits were defined by canals and boundary stones. Each was centered on a temple dedicated to the particular patron god or goddess of the city and ruled over by a priest (<!--del_lnk--> ensi) or king (<!--del_lnk--> lugal), who was intimately tied to the city&#39;s religious rites.<p>The principal Sumerian sites (from North to South) were the cities of:<ul>

      <p>The Sumerian city states rise to power during the prehistorical <!--del_lnk--> Ubaid and <!--del_lnk--> Uruk periods.

      <p>A distinctive style of fine quality painted pottery spread throughout Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf region in the <!--del_lnk--> Ubaid period, when the ancient Sumerian religious centre of <!--del_lnk--> Eridu was gradually surpassed in size by the nearby city of <!--del_lnk--> Uruk. The archaeological transition from the Ubaid period to the Uruk period is marked by a gradual shift from painted pottery domestically produced on a slow <!--del_lnk--> wheel, to a great variety of unpainted pottery mass-produced by specialists on fast <!--del_lnk--> wheels. The date of this transition, from <!--del_lnk--> Ubaid 4 to Early Uruk, is in dispute, but <!--del_lnk--> calibrated radiocarbon dates from Tell Awayli would place it as early as <!--del_lnk--> 4500 BC.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Ubaid pottery of southern Mesopotamia has been connected via <i>Choga Mami Transitional</i> ware to the pottery of the <!--del_lnk--> Samarra period culture (c. 5700-4900 BC <!--del_lnk--> C-14, 6640-5816 BC <!--del_lnk--> calBC) in the north, who were the first to practice a primitive form of irrigation agriculture along the middle Tigris River and its tributaries. The connection is most clearly seen at Tell Awayli (<i>Oueilli</i>, <i>Oueili</i>) near <!--del_lnk--> Larsa, excavated by the French in the 1980s, where 8 levels yielded pre-Ubaid pottery resembling Samarran ware. Sumerian speakers spread down into southern Mesopotamia perhaps because they had developed a social organization and a technology that enabled them, through their control of the water, to survive and prosper in a difficult environment then occupied by the fisher-hunter-gatherer population using a pre-pottery Arabian <!--del_lnk--> bifacial toolkit in the marshlands near the <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Gulf.htm" title="Persian Gulf">Persian Gulf</a> and proto-Akkadian nomadic pastoralists.<p><a id="Uruk_period" name="Uruk_period"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Uruk period</span></h3>

      <p>By the time of the <!--del_lnk--> Uruk period (4500-<!--del_lnk--> 3100 BC calibrated), the volume of trade goods transported along the canals and rivers of southern Mesopotamia facilitated the rise of many large temple-centered cities where centralized administrations employed specialized workers. It is fairly certain that it was during the Uruk period that Sumerian cities began to make use of slave labor (Subartu) captured from the hill country, and there is ample evidence for captured slaves as workers in the earliest texts. Artifacts, and even colonies of this Uruk civilization have been found over a wide area - from the <!--del_lnk--> Taurus Mountains in <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, to the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> in the west, and as far east as Central <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a>.<p>The Uruk period civilization, exported by Sumerian traders and colonists (like that found at <!--del_lnk--> Tell Brak), had an effect on all surrounding peoples, who gradually evolved their own comparable, competing economies and cultures. The cities of Sumer could not maintain remote, long-distance colonies by military force.<p>The end of the Uruk period coincided with the <!--del_lnk--> Priora oscillation, a dry period from c. <!--del_lnk--> 3200-<!--del_lnk--> 2900 BC that marked the end of a long wetter, warmer climate period from about 9,000 to 5,000 years ago, called the <!--del_lnk--> Holocene climatic optimum. When the historical record opens, the Sumerians appear to be limited to southern Mesopotamia &mdash; although very early rulers such as <!--del_lnk--> Lugal-Anne-Mundu are indeed recorded as expanding to neighboring areas as far as the Mediterranean, <!--del_lnk--> Taurus and <!--del_lnk--> Zagros, and not long after legendary figures like <!--del_lnk--> Enmerkar and <!--del_lnk--> Gilgamesh, who are associated in mythology with the historical transfer of culture from Eridu to Uruk, were supposed to have reigned.<p><a id="Early_Dynastic" name="Early_Dynastic"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early Dynastic</span></h3>
      <p>The ancient <!--del_lnk--> Sumerian king list recounts the early dynasties. Like many other archaic lists of rulers, it may include legendary names. The first king on the list whose name is known from any other source is <!--del_lnk--> Etana, 13th king of the first Dynasty of Kish. The first king authenticated through archaeological evidence is that of <!--del_lnk--> Enmebaragesi of Kish, the 22nd and penultimate king of that Dynasty, whose name is also mentioned in the <!--del_lnk--> Gilgamesh epic, and who may have been king at the time hegemony passed from Kish to Uruk once again. This has led to the suggestion that Gilgamesh himself really was a historical king of Uruk.<p><!--del_lnk--> Lugal-Zage-Si, the priest-king of Umma, overthrew the primacy of the Lagash dynasty, took Uruk, making it his capital, and claimed an empire extending from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean. He is the last ethnically Sumerian king before the arrival of the Semitic named king, <!--del_lnk--> Sargon of Akkad.<p><a id="Lagash_dynasty" name="Lagash_dynasty"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Lagash dynasty</span></h3>
      <dl>

      <p>The dynasty of Lagash is well known through important monuments, and one of the first empires in recorded history was that of <b>Eannatum</b> of Lagash, who annexed practically all of Sumer, including Kish, Uruk, Ur, and <!--del_lnk--> Larsa, and reduced to tribute the city-state of <!--del_lnk--> Umma, arch-rival of Lagash. In addition, his realm extended to parts of <!--del_lnk--> Elam and along the Persian Gulf. He seems to have used terror as a matter of policy - his stele of the vultures has been found, showing violent treatment of enemies.<p><a id="Akkadian_dynasty" name="Akkadian_dynasty"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Akkadian dynasty</span></h3>
      <p>The Semitic <!--del_lnk--> Akkadian language is first attested in proper names around 2800 BC. From about 2500 BC one finds texts written entirely in Old Akkadian. The Old Akkadian language period was at its height during the rule of Sargon the Great (2350 - 2330), but most administrative tablets even during that period are still written in Sumerian, as that was the language used by the scribes. Gelb and Westenholz differentiate between three dialects of Old Akkadian - from the pre-Sargonic period, the period of rule by king Sargon and the city of Agade, and the Ur III period. Speakers of Akkadian and Sumerian coexisted for about one thousand years, from 2800 to 1800, at the end of which Sumerian ceased to be spoken. <!--del_lnk--> Thorkild Jacobsen has argued that there is little break in historical continuity between the pre- and post-Sargon periods, and that too much emphasis has been placed on the perception of a &quot;Semitic vs. Sumerian&quot; conflict. However, it is certain that Akkadian was also briefly imposed on neighboring parts of <!--del_lnk--> Elam that were conquered by Sargon.<p><a id="Gutian_period" name="Gutian_period"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Gutian period</span></h3>
      <p>Following the downfall of the <a href="../../wp/a/Akkadian_Empire.htm" title="Akkadian Empire">Akkadian Empire</a> at the hands of <!--del_lnk--> Gutians, another native Sumerian ruler, <!--del_lnk--> Gudea of Lagash, rose to local prominence, promoting artistic development and continuing the practices of the Sargonid kings&#39; claims to divinity.<p><a id="Sumerian_renaissance" name="Sumerian_renaissance"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Sumerian renaissance</span></h3>

      <p>Later, the <!--del_lnk--> 3rd dynasty of Ur under <!--del_lnk--> Ur-Nammu and <!--del_lnk--> Shulgi, whose power extended as far as northern Mesopotamia, was the last great &quot;Sumerian renaissance&quot;, but already the region was becoming more Semitic than Sumerian, with the influx of waves of Martu (<!--del_lnk--> Amorites) who were later to found the <a href="../../wp/b/Babylonia.htm" title="Babylonia">Babylonian</a> Empire. Sumerian, however, remained a sacerdotal language taught in schools, in the same way that Latin was used in the Medieval period, for as long as cuneiform was utilised.<p>Ecologically, the agricultural productivity of the Sumerian lands was being compromised as a result of rising salinity. The evaporation of irrigated waters left dissolved salts in the soil, making them difficult for agriculture. There was a major depopulation of southern Mesopotamia, affecting many of the smaller sites, from about 2000 BC, leading to the collapse of Sumerian culture.<p><a id="Downfall" name="Downfall"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Downfall</span></h3>
      <p>Following an <!--del_lnk--> Elamite invasion and sack of Ur during the rule of <!--del_lnk--> Ibbi-Sin (ca. <!--del_lnk--> 2004 BC), Sumer came under <!--del_lnk--> Amorite rule (taken to introduce the <!--del_lnk--> Middle Bronze Age). The independent Amorite states of the 20th to 18th centuries are summarized as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Dynasty of Isin&quot; in the Sumerian king list, ending with the rise of <a href="../../wp/b/Babylonia.htm" title="Babylonia">Babylonia</a> under <a href="../../wp/h/Hammurabi.htm" title="Hammurabi">Hammurabi</a> in the ca. <!--del_lnk--> 1730 BC.<p><a id="Agriculture_and_hunting" name="Agriculture_and_hunting"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Agriculture and hunting</span></h2>
      <p>The Sumerians adopted the agricultural mode of life which had been introduced into Lower Mesopotamia and practised the same irrigation techniques as those used in Egypt. <!--del_lnk--> Adams says that irrigation development was associated with urbanization , and that 89% of the population lived in the cities <!--del_lnk--> .<p>They grew <a href="../../wp/b/Barley.htm" title="Barley">barley</a>, <!--del_lnk--> chickpeas, <!--del_lnk--> lentils, <a href="../../wp/w/Wheat.htm" title="Wheat">wheat</a>, <!--del_lnk--> dates, <a href="../../wp/o/Onion.htm" title="Onion">onions</a>, <!--del_lnk--> garlic, <a href="../../wp/l/Lettuce.htm" title="Lettuce">lettuce</a>, <!--del_lnk--> leeks and <a href="../../wp/m/Mustard_plant.htm" title="Mustard plant">mustard</a>. They also raised cattle, <!--del_lnk--> sheep, <a href="../../wp/d/Domestic_goat.htm" title="Goat">goats</a>, and <a href="../../wp/p/Pig.htm" title="Pig">pigs</a>. They used <!--del_lnk--> oxen as their primary beasts of burden and <!--del_lnk--> donkeys or <!--del_lnk--> equidss as their primary transport animal. Sumerians caught many fish and hunted <!--del_lnk--> fowl and <a href="../../wp/g/Gazelle.htm" title="Gazelle">gazelle</a>.<p>Sumerian agriculture depended heavily on irrigation. The irrigation was accomplished by the use of <!--del_lnk--> shadufs, <a href="../../wp/c/Canal.htm" title="Canal">canals</a>, <!--del_lnk--> channels, <!--del_lnk--> dykes, <!--del_lnk--> weirs, and <!--del_lnk--> reservoirs. The frequent violent floods of the <a href="../../wp/t/Tigris.htm" title="Tigris">Tigris</a>, and less so, of the <a href="../../wp/e/Euphrates.htm" title="Euphrates">Euphrates</a>, meant that canals required frequent repair and continual removal of <!--del_lnk--> silt, and survey markers and boundary stones continually replaced. The government required individuals to work on the canals in a <!--del_lnk--> corvee, although the rich were able to exempt themselves.<p>After the flood season and after the Spring Equinox and the <!--del_lnk--> Akitu or New Year Festival, using the canals, farmers would flood their fields and then drain the water. Next they let oxen stomp the ground and kill weeds. They then dragged the fields with <!--del_lnk--> pickaxes. After drying, they <!--del_lnk--> plowed, <!--del_lnk--> harrowed, <!--del_lnk--> raked the ground three times, and pulverized it with a <!--del_lnk--> mattock, before planting seed. Unfortunately the high evaporation rate resulted in gradual salinity of the fields. By the Ur III period, farmers had converted from wheat to the more salt-tolerant barley as their principle crop.<p>Sumerians harvested during the dry <a href="../../wp/a/Autumn.htm" title="Autumn">fall season</a> in three-person teams consisting of a <!--del_lnk--> reaper, a <!--del_lnk--> binder, and a <!--del_lnk--> sheaf arranger. The farmers would use <!--del_lnk--> threshing wagons to separate the <a href="../../wp/c/Cereal.htm" title="Cereal">cereal</a> heads from the <!--del_lnk--> stalks and then use <!--del_lnk--> threshing sleds to disengage the grain. They then <!--del_lnk--> winnowed the grain/chaff mixture.<p><a id="Architecture" name="Architecture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Architecture</span></h2>

      <p>The Tigris-Euphrates plain lacked minerals and trees. Sumerian structures were made of plano-convex <!--del_lnk--> mudbrick, not fixed with <!--del_lnk--> mortar or with <!--del_lnk--> cement. Mud-brick buildings eventually deteriorate, and so they were periodically destroyed, leveled, and rebuilt on the same spot. This constant rebuilding gradually raised the level of cities, so that they came to be elevated above the surrounding plain. The resultant hills are known as <!--del_lnk--> tells, and are found throughout the ancient Near East.<p>The most impressive and famous of Sumerian buildings are the <!--del_lnk--> ziggurats, large terraced platforms which supported temples. Some scholars have theorized that these structures might have been the basis of the <!--del_lnk--> Tower of Babel described in <!--del_lnk--> Genesis. Sumerian cylinder <!--del_lnk--> seals also depict houses built from reeds not unlike those built by the <!--del_lnk--> Marsh Arabs of Southern Iraq until as recently as A.D. <!--del_lnk--> 400.<p>Sumerian temples and palaces made use of more advanced materials and techniques, such as <!--del_lnk--> buttresses, <!--del_lnk--> recesses, <!--del_lnk--> half columns, and <!--del_lnk--> clay nails.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>
      <p>Sumerian culture may be traced to two main centers, <!--del_lnk--> Eridu in the south and <!--del_lnk--> Nippur in the north. Eridu and Nippur may be regarded as contrasting poles of Sumerian religion.<p>The deity <!--del_lnk--> Enlil, around whose sanctuary Nippur had grown up, was considered lord of the ghost-land, and his gifts to mankind were said to be the spells and incantations that the spirits of good or evil were compelled to obey. The world he governed was a mountain (E-kur from E=house and Kur=Mountain); the creatures that he had made lived underground.<p>Eridu, on the other hand, was the home of the culture god <!--del_lnk--> Enki (absorbed into <!--del_lnk--> Babylonian mythology as the god <!--del_lnk--> Ea), the god of beneficence, ruler of the freshwater depths beneath the earth (the <!--del_lnk--> Abzu from Ab=water and Zu=far), a healer and friend to humanity who was thought to have given us the arts and sciences, the industries and manners of civilization; the first law-book was considered his creation. Eridu had once been a seaport, and it was doubtless its foreign trade and intercourse with other lands that influenced the development of its culture. Its cosmology was the result of its geographical position: the earth, it was believed, had grown out of the waters of the deep, like the ever widening coast at the mouth of the <a href="../../wp/e/Euphrates.htm" title="Euphrates">Euphrates</a>. Long before history is recorded, however, the cultures of Eridu and Nippur had coalesced. While Babylon seems to have been a colony of Eridu, Eridu&#39;s immediate neighbour, <!--del_lnk--> Ur, may have been a colony of Nippur, since its moon god was said to be the son of Enlil of Nippur. However, in the admixture of the two cultures, the influence of Eridu was predominant.<p>Historian <!--del_lnk--> Alan Marcus has been quoted as saying that &quot;Sumerians held a rather dour perspective on life.&quot; One Sumerian wrote: &quot;Tears, lament, anguish, and depression are within me. Suffering overwhelms me. Evil fate holds me and carries off my life. Malignant sickness bathes me.&quot; Another wrote, &quot;Why am I counted among the ignorant? Food is all about, yet my food is hunger. On the day shares were allotted, my allotted share was suffering.&quot;<p>Though women were protected by late Sumerian law and were able to achieve a higher status in Sumer than in other contemporary civilizations, the culture was male-dominated.<p>There is much evidence that the Sumerians loved music. It seemed to be an important part of <!--del_lnk--> religious and civic life in Sumer. <!--del_lnk--> Lyres were popular in Sumer, see <!--del_lnk--> Sumerian music.<p><a id="Economy_and_trade" name="Economy_and_trade"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy and trade</span></h2>

      <p>The almost constant wars among the Sumerian city-states for 2000 years helped to develop the military technology and techniques of Sumer to a high level. The first war recorded was between Lagash and Umma in 2525 BC on a stele called the <i>Stele of Vultures</i>. It shows the king of Lagash leading a Sumerian army consisting mostly of <!--del_lnk--> infantry. The infantrymen carried <!--del_lnk--> spears, equipped with <a href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper">copper</a> <!--del_lnk--> helmets and <!--del_lnk--> leather <!--del_lnk--> shields <!--del_lnk--> . The spearmen are shown arranged in a <!--del_lnk--> phalanx formation, which required training and discipline, and so implies they were <!--del_lnk--> professional soldiers.<p>The Sumerian military used carts harnessed to <!--del_lnk--> onagers. These early <!--del_lnk--> chariots functioned less effectively in combat than did later designs, and some have suggested that these chariots served primarily as transports, though the crew carried battle-axes and <!--del_lnk--> lances. The Sumerian chariot comprised a four or two-<!--del_lnk--> wheeled device manned by a crew of two and harnessed to four onagers. The cart was composed of a <!--del_lnk--> woven basket and the wheels had a solid three-piece design.<p>Sumerian cities were surrounded by defensive <!--del_lnk--> walls. The Sumerians engaged in <a href="../../wp/s/Siege.htm" title="Siege">siege warfare</a> between their cities, but the <!--del_lnk--> mudbrick walls failed to deter some foes.<p><a id="Religion" name="Religion"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h2>

      <p>Like other cities of Asia Minor and the Mediterranean, Sumer was a <!--del_lnk--> polytheistic, or <!--del_lnk--> henotheistic, society. There was no organized set of gods, with each city-state having its own patrons, temples, and priest-kings; but the Sumerians were probably the first to write down their beliefs. Sumerian beliefs were also the inspiration for much of later <!--del_lnk--> Mesopotamian mythology, <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religion</a>, and <a href="../../wp/a/Astrology.htm" title="Astrology">astrology</a>.<p>The Sumerians worshipped <!--del_lnk--> An as the primary god, equivalent to &quot;heaven&quot;-- indeed, the word &quot;an&quot; in Sumerian means &quot;sky&quot;, and his consort <!--del_lnk--> Ki, meaning &quot;earth&quot;. Collectively the Gods were known as <!--del_lnk--> Anunaki (&quot;heaven and earth&quot;). An&#39;s closest cohorts were <!--del_lnk--> Enki in the south at the Abzu temple in Eridu, <!--del_lnk--> Enlil in the north at the Ekur temple of Nippur and <!--del_lnk--> Inana, the deification of Venus, the morning (eastern) and evening (western) star, at the Eanna temple (shared with An) at Uruk. The sun was <!--del_lnk--> Utu, was worshipped at Sippar, the moon was <!--del_lnk--> Nanna, worshipped at Ur and <!--del_lnk--> Nammu or Namma was one of the names of the <!--del_lnk--> Mother Goddess, probably considered to be the original matrix; there were hundreds of minor <a href="../../wp/d/Deity.htm" title="Deity">deities</a>. The Sumerian <a href="../../wp/g/God.htm" title="God">gods</a> (Sumerian <i>dingir</i>, plural <i>dingir-dingir</i> or <i>dingir-a-ne-ne</i>) thus had associations with different cities, and their religious importance often waxed and waned with the political power of the associated cities. The gods were said to have created human beings from clay for the purpose of serving them. The gods often expressed their anger and frustration through earthquakes and storms: the gist of Sumerian religion was that humanity was at the mercy of the gods.<p>Sumerians believed that the <a href="../../wp/u/Universe.htm" title="Universe">universe</a> consisted of a flat disk enclosed by a tin <!--del_lnk--> dome. The Sumerian <!--del_lnk--> afterlife involved a descent into a gloomy <!--del_lnk--> netherworld to spend eternity in a wretched <!--del_lnk--> existence as a <!--del_lnk--> Gidim (ghost).<p>Sumerian <!--del_lnk--> temples consisted of a forecourt, with a central pond for purification (the Abzu). The temple itself had a central <!--del_lnk--> nave with aisles along either side. Flanking the aisles would be rooms for the priests. At one end would stand the <!--del_lnk--> podium and a <!--del_lnk--> mudbrick table for <a href="../../wp/a/Animal.htm" title="Animal">animal</a> and <a href="../../wp/v/Vegetable.htm" title="Vegetable">vegetable</a> <!--del_lnk--> sacrifices. <!--del_lnk--> Granaries and <!--del_lnk--> storehouses were usually located near the temples. After a time the Sumerians began to place the temples on top of multi-layered square constructions built as a series of rising terraces: the <i><!--del_lnk--> ziggurats</i>.<p><a id="Technology" name="Technology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Technology</span></h2>

      <p>The most important archaeological discoveries in Sumer are a large number of tablets written in Sumerian. Sumerian pre-<!--del_lnk--> cuneiform script has been discovered on tablets dating to around <!--del_lnk--> 3500 BC.<p>The Sumerian language is generally regarded as a <!--del_lnk--> language isolate in <a href="../../wp/l/Linguistics.htm" title="Linguistics">linguistics</a> because it belongs to no known language family; <!--del_lnk--> Akkadian belongs to the <!--del_lnk--> Afro-Asiatic languages. There have been many failed attempts to connect Sumerian to other <!--del_lnk--> language groups. It is an <!--del_lnk--> agglutinative language; in other words, <!--del_lnk--> morphemes (&quot;units of meaning&quot;) are added together to create words.<p>Sumerians invented picture-<!--del_lnk--> hieroglyphs that developed into later <!--del_lnk--> cuneiform, and their language vies with <!--del_lnk--> Ancient Egyptian for credit as the oldest known <!--del_lnk--> written human language. An extremely large body of hundreds of thousands of texts in the Sumerian language has survived, the great majority of these on clay tablets. Known Sumerian texts include personal and business letters and transactions, receipts, lexical lists, laws, hymns and prayers, magical incantations, and scientific texts including mathematics, astronomy, and medicine. Monumental inscriptions and texts on different objects like statues or bricks are also very common. Many texts survive in multiple copies because they were repeatedly transcribed by scribes-in-training. Sumerian continued to be the language of religion and law in Mesopotamia long after Semitic speakers had become the ruling race.<p>Understanding Sumerian texts today can be problematic even for experts. Most difficult are the earliest texts, which in many cases don&#39;t give the full grammatical structure of the language.<p><a id="Legacy" name="Legacy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Legacy</span></h2>
      <p>Most authorities credit the Sumerians with the invention of the <!--del_lnk--> wheel, initially in the form of the <!--del_lnk--> potter&#39;s wheel. The new concept quickly led to wheeled <!--del_lnk--> vehicles and <!--del_lnk--> mill wheels. The Sumerians&#39; <!--del_lnk--> cuneiform writing system is the oldest we have evidence of (with the possible exception of the highly controversial <!--del_lnk--> Old European Script), pre-dating Egyptian <!--del_lnk--> hieroglyphics by at least seventy-five years. The Sumerians were among the first formal astronomers, correctly formulating a <a href="../../wp/h/Heliocentrism.htm" title="Heliocentrism">heliocentric</a> view of the solar system, to which they assigned 5 planets (all that can be seen with the naked eye).<p>They invented and developed arithmetic using several different number systems including a <!--del_lnk--> Mixed radix system with an alternating base 10 and base 6. This <!--del_lnk--> sexagesimal system became the standard number system in Sumer and Babylonia. Using this sexagesimal system they invented the clock with its 60 seconds, 60 minutes, and 12 hours, and the 12 month calendar which is still in use. They may have invented military formations and introduced the basic divisions between <!--del_lnk--> infantry, <!--del_lnk--> cavalry and <!--del_lnk--> archers. They developed the first known codified legal and administrative systems, complete with courts, jails, and government records. The first true <!--del_lnk--> city states arose in Sumer, roughly contemporaneously with similar entities in what is now <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israel</a>. Several centuries after their invention of cuneiform, the practice of writing expanded beyond debt/payment certificates and inventory lists and was applied for the first time about 2600 BC to written messages and mail delivery, history, legend, mathematics, astronomical records and other pursuits generally corresponding to the fields occupying teachers and students ever since. Accordingly, the first formal schools were established, usually under the auspices of a city-state&#39;s primary temple.<p>Finally, the Sumerians ushered in the age of intensive <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a> and irrigation. <!--del_lnk--> Emmer wheat, <a href="../../wp/b/Barley.htm" title="Barley">barley</a>, sheep (starting as <!--del_lnk--> mouflon) and cattle (starting as <!--del_lnk--> aurochs) were foremost among the species cultivated and raised for the first time on a grand scale. These inventions and innovations easily place the Sumerians among the most creative cultures in human pre-history and history.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer&quot;</div>
