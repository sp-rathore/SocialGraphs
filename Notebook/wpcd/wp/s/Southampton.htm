      <p><b>Southampton</b> is a <a href="../../wp/c/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="City status in the United Kingdom">city</a> and major <!--del_lnk--> port situated on the south coast of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>.

Southampton lies at the northern-most point of <!--del_lnk--> Southampton Water where it is joined by the <!--del_lnk--> River Test and <!--del_lnk--> River Itchen, with the <!--del_lnk--> River Hamble joining to the south of the urban area. The city represents the core of the <!--del_lnk--> Greater Southampton region. A resident of Southampton is called a <!--del_lnk--> Sotonian.<p>

      <p>Although <a href="../../wp/s/Stone_Age.htm" title="Stone Age">Stone Age</a> settlements are known to have existed in the area, the first permanent settlement was established by the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a>. Known as Clausentum, it was an important trading port for the large Roman towns of <!--del_lnk--> Winchester and <!--del_lnk--> Salisbury.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxons moved the centre of the town across the <!--del_lnk--> River Itchen to its present location, and it remained an important port. At the time, it was centered around what is now the St Mary&#39;s area, and the settlement was known as <i>Hamwic</i>. This name was later to evolve into <i>Hamtun</i>, and later still to <i>Hampton</i>.<p>The Viking King <a href="../../wp/c/Canute_the_Great.htm" title="Canute the Great">Canute the Great</a> is supposed to have defeated the Anglo-Saxon King <!--del_lnk--> Ethelred the Unready here in <!--del_lnk--> 1014 and been crowned here, and his fabled attempt to &quot;command&quot; the tide to halt may have taken place in Southampton. However, its prosperity was assured following the <!--del_lnk--> Norman Conquest in <!--del_lnk--> 1066, when it became the major port of transit between Winchester (then the capital of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>) and <!--del_lnk--> Normandy.<p>By the <!--del_lnk--> 13th Century, Southampton had become a leading port, and was particularly involved in the <!--del_lnk--> wool trade. The <i>Wool House</i> was built in <!--del_lnk--> 1417 as a warehouse for the medieval wool trade with <a href="../../wp/f/Flanders.htm" title="Flanders">Flanders</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>. This building is today used as the Maritime Museum, and can be found near Town Quay. It includes an exhibition concerning the RMS <i>Titanic</i>.<p><!--del_lnk--> Bowls was first played regularly on the Southampton Old Bowling Green adjacent to God&#39;s House Hospital in 1299. It is the world&#39;s oldest surviving <!--del_lnk--> bowling green.<p>The town was sacked in <!--del_lnk--> 1338 by the French, including the pirate <!--del_lnk--> Grimaldi, who used the plunder to help found the <a href="../../wp/p/Principality.htm" title="Principality">principality</a> of <a href="../../wp/m/Monaco.htm" title="Monaco">Monaco</a>. After this attack, the city walls were built, some of which remain as ruins today. The city walls include <i>God&#39;s House Tower</i>, built in <!--del_lnk--> 1417, the first purpose-built artillery fortification in England. Today, it is open as the Museum of Archaeology.<p>The 12th century Red Lion pub on the High Street below the Bargate within the old walls is where in 1415, immediately prior to King <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_V_of_England.htm" title="Henry V of England">Henry V of England</a>&#39;s departure from Southampton to the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Agincourt, the ringleaders of the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Southampton Plot&quot;, <!--del_lnk--> Richard, Earl of Cambridge, <!--del_lnk--> Henry Scrope, 3rd Baron Scrope of Masham and Sir <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Grey of Heton, were tried and found guilty of high treason, before being summarily executed outside the Bargate.<p>During the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, <!--del_lnk--> shipbuilding became an increasingly important industry, which was to remain for centuries to come. The city became a <!--del_lnk--> county corporate in <!--del_lnk--> 1447.<p><!--del_lnk--> King Edward VI Grammar School was founded in the city near God&#39;s House Tower as a school for poor clergyman in <!--del_lnk--> 1553 by <!--del_lnk--> William Capon. <!--del_lnk--> Isaac Watts, one of its locally born alumni, wrote the words of the hymn <i>O God Our Help In Ages Past</i>, the melody of which forms the four-hourly peal of the Civic Centre clock chimes. King Edward&#39;s survives as a selective independent co-educational secondary school. The Watts memorial in the city&#39;s West Park - also known as the Watts Park - was unveiled in <!--del_lnk--> 1861.<p>The port was the original point of departure for the <!--del_lnk--> Pilgrim Fathers aboard the <i><!--del_lnk--> Mayflower</i> in <!--del_lnk--> 1623. A memorial can be found on Town Quay. Since that time it has been the last port of call for literally millions of emigrants who left the Old World to start a new life in the <!--del_lnk--> USA, <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> and other parts of the world.<p>The painter <!--del_lnk--> John Everett Millais was born in the city. Southampton Solent University&#39;s art gallery is named Millais Gallery <!--del_lnk-->  in his honour.<p>In common with most of the luxury liners of the time, the <a href="../../wp/r/RMS_Titanic.htm" title="RMS Titanic">RMS <i>Titanic</i></a> sailed from here, and it is still an important ocean liner port frequented by luxury ships such as the <!--del_lnk--> RMS <i>QE2</i>, the <!--del_lnk--> MV <i>Oriana</i>, and most recently the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Queen Mary 2</i>. A memorial to the engineers of the <i>Titanic</i> may be found in Andrews Park, on Above Bar Street. There is a memorial to the musicians who played on the <i>Titanic</i> just opposite the main memorial. Also, the Maritime museum in Wool Hall includes an exhibition related to the vessel. Most of <i>Titanic&#39;</i>s crew lived in Southampton; 549 Sotonians died in the sinking.<p>The city is home to Sir <!--del_lnk--> Edwin Lutyens&#39; first permanent <!--del_lnk--> cenotaph, a memorial to the city&#39;s dead of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>. When it was unveiled on <!--del_lnk--> 6 November <!--del_lnk--> 1920, it was 1800 names, later raised to 2008. It can be found in West (Watts) Park, opposite the <i>Titanic</i> memorial.<p>The Second World War hit Southampton particularly hard, partly because of its strategic importance as the major industrial area on the South Coast and partly because of the city&#39;s links to the <a href="../../wp/s/Supermarine_Spitfire.htm" title="Supermarine Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a> fighter aircraft, which was invented and manufactured in Southampton. Pockets of Georgian architecture remain, but much of the city was levelled. The accuracy of the locally-based Ordnance Survey&#39;s maps did not go unrecognised by the <a href="../../wp/l/Luftwaffe.htm" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>: the German bomber pilots used them to bomb Southampton. One notable building to survive the bombings was Southampton&#39;s oldest, St. Michaels Church. Thought to have been commenced in 1070 <!--del_lnk--> , the building has been added to many times over the centuries but its central tower dates from Norman times. The spire was an important navigation aid for the German pilots and consequently they were ordered to avoid it <!--del_lnk--> .<p>The Spitfire was developed and initially manufactured in the suburb of Woolston. Its designer, <!--del_lnk--> Reginald Mitchell, grew up in <!--del_lnk--> Stoke-on-Trent, then had a house in Russell Place in the suburb of Highfield near the university (now identified by a memorial plaque). The plane was a direct descendant of experimental aircraft built by <!--del_lnk--> Supermarine that competed in the <!--del_lnk--> Schneider Trophy in the 1930s. Supermarine was taken over by <!--del_lnk--> Vickers in 1928. Mitchell&#39;s short life is documented in the film <i><!--del_lnk--> The First of the Few</i>. On Sept 24th 1940, the Woolston factory was bombed, killing 100 workers, though not damaging the factory. Two days later, the factory was heavily damaged by bombing, and thirty more workers died, which interrupted production of the Spitfire for many weeks at a critical time of the UK&#39;s survival.<p>There were many aircraft companies based around <!--del_lnk--> Hamble, to the east of the city, from the 1930s to 1950s, including <!--del_lnk--> Folland Aviation, started by <!--del_lnk--> Henry P Folland, the former chief designer of <!--del_lnk--> Gloster Aircraft. Folland was taken over by <!--del_lnk--> Hawker Siddeley in 1960, and later as <!--del_lnk--> British Aerospace, the factory built the <!--del_lnk--> Hawk and <!--del_lnk--> Harrier. The history of the area&#39;s contribution to aviation is celebrated at the Southampton Hall of Aviation, near Itchen Bridge, and opposite the erstwhile site of the Woolston Supermarine factory. <!--del_lnk--> BOAC had a <!--del_lnk--> flying boat base in the docks serving <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British</a> colonial possessions in <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a> in the <!--del_lnk--> 1930s and <!--del_lnk--> 1940s. It closed in <!--del_lnk--> 1950 when land based aircraft became dominant. Nearby, <!--del_lnk--> Calshot Spit was a base for the military <!--del_lnk--> flying boat services.<p>Southampton was one of the boroughs reformed by the <!--del_lnk--> Municipal Corporations Act 1835, and contained the parishes of All Saints, Holy Rood, St John, St Lawrence, St Mary, St Michael, and part of <!--del_lnk--> South Stoneham. The town became a <!--del_lnk--> county borough under the <!--del_lnk--> Local Government Act 1888. In 1894, under the <!--del_lnk--> Local Government Act 1894, the part of South Stoneham within the borough became the parish of <!--del_lnk--> Portswood, and in 1895 the parish of <!--del_lnk--> Shirley was added. In 1920, <!--del_lnk--> Bitterne, and part of the parishes of North Stoneham and South Stoneham were added. The area of the <!--del_lnk--> Itchen Urban District was added in 1925. In 1967 it took in part of the <!--del_lnk--> Nursling and Rownham parishes added. The boundaries have been largely unchanged since then, despite the loss of county borough status under the <!--del_lnk--> Local Government Act 1972, and subsequent regaining of unitary authority status with the <!--del_lnk--> Banham Review.<p>Southampton was awarded <a href="../../wp/c/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="City status in the United Kingdom">city status</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1964 by <!--del_lnk--> Letters Patent.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>

      <p>In common with many British towns and cities, Southampton was heavily bombed during the <!--del_lnk--> Second World War. Many historic buildings were lost as a result, but the old city walls remain, as does the Bargate, formerly the main gateway to the city at the northern end of the walls (Southampton has England&#39;s second-longest stretch of surviving Medieval wall, the longest being in <a href="../../wp/y/York.htm" title="York">York</a>). The Bargate is often used as a symbol of the city, and is a prominent part of the city council&#39;s corporate identity. There are numerous large parks in the city centre. Most of Southampton&#39;s municipal services, including the <a href="../../wp/l/Library.htm" title="Library">library</a> and the well-endowed <!--del_lnk--> art gallery are to be found in the <!--del_lnk--> Civic Centre.<p>The city is home to the <!--del_lnk--> University of Southampton, <!--del_lnk--> Southampton Solent University and <!--del_lnk--> West Quay shopping centre, which was the biggest city-centre shopping mall in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> when it was opened. It is also the headquarters of <!--del_lnk--> Ordnance Survey, the UK&#39;s national mapping agency, and the location of the <!--del_lnk--> National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, the focus of <!--del_lnk--> Natural Environment Research Council-funded <!--del_lnk--> marine research. The <!--del_lnk--> Lloyd&#39;s Register Group has announced plans to move its London marine operations to a specially developed site at the University of Southampton.<!--del_lnk-->  The local <a href="../../wp/n/Newspaper.htm" title="Newspaper">newspaper</a> for the city is the <!--del_lnk--> Southern Daily Echo, a <!--del_lnk--> Newsquest publication.<p>Southampton has always been strongly connected with <!--del_lnk--> maritime history and developments. In particular, it is a primary port for <!--del_lnk--> cruise ships, its heyday being the first half of the <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a>, and in particular the inter-war years, when it handled almost half the passenger traffic of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">UK</a>. Today it remains home to many luxury liners, as well as being a very important <!--del_lnk--> container port.<p>The outstanding <!--del_lnk--> harbour means it is the principal port on the south coast, and one of the largest in the UK. <!--del_lnk--> Sailing is a popular sport here. Much of this is centred around the <!--del_lnk--> Ocean Village development, a local <!--del_lnk--> marina which includes one of the South Coast&#39;s major independent cinema complexes, <!--del_lnk--> Harbour Lights. From 1977 to 2001 the famous Whitbread Around the World Yacht Race (now known as the <!--del_lnk--> Volvo Ocean Race) started in Southampton<p>The area of <!--del_lnk--> Swaythling is home to <!--del_lnk--> Ford&#39;s Southampton Assembly Plant, where the majority of their <!--del_lnk--> Transit models are manufactured.<p>Southampton is named the &#39;Green City&#39; as it is graced with many green spaces and parks. Standing in any area of Southampton, if you turn 360 degrees you will see at least one form of greenery. The largest green space is <!--del_lnk--> Southampton Common, parts of which are used to host the annual summer festivals, circuses and funfairs. The Common covers a larger area than Hyde Park in London and includes a Wildlife Centre on the former site of Southampton Zoo, a swimming pool and several lakes and ponds. The city also boasts the Southampton Sports Centre which is the focal point for the public&#39;s sporting and outdoor activities and includes an Alpine Centre, Theme Park and Athletics Centre used by professional athletes. As with most cities there are several council estates such as those in the <!--del_lnk--> Weston district.<p><!--del_lnk--> Southampton Football Club (nicknamed the &quot;Saints&quot;) is also based here, at <!--del_lnk--> St Mary&#39;s Stadium which was built in the early 2000&#39;s on the site of the old gasworks. It has a capacity of 32,000 and cost &pound;32 Million to build. In 1976, &quot;The Saints&quot; won the FA Cup Final beating <a href="../../wp/m/Manchester_United_F.C..htm" title="Manchester United">Manchester United</a> 1-0. It was a Southampton team member, <!--del_lnk--> Charles William Miller, who founded <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>&#39;s first football club.<p><a href="../../wp/h/Hampshire.htm" title="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>&#39;s county <a href="../../wp/c/Cricket.htm" title="Cricket">Cricket</a> ground is the <!--del_lnk--> Rose Bowl, Southampton, in nearby <!--del_lnk--> West End. Both the SFC stadium and the Rose Bowl have recently played host to concerts from Bon Jovi to Billy Joel.<p>Southampton has a vibrant nightlife and thriving cafe culture. Music is an important aspect of the city and there are several stadiums and outlets for this. The city is home to R&#39;n&#39;B soulstar Craig David, Coldplay drummer Will Champion, and was the birthplace of comedian <!--del_lnk--> Benny Hill.<p>There is a large <!--del_lnk--> Polish population in Southampton, with estimates as high as 20,000, or 1 in every 10.<p><a id="Government_and_politics" name="Government_and_politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Government and politics</span></h2>
      <p>Formerly a <!--del_lnk--> County Borough within the <!--del_lnk--> county of <a href="../../wp/h/Hampshire.htm" title="Hampshire">Hampshire</a> (to which it gave its name, the <i>County of Southampton</i> or <i>Southamptonshire</i> - this was officially changed to <i>Hampshire</i> in 1959 though the county had been commonly known as Hampshire or Hantshire for centuries), it became a <!--del_lnk--> non-metropolitan district in <!--del_lnk--> 1974. However, the city became independent administratively from that county as it was made into a <!--del_lnk--> unitary authority in a local government re-organisation on <!--del_lnk--> 1 April <!--del_lnk--> 1997. The district remains part of the Hampshire <!--del_lnk--> ceremonial county.<p>Southampton City Council consists of 48 councillors elected by thirds. After the 2006 local council elections on <!--del_lnk--> May 4, <!--del_lnk--> 2006 the Council is split evenly 16 seats each to the <a href="../../wp/l/Liberal_Democrats.htm" title="Liberal Democrats">Liberal Democrats</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Labour and the <!--del_lnk--> Conservative Party. Currently the council is run by the Liberal Democrats with Labour support.<p>There are three <!--del_lnk--> members of parliament for the city: Rt Hon <!--del_lnk--> John Denham (<!--del_lnk--> Labour) for <!--del_lnk--> Southampton Itchen (constituency for the east of the city), Dr <!--del_lnk--> Alan Whitehead (Labour) for <!--del_lnk--> Southampton Test (the west of the city), and <!--del_lnk--> Sandra Gidley (Liberal Democrat) for <!--del_lnk--> Romsey (which includes a portion of the north of the city).<p><a id="Transport" name="Transport"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transport</span></h2>
      <p>As befits Southampton&#39;s role as a major port, the city has good transport links with the rest of the country. The <!--del_lnk--> M27 motorway, linking places along the south coast of England, runs just to the north of the city. The <!--del_lnk--> M3 motorway links the city to <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> and also, by linking to the <!--del_lnk--> A34 road at <!--del_lnk--> Winchester with the Midlands and North. The <!--del_lnk--> M271 motorway links the <!--del_lnk--> M27 with the Western Docks and city centre.<p>Southampton is also well served by the <!--del_lnk--> rail network, used by both freight services to and from the docks, and passenger services as part of the <!--del_lnk--> national rail system. The main station in the city is <!--del_lnk--> Southampton Central. Routes run eastwards to <a href="../../wp/p/Portsmouth.htm" title="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Brighton.htm" title="Brighton">Brighton</a>, north-east to <!--del_lnk--> Winchester and <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, north to <!--del_lnk--> Reading, <a href="../../wp/b/Birmingham.htm" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> and beyond, north-west to <!--del_lnk--> Salisbury, <a href="../../wp/b/Bristol.htm" title="Bristol">Bristol</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Cardiff.htm" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> and west to <!--del_lnk--> Bournemouth, <!--del_lnk--> Poole and <a href="../../wp/w/Weymouth.htm" title="Weymouth">Weymouth</a>. Southampton Coach Station was refurbished recently, and the range and frequency of services offered by the <!--del_lnk--> National Express Group increased to make use of the new facilities.<p><!--del_lnk--> Southampton Airport is a regional airport located in the town of <!--del_lnk--> Eastleigh, just north of Southampton. It is connected to the city by a frequent rail service, and hosts flights to UK and near European destinations.<p>Whilst Southampton is no longer the base for any cross-channel ferries, it is the terminus for three internal <!--del_lnk--> ferry services, all of which operate from terminals at Town Quay. Two of these, a <!--del_lnk--> car ferry service and a fast <!--del_lnk--> catamaran passenger ferry service, provide links to <!--del_lnk--> Cowes on the <a href="../../wp/i/Isle_of_Wight.htm" title="Isle of Wight">Isle of Wight</a> and are operated by <!--del_lnk--> Red Funnel. The third ferry is the <!--del_lnk--> Hythe Ferry, providing a passenger service to the town of <!--del_lnk--> Hythe on the other side of <!--del_lnk--> Southampton Water. Town Quay is linked to Southampton Central station by a free bus service.<p>Local transport is largely road based, with significant peak hour congestion in the city. The main <!--del_lnk--> bus operators are <!--del_lnk--> First, <!--del_lnk--> Solent Blue Line (who also operate the <!--del_lnk--> BlueStar service) and <!--del_lnk--> Uni-link, although other operators also run services into the city, including <!--del_lnk--> Stagecoach and <!--del_lnk--> Wilts and Dorset.There is also a door to door minibus service (Southampton Dial a Ride) for residents who cannot access public transport, this is funded by the City Council and operated by <!--del_lnk--> SCA Support Services. However, local train services do operate in the central, Southern and Eastern sections of the city, serving <!--del_lnk--> Swaythling, <!--del_lnk--> St. Denys, <!--del_lnk--> Millbrook, <!--del_lnk--> Redbridge, <!--del_lnk--> Bitterne, <!--del_lnk--> Sholing and <!--del_lnk--> Woolston.<p>The Uni-link bus service was commissioned by the <!--del_lnk--> University of Southampton to provide access to students who are studying at the university to all parts of the city. The buses run from early in the morning to midnight meeting demands of students who wish to get to the city during the day and leisure places in the evening.<p><a id="Districts_and_suburbs" name="Districts_and_suburbs"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Districts and suburbs</span></h2>
