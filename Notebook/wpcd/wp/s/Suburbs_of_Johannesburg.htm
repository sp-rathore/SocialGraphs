      <p>The <b>suburbs of Johannesburg</b> are officially demarcated areas within the city of <a href="../../wp/j/Johannesburg.htm" title="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>. As in other countries that use <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth English, the term &quot;suburb&quot; refers to a &quot;neighbourhood&quot;, although the term has a somewhat stronger meaning in South Africa as most suburbs have legally recognised borders and separate <!--del_lnk--> postal codes. The municipal functions for the area, such as <a href="../../wp/p/Police.htm" title="Police">police</a> and <!--del_lnk--> social services, are still managed by either the <!--del_lnk--> local region or the <!--del_lnk--> city government.<p>Johannesburg, like many other <!--del_lnk--> boom towns, grew rapidly and with little planning, and thus the city covers an extremely large <!--del_lnk--> area. The main differences between the city&#39;s suburbs tend to be socioeconomic: The wealthy live to the north of the City Centre in the northern suburbs, while the poor live to the south and on the fringes of the city in former <!--del_lnk--> townships. Many people see themselves as being a resident of their suburb first and foremost to being a resident of Johannesburg secondarily.<p>

      <p>The first major modern settlements in Johannesburg were loosely planned, as they grew up quickly in order to service the need for <!--del_lnk--> labour in the <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a> <a href="../../wp/m/Mining.htm" title="Mining">mines</a> on the <!--del_lnk--> Witwatersrand. However, the population of Johannesburg increased rapidly and the city quickly established formal neighbourhoods, most of which were racially mixed as labourers lived together. The earliest formal settlement to house people of all races, <!--del_lnk--> Kliptown, is located near today&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Soweto.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Central Business District (CBD) grew rapidly in the early 1900s as many formal <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European</a> style buildings were constructed, such as the city&#39;s main <!--del_lnk--> post office. The Central Business District was the first part of the city to be built in a grid, which was designed around the major road known as <!--del_lnk--> Commissioner Street, which served as the central artery for the city. During this time period, the city invested in <!--del_lnk--> street cars, which mostly served to connect wealthier white suburbs with the CBD. Physical growth, although somewhat limited by transportation, continued quickly as immigration to South Africa, and Johannesburg in particular, increased dramatically.<p>This problem was solved in the 1930s when the <a href="../../wp/a/Automobile.htm" title="Automobile">automobile</a> was introduced in <!--del_lnk--> mass production to South Africa.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_South"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Automobiles were, for the most part, confined to the wealthy, and permitted them to move to the north of the city and <!--del_lnk--> commute into the centre. The <!--del_lnk--> South African economy did extremely well at the end of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> and many new immigrants came to South Africa from Europe. Most poor suburbs were mixed, with poor blacks and whites living together, although the wealthy suburbs were usually reserved for whites. This changed with the election of the <!--del_lnk--> National Party in the <!--del_lnk--> 1948 elections, who began to formalise the system known as <!--del_lnk--> apartheid. Apartheid formally designated which suburbs each race could live in under the <!--del_lnk--> Group Areas Act.<p>Consequently, the city was divided into white and black suburbs. The white suburbs were mostly wealthy and well-developed, and located in the nicest areas in the Johannesburg region. Black people lived in poorly developed <!--del_lnk--> townships and suburbs out of view of the white suburbs. Many large <!--del_lnk--> freeways were built to link Johannesburg with the rest of South Africa, although this permitted the further outward expansion of the city along the <!--del_lnk--> N1, <!--del_lnk--> N3, and <!--del_lnk--> M2 roadways. Public transport construction was completely abandoned, except for a minor <!--del_lnk--> bus system.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_abandoned"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_system"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p>This system continued until the 1980s, when international <!--del_lnk--> sanctions and a poor security situation lead to a large contraction in the economy. Many companies abandoned <!--del_lnk--> skyscrapers that had been built in the Central Business District (CBD) in the 1960s and 1970s, and left warehouses empty or little used.<p>When the Group Areas Act was repealed, there was a mass migration of former township dwellers and <!--del_lnk--> illegal immigrants to buildings in the CBD and surrounding areas, which caused <a href="../../wp/c/Crime.htm" title="Crime">crime</a> rates to increase dramatically in the Central area of the city.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_caused"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Central"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Many businesses that had not closed their CBD offices left for more secured Northern suburbs, and in particular, <!--del_lnk--> Sandton. The amount of business and population of the northern suburbs increased exponentially, while the CBD was left empty and abandoned as a &quot;no-go zone&quot;. The previous owners of buildings in the CBD abandoned them as their value decreased, and more illegal immigrants moved in. Many suburbs near the CBD also felt the demographic change as previously white and middle class suburbs like <!--del_lnk--> Yeoville became mostly black and dangerous within the space of two to three years.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_became"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p>The <!--del_lnk--> city government has attempted to rectify this situation <!--del_lnk--> as of 2005 by installing <!--del_lnk--> CCTV <!--del_lnk--> cameras all over the city centre, and increasing <a href="../../wp/p/Police.htm" title="Police">police</a> presence. Some businesses and residents have returned, although most businesses have built permanent and better facilities in the northern suburbs, so a large-scale return is unlikely.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_unlikely"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The city has grown so quickly to the north that the border between Johannesburg, <!--del_lnk--> Midrand, and <!--del_lnk--> Centurion is mostly an arbitrary political border, as the two cities have grown together so there is no space between them.<p><a id="Inner_city" name="Inner_city"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Inner city</span></h2>

      <p>The inner city of Johannesburg is located within the city&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Region 8. The inner city is an extremely diverse region, with areas ranging from severely degraded <!--del_lnk--> residential areas such as <!--del_lnk--> Bertrams, to the somewhat stable <!--del_lnk--> commercial area of <!--del_lnk--> Braamfontein. The estimated population of the region is 200,000, but the number of people living in the inner city on an informal basis is unknown, as many are illegal immigrants.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_illegal"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Most higher-income residents and white people have moved to the northern suburbs and have been replaced by lower-income black people. The unemployment, education, and age profiles of the area are all unknown, due to the difficulty of obtaining reliable information about the area. There have been significant movements to revitalise the <!--del_lnk--> CBD, most of which have focused on the reduction of <a href="../../wp/c/Crime.htm" title="Crime">crime</a>, especially <!--del_lnk--> street crime in the central area, and the redevelopment of <!--del_lnk--> Newtown as a cultural hub for the city.<p>Centred around the CBD, the region includes the suburbs of <!--del_lnk--> Yeoville, <!--del_lnk--> Bellevue, <!--del_lnk--> Troyeville, <!--del_lnk--> Jeppestown, and <!--del_lnk--> Berea to the east. To the west it spreads to <!--del_lnk--> Pageview and <!--del_lnk--> Fordsburg. There are small <a href="../../wp/i/Industry.htm" title="Industry">industrial</a> areas to the south, such as <!--del_lnk--> City West-Denver and <!--del_lnk--> Benrose.<p>Around 800,000 <!--del_lnk--> commuters pass through the inner city every day, and it functions as a regional <!--del_lnk--> shopping node for visitors from the southern suburbs.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_pass"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> All major <!--del_lnk--> arterial roads originate from the inner city and spread out into other parts of the city. Johannesburg&#39;s main <!--del_lnk--> railway station, <!--del_lnk--> bus terminal, and <!--del_lnk--> minibus taxi centre are all located in the inner city.<p>The suburbs close to the CBD, in particular <!--del_lnk--> Joubert Park, <!--del_lnk--> Hillbrow, and <!--del_lnk--> Berea, have a large number of high-rise apartment blocks. These areas were formerly extremely desirable; however, due to the increase in crime, the housing stock has greatly deteriorated as many wealthier residents have left for the northern suburbs. The existing buildings in the CBD area are insufficient to meet the current demands for housing in the area, and as a result, many under-utilised or abandoned office buildings have been taken over by <!--del_lnk--> squatters, or converted into residential housing units. Yeoville and Bellevue have a mix of apartment buildings and single residential units on small lots.<p>The region is located on a mountainous divide that runs from east to west. The most conspicuous geographic feature is <!--del_lnk--> Observatory Ridge, which is named for the large <!--del_lnk--> observatory located on it.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_located"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The <!--del_lnk--> recreational spaces are no longer used, due to security problems. The CBD area lacks open spaces; although there are small neighbourhood parks in all suburbs, they are also not used due to <!--del_lnk--> mugging concerns. Both the <!--del_lnk--> University of the Witwatersrand and the <!--del_lnk--> University of Johannesburg are located in the inner city. <!--del_lnk--> Johannesburg Stadium, home of one of South Africa&#39;s most famous <a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Football (soccer)">football</a> sides, is located in <!--del_lnk--> Doornfontein.<p><a id="Eastern_suburbs" name="Eastern_suburbs"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Eastern suburbs</span></h2>
      <p>The eastern suburbs of Johannesburg are located in the city&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> seventh and <!--del_lnk--> ninth regions. They have generally suffered the same fate as the city centre, although to a lesser extent, and extend out along the <!--del_lnk--> M2 and <!--del_lnk--> N12 towards <!--del_lnk--> Johannesburg International Airport. The eastern region includes some of the oldest areas in the city; however, it has historically been less fashionable than the northern suburbs because of its proximity to the <!--del_lnk--> gold reefs. The reefs all created great amounts of dust, and there is also greater exposure to winter winds. The area also includes the <!--del_lnk--> township of <!--del_lnk--> Alexandra, and other mixed residential and industrial areas towards the northeast of the city near <!--del_lnk--> Kempton Park. The area is also functionally integrated with border cities outside of the official boundary of Johannesburg, such as <!--del_lnk--> Germiston and <!--del_lnk--> Boksburg. The major freeway in the area is the <!--del_lnk--> N3 Eastern Bypass, and its largest arterial is <!--del_lnk--> Louis Botha Avenue, which runs near the western border of the city. The total population for the area is 533,000.<p>There has been strong growth to the south of the area in newly developed <!--del_lnk--> gated communities and residential areas, such as <!--del_lnk--> Mondeor, <!--del_lnk--> Mulbarton, and <!--del_lnk--> Kibler Park. Other older communities are mixed in terms of stability, <!--del_lnk--> population density, and income level. In general, the further from the inner city, the more stable the suburb. <!--del_lnk--> Bezuidenhout Valley, an extension of the inner city, is in transition. <!--del_lnk--> Malvern, on the other hand, is rapidly deteriorating along the lines of <!--del_lnk--> Hillbrow, due to <!--del_lnk--> slum lording.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_rapidly"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p>The condition of the main <a href="../../wp/r/River.htm" title="River">river</a> in the area, the <!--del_lnk--> Jukskei River, has been severely affected by <!--del_lnk--> runoff from informal settlements around Alexandra, which all lack proper <!--del_lnk--> plumbing. Properties located below the flood line of the Jukskei River have been damaged or destroyed several times due to <a href="../../wp/f/Flood.htm" title="Flood">flooding</a>.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_damaged"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_several"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p>The region also has well-developed entertainment and shopping areas. <!--del_lnk--> Gold Reef City and the <!--del_lnk--> Eastgate shopping centre have made the area an important centre for points located to the south and east of the inner city.<p><a id="South-eastern_suburbs_and_Soweto" name="South-eastern_suburbs_and_Soweto"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">South-eastern suburbs and Soweto</span></h2>
      <p>Soweto and the south-eastern suburbs, located in <!--del_lnk--> Region 6 and <!--del_lnk--> Region 10, border the city&#39;s <a href="../../wp/m/Mining.htm" title="Mining">mining</a> belt in the north. The area is mostly composed of old &quot;matchbox&quot; houses, or four-room houses built by the government, that were built to provide cheap accommodation for black workers during <!--del_lnk--> apartheid.<p><!--del_lnk--> Soweto is an abbreviation, standing for &quot;South Western Townships&quot;. Street after street in this area is lined with matchboxes; however, there are a few smaller areas where prosperous Sowetans have built houses that are more similar in stature with those in more affluent suburbs. Many people who still live in matchbox houses have improved and expanded their homes, and the <!--del_lnk--> City Council has enabled the planting of more <a href="../../wp/t/Tree.htm" title="Tree">trees</a> and the improving of <a href="../../wp/p/Park.htm" title="Park">parks</a> and <!--del_lnk--> green spaces in the area.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_enabled"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p><!--del_lnk--> Hostels are another prominent physical feature of Soweto.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_another"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_feature"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Originally built to house male migrant workers, many have been improved as dwellings for couples and families. The <!--del_lnk--> N1 Western Bypass skirts the eastern boundary of Soweto.

      <p>The northern suburbs, located in Regions <!--del_lnk--> 2, <!--del_lnk--> 3, <!--del_lnk--> 4, and <!--del_lnk--> 7, include the most wealthy and developed parts of the city.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_include"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Spreading to the north from the inner city to the border with <!--del_lnk--> Midrand, the northern suburbs include both large housing developments and commercial centres. The northern suburbs benefited greatly from the deterioration of the CBD, as many people and businesses moved. The northern suburbs have developed along the <!--del_lnk--> M1 and <!--del_lnk--> N1 highways, which serve as their major arterial roads. The <!--del_lnk--> N1 Western Bypass connects the northern suburbs with the north-western suburbs.<p>The residential areas in the northern suburbs are mainly formal, with no significant areas of informal housing, or housing that lacks a permanent structure. Although this is an established area, there is a trend of land use change from residential to commercial, especially along main arterial roads and around established nodes.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_trend"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The area is also becoming more dense, as large residential properties are <!--del_lnk--> subdivided, or redeveloped, as <!--del_lnk--> townhouse and cluster house complexes.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_dense"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The area is well connected to road networks, especially along the north-south axis formed by the <!--del_lnk--> M1 and <!--del_lnk--> N1. Roads to the east and west are less well developed, as there are no freeways travelling in that direction.<p>Towards the northern border of the city, the density of development decreases, leaving large areas of undeveloped land around Midrand.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_large"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> <!--del_lnk--> Grand Central Airport is also located in the area, which makes the northern suburbs more accessible to the rest of South Africa. The first suburb to the north of the inner city is <!--del_lnk--> Parktown, which is located on a hill overlooking the inner city and Hillbrow. It has many wealthy residents and <!--del_lnk--> Edwardian-style <!--del_lnk--> mansions. Just to the west of Parktown is <!--del_lnk--> Westcliff, which is one of the wealthiest areas in Johannesburg, as it is located on the side of a very tall hill and overlooks the inner city as well as the northern suburbs. Other wealthy residential suburbs, <!--del_lnk--> Saxonwold and <!--del_lnk--> Houghton continue to the north of Westcliff. <a href="../../wp/n/Nelson_Mandela.htm" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a> has a house in Houghton, and it is also the location of the most prestigious <!--del_lnk--> secondary schools in Johannesburg. Houghton is also the former electoral district of <!--del_lnk--> Helen Suzman, a famous anti-apartheid <!--del_lnk--> Member of Parliament.<p>The suburbs become more commercial to the north of Houghton. <!--del_lnk--> Rosebank is the centre of high-end <!--del_lnk--> retail and <!--del_lnk--> shopping for northern suburb residents. Most retail development has centred on the <!--del_lnk--> Zone@Rosebank, one of the most prestigious <!--del_lnk--> shopping centres in <!--del_lnk--> Gauteng. Many smaller companies who cannot afford to be located in <!--del_lnk--> Sandton also are located in Rosebank. The suburbs near Rosebank, including Parkhurst, Parktown North, Craighall Park and Greenside are collectively known as &quot;The Parks&quot;. Parkhurst is known for its village atmosphere and pavement caf&eacute;s and restaurants. <!--del_lnk--> Greenside is next to Parkhurst and has developed Parkhurst-style restaurants.<p>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Hyde Park, Sandton, and <!--del_lnk--> Morningside are all to the north of Rosebank, all of which are extremely wealthy and well policed. Sandton has become the new business area of Johannesburg, and features many corporate headquarters, as well as <!--del_lnk--> Nelson Mandela Square and <!--del_lnk--> Wanderers Stadium, the most prestigious <a href="../../wp/c/Cricket.htm" title="Cricket">cricket ground</a> in South Africa. The skyline of Sandton has grown rapidly and there are many projects under development in the area. Sandton is also the location of the <!--del_lnk--> JSE Securities Exchange, Africa&#39;s largest <!--del_lnk--> stock exchange, which relocated from the CBD in 2000.<p>The quality of life deteriorates on the outer fringes of the northern suburbs. One of the poorest <!--del_lnk--> townships, <!--del_lnk--> Alexandra, is located in this border area, to the east of <!--del_lnk--> Sandton.<p><a id="North-western_suburbs" name="North-western_suburbs"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">North-western suburbs</span></h2>

      <p>The north-western suburbs, located in Regions <!--del_lnk--> 1, <!--del_lnk--> 3, and <!--del_lnk--> 5, exist between the northern suburbs, <!--del_lnk--> Soweto, and the inner city. They are mostly low-rise and there are few <!--del_lnk--> skyscrapers, although there are a few new developments in the recently incorporated city of <!--del_lnk--> Randburg, which is the main business centre for the area. The area is also connected to the rest of the city by the <!--del_lnk--> N1 Western Bypass.<p><!--del_lnk--> Roodepoort is another major formerly independent municipality, recently incorporated into Johannesburg. Roodepoort&#39;s previously predominantly white population is changing as its proximity to <!--del_lnk--> Soweto has made it attractive to middle-class black people who want to move to nicer houses while maintaining ties to their old communities. There is ample access from the more affluent northern residential areas to the inner city. However, links are poor towards high economic and commercial areas in the north, such as Randburg and Sandton. This gives rise to increasing numbers of secondary roads, creating congestion and putting pressure on residential areas and infrastructure.<p>Towards the extreme north-west of the city, there are well-developed <!--del_lnk--> farms, as well as smaller formal and informal residential areas. There are also large <a href="../../wp/m/Manufacturing.htm" title="Manufacturing">manufacturing</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/Industry.htm" title="Industry">industrial</a> nodes. The informal settlements in this area are growing rapidly, with 76 per cent of the population of <!--del_lnk--> Diepsloot living in informal housing. The industrial areas along <!--del_lnk--> Hans Strijdom Drive in the south-west form part of the <!--del_lnk--> Kya Sand area. <!--del_lnk--> Fourways, in the south-east, is the major retail, office and entertainment area.<p>The first suburb to be grouped in the north-west is <!--del_lnk--> Auckland Park. Auckland Park is where one finds the headquarters of the <!--del_lnk--> South African Broadcasting Corporation, which is located in <!--del_lnk--> Radiopark, and the main campus of the <!--del_lnk--> University of Johannesburg.<p>North of Auckland Park lies <!--del_lnk--> Melville, which changed into a <!--del_lnk--> Bohemian-style enclave of <!--del_lnk--> restaurants, <!--del_lnk--> caf&eacute;s, and <!--del_lnk--> bookstores on <!--del_lnk--> 7th Avenue, after the South African Broadcasting Corporation moved its headquarters to Auckland Park. Melville&#39;s main entertainment strip is 7th road. A local Soap, <i>7de Laan</i>, shows the strip in its opening credits, mistakenly referring to the road as 7th lane. In Melville, lanes run east to west while roads lie north to south; both lanes. Melville borders on the north to the Melville Koppies, a small protected reserve. The road that cuts though Melville&#39;s business area (called &#39;New Melville&#39;, 7th road is referred to as Old Melville), Beyer Naude, has two intersections notorious in the metropolitan for accidents. The closest is just north out of Melville, intersecting with Judith road. The second is just to the south, intersecting with Empire road. Currently Melville has seen several businesses depart to the newly renovated <!--del_lnk--> Newtown area.<p>West of Melville is <!--del_lnk--> Sophiatown, once one of the most vibrant black suburbs in the city. Considered a criminal and political hotbed, the entire suburb was razed to the ground in the 1950s. The all-white suburb of <!--del_lnk--> Triomf, meaning &quot;triumph&quot; in <a href="../../wp/a/Afrikaans.htm" title="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a>, was built in its place. The only remaining original Sophiatown building is the <!--del_lnk--> Church of Christ the King. The area has since reverted to its original name of &quot;Sophiatown&quot;.<p><a id="Southern_suburbs" name="Southern_suburbs"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Southern suburbs</span></h2>

      <p>The southern suburbs, located in Regions <!--del_lnk--> 9, <!--del_lnk--> 10, and <!--del_lnk--> 11, extend to the south of the inner city, and are somewhat isolated from the rest of Johannesburg. On a map, the southern suburbs appear to hang down from the border of <!--del_lnk--> Soweto and <!--del_lnk--> Johannesburg South. It is about 40 <!--del_lnk--> kilometres south of the inner city. It is actually the most isolated, least integrated area of Johannesburg, with its east, west, and southern boundaries also forming Johannesburg proper&#39;s boundaries in the area. It is diagonally traversed by the <!--del_lnk--> N1, with the <!--del_lnk--> N12 running along its northern border.<p>The southern suburbs tend to be either solely industrial or solely residential, with most residents in the residential areas being long-term residents in well-established communities. The majority of houses in these formal settlements are included in one of Johannesburg&#39;s lowest income brackets. At the extreme south end of the city, there are extremely large informal settlements, such as <!--del_lnk--> Orange Farm, which suffer from widespread poverty and <!--del_lnk--> unemployment, which are compounded by their isolation from the rest of the city, which in turn makes it costly to extend much-needed infrastructure from the more integrated suburbs.<p>A significant amount of underdeveloped and vacant <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agricultural</a> land is publicly owned, and the city government is currently in the process of selling large tracts of it for development, which is hoped to provide jobs for the residents of the informal settlements. <!--del_lnk--> Rand Stadium, the oldest football stadium in the city, is located in the southern suburb of <!--del_lnk--> Rosettenville.<p>Turffontein was the largest concentration camp in Johannesburg during the Anglo Boer War. The camp was located where the Turffontein Racecourse is now, and housed about 5000 people. The 700 who died of that group were buried on a farm called Klipriviers Berg in Winchester Hills. The racecourse hosts the Summer Cup one of three major races in South Africa.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburbs_of_Johannesburg&quot;</div>
