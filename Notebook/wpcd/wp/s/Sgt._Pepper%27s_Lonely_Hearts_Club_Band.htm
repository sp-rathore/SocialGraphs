      <p><i><b>Sgt. Pepper&#39;s Lonely Hearts Club Band</b></i> was the eighth album by <a href="../../wp/t/The_Beatles.htm" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>. It is often cited as the most influential album of all time by prominent critics and publications, including <i><!--del_lnk--> Rolling Stone</i> (which put it atop their 500 &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Greatest Albums&quot; list in 2003). It was recorded by The Beatles over a 129-day period beginning on <!--del_lnk--> December 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1966. The album was released on <!--del_lnk--> June 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1967 in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and on <!--del_lnk--> June 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1967 in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>.<p>On release the album was an immediate critical and popular sensation. Innovative in every sense, from structure to recording techniques to the cover artwork, the artistic effect was felt immediately and influenced nearly every album that came after it.<p>

      <p><i>Sgt. Pepper&#39;s Lonely Hearts Club Band</i> was recorded as early <a href="../../wp/t/The_Beatles.htm" title="The Beatles">Beatlemania</a> was waning. The Beatles had grown tired of touring and had quit the road in late 1966, burned out after the drama of the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> bigger than Jesus&quot; controversy and a tumultuous tour of the <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a> which saw the band expelled from the country more or less at gunpoint.<p>Retirement from touring gave them, for the first time in their career, more than ample time in which to prepare their next record. As <!--del_lnk--> EMI&#39;s premier act and <!--del_lnk--> Britain&#39;s most successful pop group ever, they had almost unlimited access to the state-of-the-art technology of <!--del_lnk--> Abbey Road Studios. All four band members had already developed a preference for long, late-night sessions although they were still extremely efficient and highly disciplined in their studio habits.<p>By the time The Beatles recorded the album, their musical interests had grown from their simple <!--del_lnk--> blues, pop and rock beginnings to incorporate a variety of new influences. They had become familiar with a wide range of instruments, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Hammond organ and the <!--del_lnk--> electric piano; their instrumentation now covered the entire range, including <!--del_lnk--> strings, <!--del_lnk--> brass, <!--del_lnk--> woodwind, <!--del_lnk--> percussion and a wide range of exotic instruments, including the <!--del_lnk--> sitar. <a href="../../wp/p/Paul_McCartney.htm" title="Paul McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>, although unable to read music, had <!--del_lnk--> scored a recent British film <i><!--del_lnk--> The Family Way</i> with the assistance of producer-arranger <!--del_lnk--> George Martin, which earned him a prestigious <!--del_lnk--> Ivor Novello award.<p>The Beatles also used new modular effects units like the <!--del_lnk--> wah-wah pedal and the <!--del_lnk--> fuzzbox, which they augmented with their own experimental ideas, such as running voices and instruments through a <!--del_lnk--> Leslie speaker. Another important sonic innovation was McCartney&#39;s discovery of the <!--del_lnk--> direct injection (DI) technique, in which he could record his bass by plugging it directly into an amplifying circuit in the recording console. While the still often-used technique of recording through an amplifier with a microphone sounds more natural, this setup provided a radically different presence in bass guitar sound versus the old method.<p>The <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> period also coincided with the introduction of some important musical innovations, both from within the band and the rest of the musical industry. The work of <a href="../../wp/b/Bob_Dylan.htm" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Frank Zappa, <!--del_lnk--> Phil Spector, and <!--del_lnk--> Brian Wilson was radically redefining what was possible for pop musicians in terms of both songwriting and recording. Studio and recording technology had already reached a high degree of development and was poised for even greater innovation. The old rules of pop songwriting were being abandoned, as complex lyrical themes were explored for the first time in popular music, and songs were growing longer (such as Dylan&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Desolation Row,&quot; &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Like a Rolling Stone,&quot; and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Just Like Tom Thumb&#39;s Blues&quot;).<p><a id="Technical_innovation" name="Technical_innovation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Technical innovation</span></h2>
      <p>Since the introduction of the core technology of magnetic recording tape in 1949, <!--del_lnk--> multitrack recording had progressed rapidly, with 8-track tape recorders already available in the USA and the first 8-tracks coming on-line in commercial studios in London in late 1967, shortly after <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> was released.<p>All of the <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> tracks were recorded at Abbey Road using mono, stereo and 4-track recorders. Like its predecessors, the recording made extensive use of the technique known as bouncing down, in which a number of tracks were recorded across the four tracks of one recorder, which were then mixed and <!--del_lnk--> dubbed down onto one track of the master 4-track machine. This enabled the Abbey Road engineers to give The Beatles a virtual multi-track studio, since 8-, 16- and 24-track recorders did not exist at this time.<p>The build-up of noise during repeated <!--del_lnk--> dubbing was a major problem for engineers. The Abbey Road album was one of the first to use the <!--del_lnk--> Dolby noise reduction system. The album remains a landmark in the history of sound recording and is remarkable for the clarity, fidelity and quietness of the transfers.<p><!--del_lnk--> Magnetic tape had also led to innovative use of instruments and production effects, notably the <!--del_lnk--> tape-based keyboard sampler, the <!--del_lnk--> Mellotron, and effects like <!--del_lnk--> flanging (a term invented by Martin, an effect used as early as 1959 on <!--del_lnk--> Toni Fisher&#39;s &quot;The Big Hurt&quot;) and <!--del_lnk--> phasing, and a greatly improved system for creating echo and reverberation.<p>Several then-new production effects feature extensively on the recordings. One of the most important was <!--del_lnk--> automatic double tracking (ADT), a system that used tape recorders to create an instant and simultaneous doubling of a sound. Although it had long been recognised that using multitrack tape to record &#39;doubled&#39; lead vocals gave them a greatly enhanced sound (especially with weaker singers) it had always been necessary to record such vocal tracks twice, a task which was both tedious and exacting.<p>ADT was invented specially for The Beatles by EMI engineer <!--del_lnk--> Ken Townshend in 1965, mainly at the behest of Lennon, who hated tracking sessions and regularly expressed a desire for a technical solution to the problem. ADT quickly became a near-universal recording practice in popular music.<p>Also important was <!--del_lnk--> varispeeding, the technique of recording various tracks on a multi-track tape at slightly different tape speeds. The Beatles use this effect extensively on their vocals in this period. The speeding up of vocals (also known as &#39;tweaking&#39;) also became a widespread technique in pop production. The Beatles also used the effect on portions of their backing tracks (as on &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds&quot;) to give them a &#39;thicker&#39; and more diffuse sound.<p>In another innovation, the album (in its original LP form that was later released on CD) ends in an unusual way, beginning with a 15-kilohertz high-frequency tone (put on the album at John Lennon&#39;s suggestion, said to be &quot;especially intended to annoy your dog&quot;), followed by an endless loop made by the runout groove looping back into itself.<p>The sound in the loop is also the subject of much controversy, being widely interpreted as some kind of secret message. However, it seems that in reality it is nothing more than a few random samples and tape edits played backwards. The loop is recreated on the CD version which plays for a few seconds, then fades out. Although most of the content of the runout groove is impossible to decipher, it is possible to distinguish a sped-up voice (possibly Paul McCartney&#39;s) reciting the phrase &quot;never could see any other way&quot;.<p><a id="Instrumentation" name="Instrumentation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Instrumentation</span></h3>
      <p><i>Sgt. Pepper</i> features elaborate arrangements &mdash; for example, the <a href="../../wp/c/Clarinet.htm" title="Clarinet">clarinet</a> ensemble on &quot;<!--del_lnk--> When I&#39;m Sixty-Four&quot; &mdash; and extensive use of studio effects including echo, reverberation and reverse tape effects. Many of these effects were devised in collaboration with producer <!--del_lnk--> George Martin and his team of engineers.<p>One of the few moments of discord came during the recording of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> She&#39;s Leaving Home&quot;, when an impatient McCartney, frustrated by Martin&#39;s unavailability on another recording session, hired freelance arranger <!--del_lnk--> Mike Leander to arrange the string section &mdash; the only time during the group&#39;s entire career that he worked with another arranger, with the exception of some backing orchestration used in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Magical Mystery Tour</i> film (12 October 1967 session; see Lewisohn), which were also arranged by Leander.<p>Another example of the album&#39;s unusual production is <!--del_lnk--> John Lennon&#39;s song &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Being for the Benefit of Mr Kite&quot;, which closes Side 1 of the album. The lyrics were adapted almost word for word from an old circus poster which Lennon had bought at an antique shop in Kent. The flowing sound collage that gives the song its distinctive character was created by Martin and his engineers, who collected recordings of calliopes and fairground organs, which were then cut into strips of various lengths, thrown into a box, mixed up and edited together in random order, creating a long loop which was mixed in during final production.<p>The opening track of Side 2, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Within You Without You&quot;, is unusually long for a &#39;pop&#39; recording of the day, and features only <!--del_lnk--> George Harrison, on vocals and sitar, with all other instruments being played by a group of <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>-based Indian musicians. These deviations from the traditional rock and roll band formula were facilitated by The Beatles&#39; decision not to tour, by their ability to hire top-rate session musicians, and by Harrison&#39;s burgeoning interest in <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> and Indian music, which led him to take lessons from sitar maestro <!--del_lnk--> Ravi Shankar.<p><a id="Mono_version" name="Mono_version"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Mono version</span></h3>
      <p>The Beatles themselves mixed the album in <!--del_lnk--> mono and the <!--del_lnk--> LP was originally released as such alongside a <!--del_lnk--> stereo mix prepared by <!--del_lnk--> Abbey Road <!--del_lnk--> engineers (with the mono version now out-of-print on vinyl and never released on CD). The two mixes are fundamentally different. For example, the stereo &quot;She&#39;s Leaving Home&quot; was mixed at a lower pitch than the original recording and plays at a slower tempo. Similarly, the mono version of &quot;Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds&quot; is considerably slower than the stereo version and features much heavier gating and reverb effects. McCartney&#39;s yelling voice in the <!--del_lnk--> coda section of &quot;Sgt. Pepper (Reprise)&quot; (just before the <!--del_lnk--> segue into &quot;<!--del_lnk--> A Day In The Life&quot;) can plainly be heard in the mono version, but is inaudible in the stereo version. The mono version of the song also features drums that open with much more presence and force, as they are turned well up in the mix. Also in the stereo mix, the famous <!--del_lnk--> segue at the end of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Good Morning Good Morning&quot; (the chicken-clucking sound which becomes a guitar noise) is timed differently and a crowd noise tape comes in later during the intro to &quot;Sgt. Pepper (Reprise)&quot;. Other variations between the two mixes abound.<p><a id="Themes_and_structure" name="Themes_and_structure"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Themes and structure</span></h2>
      <p>With <i>Sgt. Pepper</i>, The Beatles wanted to create a record that could, in effect, tour for them &mdash; an idea they had already explored with the promotional film-clips made over the previous years, intended to promote them in the United States when they were not touring there.<p>McCartney decided that they should create fictitious characters for each band member and record an album that would be a performance by that fictitious band. The idea of disguise or change of identity was one in which The Beatles, naturally enough, had an avid interest &mdash; they were four of the most recognisable and widely known individuals of the 20th century.<p>The Beatles&#39; recognizability was the motivation for their growing moustaches and beards and even longer hair, and was an inspiration for the disguise of their flamboyant Sgt. Pepper costumes. McCartney was well known for going out in public in disguise and all four had used aliases for travel bookings and hotel reservations.<p>Thus, the album starts with the title song, which introduces Sgt. Pepper&#39;s band itself; this song <!--del_lnk--> segues seamlessly into a sung introduction for bandleader &quot;Billy Shears&quot; (Starr), who performs &quot;<!--del_lnk--> With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;. A <!--del_lnk--> reprise version of the title song was also recorded, and appears on side 2 of the original album (just prior to the climactic &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;), creating a &quot;bookending&quot; effect.<p>However, The Beatles essentially abandoned the concept after recording the first two songs and the reprise. Lennon was unequivocal in stating that the songs he wrote for the album had nothing to do with the <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> concept. Since the other songs on the album are actually unrelated, one might be tempted to conclude that the album does not form an overarching theme. However, the cohesive structure and careful sequencing of and transitioning between songs on the album, as well as the use of the Sgt. Pepper framing device, has led the album to be widely acknowledged as an early and groundbreaking example of the <!--del_lnk--> concept album.<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Critical reception</span></h2>
      <p>Upon release, <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> became both popular and critically acclaimed. Various reviews appearing in the mainstream press and trade publications throughout June 1967, immediately after the album&#39;s release, were generally quite positive. In <i><!--del_lnk--> The Times</i> prominent critic <!--del_lnk--> Kenneth Tynan described <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> as &quot;a decisive moment in the history of Western civilization.&quot; Others including <!--del_lnk--> Richard Poirier, and <!--del_lnk--> Geoffrey Stokes were similarly expansive in their praise, Stokes noting, &quot;listening to the <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> album one thinks not simply of the history of popular music but the history of this century.&quot; One notable critic who did not like the album was <!--del_lnk--> Richard Goldstein, a critic for the <i><!--del_lnk--> New York Times</i>, who wrote, &quot;Like an overattended child, this album is spoiled. It reeks of horns and harps, harmonica quartets, assorted animal noises, and a 41-piece orchestra,&quot; and that it was an &quot;album of special effects, dazzling but ultimately fraudulent&quot; (18th of June, quoted in <i>The Beatles: Sgt. Pepper&#39;s Lonely Hearts Club Band</i> by Allan F Moore, Cambridge University Press). One rock musician who apparently did not like the album was <!--del_lnk--> Frank Zappa, who accused The Beatles of co-opting the <!--del_lnk--> flower power aesthetic for monetary gain, saying in a <i><!--del_lnk--> Rolling Stone</i> article that he felt &quot;they were only in it for the money.&quot; That criticism later became the title of the album (<i><!--del_lnk--> We&#39;re Only In It For The Money</i>), that mocked <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> with a similar album cover. Zappa&#39;s record company decided to keep that cover from ever being displayed, and it was only after 20 years had passed that the original satirical cover was seen on the CD version. Ironically, when recording of Sgt Pepper was completed, Paul was quoted saying &quot;This is going to be our <!--del_lnk--> Freak Out!&quot; referring to Zappa&#39;s 1966 debut album which in turn is considered by many as the first <!--del_lnk--> concept album. Also, <!--del_lnk--> punk rock icon <!--del_lnk--> Iggy Pop has said that he doesn&#39;t like <i>Sgt. Pepper</i>, calling it &quot;boring&quot; and &quot;depressing.&quot; It was reported that when a cut from Sgt Pepper came on the radio, <a href="../../wp/b/Bob_Dylan.htm" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> said &quot;Turn that crap off!&quot;<p>Within days of its release, <!--del_lnk--> Jimi Hendrix was performing the title track in concert, first performing it for an audience that included Harrison and McCartney, who were greatly impressed by his unique version of their song. Also, Australian band <!--del_lnk--> The Twilights &mdash; who had obtained an advance copy of the LP in London &mdash; wowed audiences in Australia with note-perfect live renditions of the entire album, weeks before it was even released there.<p>The album won the <!--del_lnk--> Grammy Award for <!--del_lnk--> Album of the Year, the first rock album to do so, and <!--del_lnk--> Best Contemporary Album in 1968.<p>It has been on many lists of the best rock albums, including <i>Rolling Stone</i>, Bill Shapiro, <i>Alternative Melbourne</i>, Rod Underhill and VH1. In 1997 <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> was named the number 1 greatest album of all time in a &#39;Music of the Millennium&#39; poll conducted by <!--del_lnk--> HMV, <!--del_lnk--> Channel 4, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Guardian</i> and <!--del_lnk--> Classic FM. In 1998 <!--del_lnk--> <i>Q</i> magazine readers placed it at number 7, while in 2003 the <!--del_lnk--> TV network <!--del_lnk--> VH1 placed it at number 10; In 2003, the album was ranked number 1 on <i><!--del_lnk--> Rolling Stone</i> magazine&#39;s list of <!--del_lnk--> the 500 greatest albums of all time.. In 2003, it was one of 50 recordings chosen by the <a href="../../wp/l/Library_of_Congress.htm" title="Library of Congress">Library of Congress</a> to be added to the <!--del_lnk--> National Recording Registry.<p>In the years since the album&#39;s release some have criticized the album for the trends that it started, such as supposed &quot;over-indulgence&quot; on the part of artists, spending a great deal of time and money producing high minded concept albums, and the beginning of supposed decadence in rock and roll. Many critics have also become more negative about the album&#39;s music, many claiming that other albums such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Revolver</i> are superior.<p><a id="Historical_relevance" name="Historical_relevance"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Historical relevance</span></h2>
      <p>A period of experimentation in The Beatles&#39; music had begun with their album <i><!--del_lnk--> Rubber Soul</i> in late 1965. During this period, new influences and instruments from as far afield as <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> were incorporated in their recordings, which evolved further from simple teen pop and into more artistic sounds. <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> continued this process and became more avant-garde in style and form than previous or subsequent recordings.<p>McCartney cited <!--del_lnk--> The Beach Boys&#39; album <i><!--del_lnk--> Pet Sounds</i> and <!--del_lnk--> Frank Zappa&#39;s album <i><!--del_lnk--> Freak Out!</i> as key influences.<p>Their follow up, <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i> contained songs that were stylistically very like those on <i>Sgt. Pepper</i>, but after two years at the forefront of psychedelic rock, The Beatles began to return to more conventional musical expression in 1968 beginning with the jazzy, piano-based &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Lady Madonna&quot;.<p>Two songs dropped from <i>Sgt. Pepper</i>, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Penny Lane&quot;, were both recorded in late 1966 and early 1967. The unusually long gap between Beatles releases, combined with the group&#39;s withdrawal from touring, saw producer <!--del_lnk--> George Martin placed under increasing pressure by EMI and <!--del_lnk--> Capitol to deliver new material. He reluctantly issued the two songs as a double-A-sided single in February 1967. In keeping with the group&#39;s usual practice, the single tracks were not included on the LP (a decision Martin maintains he regrets to this day). They were only released as a single in the UK at the time, but were subsequently included as part of the American LP version of <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i> (which was issued as a 6-track <!--del_lnk--> EP in Britain).<p>The Harrison composition, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Only A Northern Song,&quot; was also recorded during the &quot;Pepper&quot; sessions but did not see released until January 1969 when the soundtrack album to the animated feature <i><!--del_lnk--> Yellow Submarine</i> was issued.<p><a id="Album_cover" name="Album_cover"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Album cover</span></h2>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Grammy Award-winning album packaging was created by art director <!--del_lnk--> Robert Fraser, mostly in collaboration with McCartney, designed by <!--del_lnk--> Peter Blake, and photographed by <!--del_lnk--> Michael Cooper. It featured a colourful collage of life-sized cardboard models of famous people on the front of the album cover; and, as a bow to the interest that Beatles&#39; songs now inspired, the lyrics were printed on the back cover, the first time this had been done on a pop LP. The Beatles themselves, in the guise of the Sgt Pepper band, were dressed in eye-catching military-style outfits made of satin dyed in <!--del_lnk--> day-glo colours. Among the insignia on their uniforms are:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> MBE medals on McCartney and Harrison&#39;s jackets<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom, on Lennon&#39;s right sleeve</ul>
      <p>Art director <!--del_lnk--> Robert Fraser was a prominent London art dealer who ran the <!--del_lnk--> Indica Gallery. He had become a close friend of McCartney and it was only at his strong urging that the group abandoned their original cover design, a psychedelic painting by <!--del_lnk--> The Fool.<p>Fraser was one of the leading champions of modern art in Britain in the 1960s and beyond. He argued strongly that the Fool artwork was not well-executed and that the design would soon date. He convinced McCartney to abandon it, and offered to art-direct the cover; it was Fraser&#39;s suggestion to use an established fine artist and he introduced the band to a client, noted British &#39;pop&#39; artist Peter Blake, who in collaboration with his wife, created the famous cover collage, known as &quot;People We Like&quot;.<p>According to Blake, the original concept was to create a scene that showed the Sgt Pepper band performing in a park; this gradually evolved into its final form, which shows The Beatles, as the Sgt Pepper band, surrounded by a large group of their heroes, which were created as lifesize cut-out figures. Also included were wax-work figures of The Beatles as they appeared in the early &#39;60s, borrowed from <!--del_lnk--> Madame Tussauds. Appearing to be looking down on the Beatles name in flowers as if it were a grave, it&#39;s been speculated that it symbolizes that the innocent mop-tops of yesteryear were now dead and gone. At their feet were several affectations from the Beatles&#39; homes including small statues belonging to Lennon and Harrison, a small portable TV set and a trophy. A young delivery boy who provided the flowers for the photo session was allowed to contribute a guitar made out of yellow <!--del_lnk--> hyacinths. Although it has long been rumoured that some of the plants in the arrangement were cannabis plants, this is untrue. Also included is a doll wearing a sweater giving homage to the Rolling Stones (who would return the favour by having the Beatles hidden in the cover of their own &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Their Satanic Majesty&#39;s Request&quot; LP later that year).<p>The collage depicted more than 70 famous people, including writers, musicians, film stars and (at Harrison&#39;s request) a number of Indian <!--del_lnk--> gurus. Starr reportedly made no contribution to the design. The final grouping included <!--del_lnk--> Marlene Dietrich, <!--del_lnk--> W.C. Fields, <a href="../../wp/b/Bob_Dylan.htm" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Sigmund_Freud.htm" title="Sigmund Freud">Sigmund Freud</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Aleister Crowley, <a href="../../wp/e/Edgar_Allan_Poe.htm" title="Edgar Allan Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>, <a href="../../wp/k/Karl_Marx.htm" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Oscar Wilde, <!--del_lnk--> Marlon Brando, <!--del_lnk--> Stan Laurel and <!--del_lnk--> Oliver Hardy and controversial comedian <!--del_lnk--> Lenny Bruce. Also included was the image of the original Beatles bass player, the late <!--del_lnk--> Stuart Sutcliffe. <!--del_lnk--> Pete Best said in a later <!--del_lnk--> NPR interview that Lennon borrowed family medals from his mother <!--del_lnk--> Mona for the shoot, on condition he not lose them. <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> was originally requested by John Lennon, although he eventually bowed to pressures from the rest of the band to not include Hitler on the final cover. A cardboard printout of Hitler was actually made, and can be seen leaning against the wall in several photographs taken of the photoshoot. The entire list of people on the cover can be found at <!--del_lnk--> List of images on the cover of Sgt. Pepper&#39;s Lonely Hearts Club Band.<p>The package was also one of the first &#39;<!--del_lnk--> gatefold&#39; album covers, that is, the album could be opened up like a book, to reveal a large picture of the Fab Four in costume against a yellow background. The reason for the gatefold was that The Beatles planned on filling two LPs for the release. The designs had already been approved and sent to be printed when they realized they would only have enough material for one LP.<p>Originally the group wanted the album to include a package with pins, pencils and other small Sgt. Pepper goodies but this proved far too cost-prohibitive. Instead, the album came with a page of cut-outs, with a description in the top left corner:<dl>
       <dd>SGT. PEPPER<br /> CUT-OUTS<br />
      </dl>
      <ol>
       <li>Moustache<li>Picture Card of Sgt. Pepper<li>Stripes<li>Badges<li>Stand Up of the band</ol>
      <p>The special inner sleeve, included in the early pressings of the LP, featured a multi-coloured psychedelic pattern designed by The Fool.<p>The collage created legal worries for <!--del_lnk--> EMI&#39;s legal department, which had to contact those who were still living to obtain their permission. <!--del_lnk--> Mae West initially refused &mdash; famously asking &quot;What would I be doing in a lonely heart&#39;s club?&quot; &mdash; but she relented after The Beatles sent her a personal letter. <a href="../../wp/a/Actor.htm" title="Actor">Actor</a> <!--del_lnk--> Leo Gorcey requested payment for inclusion on the cover, so his image was removed. An image of <a href="../../wp/m/Mahatma_Gandhi.htm" title="Mohandas Gandhi">Mohandas Gandhi</a> was also removed at the request of EMI, who had a branch in India and were fearful that it might cause offense there. John Lennon had, perhaps facetiously, asked to include images of <a href="../../wp/j/Jesus.htm" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, but these were rejected because they would almost certainly have generated enormous controversy. Most of the suggestions for names to be included came from McCartney, Lennon and Harrison, with additional suggestions from Blake and Fraser (Ringo said he&#39;d be okay with whatever the others chose). Beatles manager <!--del_lnk--> Brian Epstein (who died just after the album&#39;s release) had serious misgivings, stemming from the scandalous U.S. <!--del_lnk--> Butcher Cover controversy the previous year, going so far as to give a note reading &ldquo;Brown paper bags for Sgt. Pepper&rdquo; to Nat Weiss as his last wish.<p>The collage was assembled by Blake and his wife during the last two weeks of March 1967 at the London studio of photographer Michael Cooper, who took the cover shots on <!--del_lnk--> March 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1967 in a three-hour evening session. Both Lennon and Harrison were tripping on LSD while the photographs were being taken. The final bill for the cover was &pound;2,868 5s/3d, a staggering sum for the time &mdash; it has been estimated that this was 100 times the average cost for an album cover in those days.<p>The cover was subsequently <!--del_lnk--> parodied by <!--del_lnk--> Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention in the cover art of their album <i><!--del_lnk--> We&#39;re Only In It For The Money</i> (although McCartney initially refused permission for the Mothers parody cover to be released, he later relented). It was also parodied in the opening credits of an episode of <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Simpsons.htm" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i>. It has also been mimicked by Dutch comic artist <!--del_lnk--> Koen Hottentot as <i>Sgt Croppers Yearly Fairport Band</i> for the a <!--del_lnk--> Fairport Convention festival programme and subsequent poster. Swedish artist <!--del_lnk--> David Liljemark did a parody of the cover for a magazine, depicting a hypothetical future for the band <!--del_lnk--> Sven-Ingvars. The <!--del_lnk--> August 13, <!--del_lnk--> 2001 issue of the <i><!--del_lnk--> The Sporting News</i> featured a version of this album when <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a> was selected as their best <a href="../../wp/s/Sport.htm" title="Sports">sports</a> <a href="../../wp/c/City.htm" title="City">city</a> during the <!--del_lnk--> July 1, <!--del_lnk--> 2000 to <!--del_lnk--> June 30, <!--del_lnk--> 2001 time period (one of the last images of the <!--del_lnk--> World Trade Centre shown in popular culture before the <a href="../../wp/s/September_11%252C_2001_attacks.htm" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">terrorist attacks</a> of <!--del_lnk--> 11 September <!--del_lnk--> 2001). <i><!--del_lnk--> MAD Magazine</i> also parodied the cover in its August 2002 issue (#420), featuring &quot;The 50 Worst Things About Music.&quot; Rolling Stone&#39;s 1,000th issue (May 18-June 1, 2006), consisted of a lenticular, 3-D cover with 154 rock &amp; roll and pop cultural figures, including, prominently, The Beatles themselves, arranged in a style reminiscent of the famed Sgt. Pepper&#39;s cover.<p><a id="Billy_Shears" name="Billy_Shears"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Billy Shears</span></h2>
      <p><b>Billy Shears</b> was <!--del_lnk--> Ringo Starr&#39;s alias on <i>Sgt. Pepper</i>. Billy Shears is only mentioned in the <!--del_lnk--> title song and, implicitly, as the singer of the segued-into &quot;<!--del_lnk--> With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;, and even more implicitly, in the <!--del_lnk--> title song reprise.<p>It is sometimes rumoured that Billy Shears is in fact <!--del_lnk--> William Shears Campbell, supposedly a replacement for <a href="../../wp/p/Paul_McCartney.htm" title="Paul McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> after his &quot;<!--del_lnk--> death&quot;.<p>Billy Shears was later mentioned in Ringo&#39;s 1973 hit &quot;I&#39;m the Greatest&quot;, written by <!--del_lnk--> John Lennon: &quot;Yes, my name is Billy Shears / You know it has been for so many years.&quot;<p>In the 1978 <!--del_lnk--> RSO movie <i><!--del_lnk--> Sgt.

      <p>Four additional songs were recorded during the Sgt. Pepper sessions but left off the album:<ol>
       <li>&quot;<!--del_lnk--> Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;: The first song recorded for the album, written by John Lennon in reference to a Salvation Army orphanage he lived near during his childhood in Liverpool. It was set aside, along with &quot;Penny Lane,&quot; for single release in early 1967, and did not see LP release until the U.S. version of <i><!--del_lnk--> Magical Mystery Tour</i>.<li>&quot;<!--del_lnk--> Penny Lane&quot;: A Paul McCartney song kept off the record in favour of release as the flip-side of &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever.&quot; Like Lennon&#39;s song, it was written about nostalgia in Liverpool and was not released on LP until the American <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i>.<li>&quot;<!--del_lnk--> Carnival of Light&quot;: A Paul McCartney sound collage reportedly lasting ten to fifteen minutes, the song was recorded for use at the psychedelic &quot;Carnival of Light Rave&quot; and evidently expanded on the use of <!--del_lnk--> tape loops as pioneered on &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Tomorrow Never Knows.&quot; Remarkably, the recording has never seen public release - even on bootlegs.<li>&quot;<!--del_lnk--> Only a Northern Song&quot;: A George Harrison-penned tune attacking the conventions of pop and the record industry. The song was featured in the 1968 film <i><!--del_lnk--> Yellow Submarine</i>, as well as the soundtrack album released the following year.</ol>

      <p>The LP was adapted as a stage musical in the mid-1970s, which would itself provide the partial basis for a widely-panned <!--del_lnk--> 1978 <!--del_lnk--> movie version, produced by <!--del_lnk--> Robert Stigwood and starring <!--del_lnk--> Peter Frampton as Billy Shears and <!--del_lnk--> The Bee Gees as the Hendersons, with an all-star supporting cast including <!--del_lnk--> George Burns and <!--del_lnk--> Steve Martin.

Despite the fact that The Bee Gees were among the hottest stars in music at the time, the movie was a critical and commercial flop.<p><a id="Sgt._Pepper_Knew_My_Father" name="Sgt._Pepper_Knew_My_Father"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Sgt.
