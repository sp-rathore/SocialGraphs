      <p>Since the time of the <!--del_lnk--> Greek philosopher <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> in the <!--del_lnk--> 4th century BC, there have been many attempts to understand and explain gravity. Aristotle believed that there was no <!--del_lnk--> effect without a <!--del_lnk--> cause, and therefore no <a href="../../wp/m/Motion_%2528physics%2529.htm" title="Motion (physics)">motion</a> without a <a href="../../wp/f/Force.htm" title="Force">force</a>. He hypothesized that everything tried to move towards their proper place in the crystalline <a href="../../wp/s/Sphere.htm" title="Sphere">spheres</a> of the heavens, and that <!--del_lnk--> physical bodies fell toward the centre of the <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a> in proportion to their <!--del_lnk--> weight. Another example of an attempted explanation is that of the <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">Indian</a> <!--del_lnk--> astronomer <!--del_lnk--> Brahmagupta who, in <a href="../../wp/a/Anno_Domini.htm" title="Anno Domini">AD</a>&nbsp;628 , wrote that &quot;bodies fall towards the earth as it is in the nature of the earth to attract bodies, just as it is in the nature of water to flow&quot;.<p>Modern work on gravitational theory began with the work of <a href="../../wp/g/Galileo_Galilei.htm" title="Galileo Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a> in the late <a href="../../wp/1/16th_century.htm" title="16th century">16th century</a> and early <a href="../../wp/1/17th_century.htm" title="17th century">17th century</a>. In his famous experiment dropping balls at the <!--del_lnk--> Tower of Pisa and later with careful measurements of balls rolling down <!--del_lnk--> inclines, Galileo showed that gravitation accelerates all objects at the same rate. This was a major departure from Aristotle&#39;s belief that heavier objects are accelerated faster. (Galileo correctly postulated air resistance as the reason that lighter objects appear to fall more slowly.) Galileo&#39;s work set the stage for the formulation of Newton&#39;s theory of gravity.<p><a id="Newton.27s_theory_of_gravitation" name="Newton.27s_theory_of_gravitation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Newton&#39;s theory of gravitation</span></h3>

      <p>In 1687, English mathematician <!--del_lnk--> Sir Isaac Newton published the famous <i><!--del_lnk--> Principia</i>, which hypothesizes the <!--del_lnk--> inverse-square law of universal gravitation. In his own words, &quot;I deduced that the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must be reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centers about which they revolve; and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the Moon in her orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the Earth; and found them answer pretty nearly.&quot;<p>Newton&#39;s theory enjoyed its greatest success when it was used to predict the existence of <a href="../../wp/n/Neptune.htm" title="Neptune">Neptune</a> based on motions of <a href="../../wp/u/Uranus.htm" title="Uranus">Uranus</a> that could not be accounted by the actions of the other planets. Calculations by <!--del_lnk--> John Couch Adams and <!--del_lnk--> Urbain Le Verrier both predicted the general position of the planet, and Le Verrier&#39;s calculations are what led <!--del_lnk--> Johann Gottfried Galle to the discovery of Neptune.<p>Ironically, it was another discrepancy in a planet&#39;s orbit that helped to doom Newton&#39;s theory. By the end of the 19th century, it was known that the orbit of <a href="../../wp/m/Mercury_%2528planet%2529.htm" title="Mercury (planet)">Mercury</a> could not be accounted for entirely under Newton&#39;s theory, and all searches for another perturbing body (such as a planet orbiting the <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">Sun</a> even closer than Mercury) have come up empty. This issue was resolved in 1915 by <a href="../../wp/a/Albert_Einstein.htm" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>&#39;s new <!--del_lnk--> general relativity theory; this theory accounted for the discrepancy in Mercury&#39;s orbit.<p>Although Newton&#39;s theory has been superseded, most modern non-relativistic gravitational calculations are based on Newton&#39;s work due its being a much simpler theory to work with.<p><a id="General_relativity" name="General_relativity"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">General relativity</span></h3>

      <p>In this theory Einstein proposed that <!--del_lnk--> inertial motion occurs when objects are in <!--del_lnk--> free-fall instead of when they are at <!--del_lnk--> rest with respect to a massive object such as the Earth (as is the case in classical mechanics). The problem is that in flat spacetimes such as those of classical mechanics and <a href="../../wp/s/Special_relativity.htm" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a>, there is no way that inertial observers can accelerate with respect to each other, as free-falling bodies can do as they are each accelerated towards the centre of a massive object.<p>To deal with this difficulty, Einstein proposed that <!--del_lnk--> spacetime is <!--del_lnk--> curved by the presence of matter, and that free-falling objects are following the <!--del_lnk--> geodesics of the spacetime. More specifically, Einstein discovered the <!--del_lnk--> field equations of general relativity, which relate the presence of matter and the curvature of spacetime. The Einstein field equations are a set of 10 <!--del_lnk--> simultaneous, <!--del_lnk--> non-linear, <a href="../../wp/d/Differential_equation.htm" title="Differential equation">differential equations</a> whose solutions give the components of the <!--del_lnk--> metric tensor of spacetime. Metric tensors describe the geometry of spacetime. The geodesic paths for objects in inertial motion are calculated from a metric tensor. Notable solutions of the Einstein field equations include:<ul>
       <li>The <!--del_lnk--> Schwarzschild solution, which describes spacetime surrounding a <!--del_lnk--> spherically symmetric non-<!--del_lnk--> rotating uncharged massive object. For compact enough objects, this solution generated a <a href="../../wp/b/Black_hole.htm" title="Black hole">black hole</a> with a central <!--del_lnk--> singularity. For radial distances from the centre which are much greater then the <!--del_lnk--> Schwarzschild radius, the accelerations predicted by the Schwarzschild solution are practically identical to those predicted by Newton&#39;s theory of gravity.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Reissner-Nordstr&ouml;m solution, in which the central object has an electrical charge. For charges with a <!--del_lnk--> geometrized length which are less than the geometrized length of the mass of the object, this solution produces black holes with two <!--del_lnk--> event horizons.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Kerr solution solution for rotating massive objects. This solution also produces black holes with multiple event horizons.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> cosmological <!--del_lnk--> Robertson-Walker solution, which predicts the expansion of the <a href="../../wp/u/Universe.htm" title="Universe">universe</a>.</ul>
      <p>General relativity has enjoyed much success because of how its predictions have been regularly confirmed. For example:<ul>
       <li>General relativity accounts for the anomalous <!--del_lnk--> precession of the planet <a href="../../wp/m/Mercury_%2528planet%2529.htm" title="Mercury (planet)">Mercury</a>.<li>The prediction that time runs slower at lower potentials has been confirmed by the <!--del_lnk--> Pound-Rebka experiment, the <!--del_lnk--> Hafele-Keating experiment, and the <!--del_lnk--> GPS.<li>The prediction of the deflection of light was first confirmed by <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Eddington in <!--del_lnk--> 1919, and has more recently been strongly confirmed through the use of a <!--del_lnk--> quasar which passes behind the <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">Sun</a> as seen from the <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a>. See also <!--del_lnk--> gravitational lensing.<li>The time delay of light passing close to a massive object was first identified by <!--del_lnk--> Shapiro in <!--del_lnk--> 1964 in interplanetary spacecraft signals.<li><!--del_lnk--> Gravitational radiation has been indirectly confirmed through studies of binary <!--del_lnk--> pulsars.<li>The expansion of the universe (predicted by the <!--del_lnk--> Robertson-Walker metric) was confirmed by <!--del_lnk--> Edwin Hubble in <!--del_lnk--> 1929.</ul>

      <p>Every planetary body, including the Earth, is surrounded by its own gravitational field, which exerts an attractive force on any object. This field is proportional to the body&#39;s mass and varies inversely with the square of distance from the body. The gravitational field is numerically equal to the acceleration of objects under its influence, and its value at the Earth&#39;s surface, denoted <i>g</i>, is approximately 9.80665&nbsp;m/s&sup2; or 32.17405&nbsp;ft/s&sup2;. This means that, ignoring air resistance, an object falling freely near the earth&#39;s surface increases in speed by 9.80665 m/s (around 22 mph) for each second of its descent. Thus, an object starting from rest will attain a speed of 9.80665 m/s (32.17405&nbsp;ft/s) after one second, 19.6133&nbsp;m/s (64.3481&nbsp;ft/s) after two seconds, and so on. According to Newton&#39;s 3rd Law, the Earth itself experiences an equal and opposite force to that acting on the falling object, meaning that the Earth also accelerates towards the object. However, because the mass of the Earth is huge, the measurable acceleration of the Earth by this same force is negligible.<p><a id="Equations_for_a_falling_body" name="Equations_for_a_falling_body"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Equations for a falling body</span></h3>

      <p>Under normal earth-bound conditions, when objects move owing to a constant gravitational force a set of kinematical and dynamical equations describe the resultant trajectories. For example, <!--del_lnk--> Newton&rsquo;s law of gravitation simplifies to <i>F = mg</i>, where m is the <!--del_lnk--> mass of the body. This assumption is reasonable for objects falling to <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">earth</a> over the relatively short vertical distances of our everyday experience, but is very much untrue over larger distances, such as spacecraft trajectories, because the acceleration far from the surface of the Earth will not in general be <b>g</b>. A further example is the expression that we use for the calculation of potential energy <i>P.E.</i> of a body at height <i>h</i> ( <i>P.E. = mgh</i>). This expression can be used only over small distances h from the Earth. Similarly the expression for the maximum height reached by a vertically projected body, <span class="texhtml"><i>h</i> = <i>u</i><sup>2</sup> / 2<i>g</i></span> is useful for small heights and small initial velocities only. In case of large initial velocities we have to use the principle of conservation of energy to find the maximum height reached.<p><a id="Gravity_and_astronomy" name="Gravity_and_astronomy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Gravity and astronomy</span></h3>

      <p>The discovery and application of Newton&#39;s law of gravity accounts for the detailed information we have about the planets in our solar system, the mass of the Sun, the distance to stars and even the theory of <!--del_lnk--> dark matter. Although we have not traveled to all the planets nor to the Sun, we know their mass. The mass is obtained by applying the laws of gravity to the measured characteristics of the orbit. In space an object maintains its <!--del_lnk--> orbit because of the force of gravity acting upon it. Planets orbit stars, stars orbit <!--del_lnk--> galactic centers, <a href="../../wp/g/Galaxy.htm" title="Galaxy">galaxies</a> orbit a centre of mass in clusters, and clusters orbit in <!--del_lnk--> superclusters.<p><a id="Gravity_versus_gravitation" name="Gravity_versus_gravitation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Gravity versus gravitation</span></h3>
      <p>It is important to note that <b>gravitation</b> is not <b>gravity</b>. Gravitation is the attractive influence that all objects exert on each other, while &quot;gravity&quot; specifically refers to a <a href="../../wp/f/Force.htm" title="Force">force</a> which all massive objects are theorized to exert on each other to cause gravitation. Although these terms are used interchangeably in everyday use, it is important to note that in theories other than Newton&#39;s, gravitation is caused by factors other than gravity. For example, in <!--del_lnk--> general relativity, gravitation is due to spacetime curvatures which causes <!--del_lnk--> inertially moving object to tend to accelerate towards each other. Another (but discredited) example is <!--del_lnk--> Le Sage&#39;s theory of gravitation, in which massive objects are effectively pushed towards each other.<p><a id="Applications" name="Applications"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Applications</span></h2>

      <p>A vast number of mechanical contrivances depend in some way on gravity for their operation. For example, a height difference can provide a useful pressure differential in a liquid, as in the case of an <!--del_lnk--> intravenous drip or a <!--del_lnk--> water tower. The gravitational potential energy of water can be used to generate <!--del_lnk--> hydroelectricity as well as to haul a tramcar up an incline, using a system of water tanks and pulleys; the <!--del_lnk--> Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway <!--del_lnk-->  in <!--del_lnk--> Devon, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> employs just such a system. Also, a weight hanging from a cable over a <!--del_lnk--> pulley provides a constant tension in the cable, including the part on the other side of the pulley to the weight.<p>Examples are numerous: For example molten <a href="../../wp/l/Lead.htm" title="Lead">lead</a>, when poured into the top of a <!--del_lnk--> shot tower, will <!--del_lnk--> coalesce into a rain of spherical lead shot, first separating into droplets, forming molten spheres, and finally freezing solid, undergoing many of the same effects as meteoritic <!--del_lnk--> tektites, which will cool into spherical, or near-spherical shapes in <!--del_lnk--> free-fall. Also, a <!--del_lnk--> fractionation <!--del_lnk--> tower can be used to manufacture some materials by separating out the material components based on their <!--del_lnk--> specific gravity. Weight-driven <!--del_lnk--> clocks are powered by gravitational potential energy, and pendulum clocks depend on gravity to regulate time. Artificial <!--del_lnk--> satellites are an application of gravitation which was mathematically described in Newton&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Principia</i>.<p>Gravity is used in geophysical exploration to investigate density contrasts in the subsurface of the Earth. Sensitive <!--del_lnk--> gravimeters use a complicated spring and mass system (in most cases) to measure the strength of the &quot;downward&quot; component of the gravitational force at a point. Measuring many stations over an area reveals anomalies measured in mGal or microGal (1 gal is 1 cm/s^2. Average gravitational acceleration is about 981 gal, or 981,000 mGal.). After corrections for the obliqueness of the Earth, elevation, terrain, instrument drift, etc., these anomalies reveal areas of higher or lower density in the <a href="../../wp/c/Crust_%2528geology%2529.htm" title="Crust (geology)">crust</a>. This method is used extensively in <a href="../../wp/m/Mineral.htm" title="Mineral">mineral</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> exploration, as well as <!--del_lnk--> time-lapse <!--del_lnk--> groundwater modeling.
