      <p><b>George VI</b> (Albert Frederick Arthur George Windsor) (<!--del_lnk--> 14 December <!--del_lnk--> 1895 - <!--del_lnk--> 6 February <!--del_lnk--> 1952) became the <!--del_lnk--> King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and <!--del_lnk--> Emperor of India, upon the unexpected abdication of his brother, <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_VIII_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Edward VIII of the United Kingdom">Edward VIII</a>. He reigned from <!--del_lnk--> 11 December <!--del_lnk--> 1936 until his death.

He was the third <!--del_lnk--> British monarch to use the name <!--del_lnk--> Windsor, the name his father had given to his branch of the German royal House of <!--del_lnk--> Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. He was king during the <!--del_lnk--> Second World War.<p>

      <p>George VI was born on <!--del_lnk--> 14 December <!--del_lnk--> 1895 at York Cottage, on the <a href="../../wp/s/Sandringham_House.htm" title="Sandringham House">Sandringham Estate</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/Norfolk.htm" title="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>. His father was Prince George, Duke of York (later <a href="../../wp/g/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="George V of the United Kingdom">King George V</a>), the second but eldest surviving son of The Prince <i>(later <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Edward VII of the United Kingdom">Edward VII</a>)</i> and Princess of Wales <i>(<!--del_lnk--> Alexandra of Denmark)</i>. His mother was the Duchess of York (later <!--del_lnk--> Queen Mary), the eldest daughter of <!--del_lnk--> Prince Francis, Duke of Teck and <!--del_lnk--> Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge. The day was the anniversary of the death of his great grandfather, <!--del_lnk--> Prince Albert, the Prince Consort. Uncertain of how Albert&#39;s widow <a href="../../wp/v/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a> would take this news, the Prince of Wales wrote to his son, Prince George, Duke of York, that the Queen had been &quot;rather distressed&quot;. Two days later, he wrote again: &quot;I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name <i>Albert</i> to her&quot;. This mollified the baby&#39;s great-grandmother, who wrote to the baby&#39;s mother, the Duchess of York: &quot;I am all impatience to see the <i>new</i> one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good.&quot; However, his maternal grandmother <!--del_lnk--> Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge did not like the first name the baby had been given, and she wrote prophetically that she hoped the last name &quot;may supplant the less favoured one&quot;.<p>He was baptised at St Mary Magdalene&#39;s Church near <a href="../../wp/s/Sandringham_House.htm" title="Sandringham House">Sandringham</a> three months later. His godparents were <a href="../../wp/v/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Empress Frederick, Grand Duke Friedrich Wilhelm of <!--del_lnk--> Mecklenburg-Strelitz, his wife the Grand Duchess (formerly <!--del_lnk--> Princess Augusta of Cambridge), the <!--del_lnk--> Crown Prince of Denmark, the <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Connaught, and <!--del_lnk--> Prince Adolphus of Teck, and the <!--del_lnk--> Duchess of Fife.<p>As the second son of his parents, he was thus fourth in line for the throne at birth. The Duchess of York had given birth to her eldest son <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_VIII_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Edward VIII of the United Kingdom">Edward</a>, who was third in line to the throne on <!--del_lnk--> 23 June <!--del_lnk--> 1894. Although George VI was the son and grandson of kings of the United Kingdom, his accession was the result of a play of circumstances. His father, the future George V, was the younger of the two sons of the then <!--del_lnk--> Prince of Wales, and was not expected ever to become king. However, his elder brother, <!--del_lnk--> Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence, who had been expected to eventually ascend the throne, died unexpectedly at a young age on <!--del_lnk--> 14 January <!--del_lnk--> 1892 of <a href="../../wp/p/Pneumonia.htm" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a> which had developed from <!--del_lnk--> influenza. It was this that resulted in the <!--del_lnk--> Duke of York later becoming King George V. George VI himself was the second son of his parents; and his own elder brother became king as <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_VIII_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Edward VIII of the United Kingdom">Edward VIII</a>, upon the death of their father George V. However, <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_VIII_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Edward VIII of the United Kingdom">Edward VIII</a> chose to abdicate his crown to marry a divorc&eacute;e; it was by reason of this unforeseeable abdication, unique in British history, that George VI came to the throne.<p><a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
      <p>As a child, the future George VI was known as Prince Albert (or &#39;Bertie&#39; to his family). He often suffered from ill health and was described as &quot;easily frightened and somewhat prone to tears&quot;. His parents, the Duke and Duchess of York, were generally removed from their children&#39;s upbringing, as was the norm in royal families of that era. Unfortunately this allowed the Royal nanny to have a dominating role in their young lives. The nanny doted over Albert&#39;s brother, Prince Edward, while neglecting Albert. Albert developed a severe <!--del_lnk--> stammer that lasted for many years as well as chronic stomach problems. He also suffered from knock knees, and to correct this he had to wear splints, which were extremely painful. He was also forced to write with his right hand although he was a natural <!--del_lnk--> left-hander.<p>Growing up, he was completely outshone by his elder brother, whose dominance was one of the most important influences on his early life. Prince Edward had, according to almost everyone who ever knew him, an extraordinary and magnetic charm. No one felt his charms more strongly than the younger members of his family. In the isolation of their lives, he was the most attractive person they ever knew. In childhood they followed his leadership, while as young men they ardently admired him.<p>As a great-grandson of <a href="../../wp/v/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a>, Albert was styled His Highness Prince Albert of York from birth. In <!--del_lnk--> 1898, Queen Victoria issued <!--del_lnk--> Letters Patent which granted the children of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales the style <i><!--del_lnk--> Royal Highness</i>. Thus Albert was then styled His Royal Highness Prince Albert of York.<table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="background: #FFFFFF; border: 1px solid #8888AA; border-collapse: collapse; float: right; font-size: 95%; margin: 0px 0px 8px 8px; padding: none; text-align: left; vertical-align: top; width: 240px;">

      <p>Queen Victoria died on <!--del_lnk--> 22 January <!--del_lnk--> 1901. The Prince of Wales succeeded her as King Edward VII. The Duke of York became the new Prince of Wales. Prince Edward was then second in line for the throne, and Prince Albert was now third.<p><a id="Military_career_and_education" name="Military_career_and_education"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Military career and education</span></h2>
      <p>From <!--del_lnk--> 1909 Albert attended the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Naval College, Osborne as a naval <!--del_lnk--> cadet. Despite coming bottom of the class in the final examination, Albert progressed to the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Naval College, Dartmouth in 1911. When Edward VII died on <!--del_lnk--> 6 May <!--del_lnk--> 1910 Albert&#39;s father became King George V. Prince Edward was created Prince of Wales on <!--del_lnk--> 2 June <!--del_lnk--> 1910 and Albert was now second in line to the throne.<p>Albert was commissioned as a <!--del_lnk--> midshipman on <!--del_lnk--> 15 September <!--del_lnk--> 1913, one year later he was serving in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> (<!--del_lnk--> 1914 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> 1918). He saw action aboard <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Collingwood</i> in the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Jutland.htm" title="Battle of Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> (<!--del_lnk--> 31 May &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> 1 June <!--del_lnk--> 1916). The battle was a tactical victory for the <!--del_lnk--> German Empire but a strategic victory for the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. In <!--del_lnk--> 1918 Albert transferred to the newly-created <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Air_Force.htm" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a> but did not see any further action in the war, largely through ill health caused by a duodenal ulcer. After the war, Albert studied history, economics and civics for a year at <a href="../../wp/t/Trinity_College%252C_Cambridge.htm" title="Trinity College, Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>, from October <!--del_lnk--> 1919.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1920 Prince Albert was created <!--del_lnk--> Duke of York, <!--del_lnk--> Earl of Inverness and <!--del_lnk--> Baron Killarney. He then began to take on royal duties, representing his father, King George V. Upon taking the throne, he became an Admiral of the Fleet in the Royal Navy.<p><a id="Marriage" name="Marriage"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Marriage</span></h2>
      <p>It was unusual, in a time when royals were expected to marry fellow royals, that Albert had a great deal of freedom in choosing a prospective wife. In 1920 he met Lady <!--del_lnk--> Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the youngest daughter of <!--del_lnk--> Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne and set his sights on marrying her. Although Lady Elizabeth was a direct descendent of King <!--del_lnk--> Robert I of Scotland and King <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_VII_of_England.htm" title="Henry VII of England">Henry VII of England</a>, she was in British law a <!--del_lnk--> commoner. She rejected his proposal twice and hesitated for nearly two years reportedly because she was reluctant to make the sacrifices necessary to become a member of the royal family. However, it has been alleged that she had intended to marry Edward, an engagement between them was even gossiped about in the papers, but historians assume that this is simply a case of misreporting. In the words of the <!--del_lnk--> Countess of Strathmore, Albert would be &quot;made or marred&quot; by his choice of wife and after a protracted courtship Elizabeth agreed to marry him. However, in an interview just before her marriage Lady Elizabeth denied having turned down Albert: &quot;Do you think I am the sort of person Bertie would have to ask twice?&quot; They were married on <!--del_lnk--> 26 April <!--del_lnk--> 1923 in <a href="../../wp/w/Westminster_Abbey.htm" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>. The newly-formed <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a> wished to record and broadcast the event on <a href="../../wp/r/Radio.htm" title="Radio">radio</a>, but the <!--del_lnk--> Chapter vetoed the idea (although the Dean, <!--del_lnk--> Herbert Edward Ryle was in favour). Lady Elizabeth was styled Her Royal Highness The Duchess of York after their marriage. At that time, Albert&#39;s marriage to a British commoner was considered a modernising gesture.<p>The Duke and Duchess of York had two children:<ul>
       <li><a href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Elizabeth II</a> (born <!--del_lnk--> 21 April <!--del_lnk--> 1926)<li><!--del_lnk--> Princess Margaret (<!--del_lnk--> 21 August <!--del_lnk--> 1930 &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> 9 February <!--del_lnk--> 2002).</ul>
      <p>The Duke and Duchess lived a relatively sheltered life at their <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> residence, 145 <!--del_lnk--> Piccadilly; one of the few stirs was when the Canadian Prime Minister, <!--del_lnk--> R. B. Bennett considered the Duke for <!--del_lnk--> Governor General of Canada in <!--del_lnk--> 1931 &mdash; a proposal which the King rejected on the advice of his ministers.<p><a id="Reluctant_king" name="Reluctant_king"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Reluctant king</span></h2>

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> January 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1936, King George V died and Prince Edward ascended the throne as Edward VIII. As he had no children, Albert was now the <!--del_lnk--> heir presumptive to the throne until the unmarried Edward VIII had any legitimate children, or died. George V had had severe reservations about Edward, saying, &quot;I pray God that my eldest son will never marry and that nothing will come between Bertie and Lilibet and the throne.&quot; Less than a year later on <!--del_lnk--> December 11, <!--del_lnk--> 1936, Edward VIII abdicated the throne in order to marry his love, <!--del_lnk--> Wallis Warfield Simpson. Thus Prince Albert, Duke of York, was now king, a position he was reluctant to accept. The day before the abdication, he went to London to see his mother, <!--del_lnk--> Queen Mary. He wrote in his diary, &quot;When I told her what had happened, I broke down and sobbed like a child.&quot;<p>It is alleged that there was brief speculation as to the desirability of bypassing him and his brother, <!--del_lnk--> Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, in favour of the younger brother <!--del_lnk--> Prince George, Duke of Kent. This seems to have been suggested on the grounds that Prince George was the only brother with, at that time, a son.<p>Albert assumed the style and title King George VI to emphasise continuity with his father and restore confidence in the monarchy. His first act was to confer upon his brother the title HRH The Duke of Windsor.

      <p>The beginning of George VI&#39;s reign was taken up by questions surrounding his predecessor and brother, whose titles, style and position were uncertain. He had been introduced as &quot;His Royal Highness Prince Edward&quot; for the Abdication broadcast but George VI felt that by abdicating and renouncing the succession Edward had lost the right to bear Royal titles, including &quot;Royal Highness&quot;. In settling the issue, George VI created Edward the <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Windsor, and the Letters Patent creating the dukedom entitled Edward to be styled His Royal Highness, but prevented any wife and children from being similarly styled. George VI was also forced to buy the royal houses of <!--del_lnk--> Balmoral Castle and <a href="../../wp/s/Sandringham_House.htm" title="Sandringham House">Sandringham House</a> from Prince Edward, as these were private properties and did not pass to George VI on his accession.<p>George VI&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> coronation took place on <!--del_lnk--> 12 May <!--del_lnk--> 1937&mdash;the intended date of Edward&#39;s coronation. In a break with tradition, Queen Mary attended the coronation as a show of support for her son. There was no <!--del_lnk--> durbar held in <a href="../../wp/d/Delhi.htm" title="Delhi">Delhi</a> for George VI, as had occurred for his father, as the cost would have been a burden to the government of India in the depths of the Depression. Rising Indian nationalism made the welcome which the royal couple would have received likely to be muted at best, and a prolonged absence from Britain would have been undesirable in the tense period before <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> without the strategic advantages of the North American tour which in the event was undertaken in 1939.<p>The growing likelihood of war erupting in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> would dominate the reign of King George VI. Initially the King and Queen took an <!--del_lnk--> appeasement stance against <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, supporting the policy of <!--del_lnk--> Neville Chamberlain. The King and Queen greeted Chamberlain on his return from negotiating the <!--del_lnk--> Munich Agreement in <!--del_lnk--> 1938, and invited him to appear on the balcony of <a href="../../wp/b/Buckingham_Palace.htm" title="Buckingham Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> with them, sparking anger among anti-appeasement MPs including <a href="../../wp/w/Winston_Churchill.htm" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>.<p>In 1939, the King and Queen undertook an extensive tour of <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a> ,from which they made a shorter visit to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States of America">United States of America</a>. George was the first reigning monarch to visit either of these countries. The royal couple were accompanied throughout the trip to the United States by Canadian Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> William Lyon Mackenzie King, and not a British minister, meaning they were present as <!--del_lnk--> King and Queen of Canada, a measure intended to placate the strong isolationist tendencies among the North American public vis-&agrave;-vis the developing tensions in Europe. Although the aim of the tour was nevertheless mainly political, to shore up Atlantic support for Britain in any upcoming war, the King and Queen were extremely enthusiastically received by the Canadian public and the spectre of Edward VIII&#39;s charisma was comprehensively dispelled. They were also warmly received by the American people, visiting the <!--del_lnk--> 1939 New York World&#39;s Fair and staying at the <!--del_lnk--> White House with <a href="../../wp/p/President_of_the_United_States.htm" title="President of the United States">President</a> <a href="../../wp/f/Franklin_D._Roosevelt.htm" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> and at his private estate at Hyde Park, New York.<p>When war broke out in <!--del_lnk--> 1939, George VI and his wife resolved to stay in London and not flee to Canada, as had been suggested. The King and Queen officially stayed in Buckingham Palace throughout the war, although they often escaped to <a href="../../wp/w/Windsor_Castle.htm" title="Windsor Castle">Windsor Castle</a> to avoid bombing raids. George VI and Queen Elizabeth narrowly avoided death when two German bombs exploded in a courtyard at Buckingham Palace.<p>Throughout the war, the King and Queen provided morale-boosting visits throughout the UK, visiting bomb sites and munition factories. The Royal Family adhered to rationing restrictions in the country at the time, indeed, Eleanor Roosevelt during her stay at Buckingham Palace during the war reported expressly on the rationed food served in the Palace and the limited bathwater that was permitted.<p>It has been suggested that a strong bond of friendship was forged between the King and Queen and President and Mrs Roosevelt during the 1939 Royal Tour, which had major significance in the relations between the United States and Great Britain through the war years. But there have never been credible suggestions that the King took any strategic role in the War; his frequent letters to the President were mostly unanswered and it was, of course Roosevelt&#39;s relationship with Churchill that was critical. <!--del_lnk--> Eleanor Roosevelt took a wry view of the utility of kings and queens and the substance of George and Elizabeth (&quot;a little self-consciously regal,&quot; was her verdict on Elizabeth).<p><a id="Illness_and_death" name="Illness_and_death"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Illness and death</span></h2>

      <p>The war had taken its toll on the King&#39;s health. This was exacerbated by his heavy smoking and subsequent development of <a href="../../wp/l/Lung_cancer.htm" title="Lung cancer">lung cancer</a>. Increasingly his daughter Princess Elizabeth, the heiress presumptive to the throne, would take on more of the royal duties as her father&#39;s health deteriorated. In the autumn of <!--del_lnk--> 1951 a cancerous lung was removed.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 6 February <!--del_lnk--> 1952, George VI died in his sleep at Sandringham House in Norfolk, at the age of 56. He was the only British monarch of modern times whose death was not observed and whose precise moment of death was not recorded.
