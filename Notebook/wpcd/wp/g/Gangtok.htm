      <p>Not much is known about the early history of Gangtok. The earliest records date from the construction of the <!--del_lnk--> hermitic Gangtok monastery in 1716. Gangtok remained a small hamlet until the construction of the <!--del_lnk--> Enchey Monastery in 1840 made it a pilgrimage centre. After the <!--del_lnk--> defeat of the Tibetans by the British, Gangtok became a major stopover in the trade between Tibet and British India at the end of the 19th century. Most of the roads and the <!--del_lnk--> telegraph in the area were built during this time.<p>In 1894, <!--del_lnk--> Thutob Namgyal, the Sikkimese monarch under British rule, shifted the capital from <!--del_lnk--> Tumlong to Gangtok, increasing its importance. A new grand palace along with other state buildings was built in the new capital. Following <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_independence_movement.htm" title="Indian independence movement">India&#39;s independence</a> in 1947, Sikkim became a <!--del_lnk--> nation-state with Gangtok as its capital. Sikkim became a <!--del_lnk--> suzerain of India, with the condition that it would retain its independence, by the treaty signed between the <!--del_lnk--> Chogyal and the then <!--del_lnk--> Indian Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> Jawaharlal Nehru. Trade between India and Tibet continued to flourish through the <!--del_lnk--> Nathula and <!--del_lnk--> Jelepla passes, offshoots of the ancient <!--del_lnk--> Silk Route near Gangtok. These border passes were sealed after the <!--del_lnk--> Sino-Indian War in 1962, which deprived Gangtok of its trading business. In 1975, the monarchy was abrogated and Sikkim became India&#39;s twenty-second state, with Gangtok as its capital .<div class="center">

      <p>Gangtok is located at <span class="plainlinksneverexpand"><!--del_lnk--> 27.33&deg;&nbsp;N 88.62&deg;&nbsp;E</span>. It has an average elevation of 1437&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> metres (4714&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> feet). It is situated in the lower <a href="../../wp/h/Himalayas.htm" title="Himalaya">Himalayas</a> at an altitude of 1,780&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> metres (5,480&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> feet), in southeast Sikkim. In addition to being the state capital, it is also the headquarters of the <!--del_lnk--> East Sikkim district. The town lies on one side of a hill, with &quot;The Ridge&quot;, a promenade housing the <!--del_lnk--> governor&#39;s residence at one end and the palace, situated at an altitude of about 6,000&nbsp;feet (1,828&nbsp;m), at the other. The city overlooks the <!--del_lnk--> Ranikhola in the valley below. Most of the roads are steep, with the buildings built on compacted ground alongside them. The peaks of the snow-clad Himalayan range, including the world&#39;s third tallest peak, the <!--del_lnk--> Kanchenjunga, can be seen to the east of the city.<p>Because of its elevation and sheltered environment, Gangtok enjoys a mild, <a href="../../wp/t/Temperate.htm" title="Temperate">temperate</a> climate all year round. Like most Himalayan towns, Gangtok has five seasons: <a href="../../wp/s/Summer.htm" title="Summer">summer</a>, <!--del_lnk--> monsoons, <a href="../../wp/a/Autumn.htm" title="Autumn">autumn</a>, <a href="../../wp/w/Winter.htm" title="Winter">winter</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Spring_%2528season%2529.htm" title="Spring (season)">spring</a>. Temperatures range from a high of 25&nbsp;&deg;<!--del_lnk--> C (77&deg;&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> F) in summer to a low of about 3&nbsp;&deg;C (37&nbsp;&deg;F) in winter. <a href="../../wp/s/Snow.htm" title="Snow">Snowfall</a> is rare, and in recent times Gangtok has received snow only in 1990, 2004 and 2005. Temperatures below <!--del_lnk--> freezing are also rare. During this season the weather can be sporadic, and change abruptly from bright sunshine and clear skies to heavy rain within a couple of hours.<p>During spring and autumn the weather is generally sunny and mild. Owing to its elevation, Gangtok is often enveloped in <!--del_lnk--> fog during the monsoon and winter months. Between June and September (the monsoon months), the rain often causes <!--del_lnk--> landslides in the area. The lower Himalayas in general are composed of labile rock formations and therefore prone to landslides even in dry seasons. These landslides can result in the town being cut off from other parts of Sikkim.<p>Flora around Gangtok includes temperate, <!--del_lnk--> deciduous forests of <!--del_lnk--> poplar, <!--del_lnk--> birch, <!--del_lnk--> oak, and <!--del_lnk--> elm, as well as <!--del_lnk--> evergreen, <!--del_lnk--> coniferous trees of the <!--del_lnk--> wet alpine. Densely forested regions of these evergreens lie just around the town. A wide variety of rare <!--del_lnk--> orchids are often featured in flower shows around the city. <a href="../../wp/s/Sunflower.htm" title="Sunflower">Sunflower</a>, <!--del_lnk--> marigold, <!--del_lnk--> poinsettia, and other flowers bloom in November and December.<p><!--del_lnk--> Bamboo grows in abundance along the slopes of Gangtok, providing a perennial source of spring water, which originates from the roots of the trees. In the lower reaches of the town, the vegetation graduates from alpine to <!--del_lnk--> subtropical and temperate deciduous.<p><a id="Localities" name="Localities"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Localities</span></h2>
      <p>The areas which make up Gangtok though in no particular order are&nbsp;:<dl>
       <dt>Palzor Stadium Road</dl>
      <p>Also called P.S. Road, it joins the low lying localities and suburbs with the main town. Palzor Stadium is one of its major stops. As it nears its end, it is flanked by many hotels and also the stop of the SNT or the Sikkim National Transport Buses. Some major hotels include Hotel Tibet, Hotel Mayur, Hotel Mt. Jopuno among others. The top floor of Hotel Tibet is the residence of The <!--del_lnk--> Dalai Lama when he visits Gangtok. There is also a Taxi stand.<dl>
       <dt>Mahtama Gandhi Road</dl>
      <p>Also called M.G. Road, it is the main commercial district of Gangtok. There are many shops run by members of the <!--del_lnk--> Marwari community or migrant Biharis.<dl>
       <dt>Lal Bazar</dl>
      <p>This is the main market of the town and occurs at the end of M.G. Road. Farmers from all over the state and adjoining areas including Nepal and Bhutan come to the market to sell their produce every weekend.<dl>
       <dt>Development Area</dl>
      <p>This area is fairly remote and is situated at a higher altitude and has been identified by the Govt. for future expansion. It is also called Zero Point. The State Library is in this area.<p>Gangtok&#39;s highest lodge is the Siniolchu Lodge located near the Enchey Monastery. It is also close to the state&#39;s main TV transmission tower.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>
      <p>Sikkim&#39;s mountainous terrain results in the lack of train or air links, limiting the area&#39;s potential for rapid industrial development. The government is the largest employer in the city, both directly and as contractors. The <!--del_lnk--> Sikkim Police also employs a large number of people to patrol the streets. The tourism industry provides employment to many people, with jobs ranging from drivers, shopkeepers to hoteliers. Gangtok receives around 200,000 tourists and earns <!--del_lnk--> Rs.&nbsp;42 crores (9.7 million <!--del_lnk--> US $ annually. Its economy does not have a manufacturing base, but <!--del_lnk--> cottage industries such as <a href="../../wp/w/Watch.htm" title="Watch">watch</a>-making, <!--del_lnk--> country-made alcohol and handicrafts are present. Among the handicrafts are the handmade paper industry made from various vegetable fibers or cotton rags. The main market in Gangtok provides many of the state&#39;s rural residents a place to offer their produce during the harvest seasons. The majority of the private business community is made up of Marwaris and Biharis.<p>As Sikkim is a frontier state, the <!--del_lnk--> Indian army maintains a large presence in the vicinity of Gangtok. This leads to a large population of semi-permanent residents who bring money into the local economy. The government of Sikkim also earns a lot of revenue from the numerous <i><!--del_lnk--> Playwin</i> lottery centres (through <!--del_lnk--> online gambling) in the city. With the proposed opening of the <!--del_lnk--> Nathula Pass by the Union government in April 2006, Gangtok would benefit as a result of trade between India and Tibet. The Nathula Pass, located about fifty kilometres from Gangtok, used to be the primary route of the <!--del_lnk--> wool, <!--del_lnk--> fur and <!--del_lnk--> spice trade with Tibet until 1962, when the border was closed.<p><a id="Civic_governance" name="Civic_governance"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Civic governance</span></h2>
      <p>The civic infrastructure of Gangtok is overseen by the local municipal corporation whose councillors are directly elected by the people. The rural roads around Gangtok however, are maintained by the <!--del_lnk--> Border Roads Organisation, which is a part of the <!--del_lnk--> Indian army. As the headquarters of <!--del_lnk--> East Sikkim district, Gangtok also houses the offices of the <!--del_lnk--> district collector, an administrator appointed by the Union Government of India. Gangtok is also home to the <!--del_lnk--> Sikkim High Court, which is India&#39;s smallest <!--del_lnk--> High Court in terms of area and population of jurisdiction.<p>Gangtok does not have its own police commissionerate like other cities in India. Instead, it comes under the jurisdiction of the state police, which is headed by a <!--del_lnk--> Director General of Police, although an <!--del_lnk--> Inspector General of Police oversees the town. Sikkim is known for its very low crime rate and, though official statistics for urban crime are not available, Gangtok can indirectly be said to have one of the lowest crime statistics in India.<p><a id="Infrastructure" name="Infrastructure"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Infrastructure</span></h2>
      <p>Due to the abundance of natural springs in the vicinity, Gangtok does not suffer from a water shortage. It also has an almost uninterrupted <a href="../../wp/e/Electricity.htm" title="Electricity">electricity</a> supply due to Sikkim&#39;s numerous <!--del_lnk--> hydroelectric power stations, and has the state&#39;s only <!--del_lnk--> cardiac hospital. Only 30% of Gangtok has a <!--del_lnk--> sewerage network and it is estimated that Rs.&nbsp;28 crore (6.4 million US$) is required to upgrade the system. Though all buildings are supposed to be at a height of 15&nbsp;metres (50&nbsp;feet), this is openly flouted. The city has enforced a ban on the use of plastic bags, in an effort to maintain its harmony with nature. Most shops and businesses pack their goods in paper bags.<p>Though Gangtok has many good schools, such as the Paljor Namgyal Girls School, it only has a single college offering a degree in arts and commerce . Gangtok does not have a <a href="../../wp/u/University.htm" title="University">university</a> within the city limits. However, just 8 km from here is the headquarters of the <!--del_lnk--> Sikkim Manipal University. There are other institutions offering <!--del_lnk--> diplomas in Buddhist literature, catering and other non-mainstream fields. As a result, many of its residents migrate to nearby <!--del_lnk--> Siliguri or <a href="../../wp/k/Kolkata.htm" title="Kolkata">Kolkata</a> in pursuit of higher education. This problem has been compounded with the growing unemployment in the state, due to the lack of large-scale industries.<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transport</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Taxis are the most widely available <!--del_lnk--> public transport within Gangtok. Most of Gangtok&#39;s residents stay within a few kilometres of the town centre and many have their own vehicles. Those residing some distance away generally make use of share-jeeps, a kind of public taxis. It is the only capital city in India to have a <!--del_lnk--> cable car, which was initially constructed for the elected <!--del_lnk--> MLA&#39;s to reach the state Assembly. It is now open to the public, though the distance covered is less than a kilometre (0.6&nbsp;miles).<p>Gangtok is connected to the rest of India by an all-weather metalled highway, NH-31A, which links Gangtok to <!--del_lnk--> Siliguri, located 114&nbsp;km (71&nbsp;miles) away in the neighbouring state of <!--del_lnk--> West Bengal. The highway also provides a link to the neighbouring hill station towns of <!--del_lnk--> Darjeeling and <!--del_lnk--> Kalimpong, which are also the nearest urban areas. A regular jeep, van, and bus service links the towns to Gangtok and is the only route to the city from the rest of India. The nearest railhead connected to the rest of India is the station of <!--del_lnk--> New Jalpaiguri, a suburb of Siliguri, situated 124&nbsp;km (77&nbsp;miles) away from Gangtok. The nearest <!--del_lnk--> airport is <!--del_lnk--> Bagdogra Airport, 16&nbsp;km (10&nbsp;miles) from Siliguri. Although Gangtok does not have an airport, it is linked to Bagdogra airport, near Siliguri, via a regular <!--del_lnk--> helicopter service, the Sikkim Helicopter Service. A new airport, which would be the state&#39;s first, is slated to be opened by mid-2005.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>
      <p>Ethnic <a href="../../wp/n/Nepal.htm" title="Nepal">Nepalis</a>, who settled in the region during British rule, comprise the majority of Gangtok&#39;s fifty thousand residents. <!--del_lnk--> Lepchas, native to the land, and <!--del_lnk--> Bhutias also constitute a sizable portion of the populace. Additionally, a large number of <!--del_lnk--> Tibetans have immigrated to the town in recent years. Immigrant resident communities not native to the region include the <!--del_lnk--> Marwaris, who own most of the shops; the <!--del_lnk--> Biharis, who are employed in mostly <!--del_lnk--> blue collar jobs and the <!--del_lnk--> Bengalis.<p><a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Muslims are the two largest religions in Gangtok. Gangtok also has a sizable <!--del_lnk--> Christian population, most of which is of Lepcha origin, who converted after <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> missionaries started preaching here in the late 19th century. The town has remained secular, having never witnessed any sort of inter-religious strife in its history. A <a href="../../wp/m/Mosque.htm" title="Mosque">mosque</a> in downtown Gangtok also serves the small <!--del_lnk--> Muslim minority.<p><!--del_lnk--> Nepali is the most widely spoken language in Gangtok. <!--del_lnk--> English and <a href="../../wp/h/Hindi.htm" title="Hindi">Hindi</a> are also widely spoken and understood in most of Sikkim, particularly in Gangtok. Other languages spoken in Gangtok include Bhutia (Sikkimese), Tibetan and Lepcha.<p>As of the 2001 <!--del_lnk--> census of India<sup id="fn_GRIndia_back"><!--del_lnk--> GRIndia</sup>, Gangtok had a population of 29,162. Males constitute 54% of the population and females 46%. Gangtok has an average literacy rate of 79%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 82%, and female literacy is 75%.

During the Losar, the Tibetan New Year in mid-December, most government offices and tourist centres are closed for a week. In recent times, <!--del_lnk--> Christmas has also been celebrated in Gangtok.<p>Residents of Sikkim are music lovers and it is common to hear <!--del_lnk--> Western rock music being played in homes and restaurants. <!--del_lnk--> Hindi pop songs are also common. Indigenous Nepali rock, music suffused with a western rock beat and Nepali lyrics, is also particularly popular.<p><a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Football (soccer)">Football (soccer)</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Cricket.htm" title="Cricket">cricket</a> are the two most popular sports.

      <p>A centre of Buddhist learning and culture, Gangtok&#39;s most famous Buddhist institutions are the <!--del_lnk--> Enchey monastery, the Do-drul Chorten stupa complex and the <!--del_lnk--> Rumtek Monastery. The Enchey monastery is the city&#39;s oldest monastery and is the seat of the <!--del_lnk--> Nyingma order. The two-hundred year old baroque monastery houses images of gods, goddesses, and other religious artifacts. In the month of January, the <i>Chaam</i>, or masked dance, is performed with great fanfare. The Dro-dul Chorten is a stupa which was constructed in 1945 by Trulshi Rimpoch&eacute;, head of the Nyingma order of <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan Buddhism. Inside this stupa are complete set of relics, holy books, and <i>mantras</i>. Surrounding the edifice are 108 <i>Mani Lhakor</i>, or prayer wheels. The complex also houses a religious school.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Rumtek Monastery on the outskirts of the town is one of Buddhism&#39;s most sacred monasteries. The monastery is the seat of the <!--del_lnk--> Kagyu order, one of the major Tibetan sects, and houses some of the world&#39;s most sacred and rare <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan Buddhist scriptures and religious objects in its reliquary. Constructed in the 1960s, the building is modelled after a similar monastery in <a href="../../wp/l/Lhasa.htm" title="Lhasa">Lhasa</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Tibet.htm" title="Tibet">Tibet</a>.
