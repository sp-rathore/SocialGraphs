      <p><b>Geography</b> (from the <!--del_lnk--> Greek words <b><!--del_lnk--> Ge</b> (<i>&gamma;&eta;</i>) or <b>Gaea</b> (<i>&gamma;&alpha;&iota;&alpha;</i>), both meaning <b>&quot;Earth&quot;</b>, and <b>graphein</b> (<i>&gamma;&rho;&alpha;&phi;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;</i>) meaning <b>&quot;to describe&quot;</b> or &quot;to write&quot;<i>or &quot;to map&quot;)</i> is the study of the Earth&#39;s features and of the distribution of life on the earth, including human life and the effects of human activity. So, literally, the translation would be &quot;To describe Earth&quot;.There are at least four traditional views on geography among geographers where emphasis is on the <!--del_lnk--> spatial analysis of natural and human phenomena (geography as a study of distribution), on area studies (places and regions), on man-land relationships, and earth science (study of the earth, its waters, and the atmosphere.)<p>

      <p>Traditionally, geography as well as <!--del_lnk--> geographers has been viewed as the same as <!--del_lnk--> cartography and people who study place names. Although many geographers are trained in <!--del_lnk--> toponymy and cartography, this is not their main preoccupation. Geographers study the <!--del_lnk--> spatial and <!--del_lnk--> temporal distribution of phenomena, processes and feature as well as the interaction of <a href="../../wp/h/Human.htm" title="Humans">humans</a> and their <!--del_lnk--> environment. As space and place affect a variety of topics such as economics, health, climate, plants and animals, geography is highly interdisciplinary.<table align="center" cellpadding="10" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>Geography as a discipline can be split broadly into two main sub fields: <!--del_lnk--> human geography and <!--del_lnk--> physical geography. The former focuses largely on the built environment and how space is created, viewed and managed by humans as well as the influence humans have on the space they occupy. The latter examines the natural environment and how the <a href="../../wp/c/Climate.htm" title="Climate">climate</a>, <a href="../../wp/v/Vegetation.htm" title="Vegetation">vegetation</a> &amp; life, <a href="../../wp/s/Soil.htm" title="Soil">soil</a>, <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a> and <!--del_lnk--> landforms and produced and interact. As a result of the two subfields using different approaches a third field has emerged, which is <!--del_lnk--> environmental geography. Environmental geography combines physical and human geography and looks at the interactions between the environment and humans.<p><a id="History_of_geography" name="History_of_geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History of geography</span></h2>

      <p>The foundations of geography can be traced to the ancient cultures, such as the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Greeks</a>, who were the first to explore geography as both <a href="../../wp/a/Art.htm" title="Art">art</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">science</a>, whether through <!--del_lnk--> Cartography, <!--del_lnk--> Philosophy, and <!--del_lnk--> Literature, or through <!--del_lnk--> Mathematics. There is some debate about who was the first person to assert that the Earth is spherical in shape, with the credit going either to <!--del_lnk--> Parmenides or <a href="../../wp/p/Pythagoras.htm" title="Pythagoras">Pythagoras</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Anaxagoras was able to demonstrate that the profile of the Earth was circular by explaining <!--del_lnk--> eclipses. However he still believed that the Earth was a flat disk, as did many of his contemporaries. One of the first estimates of the radius of the Earth was made by <!--del_lnk--> Eratosthenes.<p>The first rigorous system of latitude and longitude lines is credited to <!--del_lnk--> Hipparchus. He employed a <!--del_lnk--> sexagesimal system that was derived from <!--del_lnk--> Babylonian mathematics. The parallels and meridians were sub-divided into 360&deg;, with each degree further subdivided 60&prime; (minutes). To measure the longitude at different location on Earth, he suggested using eclipses to determine the relative difference in time. The extensive mapping by the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Romans</a> as they explored new lands would later provide a high level of information for <a href="../../wp/p/Ptolemy.htm" title="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> to construct detailed <!--del_lnk--> atlases. He extended the work of Hipparchus, using a grid system on his maps and adopting a length of 56.5 <!--del_lnk--> miles for a degree.<p>During the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, the fall of the <!--del_lnk--> Roman empire led to a shift in the evolution of geography from <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> to the <!--del_lnk--> Islamic world. Scholars such as <!--del_lnk--> Idrisi (produced detailed maps), <!--del_lnk--> Ibn Batutta, and <!--del_lnk--> Ibn Khaldun provided detailed accounts of their <!--del_lnk--> Hajj. Further, Islamic scholars translated and inteperated the earlier works of the Romans and Greeks and established the <!--del_lnk--> House of Wisdom in Baghdad for this purpose.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Age of discovery during the <a href="../../wp/1/16th_century.htm" title="16th century">16th</a> and <a href="../../wp/1/17th_century.htm" title="17th century">17th centuries</a> where many new lands were discovered and accounts by explorers such as <a href="../../wp/c/Christopher_Columbus.htm" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Marco_Polo.htm" title="Marco Polo">Marco Polo</a> and <a href="../../wp/j/James_Cook.htm" title="James Cook">James Cook</a> , revived a desire for both accurate geographic detail, and more solid theoretical foundations.<p>The <a href="../../wp/1/18th_century.htm" title="18th century">18th</a> and <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th centuries</a> were the times when geography became recognized as a discrete academic discipline and became part of a typical <a href="../../wp/u/University.htm" title="University">university</a> curriculum in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> (especially <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin.htm" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>). The development of many geographic societies also occurred during the 19th century with the foundations of the <!--del_lnk--> Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de G&eacute;ographie in <!--del_lnk--> 1821, the <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Geographical_Society.htm" title="Royal Geographical Society">Royal Geographical Society</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1830, <!--del_lnk--> Russian Geographical Society in <!--del_lnk--> 1845 and the <!--del_lnk--> National Geographic Society in<!--del_lnk--> 1888. The influence of <a href="../../wp/i/Immanuel_Kant.htm" title="Immanuel Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Alexander von Humbolt, <!--del_lnk--> Carl Ritter and <!--del_lnk--> Paul Vidal de la Blache can be seen as a major turning point in geography from a philosophy to an academic subject.<p>Over the past two centuries the advancements in technology such as computers, has led to the development of <!--del_lnk--> geomatics and new practices such as participant observation and geostatistics being incorporated into geography&#39;s portofilio of tools. In the West during the <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a>, the discipline of geography went through four major phases: <!--del_lnk--> environmental determinism, <!--del_lnk--> regional geography, the <!--del_lnk--> quantitative revolution, and <!--del_lnk--> critical geography.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Physical geography (or physiogeography) focuses on geography as an <!--del_lnk--> Earth science. It aims to understand the physical features of the Earth, its <!--del_lnk--> lithosphere, <!--del_lnk--> hydrosphere, <a href="../../wp/e/Earth%2527s_atmosphere.htm" title="Earth&#39;s atmosphere">atmosphere</a>, <!--del_lnk--> pedosphere and global <!--del_lnk--> flora and <!--del_lnk--> fauna patterns (<a href="../../wp/b/Biosphere.htm" title="Biosphere">biosphere</a>).

      <p>* Distinction between these fields of study have become increasingly blurred over time and the above list should not be considered definitive.<p><a id="Socio-environmental_geography" name="Socio-environmental_geography"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Socio-environmental geography</span></h3>
      <p>During the time of environmental determinism, geography was defined not as the study of spatial relationships, but as the study of how humans and the natural environment interact. Though environmental determinism has lost support, there remains a strong tradition of geographers addressing the relationships between people and nature. There are two main subfields of socio-environmental geography:<ul>
       <li><i>Cultural and Political ecology</i> (CAPE): Cultural ecology grew out of the work of <!--del_lnk--> Carl Sauer in geography and a similar school of thought in <a href="../../wp/a/Anthropology.htm" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a>. It examined how human societies adapt themselves to the natural environment. <!--del_lnk--> Sustainability science has been one important outgrowth of this tradition. Political ecology arose when some geographers used aspects of <!--del_lnk--> critical geography to look at relations of power and how they affect people&#39;s use of the environment. For example, an influential study by <!--del_lnk--> Michael Watts argued that famines in the <!--del_lnk--> Sahel are caused by the changes in the region&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> political and <!--del_lnk--> economic system as a result of <!--del_lnk--> colonialism and the spread of <a href="../../wp/c/Capitalism.htm" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a>.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><i>Risk-hazards research</i>: Research on <!--del_lnk--> hazards began with the work of geographer <!--del_lnk--> Gilbert F. White, who sought to understand why people live in disaster-prone <!--del_lnk--> floodplains. Since then, the hazards field has expanded to become a multidisciplinary field examining both <!--del_lnk--> natural hazards (such as <a href="../../wp/e/Earthquake.htm" title="Earthquake">earthquakes</a>) as well as <!--del_lnk--> technological hazards (such as <!--del_lnk--> nuclear reactor meltdowns). Geographers studying hazards are interested in both the dynamics of the hazard event and how people and societies deal with it. (<i>See main article: <!--del_lnk--> Disaster management</i>)</ul>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Urban planning, <!--del_lnk--> regional planning and <!--del_lnk--> spatial planning use the science of geography to assist in determining how to develop (or not develop) the land to meet particular criteria, such as safety, beauty, economic opportunities, the preservation of the built or natural heritage, and so on. The planning of towns, cities and rural areas may be seen as applied geography.<p><a id="Regional_science" name="Regional_science"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Regional science</span></h4>
      <p>In the <!--del_lnk--> 1950s the <!--del_lnk--> regional science movement led by Walter Isard arose, to provide a more quantitative and analytical base to geographical questions, in contrast to the descriptive tendencies of traditional geography programs. Regional science comprises the body of knowledge in which the spatial dimension plays a fundamental role, such as <!--del_lnk--> regional economics, <!--del_lnk--> resource management, <!--del_lnk--> location theory, <!--del_lnk--> urban and <!--del_lnk--> regional planning, <a href="../../wp/t/Transport.htm" title="Transport">transport</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Communication.htm" title="Communication">communication</a>, <!--del_lnk--> human geography, population distribution, <!--del_lnk--> landscape ecology, and environmental quality.<p><a id="Interplanetary_Sciences" name="Interplanetary_Sciences"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Interplanetary Sciences</span></h4>
      <p>While the discipline of geography is normally concerned with the <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a>, the term can also be informally used to describe the study of other worlds, such as the <!--del_lnk--> planets of the <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_System.htm" title="Solar system">solar system</a>, and even beyond. The study of systems larger than the earth itself usually forms part of <a href="../../wp/a/Astronomy.htm" title="Astronomy">Astronomy</a> or <!--del_lnk--> Cosmology.

Alternative terms such as <!--del_lnk--> areology (the study of Mars) have been proposed but are not widely used.<p><a id="Geographical_techniques" name="Geographical_techniques"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geographical techniques</span></h2>
      <p>As spatial interrelationships are key to this <!--del_lnk--> synoptic science, <!--del_lnk--> maps are a key tool. Classical <!--del_lnk--> cartography has been joined by a more modern approach to geographical analysis, computer-based <!--del_lnk--> geographic information systems (GIS).<p>In their study, geographers use four interrelated approaches:<ul>
       <li>Systematic - Groups geographical knowledge into categories that can be explored globally.<li>Regional - Examines systematic relationships between categories for a specific region or location on the planet.<li>Descriptive - Simply specifies the locations of features and populations.<li>Analytical - Asks <i>why</i> we find features and populations in a specific geographic area.</ul>

      <p>Cartography studies the representation of the Earth&#39;s surface with abstract symbols (map making). Although other subdisciplines of geography rely on maps for presenting their analyses, the actual making of maps is abstract enough to be regarded separately. Cartography has grown from a collection of drafting techniques into an actual science.<p>Cartographers must learn <!--del_lnk--> cognitive psychology and ergonomics to understand which symbols convey information about the Earth most effectively, and <!--del_lnk--> behavioural psychology to induce the readers of their maps to act on the information. They must learn <!--del_lnk--> geodesy and fairly advanced <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> to understand how the shape of the Earth affects the distortion of map symbols projected onto a flat surface for viewing. It can be said, without much controversy, that cartography is the seed from which the larger field of geography grew. Most geographers will cite a childhood fascination with maps as an early sign they would end up in the field.<p><a id="Geographic_information_systems" name="Geographic_information_systems"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Geographic information systems</span></h3>

      <p>Geographic information systems (GIS) deal with the storage of information about the Earth for automatic retrieval by a computer, in an accurate manner appropriate to the information&#39;s purpose. In addition to all of the other subdisciplines of geography, GIS specialists must understand <a href="../../wp/c/Computer_science.htm" title="Computer science">computer science</a> and <!--del_lnk--> database systems.

      <p>Remote sensing can be defined as the art and science of obtaining information about Earth features from measurements made at a distance. Remotely sensed data comes in many forms such as <!--del_lnk--> satellite imagery, <!--del_lnk--> aerial photography and data obtained from hand-held sensors. Geographers increasingly use remotely sensed data to obtain information about the Earth&#39;s land surface, ocean and atmosphere because it: a) supplies objective information at a variety of spatial scales (local to global), b) provides a synoptic view of the area of interest, c) allows access to distant and/or inaccessible sites, d) provides spectral information outside the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, and e) facilitates studies of how features/areas change over time. Remotely sensed data may be analyzed either independently of, or in conjunction with, other digital data layers (e.g., in a Geographic Information System).<p><a id="Geostatistics" name="Geostatistics"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Geostatistics</span></h3>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Geostatistics deal with quantitative data analysis, specifically the application of statistical methodology to the exploration of geographic phenomena. Geostatistics is used extensively in a variety of fields including: <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrology.htm" title="Hydrology">hydrology</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Geology.htm" title="Geology">geology</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> exploration, weather analysis, <!--del_lnk--> urban planning, <a href="../../wp/l/Logistics.htm" title="Logistics">logistics</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> epidemiology. The mathematical basis for geostatistics derives from <!--del_lnk--> cluster analysis, <!--del_lnk--> discriminant analysis, and <!--del_lnk--> non-parametric statistical tests, and a variety of other subjects. Applications of geostatistics rely heavily on <!--del_lnk--> Geographic Information Systems, particularly for the <!--del_lnk--> interpolation (estimate) of unmeasured points.<p><a id="Geographic_qualitative_methods" name="Geographic_qualitative_methods"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Geographic qualitative methods</span></h3>
