      <p><b>Greek mythology</b> is the body of stories belonging to the ancient Greeks, concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world and their own <!--del_lnk--> cult and <!--del_lnk--> ritual practices. Modern scholars referred to the myths and studied them in an attempt to throw light on the religious and political institutions of <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">ancient Greece</a> and, in general, on the ancient Greek civilization.<p>Greek mythology consists in part of a large collection of narratives that explain the origins of the world and detail the lives and adventures of a wide variety of <!--del_lnk--> gods, goddesses, heroes, heroines, and other <!--del_lnk--> mythological creatures. These accounts were initially fashioned and disseminated in an <!--del_lnk--> oral-poetic tradition; the Greek myths are known today primarily from <!--del_lnk--> Greek literature. The oldest known literary sources, the <!--del_lnk--> epic poems <i><!--del_lnk--> Iliad</i> and <i><a href="../../wp/o/Odyssey.htm" title="Odyssey">Odyssey</a></i>, focus on events surrounding the <a href="../../wp/t/Trojan_War.htm" title="Trojan War">Trojan War</a>. Two poems by <a href="../../wp/h/Homer.htm" title="Homer">Homer</a>&#39;s near contemporary <!--del_lnk--> Hesiod, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Theogony</i> and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Works and Days</i>, contain accounts of the genesis of the world, the succession of divine rulers, the succession of human ages, the origin of human woes, and the origin of sacrificial practices. Myths are also preserved in the <!--del_lnk--> Homeric hymns, in fragments of epic poems of the <!--del_lnk--> Epic Cycle, in lyric poems, in the works of the tragedians of the <!--del_lnk--> 5th century BC, in writings of scholars and poets of the <!--del_lnk--> Hellenistic Age and in writers of the time of the Roman Empire, for example, <!--del_lnk--> Plutarch and <!--del_lnk--> Pausanias.<p>Monumental evidence at <!--del_lnk--> Mycenaean and <a href="../../wp/m/Minoan_civilization.htm" title="Minoan civilization">Minoan</a> sites helped to explain many of the questions about Homer&#39;s epics and provided archaeological proofs of many of the mythological details about gods and heroes. Greek mythology was also depicted in artifacts; Geometric designs on pottery of the <!--del_lnk--> 8th century BC depict scenes from the Trojan cycle, as well as the adventures of <a href="../../wp/h/Heracles.htm" title="Heracles">Heracles</a>. In the succeeding <!--del_lnk--> Archaic, <!--del_lnk--> Classical and <a href="../../wp/h/Hellenistic_Greece.htm" title="Hellenistic Greece">Hellenistic</a> periods, Homeric and various other mythological scenes appear to supplement the existing literary evidence.<p>Greek mythology has had extensive influence on the culture, the arts and the literature of Western civilization and remains part of western heritage and language. It has been a part of the educational fabric from childhood, while poets and artists from ancient times to the present have derived inspiration from Greek mythology and have discovered contemporary significance and relevance in classical mythological themes. Therefore, western literature is <!--del_lnk--> diachronically heavy with allusions to the heritage of the ancient Greek myths.<p>

      <p>While all cultures throughout the world have their own <a href="../../wp/m/Mythology.htm" title="Mythology">myths</a>, the term <i>mythology</i> is a Greek coinage and had a specialized meaning within Greek culture.<p>The Greek term <i>mythologia</i> is a compound of two smaller words:<ul>
       <li><b>mythos</b> (&mu;&#x1FE6;&theta;&omicron;&sigmaf;) &mdash; which in <!--del_lnk--> Classical Greek means roughly &quot;the oral speech&quot;, &quot;words without action&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> Aeschylus: &quot;&#x1F14;&rho;&gamma;&#x1FF3; &kappa;&omicron;&#x1F50;&kappa;&#x3AD;&tau;&iota; <i>&mu;&#x3CD;&theta;&#x1FF3;</i>&quot; [from word to deed]) and, by expansion, a &quot;ritualized <!--del_lnk--> speech act&quot;, as of a chieftain at an assembly, or of a poet or priest, or a narration (Aeschylus: &#x1F08;&kappa;&omicron;&#x3CD;&sigma;&epsilon;&iota; &mu;&#x1FE6;&theta;&omicron;&nu; &#x1F10;&nu; &beta;&rho;&alpha;&chi;&epsilon;&#x1FD6; &lambda;&#x3CC;&gamma;&#x1FF3; [The whole tale you will hear in brief space of time]).<li><b>logos</b> (&lambda;&#x3CC;&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf;) &mdash; which in Classical Greek stands for: a) the (oral or written) expression of thoughts and b) the ability of a person to express his thoughts (inward logos).</ul>
      <h2> <span class="mw-headline">Survey of mythic history</span></h2>
      <p>The Greeks&#39; construction of mythology changed over time to accommodate the evolution of their own culture. The earlier inhabitants of the <!--del_lnk--> Balkan Peninsula were an agricultural people who assigned an evil spirit to every aspect of nature. Eventually, these vague spirits assumed human shape and entered the local mythology as gods and goddesses. When tribes from the north of the Balkan Peninsula invaded, they brought with them a new pantheon of gods, based on conquest, force, prowess in battle, and violent heroism. Other older deities of the agricultural world fused with those of the more powerful invaders or else faded into insignificance.<p>After the middle of the Archaic period myths about love relationships between male gods and male heroes become more and more frequent, indicating the parallel development of <!--del_lnk--> pedagogic pederasty <i>(Eros paidikos, &pi;&alpha;&iota;&delta;&iota;&kappa;&#x3CC;&sigmaf; &#x1F14;&rho;&omega;&sigmaf;),</i> thought to have been introduced around 630 BC. By the end of the 5th century BC, poets had assigned at least one <!--del_lnk--> eromenos to every important god except <!--del_lnk--> Ares and to many legendary figures. Previously existing myths, such as that of <a href="../../wp/a/Achilles.htm" title="Achilles">Achilles</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Patroclus, were also cast in a <!--del_lnk--> pederastic light. Alexandrian poets at first, then more generally literary mythographers in the early Roman Empire, often adapted stories of characters in Greek myth in ways that did not reflect earlier actual beliefs. Many of the most popular versions of these myths that we have today were actually from these inventive retellings, which may blur the archaic beliefs.<p>The achievement of epic poetry was to create cycles of stories and as result to develop a sense of mythical chronology. Thus Greek mythology unfolds like a phase in the development of the world and of man. While self-contradictions in the stories make an absolute timeline impossible, an approximate chronology may be discerned. The mythological history of the world can be divided in 3 or 4 broader periods:<ol>
       <li><i>The myths of origin</i> or <i>age of gods (Theogonies, &quot;births of gods&quot;)</i>: stories about the origins of the world, the gods, and the human race.<li><i>The age when gods and mortals mingled freely</i>: stories of the early interactions between gods, <!--del_lnk--> demigods, and mortals.<li><i>The age of heroes (heroic age)</i>, where divine activity was more limited. The last and greatest of the heroic sagas is the stories of <i>the Trojan War and after</i> (regarded by some researchers as a separate fourth period).</ol>
      <p>While the age of gods has often been of more interest to contemporary students of myth, the Greek authors of the archaic and classical eras had a clear preference for the age of heroes. For example, the heroic <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> dwarfed the divine-focused <i>Theogony</i> and Homeric Hymns in both size and popularity. Under the influence of Homer the &quot;hero cult&quot; leads to a restructuring in spiritual life, expressed in the separation of the realm of the gods from the realm of the dead (=heroes), of the Olympian from the Chthonic. In the <i>Works and Days</i>, Hesiod makes use of a scheme of Four Ages (or Races): Golden, Silver, Bronze, and Iron. These races or ages are separate creations of the gods, the Golden Age belonging to the reign of Cronus, the subsequent races the creation of Zeus. Hesiod intercalates the Age (or Race) of Heroes just after the Bronze Age. The final age was the Iron Age, during which the poet himself lived. The poet regards it as the worst; the presence of evil was explained by <!--del_lnk--> Pandora&#39;s myth. In <i><!--del_lnk--> Metamorphoses</i> Ovid follows Hesiod&#39;s concept of the four ages.<p><a id="Age_of_gods" name="Age_of_gods"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Age of gods</span></h3>

      <p>&quot;Myths of origin&quot; or &quot;creation myths&quot; represent an attempt to render the universe comprehensible in human terms and explain the origin of the universe. The most widely accepted account of beginning of things as reported by Hesiod&#39;s <i>Theogony</i>, starts with <!--del_lnk--> Chaos, a yawning nothingness. Out of the void emerged Ge or <!--del_lnk--> Gaia (the Earth) and some other primary divine beings: <!--del_lnk--> Eros (Love), the <!--del_lnk--> Abyss (the <!--del_lnk--> Tartarus), and the <!--del_lnk--> Erebus. Without male assistance Gaia gave birth to <!--del_lnk--> Uranus (the Sky) who then fertilised her. From that union were born, first, the <!--del_lnk--> Titans: six males and six females (<!--del_lnk--> Oceanus, <!--del_lnk--> Coeus and <!--del_lnk--> Crius and <!--del_lnk--> Hyperion and <!--del_lnk--> Iapetus, <!--del_lnk--> Theia and <!--del_lnk--> Rhea, <!--del_lnk--> Themis and <!--del_lnk--> Mnemosyne, <!--del_lnk--> Phoebe and <!--del_lnk--> Tethys, and <!--del_lnk--> Cronus); then the one-eyed <a href="../../wp/c/Cyclops.htm" title="Cyclops">Cyclopes</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Hecatonchires or Hundred-Handers. Cronus (&quot;the wily, youngest and most terrible of [Gaia&#39;s] children&quot;)castrated his father and became the ruler of the gods with his sister-wife Rhea as his consort and the other Titans became his court. This motif of father/son conflict was repeated when Cronus was confronted by his son, Zeus. Zeus challenged him to war for the kingship of the gods. At last, with the help of the Cyclopes,(whom Zeus freed from Tarturus), Zeus and his siblings were victorious, while Cronus and the Titans were hurled down to imprisonment in Tartarus.<p>The earliest Greek thought about poetry considered the theogony to be the prototypical poetic genre &mdash; the prototypical <i>mythos</i> (myth) &mdash; and imputed almost magical powers to it. <!--del_lnk--> Orpheus, the archetypal poet, was also the archetypal singer of theogonies, which he uses to calm seas and storms in Apollonius&#39; <i><!--del_lnk--> Argonautica</i>, and to move the stony hearts of the underworld gods in his descent to <!--del_lnk--> Hades. When <!--del_lnk--> Hermes invents the <!--del_lnk--> lyre in the <i>Homeric Hymn to Hermes</i>, the first thing he does is sing the birth of the gods. Hesiod&#39;s <i>Theogony</i> is not only the fullest surviving account of the gods, but also the fullest surviving account of the archaic poet&#39;s function, with its long preliminary invocation to the <!--del_lnk--> Muses. Theogony was also the subject of many lost poems, including those attributed to Orpheus, <!--del_lnk--> Musaeus, <!--del_lnk--> Epimenides, <!--del_lnk--> Abaris and other legendary seers, which were used in private ritual purifications and <!--del_lnk--> mystery-rites. There are indications that <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a> was familiar with some version of the Orphic theogony. A few fragments of these works survive in quotations by <!--del_lnk--> Neoplatonist philosophers and recently unearthed <!--del_lnk--> papyrus scraps. One of these scraps, the <!--del_lnk--> Derveni Papyrus now proves that at least in the 5th century BC a theogonic-cosmogonic poem of Orpheus was in existence. This poem attempted to outdo Hesiod&#39;s <i>Theogony</i> and the genealogy of the gods was extended back with <!--del_lnk--> Nyx (Night) as an ultimate beginning before Uranus, Cronus and Zeus.<p>The first philosophical cosmologists reacted against, or sometimes built upon, popular mythical conceptions that had existed in the Greek world for some time. Some of these popular conceptions can be gleaned from the poetry of Homer and Hesiod. In Homer, the Earth was viewed as a flat disk afloat on the river of <!--del_lnk--> Oceanus and overlooked by a hemispherical sky with sun, moon and stars. The Sun (<!--del_lnk--> Helios) traversed the heavens as a charioteer and sailed around the Earth in a golden bowl at night. Sun, earth, heaven, rivers, and winds could be addressed in prayers and called to witness oaths. Natural fissures were popularly regarded as entrances to the subterranean house of Hades, home of the dead.<p><a id="Greek_gods" name="Greek_gods"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Greek gods</span></h4>

      <p>After the overthrow of the Titans, a new <!--del_lnk--> pantheon of <a href="../../wp/d/Deity.htm" title="Deity">gods</a> and <!--del_lnk--> goddesses emerged. Among the principle Greek deities were the Olympians (The limitation of their number to twelve seems to have been a comparatively modern idea), residing atop <!--del_lnk--> Mount Olympus under the eye of Zeus. Besides the Olympians, the Greeks worshiped various gods of the countryside, the goat-god <!--del_lnk--> Pan, <!--del_lnk--> Nymphs, Naeads (who dwelled in springs), <!--del_lnk--> Dryads (who dwelled in trees), <!--del_lnk--> Nereids (who inhabited the sea), river gods, <!--del_lnk--> Satyrs, and others. In addition, there were the dark powers of the underworld, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Erinyes (or Furies), said to pursue those guilty of crimes against blood-relatives. In order to honour the ancient Greek pantheon, poets composed the Homeric Hymns (a group of thirty-three songs). Gregory Nagy regards &quot;the larger Homeric Hymns as simplex preludes (compared with <i>Theogony</i>), each of which invokes one god&quot;.<p>In the wide variety of myths and legends that constitute ancient Greek mythology, the deities that were native to the Greek peoples are described as having essentially corporeal but ideal bodies. According to <!--del_lnk--> Walter Burkert, the defining characteristic of Greek anthropomorphism is that &quot;the Greek gods are persons, not abstractions, ideas or concepts&quot;. Regardless of their underlying forms, the ancient Greek gods have many fantastic abilities; most significantly, the gods are not affected by disease, and can be wounded only under highly unusual circumstances. The Greeks considered immortality as the distinctive characteristic of their gods; this immortality, as well as unfading youth, was insured by the constant use of <!--del_lnk--> nectar and <!--del_lnk--> ambrosia, by which the divine blood was renewed in their veins.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Each god descends from his or her own genealogy, pursues differing interests, has a certain area of expertise, and is governed by a unique personality; however, these descriptions arise from a multiplicity of archaic local variants, which do not always agree with one another. When these gods were called upon in poetry, prayer or cult, they are referred to by a combination of their name and <!--del_lnk--> epithets, that identify them by these distinctions from other manifestations of themselves (e.g. <i>Apollo Musagetes</i> is &quot;<a href="../../wp/a/Apollo.htm" title="Apollo">Apollo</a>, [as] leader of the <!--del_lnk--> Muses&quot;). Alternatively the epithet may identify a particular and localized aspect of the god, sometimes thought to be already ancient during the classical epoch of Greece.<p>Most gods were associated with specific aspects of life. For example, <!--del_lnk--> Aphrodite was the goddess of love and beauty, <!--del_lnk--> Ares was the god of war, <!--del_lnk--> Hades the god of the dead, and <a href="../../wp/a/Athena.htm" title="Athena">Athena</a> the goddess of wisdom and courage. Some deities, such as <a href="../../wp/a/Apollo.htm" title="Apollo">Apollo</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Dionysus, revealed complex personalities and mixtures of functions, while others, such as <!--del_lnk--> Hestia (literally &quot;hearth&quot;) and <!--del_lnk--> Helios (literally &quot;sun&quot;), were little more than personifications. The most impressive <!--del_lnk--> temples tended to be dedicated to a limited number of gods, who were the focus of large pan-Hellenic cults. It was, however, common for individual regions and villages to devote their own cults to minor gods. Many cities also honored the more well-known gods with unusual local rites and associated strange myths with them that were unknown elsewhere. During the heroic age, the cult of heroes (or demi-gods) supplemented this of the gods.<p><a id="Age_of_gods_and_men" name="Age_of_gods_and_men"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Age of gods and men</span></h3>

      <p>Bridging the age when gods lived alone and the age when divine interference in human affairs was limited was a transitional age in which gods and men moved together. These were the early days of the world when the groups mingled more freely than they did later. Most of these tales were later told by Ovid&#39;s <i>Metamorphoses</i> and they are often divided in two thematic groups: tales of love, and tales of punishment.<p>Tales of love often involve the incest, seduction or rape of a mortal woman by a male god, resulting in heroic offspring. The stories generally suggest that relationships between gods and mortals are something to avoid; even consenting relationships rarely have happy endings. In a few cases, a female divinity mates with a mortal man, as in the <i>Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite</i>, where the goddess lies with <!--del_lnk--> Anchises to produce <!--del_lnk--> Aeneas. The marriage of <!--del_lnk--> Peleus and <!--del_lnk--> Thetis, which yielded <a href="../../wp/a/Achilles.htm" title="Achilles">Achilles</a>, is another such myth.<div class="thumb tleft">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>The second type (tales of punishment) involves the appropriation or invention of some important cultural artifact, as when <!--del_lnk--> Prometheus steals fire from the gods, when <!--del_lnk--> Tantalus steals nectar and <!--del_lnk--> ambrosia from Zeus&#39; table and gives it to his own subjects - revealing to them the secrets of the gods, when <!--del_lnk--> Prometheus or <!--del_lnk--> Lycaon invents sacrifice, when <!--del_lnk--> Demeter teaches <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Mysteries to <!--del_lnk--> Triptolemus, or when <!--del_lnk--> Marsyas invents the <!--del_lnk--> aulos and enters into a musical contest with <a href="../../wp/a/Apollo.htm" title="Apollo">Apollo</a>. Prometheus&#39; adventures mark &quot;a place between the history of the gods and that of man&quot;. An anonymous papyrus fragment, dated to the <!--del_lnk--> third century BC, vividly portrays <!--del_lnk--> Dionysus&#39; punishment of the king of <!--del_lnk--> Thrace, <!--del_lnk--> Lycurgus, whose recognition of the new god came too late, resulting in horrific penalties that extended into the afterlife. The story of the arrival of Dionysus to establish his cult in Thrace was also the subject of an Aeschylean trilogy. In another tragedy, Euripide&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> The Bacchae</i>, the king of <!--del_lnk--> Thebes, <!--del_lnk--> Pentheus, is punished by Dionysus, because he disrespected the god and spied on his <!--del_lnk--> Maenads, the female <!--del_lnk--> worshippers of the god.<p>In another story, based on an old folk-tale motif, and echoeing a similar theme, <!--del_lnk--> Demeter was searching for her daughter, <!--del_lnk--> Persephone, having taken the form of an old woman called <!--del_lnk--> Doso, and received a hospitable welcome from <!--del_lnk--> Celeus, the King of <!--del_lnk--> Eleusis in <!--del_lnk--> Attica. As a gift to Celeus, because of his hospitality, Demeter planned to make Demophon as a god, but she was unable to complete the ritual because his mother Metanira walked in and saw her son in the fire and screamed in fright, which angered Demeter, who lamented that foolish mortals do not understand the concept and ritual.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p><a id="Heroic_age" name="Heroic_age"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Heroic age</span></h3>
      <p>The age in which the heroes lived is known as the heroic Age. The epic and genealogical poetry created cycles of stories clustered around particular heroes or events and established the family relationships between the heroes of different stories; they thus arranged the stories in sequence. According to Ken Dowden, &quot;there is even a saga effect: we can follow the fates of some families in successive generations&quot;.<p>After the rise of the hero cult, gods and heroes constitute the sacral sphere and are invoked together in oaths, and prayers which are addressed to them. In contrast to the age of gods, during the heroic age the roster of heroes is never given fixed and final form; great gods are no longer born, but new heroes can always be raised up from the army of the dead. Another important difference between the hero cult and the cult of gods is that the hero becomes the centre of local group identity.<p>The monumental events of <a href="../../wp/h/Heracles.htm" title="Heracles">Heracles</a> are regarded as the dawn of the age of heroes. To the Heroic Age are also ascribed three great military events, the <!--del_lnk--> Argonautic expedition and the <a href="../../wp/t/Trojan_War.htm" title="Trojan War">Trojan War</a> as well as the Theban War.<p><a id="Heracles_and_the_Heracleidae" name="Heracles_and_the_Heracleidae"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Heracles and the Heracleidae</span></h4>

      <p>Behind Heracles&#39; complicated mythology there was probably a real man, perhaps a chieftain-vassal of the kingdom of <!--del_lnk--> Argos. Traditionally, however, Heracles was the son of Zeus and <!--del_lnk--> Alcmene, granddaughter of <!--del_lnk--> Perseus. His fantastic solitary exploits, with their many <!--del_lnk--> folk tale themes, provided much material for popular legend. He is portrayed as a sacrificier, mentioned as a founder of altars, and imagined as a voracious eater himself; it is in this role that he appears in comedy, while his tragic end provided much material for tragedy &mdash; <i><!--del_lnk--> Heracles</i> is regarded by Thalia Papadopoulou as &quot;a play of great significance in examination of aother Euripidean dramas&quot;. In art and literature Heracles was represented as an enormously strong man of moderate height; his characteristic weapon was the bow but frequently also the club. Tha vase paintings demonstrate the unparalleled popularity of Heracles, his fight with the lion being depicted many hundreds of times.<p>Heracles also entered Etruscan and Roman mythology and cult, and the exclamation &quot;mehercule&quot; became as familiar to the Romans as &quot;Herakleis&quot; was to the Greeks. In <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> he was worshipped as a god of merchants and traders, although others also prayed to him for his characteristic gifts of good luck or rescue from danger.<p>Heracles attained the highest social prestige through his appointment as official ancestor of the <!--del_lnk--> Dorian kings. This probably served as a legitimation for the Dorian migrations into the <!--del_lnk--> Peloponnese. <!--del_lnk--> Hyllus, the eponymous hero of one Dorian phyle, became the son of Heracles and one of the <i>Heracleidae</i> or <i>Heraclids</i> (the numerous descendants of Heracles, especially the descendants of <!--del_lnk--> Hyllus &mdash; other Heracleidae included <!--del_lnk--> Macaria, <!--del_lnk--> Lamos, <!--del_lnk--> Manto, <!--del_lnk--> Bianor, <!--del_lnk--> Tlepolemus, and <!--del_lnk--> Telephus). These Heraclids conquered the <!--del_lnk--> Peloponnesian kingdoms of <!--del_lnk--> Mycenae, <!--del_lnk--> Sparta and <!--del_lnk--> Argos, claiming, according to legend, a right to rule it through their ancestor. Their rise to dominance is frequently called the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Dorian invasion&quot;. The Lydian and later the Macedonian kings, as rulers of the same rank, also became Heracleidae.<p>Other members of this earliest generation of heroes, such as Perseus, <!--del_lnk--> Deucalion, <!--del_lnk--> Theseus and <!--del_lnk--> Bellerophon, have many traits in common with Heracles. Like him, their exploits are solitary, fantastic and border on <!--del_lnk--> fairy tale, as they slay monsters such as the <!--del_lnk--> Chimera and <!--del_lnk--> Medusa. Bellerophon&#39;s adventures are commonplace types, similar to the adventures of Heracles and Theseus. Sending a hero to his presumed death is also a recurrent theme of this early heroic mythological tradition, used in the cases of Perseus and Bellerophon.<p><a id="Argonauts" name="Argonauts"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Argonauts</span></h4>

      <p>The only surviving Hellenistic epic, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Argonautica</i> of Apollonius of Rhodes (epic poet, scholar, and director of the <a href="../../wp/l/Library_of_Alexandria.htm" title="Library of Alexandria">Library of Alexandria</a>) tells the myth of the voyage of <!--del_lnk--> Jason and the Argonauts to retrieve the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Fleece from the mythical land of <!--del_lnk--> Colchis. In the <i>Argonautica</i>, Jason is impelled on his quest by king <!--del_lnk--> Pelias, who receives a prophecy that a man with one sandal would be his <!--del_lnk--> nemesis. Jason loses a sandal in a river, arrives at the court of Pelias, and the epic is set in motion. Nearly every member of the next generation of heroes, as well as Heracles, went with <!--del_lnk--> Jason in the ship <i><!--del_lnk--> Argo</i> to fetch the Golden Fleece. This generation also included <!--del_lnk--> Theseus, who went to <!--del_lnk--> Crete to slay the <!--del_lnk--> Minotaur; <!--del_lnk--> Atalanta, the female heroine; and <!--del_lnk--> Meleager, who once had an epic cycle of his own to rival the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i>. Pindar, Apollonius and Apollodorus endeavor to give full lists of the Argonauts.<p>Although Apollonius wrote his poem in the <!--del_lnk--> 3rd century BC, the composition of the story of the Argonauts (a highly complex legend) is earlier than <i>Odyssey</i>, which shows familiarity with the exploits of Jason (the wandering of Odysseus may have been partly founded on it). In ancient times the expedition was regarded as a historical fact, an incident in the opening up of the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Sea.htm" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a> to Greek commerce and colonization.

      <p>In between the <!--del_lnk--> Argo and the <a href="../../wp/t/Trojan_War.htm" title="Trojan War">Trojan War</a>, there was a generation known chiefly for its horrific crimes.

      <p>Greek mythology culminates in the Trojan War, fought between the Greeks and <!--del_lnk--> Troy, and its aftermath. In Homer&#39;s works the chief stories have already taken shape, and individual themes were elaborated later, especially in Greek drama. The Trojan War acquired also a great interest for the <!--del_lnk--> Roman culture because of the story of <!--del_lnk--> Aeneas, a Trojan hero, whose from Troy led to the founding of the city that would one day become Rome, is recounted in <a href="../../wp/v/Virgil.htm" title="Virgil">Virgil</a>&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Aeneid</i> (Book II of Virgil&#39;s Aeneid contains the best-known account of the sack of Troy). Finally there are two pseudo-chronicles written in Latin that passed under the names of <!--del_lnk--> Dictys Cretensis and <!--del_lnk--> Dares Phrygius.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Trojan War cycle, a collection of <!--del_lnk--> epic poems, starts with the events leading up to the war: (<!--del_lnk--> Eris and the <!--del_lnk--> golden apple of <!--del_lnk--> Kallisti, the <!--del_lnk--> Judgement of Paris, the abduction of <!--del_lnk--> Helen, the sacrifice of <!--del_lnk--> Iphigenia at <!--del_lnk--> Aulis). To recover Helen, the Greeks launched a great expedition under the overall command of <!--del_lnk--> Menelaus&#39; brother, <a href="../../wp/a/Agamemnon.htm" title="Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>, king of <!--del_lnk--> Argos or <!--del_lnk--> Mycenae, but The Trojans refused to return Helen. The <i>Iliad</i>, which is set in the tenth year of the war, tells of the quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles, who was the finest Greek warrior, and the consequent deaths in battle of Achilles&#39; friend <!--del_lnk--> Patroclus and Priam&#39;s eldest son, <!--del_lnk--> Hector. After Hector&#39;s death the Trojans were joined by two exotic allies, <!--del_lnk--> Penthesilea, queen of the <!--del_lnk--> Amazons, and <!--del_lnk--> Memnon, king of the <!--del_lnk--> Ethiopians and son of the dawn-goddess <!--del_lnk--> Eos. Achilles killed both of these, but Paris then managed to kill Achilles with an arrow. Before they could take Troy, the Greeks had to steal from the citadel the wooden image of Pallas Athena (the <!--del_lnk--> Palladium). Finally, with Athena&#39;s help, they built the <!--del_lnk--> Trojan Horse. Despite the warnings of Priam&#39;s daughter <!--del_lnk--> Cassandra, the Trojans were persuaded by <!--del_lnk--> Sinon, a Greek who feigned desertion, to take the horse inside the walls of Troy as an offering to Athena; the priest Laocoon, who tried to have the horse destroyed, was killed by sea-serpents. At night the Greek fleet returned, and the Greeks from the horse opened the gates of Troy. In the total sack that followed, Priam and his remaining sons were slaughtered; the Trojan women passed into slavery in various cities of Greece. The adventurous homeward voyages of the Greek leaders (including the wanderings of <a href="../../wp/o/Odysseus.htm" title="Odysseus">Odysseus</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Aeneas (the <i><!--del_lnk--> Aeneid</i>), and the murder of Agamemnon) were told in two epics, the Returns (<i><!--del_lnk--> Nostoi</i>; lost) and Homer&#39;s <a href="../../wp/o/Odyssey.htm" title="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>. The Trojan cycle also includes the adventures of the children of the Trojan generation (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> Orestes and <!--del_lnk--> Telemachus).<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The Trojan War provided a variety of themes and became a main source of inspiration for ancient Greek artists (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> metopes on the <a href="../../wp/p/Parthenon.htm" title="Parthenon">Parthenon</a> depicting the sack of Troy); this artistic preference for themes deriving from the Trojan Cycle indicates its importance for the ancient Greek civilization. The same mythological cyrcle also inspired a series of posterior European literary writings. For instance, Trojan Medieval European writers, unacquainted with Homer at first hand, found in the Troy legend a rich source of heroic and romantic storytelling and a convenient framework into which to fit their own courtly and chivalric ideals. <a href="../../wp/1/12th_century.htm" title="12th century">12th century</a> authors, such as <!--del_lnk--> Beno&icirc;t de Sainte-Maure (<i>Roman de Troie</i> [Romance of Troy, 1154&ndash;60]) and <!--del_lnk--> Joseph of Exeter (<i>De Bello Troiano</i> [On the Trojan War, 1183]) describe the war while rewriting the standard version they found in <i>Dictys</i> and <i>Dares</i>. They thus follow <!--del_lnk--> Horace&#39;s advice and <!--del_lnk--> Vergil&#39;s example: they rewrite a poem of Troy instead of telling something completely new.<p><a id="Greek_and_Roman_conceptions_of_myth" name="Greek_and_Roman_conceptions_of_myth"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Greek and Roman conceptions of myth</span></h2>
      <p>Mythology was at the heart of everyday life in ancient Greece. Greeks regarded mythology as a part of their history. They used myth to explain natural phenomena, cultural variations, traditional enmities and friendships. It was a source of pride to be able to trace one&#39;s leaders&#39; descent from a mythological hero or a god. Few ever doubted that there was truth behind the account of the Trojan War in the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i>. According to <!--del_lnk--> Victor Davis Hanson, a military <!--del_lnk--> historian, <!--del_lnk--> columnist, political essayist and former <!--del_lnk--> Classics professor, and John Heath, associate professor of Classics at <!--del_lnk--> Santa Clara University, the profound knowledge of the homeric <!--del_lnk--> epos was deemed by the Greeks the basis of their acculturation. Homer was the &quot;education of Greece&quot; (&#x1F19;&lambda;&lambda;&#x3AC;&delta;&omicron;&sigmaf; &pi;&alpha;&#x3AF;&delta;&epsilon;&upsilon;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;), and his poetry &quot;the Book&quot;.<p><a id="Philosophy_and_myths" name="Philosophy_and_myths"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Philosophy and myths</span></h3>

      <p>After the rise of philosophy, and history, prose and <!--del_lnk--> rationalism in the late 5th century BC the fate of myth became uncertain, and mythical genealogies gave place to a conception of history which tried to exclude the supernatural (such as the <a href="../../wp/t/Thucydides.htm" title="Thucydides">Thucydidean</a> history). While poets and dramatists were reworking the myths, Greek historians and philosophers were beginning to criticize them.<p>A few radical philosophers like <!--del_lnk--> Xenophanes of Colophon were already beginning to label the poets&#39; tales as blasphemous lies in the 6th century BC; Xenophanes had complained that Homer and Hesiod attributed to the gods &quot;all that is shameful and disgraceful among men; they steal, commit adultery, and deceive one another&quot;. This line of thought found its most sweeping expression in <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a>&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Republic</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Laws</i>. Plato created his own allegorical myths (such as the vision of Er in the <i>Republic</i>), attacked the traditional tales of the gods&#39; tricks, thefts and adulteries as immortal, and objected to their central role in literature. Plato&#39;s criticism (he called the myths &quot;old wives&#39; chatter&quot;) was the first serious challenge to the homeric mythological tradition. For his part Aristotle ctiticized the Pre-socratic quasi-mythical philosophical approoach and underscored that &quot;Hesiod and the theological writers were concerned only with what seemed plausible to themselves, and had no respect for us [...] But it is not worth taking seriously writers who show off in the mythical style; as for those who do proceed by proving their assertions, we must cross-examine them&quot;.<p>Nevertheless, even Plato did not manage to wean himself and his society from the influence of myth; his own characterization for Socrates is based on the traditional homeric and tragic patterns, used by the philosopher to praise the righteous life of his teacher:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>Hanson and Heath estimate that Plato&#39;s rejection of the homeric tradition was not favorably received by the grassroots Greek civilization. The old myths were kept alive in local cults; they continued to influence poetry, and to form the main subject of painting and sculpture.<p>More sportingly, the 5th century BC <!--del_lnk--> tragedian <!--del_lnk--> Euripides often played with the old traditions, mocking them, and through the voice of his characters injecting notes of doubt. Yet the subjects of his plays were taken, without exception, from myth. Many of thses plays were written in answer to a predecessor&#39;s version of the same or similar myth. Euripides impugns mainly the myths about the gods and begins his critique with an objection similar to the one previously expressed by Xenocrates: the gods, as traditionally represented, are far too crassly <!--del_lnk--> anthropomorphic.<p><a id="Hellenistic_and_Roman_rationalism" name="Hellenistic_and_Roman_rationalism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Hellenistic and Roman rationalism</span></h3>

      <p>During the <!--del_lnk--> Hellenistic period, mythology took on the prestige of &eacute;lite knowledge that marks its possessors as belonging to a certain class. At the same time, the skeptical turn of the Classical age became even more pronounced. Greek mythographer <!--del_lnk--> Euhemerus established the tradition of seeking an actual historical basis for mythical beings and events. Although his original work (<i>Sacred Scriptures</i>) is lost, much is known about it from what is recorded by Diodorus and <!--del_lnk--> Lactantius.<p>Rationalizing <!--del_lnk--> hermeneutics of myth became even more popular under the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>, thanks to the physicalist theories of <a href="../../wp/s/Stoicism.htm" title="Stoicism">Stoic</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Epicurean philosophy. Stoics presented explanations of the gods and heroes as physical phenomena, while the <!--del_lnk--> euhemerists rationalized them as historical figures. At the same time, the Stoics and the <!--del_lnk--> Neoplatonists promoted the moral significations of the mythological tradition, often based on Greek etymologies. Through his Epicurean message, <!--del_lnk--> Lucretius had sought to expel superstitious fears from the minds of his fellow-citizens. <!--del_lnk--> Livy, too, is sceptical about the mythological tradition and claims that he does not intend to pass judgement on such legends (fabulae). The challenge for Romans with a strong and apologetic sense of <!--del_lnk--> religious tradition was to defend that tradition while conceding that it was often a breeding-ground for superstition. The antiquarian <!--del_lnk--> Varro, who regarded religion as a human inistitution with great importance for the preservation of good in society, devoted rigorous study to the origins of religious cults. In his <i>Antiquitates Rerum Divinarum</i> (which has not survived, but <a href="../../wp/a/Augustine_of_Hippo.htm" title="Augustine of Hippo">Augustine</a>&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> City of God</i> indicate its genreal approach) Varro argues that whereas the superstitious man fears the gods, the truly religious person venerates them as parents. In wis work he distinguished three kinds of gods:<ul>
       <li>The gods of nature: personifications of phenomena like rain and fire.<li>The gods of the poets: invented by unscrupulous bards to stir the passions.<li>The gods of the city: invented by wise legislators to soothe and enlighten the populace.</ul>
      <p>Roman Academic Cotta ridicules both literal and allegorical acceptance of myth, declaring roundly that myths have no place in philosophy. <!--del_lnk--> Cicero is also generally disdainful of myth, but, like Varro, he is emphatic in his support for the state religion and its institutions. It is difficult to know how far down the social scale this rationalism extended. Cicero asserts that no one (not even old women and boys) is so foolish in the terrors of <!--del_lnk--> Hades or the existence of <!--del_lnk--> Scyllas, <!--del_lnk--> centaurs or other composite creatures, but, on the other hand, the orator elsewhere complains of the superstitious and credulous character of the people. <i>De Natura Deorum</i> is the most comprehensive summary of Cicero&#39;s this line of thought.<p><a id="Syncretizing_trends" name="Syncretizing_trends"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Syncretizing trends</span></h3>

      <p>During the Roman era appears a popular trend to syncretize multiple Greek and foreign gods in strange, nearly unrecognizable new cults. Syncretization was also due to the fact that the Romans had little <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_mythology.htm" title="Roman mythology">mythology</a> of their own, and inherited the Greek mythological tradition; therefore, the major Roman gods were syncretized with those of the Greeks. In addition to this combination of the two mythological tradition, the association of the Romans with eastern religions led to further syncretizations. For instance, the cult of Sun was introduced in Rome after <!--del_lnk--> Aurelian&#39;s successful campaigns in <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a>. The asiatic divinities <!--del_lnk--> Mithras (that is to say, the Sun) and Ba&#39;al were combined with <a href="../../wp/a/Apollo.htm" title="Apollo">Apollo</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Helios into one <!--del_lnk--> Sol Invictus, with conglomerated rites and compound attributes. Apollo might be increasingly identified in religion with Helios or even Dionysus, texts retelling his myths seldom reflected such developments. The traditional literary mythology was increasingly dissociated from actual religious practice.<p>The surviving 2nd century collection of <!--del_lnk--> Orphic Hymns and <!--del_lnk--> Macrobius&#39;s <i>Saturnalia</i> are influenced by the theories of rationalism and the syncretizing trends as well. The Orphic Hymns are a set of pre-classical poetic compositions, attributed to the culture hero <!--del_lnk--> Orpheus, himself the subject of a renowned myth. In reality, these poems were probably composed by several different poets, and contain a rich set of clues about prehistoric European mythology. The stated purpose of the <i>Saturnalia</i> is to transmit the Hellenic culture he has derived from his reading, even though much of his treatment of gods is colored by Egyptian and North African mythology and theology (which also affect the interpretation of <a href="../../wp/v/Virgil.htm" title="Virgil">Virgil</a>). In Saturnalia reappear mythographical comments influenced by the euhemerists, the Stoics and the Neoplatonists.<p><a id="Modern_interpretations" name="Modern_interpretations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Modern interpretations</span></h2>
      <p>The genesis of modern understanding of Greek mythology is regarded by some scholars as a double reaction at the end of the eighteenth century against &quot;the traditional attitude of Christian animosity&quot;, in which the Christian reinterpretation of myth as a &quot;lie&quot; or <!--del_lnk--> fable had been retained. In Germany, by about 1795, there was a growing interest in Homer and Greek mythology. In <!--del_lnk--> G&ouml;ttingen <!--del_lnk--> Johann Matthias Gesner began to revive Greek studies, while his successor, <!--del_lnk--> Christian Gottlob Heyne, worked with <!--del_lnk--> Johann Joachim Winckelmann, and laid the foundations for mythological research both in Germany and elsewhere.<p><a id="Comparative_and_psychoanalytic_approaches" name="Comparative_and_psychoanalytic_approaches"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Comparative and psychoanalytic approaches</span></h3>

      <p><a href="../../wp/s/Sigmund_Freud.htm" title="Sigmund Freud">Sigmund Freud</a> introduced a transhistorical and biological conception of man and a view of myth as an expression of repressed ideas. Dream interpretation is the basis of Freudian myth interpretation and Freud&#39;s concept of dreamwork recognizes the importance of contextual relationships for the interpretation of any individual element in a dream. This suggestion would find an important point of rapprochment between the structuralist and psychoanalytic approaches to myth in Freud&#39;s thought. Carl Jung extended the transhistorical, psychological approach with his theory of the &quot;collective unconscious&quot; and the archetypes (inherited &quot;archaic&quot; patterns), often encoded in myth, that arise out of it. According to Jung, &quot;myth-forming structural elements must be present in the unconscious psyche&quot;. Comparing Jung&#39;s methodology with <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Campbell&#39;s theory, Robert A. Segal concludes that &quot;to interpret a myth Campbell simply identifies the archetypes in it. An interpretation of the Odyssey, for example, would show how Odysseus&rsquo;s life conforms to a heroic pattern.

      <p>There are various modern theories about the origins of Greek mythology. According to the Scriptural theory, all mythological legends are derived from the narratives of the <!--del_lnk--> Scriptures, though the real facts have been disguised and altered. According to the Historical Theory all the persons mentioned in mythology were once real human beings, and the legends relating to them are merely the additions of later times. Thus the story of <!--del_lnk--> Aeolus is supposed to have risen from the fact that Aeolus was the ruler of some islands in the <!--del_lnk--> Tyrrhenian Sea. The Allegorical theory supposes that all the ancient myths were allegorical and symbolical. According to the Physical theory the elements of air, fire, and water were originally the objects of religious adoration, and the principal deities were personifications of the powers of nature. Max M&uuml;ller attempted to understand an <!--del_lnk--> Indo-European religious form by tracing it back to its Aryan, Vedic, &quot;original&quot; manifestation. In 1891, he claimed that &quot;the most important discovery which has been made duting the nineteenth century with respect to the ancient history of mankind [...] was this sample equation: <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> <!--del_lnk--> Dyaus-pitar = Greek Zeus = Latin <a href="../../wp/j/Jupiter_%2528mythology%2529.htm" title="Jupiter (mythology)">Jupiter</a> = Old Norse <!--del_lnk--> Tyr&quot;. In other cases, close parallels in character and function suggest a common heritage, yet lack of linguistic evidence makes it difficult to prove, as in the comparison between Uranus and the Sanskrit <!--del_lnk--> Varuna or the <!--del_lnk--> Moirae and the <!--del_lnk--> Norns.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Archaeology and mythography, on the other hand, has revealed that the Greeks were inspired by some of the civilizations of Asia Minor and the Near East. <!--del_lnk--> Adonis seems to be the Greek counterpart &mdash; more clearly in cult than in myth &mdash; of a Near Eastern dying god; <!--del_lnk--> Cybele is rooted in <!--del_lnk--> Anatolian culture; much of <!--del_lnk--> Aphrodite&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> iconography springs from Semitic goddesses, and parallels between the earliest divine generations (Chaos and its children) and <!--del_lnk--> Tiamat in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Enuma Elish</i> are also possible According to Meyer Reinhold, &quot;near Eastern theogonic concepts, involving divine succession through violence and generational conflicts for power, found their way [...] into Greek mythology&quot;. In addition to Indo-European and Near Eastern origins, some scholars have speculated on the debts of Greek mythology to the pre-Hellenic societies; Crete, <!--del_lnk--> Mycenae, <!--del_lnk--> Pylos, <!--del_lnk--> Thebes and <!--del_lnk--> Orchomenos figure so large in later Greek mythology. Historians of religion were fascinated by a number of apparently ancient configurations of myth connencted with Crete (the god as bull, Zeus and Europa, <!--del_lnk--> Pasiphae who yields to the bull and gives birth to the <!--del_lnk--> Minotaur etc.) Professor Martin P. Nilsson concluded that all great classical Greek myths were tied to Mycenaen centres and were anchored in pehistoric times. Nevertheless, according to Burkert, the iconography of the Cretan Palace Period has provided almost no confirmation of all these theories.<p><a id="Motifs_in_western_art_and_literature" name="Motifs_in_western_art_and_literature"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Motifs in western art and literature</span></h2>

      <p>The widespread adoption of <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> would not curb the popularity of the myths; with the rediscovery of classical antiquity in <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, the poetry of Ovid became a major influence on the imagination of poets, dramatists, musicians and artists.

By the end of the century, <a href="../../wp/r/Romanticism.htm" title="Romanticism">Romanticism</a> initiated a surge of enthusiam for all things Greek, including Greek mythology. In Britain, new translations of Greek tragedies and Homer inspired contemporary poets (such as <!--del_lnk--> Alfred Lord Tennyson, <!--del_lnk--> Keats, <a href="../../wp/g/George_Byron%252C_6th_Baron_Byron.htm" title="Byron">Byron</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Shelley) and painters (such as <!--del_lnk--> Lord Leighton and <!--del_lnk--> Lawrence Alma-Tadema). <!--del_lnk--> Christoph Gluck, <!--del_lnk--> Richard Strauss, <!--del_lnk--> Jacques Offenbach and many others set Greek mythological themes to music.
