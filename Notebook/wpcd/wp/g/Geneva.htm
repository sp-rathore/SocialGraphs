      <p><i>Geneva</i> was the name of a settlement of the <!--del_lnk--> Celtic people of the <!--del_lnk--> Allobroges. The name of <i>Genava</i> (or <i>Genua</i>) in <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> appeared for the first time in the writings of <a href="../../wp/j/Julius_Caesar.htm" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> in <i><!--del_lnk--> De Bello Gallico</i>, his comments on the <!--del_lnk--> Gallic Wars. Its name may be identical in origin to the name of the <!--del_lnk--> Ligurian city of <i>Genua</i> (modern <a href="../../wp/g/Genoa.htm" title="Genoa">Genoa</a>), meaning &quot;knee&quot;, that is, &quot;angle&quot;, referring to its geographical position; though more likely is based on the root gen- &#39;birth&#39; (Genawa is at the birth of the river from the womb of the lake; perhaps the name in full means &#39;birth-water&#39;). After the Roman conquest it became part of the <i>Provincia Romana</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Gallia Narbonensis). In 58 BC, at Geneva, Caesar hemmed in the <!--del_lnk--> Helvetii on their westward march. In the 9th century it became the capital of <!--del_lnk--> Burgundy. Though Geneva was contested among Burgundians and Franks and the Holy Roman Emperors, in practice it was ruled by its <!--del_lnk--> Prince-bishops, until the <!--del_lnk--> Reformation, when Geneva became a <!--del_lnk--> republic.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Due to the work of <!--del_lnk--> reformers such as <a href="../../wp/j/John_Calvin.htm" title="John Calvin">John Calvin</a>, Geneva was sometimes dubbed <i>the Protestant Rome</i>. In the 16th century Geneva was the centre of <!--del_lnk--> Calvinism; the <!--del_lnk--> St. Pierre Cathedral in what is now called the Old Town was John Calvin&#39;s own church. During the time when England was ruled by the Catholic Queen <!--del_lnk--> Mary I Tudor, who persecuted Protestants, a number of Protestant scholars fled to Geneva. Among these scholars was <!--del_lnk--> William Whittingham who supervised the translation of the <!--del_lnk--> Geneva Bible in collaboration with Miles Coverdale, Christopher Goodman, Anthony Gilby, Thomas Sampson and William Cole.<p>One of the most important events in Geneva&#39;s history is <i><!--del_lnk--> l&#39;Escalade</i> (literally: &quot;the scaling of the wall&quot;). For the people of Geneva, l&#39;Escalade is the symbol of their independence. It marked the final attempt in a series of assaults mounted throughout the 16th century by <!--del_lnk--> Savoy, which wanted to annex Geneva as its capital north of the Alps. This last assault happened on the night of 11-<!--del_lnk--> 12 December <!--del_lnk--> 1602 and is celebrated yearly in the Old Town with numerous demonstrations and a parade of horses, cannons and armed men in period costumes.<p>Geneva, or officially the <i>Canton &amp; Republic of Geneva</i>, became a canton of Switzerland in 1815. The first of the <!--del_lnk--> Geneva Conventions was signed in 1864, to protect the sick and wounded in war time.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>Geneva is located at 46&deg;12 North, 6&deg;09&#39; East, at the south-western end of <!--del_lnk--> Lake Geneva, where the lake flows into the <!--del_lnk--> Rh&ocirc;ne River. It is surrounded by two mountain chains, the <!--del_lnk--> Alps and the <!--del_lnk--> Jura.<p>The city of Geneva has an area of 15.86 km&sup2;, while the area of the <!--del_lnk--> Canton of Geneva is 282 km&sup2;, including the two small enclaves of <!--del_lnk--> C&eacute;ligny in <!--del_lnk--> Vaud. The part of the Lake that is attached to Geneva has an area of 38 km&sup2; and is sometimes referred to as <i>Petit lac</i> (<i>small lake</i>). The Canton has only a 4.5 km border with the rest of Switzerland; out of a total of 107.5 km of borders, the remaining 103 are shared with <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, with the <!--del_lnk--> D&eacute;partment de l&#39;Ain to the North and the <!--del_lnk--> D&eacute;partement de la Haute-Savoie to the South.<p>The altitude of Geneva is 373.6 m, and corresponds to the altitude of the largest of the <!--del_lnk--> Pierres du Niton, two large rocks emerging from the lake which date from the last ice age. This rock was chosen by General <!--del_lnk--> Guillaume Henri Dufour as the reference point for all surveying in Switzerland <!--del_lnk--> .<p>The second main river of Geneva is the <!--del_lnk--> Arve River which flows into the <!--del_lnk--> Rh&ocirc;ne River just west of the city centre.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>
      <p>As of 2004, the population of the Commune (city) of Geneva was 185,526, while 438,500 people lived in the Canton of Geneva; around 700,000 people live in the Geneva urban community, which extends into Vaud Canton and neighboring France.<p>The population of the Canton is split between 145,200 people originally from Geneva (33.1%), 123,400 Swiss from other cantons (28.2%) and 169,000 foreigners (38.7%), from 180 different countries.

Most of the drinkable water (80%) is extracted from the <!--del_lnk--> lake; the remaining 20% is provided by <!--del_lnk--> groundwater originally formed by infiltration from the <!--del_lnk--> Arve River. 30% of the Canton&#39;s needs in electricity are locally produced, mainly by three <!--del_lnk--> hydroelectric <a href="../../wp/d/Dam.htm" title="Dam">dams</a> on the <!--del_lnk--> Rhone River (Seujet, Verbois and Chancy-Pougny). In addition, 13% of the electricity produced in the Canton is made from the heat induced by the burning of waste at the <!--del_lnk--> waste incineration facility of <!--del_lnk--> Les Cheneviers. The remaining needs (57%) are covered by imports from other cantons in Switzerland or other European countries; SIG buys only electricity produced by <!--del_lnk--> renewable methods, and in particular does not use electricity produced using <!--del_lnk--> nuclear reactors or <!--del_lnk--> fossil fuels. Natural gas is available in the City of Geneva, as well as in about two-thirds of the municipalities of the canton, and is imported from western Europe by the Swiss company <!--del_lnk--> Gaznat. SIG also provides telecommunication facilities to carriers, service providers and large enterprises. From 2003 to 2005 &quot;Voisin, voisine&quot; a <!--del_lnk--> Fibre to the Home pilot project with a <!--del_lnk--> Triple play offering was launched to test the end-user market in the Charmilles district.<p><a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h2>

The Cathedral and towers, which both embody the high point of the Reformed tradition and explores the origins of Christianity in its <i>archaeological site</i>, is now complemented by the International Museum of the Reformation, on the ground floor of the Maison Mallet. An underground passage, reopened when the Museum was created, connects the two buildings and a pass is now available for visitors to enjoy all three areas.<p>The city&#39;s most noted landmark is a <!--del_lnk--> fountain: the <!--del_lnk--> Jet d&#39;Eau (<i>water-jet</i>), situated in Lake Geneva. Its 140-metre-high water column is visible from many parts of the city.<h3> <span class="mw-headline">Theatre</span></h3>

      <p>As the Geneva authorities say, the history of the city is closely related to that of the foreign communities. Ever since the migration of foreigners to Geneva, these communities have found refuge, bringing their know-how, their customs and hope of a new life. They have widely participated in the international influence of Geneva, to its economic prosperity, and also to the spreading of views and of science.<p><a id="Religious_communities" name="Religious_communities"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Religious communities</span></h3>
      <p>There are quite many communities in Geneva. Religious communities are very diverse. Even if Geneva is supposed to be the Protestant Rome, many religions meet in Geneva. Beside the Protestants, the Catholics have been more and more numerous thanks to immigration from latin countries. The Jewish community is one of the oldest of Switzerland, and the more recent Muslim community is emerging in this city which respects all communities.<p><a id="Foreign_communities" name="Foreign_communities"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Foreign communities</span></h3>
      <p>Even though Geneva is not a very large metropolis on the world scale, foreign communities are extremely diverse and numerous due to the fact that many UN agencies and NGOs are based in Geneva. Basically every nationality is represented in Geneva. Expatriates, including short-term ones, play an important part in the city&#39;s social life. The website Genevaonline (genevaonline.ch) was set up by expats to improve networking among people from different nationalities.<p><a id="LGBT_community" name="LGBT_community"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">LGBT community</span></h3>
      <p>Many other communities or minorities are also very well represented in Geneva, including sexual minorities, with no less than three organizations in Geneva. Dialogai, a gay organization, Lestime, a lesbian organization, and association 360, a mixed organization.<p><a id="Trivia" name="Trivia"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Trivia</span></h2>
      <p>Since 1818, a particular <a href="../../wp/c/Chestnut.htm" title="Chestnut">chestnut tree</a> is used as the official &quot;herald of the <a href="../../wp/s/Spring_%2528season%2529.htm" title="Spring (season)">spring</a>&quot; in Geneva. The <i>sautier</i> (secretary of the Parliament of the Canton of Geneva) observes the tree and notes the day of arrival of the first bud. While this event has no practical impact, the sautier issues a formal press release and the local newspaper will usually mention the news. In 2006, the first bud appeared on <!--del_lnk--> 14 March.<p>In 2000, Geneva was awarded the <!--del_lnk--> Wakker Prize for the development and preservation of its architectural heritage.<p><a id="Famous_Literature_involving_Geneva" name="Famous_Literature_involving_Geneva"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Famous Literature involving Geneva</span></h2>
