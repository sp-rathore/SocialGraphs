      <p>The <b>greenhouse effect</b>, discovered by <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Fourier in <!--del_lnk--> 1824 and first investigated quantitatively by <!--del_lnk--> Svante Arrhenius in <!--del_lnk--> 1896, is the process in which the emission of <!--del_lnk--> infrared radiation by an <!--del_lnk--> atmosphere warms a <a href="../../wp/p/Planet.htm" title="Planet">planet</a>&#39;s surface. The name comes from an incorrect <!--del_lnk--> analogy with the warming of air inside a <!--del_lnk--> greenhouse compared to the air outside the greenhouse. The Earth&#39;s average surface temperature is about 20-30&deg;C warmer than it would be without the greenhouse effect <!--del_lnk--> . In addition to the Earth, <!--del_lnk--> Mars and especially <!--del_lnk--> Venus have greenhouse effects.<p>In common usage, &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; may refer either to the natural greenhouse effect due to naturally occurring greenhouse gases, or to the enhanced (<!--del_lnk--> anthropogenic) greenhouse effect which results from gases emitted as a result of human activities (see also <a href="../../wp/g/Global_warming.htm" title="Global warming">global warming</a>, <!--del_lnk--> scientific opinion on climate change and <!--del_lnk--> attribution of recent climate change).<script type="text/javascript">

      <p>The Earth receives energy from the Sun in the form of <!--del_lnk--> radiation. The Earth reflects about 30% of the incident solar flux; the remaining 70% is absorbed, warming the land, atmosphere and oceans.<p>To the extent that the Earth is in a <!--del_lnk--> steady state, the energy stored in the atmosphere and ocean does not change in time, so energy equal to the absorbed <!--del_lnk--> solar radiation must be radiated back to space. Earth radiates energy into space as <!--del_lnk--> black-body radiation, which maintains a thermal equilibrium. This thermal, <!--del_lnk--> infrared <!--del_lnk--> radiation increases with increasing temperature. One can think of the Earth&#39;s temperature as being determined by the infrared flux needed to balance the absorbed solar flux.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The reason this warms the surface is most easily understood by starting with a simplified model of a purely radiative greenhouse effect that ignores energy transfer in the atmosphere by convection (sensible heat transport) and by the <!--del_lnk--> evaporation and <!--del_lnk--> condensation of <!--del_lnk--> water vapor (<!--del_lnk--> latent heat transport). In this purely radiative case, one can think of the atmosphere as emitting infrared radiation both upwards and downwards. The upward infrared flux emitted by the surface must balance not only the absorbed solar flux but also this downward infrared flux emitted by the atmosphere. The surface temperature will rise until it generates thermal radiation equivalent to the sum of these two incident radiation streams.<p>A more realistic picture taking into account the convective and latent heat fluxes is somewhat more complex. But the following simple model captures the essence. The starting point is to note that the opacity of the atmosphere to infrared radiation determines the height in the atmosphere from which most of the photons emitted to space are emitted. If the atmosphere is more opaque, the typical photon escaping to space will be emitted from higher in the atmosphere, because one then has to go to higher altitudes to <i>see</i> out to space in the infrared. Since the emission of infrared radiation is a function of temperature, it is the temperature of the atmosphere at this emission level that is effectively determined by the requirement that the emitted flux balance the absorbed solar flux.<p>But the temperature of the atmosphere generally decreases with height above the surface, at a rate of roughly 6.5 &deg;C per kilometer on average, until one reaches the <!--del_lnk--> stratosphere 10-15 km above the surface. (Most infrared photons escaping to space are emitted by the <!--del_lnk--> troposphere, the region bounded by the surface and the stratosphere, so we can ignore the stratosphere in this simple picture.) A very simple model, but one that proves to be remarkably useful, involves the assumption that this temperature profile is simply fixed, by the non-radiative energy fluxes. Given the temperature at the emission level of the infrared flux escaping to space, one then computes the surface temperature by increasing temperature at the rate of 6.5 &deg;C per kilometer, the environmental <!--del_lnk--> lapse rate, until one reaches the surface. The more opaque the atmosphere, and the higher the emission level of the escaping infrared radiation, the warmer the surface, since one then needs to follow this lapse rate over a larger distance in the vertical. While less intuitive than the purely radiative greenhouse effect, this less familiar <i>radiative-convective</i> picture is the starting point for most discussions of the greenhouse effect in the <!--del_lnk--> climate modeling literature.<p>The term &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; is a source of confusion in that actual greenhouses do not warm by this same mechanism (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> ).<p><a id="The_greenhouse_gases" name="The_greenhouse_gases"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">The greenhouse gases</span></h2>

      <p><a href="../../wp/q/Quantum_mechanics.htm" title="Quantum mechanics">Quantum mechanics</a> provides the basis for computing the interactions between <!--del_lnk--> molecules and radiation. Most of this interaction occurs when the <!--del_lnk--> frequency of the radiation closely matches that of the <!--del_lnk--> spectral lines of the molecule, determined by the quantization of the modes of vibration and rotation of the molecule. (The electronic excitations are generally not relevant for infrared radiation, as they require energy larger than that in an infrared photon.)<p>The width of a spectral line is an important element in understanding its importance for the absorption of radiation. In the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere these spectral widths are primarily determined by &ldquo;pressure broadening&rdquo;, which is the distortion of the spectrum due to the collision with another molecule. Most of the infrared absorption in the atmosphere can be thought of as occurring while two molecules are colliding. The absorption due to a photon interacting with a lone molecule is relatively small. This three-body aspect of the problem, one photon and two molecules, makes direct quantum mechanical computation for molecules of interest more challenging. Careful laboratory <!--del_lnk--> spectroscopic measurements, rather than <i>ab initio</i> quantum mechanical computations, provide the basis for most of the radiative transfer calculations used in studies of the atmosphere.<p>The molecules/atoms that constitute the bulk of the atmosphere; <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> (O<sub>2</sub>), <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen.htm" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a> (N<sub>2</sub>) and <a href="../../wp/a/Argon.htm" title="Argon">argon</a>; do not interact with infrared radiation significantly. While the oxygen and nitrogen molecules can vibrate, because of their symmetry these vibrations do not create any transient charge separation that enhances the interaction with radiation. In the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, the dominant infrared absorbing gases are <!--del_lnk--> water vapor, <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, and <a href="../../wp/o/Ozone.htm" title="Ozone">ozone</a> (O<sub>3</sub>), these molecules being &ldquo;floppier&rdquo; so that their rotation/vibration modes are more easily excited. For example, carbon dioxide is a linear molecule, but it has an important vibrational mode in which the molecule bends with the carbon in the middle moving one way and the oxygens on the ends moving the other way, creating some charge separation, a <!--del_lnk--> dipole moment. A substantial part of the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide exists because this vibration is easily excited by infrared radiation. Clouds are also very important infrared absorbers. Therefore, water has multiple effects on infrared radiation, through its vapor phase and through its condensed phases. Other absorbers of significance include <!--del_lnk--> methane, <!--del_lnk--> nitrous oxide and the <!--del_lnk--> chlorofluorocarbons.<p>Discussion of the relative importance of different infrared absorbers is confused by the overlap between the spectral lines due to different gases, widened by pressure broadening. As a result, the absorption due to one gas cannot be thought of as independent of the presence of other gases. One convenient approach is to remove the chosen constituent, leaving all other absorbers, and the temperatures, untouched, and monitoring the infrared radiation escaping to space. The reduction in infrared absorbtion is then a measure of the importance of that constituent. More precisely, define the greenhouse effect (GE) to be the difference between the infrared radiation that the surface would radiate to space if there were no atmosphere and the actual infrared radiation escaping to space. Then compute the percentage reduction in GE when a constituent is removed. The table below is computed by this method, using a particular 1-dimensional model of the atmosphere. More recent 3D computations lead to similar results.<center>

      <p>By this particular measure, water vapor can be thought of as providing 36% of the greenhouse effect, and carbon dioxide 12%, but the effect of removal of both of these constituents will be greater than 48%. An additional proviso is that these numbers are computed holding the cloud distribution fixed. But removing water vapor from the atmosphere while holding clouds fixed is not likely to be physically relevant. In addition, the effects of a given gas are typically nonlinear in the amount of that gas, since the absorption by the gas at one level in the atmosphere can remove photons that would otherwise interact with the gas at another altitude. The kinds of estimates presented in the table, while often encountered in the controversies surrounding global warming, must be treated with caution. Different estimates found in different sources typically result from different definitions and do not reflect uncertainties in the underlying radiative transfer.<p><a id="Positive_feedback_and_runaway_greenhouse_effect" name="Positive_feedback_and_runaway_greenhouse_effect"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Positive feedback and runaway greenhouse effect</span></h2>
      <p>When the concentration of a greenhouse gas (<b>A</b>) is itself a function of temperature, there is a <!--del_lnk--> positive feedback from the increase in another greenhouse gas (<b>B</b>), whereby increase in B increases the temperature which, in turn, increases the concentration of A, which increases temperatures further, and so on. This feedback is bound to stop, since the overall supply of the gas A must be finite. If this feedback ends after producing a major temperature increase, it is called a <b>runaway greenhouse effect</b>.<p>According to some climate models (<!--del_lnk--> Clathrate gun hypothesis), such a <a href="../../wp/g/Greenhouse_effect.htm" title="Runaway greenhouse effect">runaway greenhouse effect</a>, involving liberation of methane gas from hydrates by global warming, caused the <!--del_lnk--> Permian-Triassic extinction event. It is also thought that large quantities of methane could be released from the Siberian tundra as it begins to thaw, methane being 21-times more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide <!--del_lnk--> .<p>A runaway greenhouse effect involving CO<sub>2</sub> and water vapor may have occurred on <a href="../../wp/v/Venus.htm" title="Venus">Venus</a>. On Venus today there is little water vapor in the atmosphere. If water vapor did contribute to the warmth of Venus at one time, this water is thought to have escaped to space. Venus is sufficiently strongly heated by the Sun that water vapor can rise much higher in the atmosphere and is split into <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> by ultraviolet light. The hydrogen can then escape from the atmosphere and the oxygen recombines. Carbon dioxide, the dominant greenhouse gas in the current Venusian atmosphere, likely owes its larger concentration to the weakness of carbon recycling as compared to Earth, where the carbon dioxide emitted from volcanoes is efficiently subducted into the Earth by plate tectonics on geologic time scales<!--del_lnk--> ,<!--del_lnk--> .<p><a id="Anthropogenic_greenhouse_effect" name="Anthropogenic_greenhouse_effect"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Anthropogenic greenhouse effect</span></h2>

      <p>The term &#39;greenhouse effect&#39; originally came from the greenhouses used for gardening, but it is a misnomer since greenhouses operate differently <!--del_lnk-->  <!--del_lnk--> . A greenhouse is built of glass; it heats up primarily because the Sun warms the ground inside it, which warms the air near the ground, and this air is prevented from rising and flowing away. The warming inside a greenhouse thus occurs by suppressing convection and turbulent mixing. This can be demonstrated by opening a small window near the roof of a greenhouse: the temperature will drop considerably. It has also been demonstrated experimentally (Wood, 1909): a &quot;greenhouse&quot; built of rock salt (which is transparent to IR) heats up just as one built of glass does. Greenhouses thus work primarily by preventing <i><!--del_lnk--> convection</i>; the atmospheric greenhouse effect however reduces <i>radiation loss</i>, not convection. It is quite common, however, to find sources (e.g., <!--del_lnk-->  <!--del_lnk--> ) that make the &quot;greenhouse&quot; analogy. Although the primary mechanism for warming greenhouses is the prevention of mixing with the free atmosphere, the radiative properties of the glazing can still be important to commercial growers. With the modern development of new plastic surfaces and glazings for greenhouses, this has permitted construction of greenhouses which selectively control radiation transmittance in order to better control the growing environment <span class="PDFlink"><!--del_lnk--> </span><span style="font-size:smaller;"><!--del_lnk--> PDF&nbsp;(271&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> KiB)</span>.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect&quot;</div>
