      <p><b>Gibraltar</b> is a <!--del_lnk--> UK overseas territory located near the southernmost tip of the <!--del_lnk--> Iberian Peninsula, overlooking the <!--del_lnk--> Strait of Gibraltar. The territory shares a land border with <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> to the north. Gibraltar has historically been an important base for the <!--del_lnk--> British Armed Forces and is the site of a British naval base.<p>The name of the territory is derived from the original <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> name <i>Jabal &#x162;&#x101;riq</i> (&#x62C;&#x628;&#x644; &#x637;&#x627;&#x631;&#x642;), meaning &quot;mountain of Tariq&quot;. It refers to the <!--del_lnk--> Berber <!--del_lnk--> Umayyad general <!--del_lnk--> Tariq ibn-Ziyad, who led the <!--del_lnk--> Moorish invasion of Iberia in <!--del_lnk--> 711. Earlier, it was known as <i>Mons Calpe</i>, one of the <!--del_lnk--> Pillars of Hercules. Today, Gibraltar is known colloquially as &quot;Gib&quot; or &quot;the Rock&quot;.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> sovereignty of Gibraltar is a major issue of contention in Anglo-Spanish relations. <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> requests the return of sovereignty, ceded by Spain in perpetuity in 1713. Any transfer has been consistently and totally rejected by almost all Gibraltarians.<p>

      <p>Human settlement in Gibraltar can be traced back to the <!--del_lnk--> Phoenicians around <!--del_lnk--> 950 BC, although there is earlier evidence of habitation by the <!--del_lnk--> Neanderthals, an extinct species of the <!--del_lnk--> Homo genus. Semi-permanent settlements were later established by the <!--del_lnk--> Carthaginians and <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a>. After the collapse of the Roman Empire, Gibraltar came briefly under the control of the <!--del_lnk--> Vandals, and would later form part of the Visigothic Kingdom of <!--del_lnk--> Hispania until its collapse due to the <!--del_lnk--> Muslim conquest in 711 AD. At that time, Gibraltar was named as one of the <!--del_lnk--> Pillars of Hercules, after the legend of the creation of the <!--del_lnk--> Straits of Gibraltar.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> April 30, <!--del_lnk--> 711, the <!--del_lnk--> Umayyad general <!--del_lnk--> Tariq ibn Ziyad led a <!--del_lnk--> Berber-dominated army across the Strait from <!--del_lnk--> Ceuta. He first attempted to land at <!--del_lnk--> Algeciras but failed. Subsequently, he landed undetected at the southern point of the Rock from present-day <a href="../../wp/m/Morocco.htm" title="Morocco">Morocco</a> in his quest for Spain. Little was built during the first four centuries of <!--del_lnk--> Moorish control.<p>The first permanent settlement was built by the <!--del_lnk--> Almohad Sultan <!--del_lnk--> Abd al-Mu&#39;min, who ordered the construction of a fortification on the Rock, the remains of which are still present. Gibraltar would later become part of the Taifa Kingdom of Granada until 1309, when it would be briefly occupied by Castilian troops. In 1333 it was conquered by the <!--del_lnk--> Marinids who had invaded Muslim Spain. The Marinids ceded Gibraltar to the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Granada in 1374. Finally, it was <!--del_lnk--> reconquered definitively by the <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Medina Sidonia in 1462, ending 750 years of Moorish control.<p>In the initial years under Medina Sidonia, Gibraltar was granted sovereignty as a home to a population of exiled <!--del_lnk--> Sephardic Jews. <!--del_lnk--> Pedro de Herrera, a Jewish <!--del_lnk--> converso from <!--del_lnk--> C&oacute;rdoba who had led the conquest of Gibraltar, led a group of 4,350 Jews from C&oacute;rdoba and <!--del_lnk--> Seville to establish themselves in the town. A community was built and a garrison established to defend the peninsula. However, this lasted only 3 years. In 1476, the Duke of Medina Sidonia realigned with the Spanish Crown; the <!--del_lnk--> Sefardim were then forced back to C&oacute;rdoba and the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish Inquisition. Gibraltar would not pass under the hands of the Spanish Crown until 1501. One year later, the <!--del_lnk--> Catholic Monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella granted Gibraltar a coat of arms.<div class="thumb tright">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>The naval Battle of Gibraltar took place on 1607-04-25 during the <!--del_lnk--> Eighty Years&#39; War when a Dutch fleet surprised and engaged a Spanish fleet anchored at the Bay of Gibraltar. During the 4-hour action, the entire Spanish fleet was destroyed.<p>During the <a href="../../wp/w/War_of_the_Spanish_Succession.htm" title="War of the Spanish Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>, British and Dutch troops, allies of <!--del_lnk--> Archduke Charles, the Austrian pretender to the Spanish Crown, formed a Confederate fleet and attacked various towns on the southern coast of Spain. On <!--del_lnk--> 4 August <!--del_lnk--> 1704, after six hours of bombardment starting at 5 a.m., the confederate fleet, commanded by Admiral Sir George Rooke, captured the town of Gibraltar in the name of the Archduke Charles. <!--del_lnk--> Terms of surrender were agreed upon, after the majority of the population (some four thousand) chose to leave Gibraltar.<p>Franco-Spanish troops failed to retake the town, and British sovereignty over Gibraltar was subsequently recognised by the 1713 <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Utrecht, which ended the war. Spain ceded Gibraltar and <!--del_lnk--> Minorca to the United Kingdom, which has retained sovereignty over the former ever since, despite all attempts by Spain to recapture it.<p>Gibraltar subsequently became an important naval base for the <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Navy.htm" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> and played an important part in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Trafalgar. Its strategic value increased with the opening of the <a href="../../wp/s/Suez_Canal.htm" title="Suez Canal">Suez Canal</a>, as it controlled the important sea route between the UK and its colonies in <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>. During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the civilian residents of Gibraltar were evacuated, and the Rock was turned into a fortress. An <!--del_lnk--> airfield was built over the civilian racecourse. Guns on Gibraltar controlled the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea, but plans by <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> to capture the Rock, codenamed <!--del_lnk--> Operation Felix, were frustrated by Spain&#39;s reluctance to allow the <!--del_lnk--> German Army onto Spanish soil. Germany&#39;s Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Wilhelm Canaris, head of the <!--del_lnk--> Abwehr, also helped by filing a pointedly negative assessment of the options. Canaris was a leader of the German high command resistance to Hitler, and it is thought that he frustrated the attack to limit Germany&#39;s aggression.<p>In the <!--del_lnk--> 1950s, Spain, then under the dictatorship of <!--del_lnk--> Francisco Franco, renewed its claim to sovereignty over Gibraltar, sparked in part by the visit of <a href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1954 to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Rock&#39;s capture. For the next thirty years, Spain restricted movement between Gibraltar and Spain. A referendum was held on <!--del_lnk--> September 10, <!--del_lnk--> 1967, in which Gibraltar&#39;s voters were asked whether they wished to either pass under Spanish sovereignty, or remain under British sovereignty, with institutions of self-government. The vote was overwhelmingly in favour of continuance of British sovereignty, with 12,138 to 44 voting to reject Spanish sovereignty. In response, Spain completely closed the border with Gibraltar and severed all communication links.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1981 it was announced that <!--del_lnk--> The Prince and <!--del_lnk--> Princess of Wales would fly to Gibraltar to board the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Britannia</i> as part of their honeymoon. In response, the Spanish King, <!--del_lnk--> Juan Carlos I refused to attend their wedding in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1988, <!--del_lnk--> SAS troops foiled an attempted terrorist attack on the British Army Garrison by members of the <!--del_lnk--> IRA, an event that was subsequently the subject of a controversial British television <!--del_lnk--> documentary, <i><!--del_lnk--> Death on the Rock</i>.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The border with Spain was partially reopened in <!--del_lnk--> 1982, and fully reopened in <!--del_lnk--> 1985 after Spain&#39;s accession into the <!--del_lnk--> European Community. Joint talks on the future of the Rock held between Spain and the United Kingdom have occurred since the late <!--del_lnk--> 1980s, with various proposals for joint sovereignty discussed. However, another referendum organised in Gibraltar rejected the idea of joint sovereignty by 17,900 (98.97%) votes to 187 (1.03%). The British Government restated that, in accordance with the preamble of the constitution of Gibraltar, the &quot;UK will never enter into arrangements under which the people of Gibraltar would pass under the sovereignty of another state against their freely and democratically expressed wishes.&quot; The question of Gibraltar continues to affect Anglo-Spanish relations.<p>In September <!--del_lnk--> 2006 representatives of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, Gibraltar and <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> concluded in Cordoba, Spain, a landmark agreement on a range of cross-cutting issues affecting the Rock and the campo Gibraltar removing many of the restrictions imposed by <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>

There are three political parties currently represented in the House of Assembly: the <!--del_lnk--> Gibraltar Social Democrats, the <!--del_lnk--> Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party, and the <!--del_lnk--> Gibraltar Liberal Party.<p><!--del_lnk--> New Gibraltar Democracy and the <!--del_lnk--> Progressive Democratic Party have been formed since the 2003 election. The <!--del_lnk--> Reform Party and <!--del_lnk--> Gibraltar Labour Party, having failed to achieve any popular support, ceased operating in <!--del_lnk--> 2005.<p>Gibraltar is a part of the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a>, having joined under the British Treaty of Accession (<!--del_lnk--> 1973), with exemption from some areas such as the <!--del_lnk--> Customs Union and <!--del_lnk--> Common Agricultural Policy.<p>After a <!--del_lnk--> ten year campaign to exercise the right to vote in European Elections, from <!--del_lnk--> 2004, the people of Gibraltar participated in elections for the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Parliament.htm" title="European Parliament">European Parliament</a> as part of the <!--del_lnk--> South West England constituency. <!--del_lnk--> <p>As a result of the continued Spanish claim, the issue of <!--del_lnk--> sovereignty features strongly in Gibraltar politics. All local political parties are opposed to any transfer of sovereignty to Spain, instead supporting <!--del_lnk--> self-determination for the Rock. This policy is supported by the main UK opposition parties. In view of the UK Government&#39;s repeated commitment to respect the wishes of the people of Gibraltar, as laid out in the Constitution, the proposal for joint sovereignty is now considered dead.<p>In March <!--del_lnk--> 2006 <!--del_lnk--> Jack Straw <!--del_lnk--> announced that a new Gibraltar constitution had been agreed upon and would be published prior to a referendum on its acceptance in Gibraltar that year.<p>In July 2006, <!--del_lnk--> Geoff Hoon Minister for Europe, in a statement to the UK Parliament confirmed that the new Constitution confirms the right of self-determination of the Gibraltarian people.<!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>The British military traditionally dominated the economy of Gibraltar, with the naval dockyard providing the bulk of economic activity. This has however diminished in the last twenty years, and it is estimated to account for only 7% of the local economy, compared to over 60% in <!--del_lnk--> 1984.<p>Today, Gibraltar has an extensive service-based economy, dominated by <!--del_lnk--> financial services and <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">tourism</a>. Referred as an International Finance Centre , Gibraltar was among 35 jurisdictions identified by the <!--del_lnk--> OECD as a <!--del_lnk--> Tax haven in June <!--del_lnk--> 2000 . As a result of having made a commitment in accordance with the OECD&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> 2001 Progress Report on the OECD&#39;s Project on Harmful Tax Practices, Gibraltar will not be included in the next OECD&#39;s list of unco-operative tax havens . It has also never been listed on the <!--del_lnk--> FATF Blacklist of unco-operative countries in the fight against <!--del_lnk--> money laundering. It may also be referred to as an <!--del_lnk--> Offshore Financial Centre, by international institutions such as the <!--del_lnk--> IMF .<p>Fiscal advantages, including no tax on capital income, are offered to the over 8.000 offshore qualified companies registered in Gibraltar . After an agreement with the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 2005, this tax-exempt regime is due to disappear on the 31st of December <!--del_lnk--> 2010 .<p>Financial services and persons involved in the industry are regulated by the <!--del_lnk--> Financial Services Commission, which operates in a similar manner to the United Kingdom <!--del_lnk--> Financial Services Authority.<p>A number of British and international banks have operations based Gibraltar. Recently, a number of large bookmakers and online gaming operators have relocated to Gibraltar, to benefit from operating in a well regulated jurisdiction with a favourable tax regime.<p>Tourism is also a significant industry. Gibraltar is a popular stop for cruise ships and attracts day visitors from resorts in Spain. The Rock is a popular tourist attraction, particularly among British tourists and residents in the southern coast of Spain. It is also a popular shopping destination, and all goods and services are <!--del_lnk--> VAT free. Many of the large British high street chains have branches in Gibraltar, including <!--del_lnk--> Marks and Spencer, <!--del_lnk--> BHS, <!--del_lnk--> Dorothy Perkins, and the supermarket <!--del_lnk--> Morrisons.<p>Other areas of activity are services related to shipping, like bunkering, and ship repair and construction. The economy is considered to be strong and diversified.<p>Figures from the <!--del_lnk--> CIA World Factbook show that Gibraltar has a <!--del_lnk--> GDP of over &pound;432 million ($769 million) with a per capita figure of &pound;15,700 ($28,000). The main export markets in 2004 were <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> (19.4%), Spain (14.1%), <a href="../../wp/t/Turkmenistan.htm" title="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a> (12.1%), <a href="../../wp/s/Switzerland.htm" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> (11.7%), <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> (10.1%), the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> (9.1%), and <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greece</a> (6.8%).<p>The unit of currency in use is the <!--del_lnk--> Pound Sterling with notes issued by the Government of Gibraltar although there is an ISO code of <!--del_lnk--> GIP for the <!--del_lnk--> Gibraltar Pound.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>The population of Gibraltar was 27,884, (2005) and has been fairly constant around that number.<p>The Gibraltarians are often described either as English or Spanish, but they are a distinctive racial and cultural fusion of the many European immigrants who came to the Rock over 300 years. Gibraltarians are the descendants of economic migrants that came to Gibraltar after the majority of the Spanish population left in 1704 (185 Spaniards remained in 1753). Subsequently, <a href="../../wp/g/Genoa.htm" title="Genoa">Genoese</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Malta.htm" title="Malta">Maltese</a>, and <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> formed the majority of this new population. Other groups including Minorcans (forced to leave their homes when that island was returned to Spain in 1802), Sardinians, Sicilians, French, Germans, Italians, and, of course, the British. Immigration from Spain and intermarriage with Spaniards from the surrounding Spanish towns was a constant feature of Gibraltar&#39;s history until General Francisco Franco decided to close the border with Gibraltar, cutting off many Gibraltarians from their relatives on the Spanish side of the Frontier. The land frontier was opened by the Spanish Socialist Government, however other restrictions remain in place.<p>The main religion is Christianity, with the majority of Gibraltarians belonging to the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>. Christian religious minorities include the <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_England.htm" title="Church of England">Church of England</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Church of Scotland the <!--del_lnk--> Methodist Church, a ward of <!--del_lnk--> The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and <!--del_lnk--> Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses. There are also a number of <!--del_lnk--> Hindu Indians, a Moroccan <!--del_lnk--> Muslim population, and a long established <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> community.<p>The official language is <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a>, which is used for government and business purposes. Most Gibraltarians use <!--del_lnk--> Llanito (pronounced &quot;Yanito&quot;) as their <!--del_lnk--> vernacular language - a <!--del_lnk--> dialect of <!--del_lnk--> Andalusian Spanish, strongly influenced by English while incorporating some words not native to either.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

      <p>The culture of Gibraltar reflects Gibraltarians&#39; diverse origins. While there are <!--del_lnk--> Andalusian and British influences, the ethnic origins of most Gibraltarians are not confined to British or Andalusian ethnicities. Most ethnicities include Genoese, Maltese, Portuguese, and Germans. A handful of other Gibraltar residents are Jewish of <!--del_lnk--> Sephardic origin, <a href="../../wp/n/North_Africa.htm" title="North Africa">North African</a>, or Hindu.<p>British influence remains strong. Although Gibraltarians often speak to each other in an English-influenced Andalusian dialect called Yanito or Llanito, English is the language of government, commerce, education, and the media. Gibraltarians going on to higher education attend university in the UK. Patients requiring medical treatment not available on the Rock receive it there as private patients paid for by the Gibraltar Government.<p><!--del_lnk--> National Day is celebrated annually on September 10th.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Every year Gibraltar celebrates its National Day on 10th September to commemorate the 1967 referendum where with a massive majority the people of Gibraltar voted to reject annexation by Spain.<p>The day is a public holiday, and most Gibraltarians participate by dressing up in the National Colours of red and white and attending the political rally and other events held that day.<p>The political rally culminates with the release of 30,000 red and white balloons representing the number of people of Gibraltar.<p>A good description of the occasion by <!--del_lnk--> Andrew Rosindell MP is:<p><i>&quot;Gibraltar&#39;s national day, 10 September, is a magnificent celebration not only of Gibraltarians&#39; pride in being British but of their love of their homeland.</i>&quot;<p><a id="Gibraltar_UEFA_Membership" name="Gibraltar_UEFA_Membership"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Gibraltar UEFA Membership</span></h2>
      <p>The Gibraltar Football Association (GFA) applied to <!--del_lnk--> UEFA for independent membership of the football <!--del_lnk--> confederation, which would enable it to play as a national team in international matches in Europe and around the world (as participation in FIFA flows from UEFA membership).<p>The Spanish football federation has objected strongly to Gibraltarian membership, leading UEFA to deny entry to the GFA. However, following an appeal to the <!--del_lnk--> Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), UEFA have now been ordered to overturn their decision, and admit Gibraltar. The Spanish Government has threatened to withdraw Spanish teams, including their national side, from UEFA, although under current rules this would preclude Spanish involvement in all international football.<!--del_lnk--> <p>The GFA was founded in <!--del_lnk--> 1895 making it one of the oldest associations, and complies with all aspects of membership. The Spanish objection is based on its facilities being built on &#39;disputed land&#39;.<!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Famous_people_from_Gibraltar" name="Famous_people_from_Gibraltar"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Famous people from Gibraltar</span></h2>
