<h2>SOS Children in Ghana</h2>
<img src="../../wp/g/Ghana_Map.jpg" width="220" height="352" alt="SOS Children Sponsorship Sites in Ghana" class="left" /><p>The Republic of Ghana, formerly known as the Gold Coast, is on the coast of West Africa, bordered by Burkina Faso, Togo and the Ivory Coast. </p><p>Ghana is one of the world's poorest countries, with nearly 70 per cent of its population dependent on small scale farming. Malaria, acute respiratory infections, diarrhoea, malnutrition and measles remain the five leading killer diseases of children, but overall infant and under-five mortality rates are declining. </p><p>There are two SOS Children's communities in Ghana. The charity opened the first in Tema in 1971. Tema is an industrial town near the capital Accra. The second community, in Asiakwa, 100 kms north of Accra, opened in 1990. </p><p>The charity's Tema community has fifteen family houses and two youth houses. Here older children and young people live semi-independent lives while continuing their education or vocational training. The educational needs of both the SOS children and the local community - over 1000 children and young people -  are provided for by a kindergarten, three schools and a vocational training centre for girls. </p><p>The schools at Tema include an International College. Established in 1990 it offers courses leading to the International Baccalaureate and IGCSE to SOS children from all over Africa, as well as non-SOS Ghanaian children. Many students go on to university in Europe and the USA as well as Africa. </p><p>The community in Asiakwa has eight family houses built in traditional local style on the side of a hill. As well as a community day care centre, the village has a kindergarten and primary and secondary schools which are all used by local children as well as the SOS village children. Both villages have medical centres which between them treat over 2000 patients a year.</p><p>There are more details on our <a href="../../wp/g/Ghana_Cv_Tema.htm">SOS Children&rsquo;s Village Tema</a> in the 'projects' section of the website.</p><h3>Local Contacts</h3>
