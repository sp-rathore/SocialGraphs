      <p><b>Gregorian chant</b> is the central tradition of Western <!--del_lnk--> plainchant, a form of <!--del_lnk--> monophonic, unaccompanied <!--del_lnk--> sacred song of the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>. Gregorian chant developed mainly in the <a href="../../wp/f/Franks.htm" title="Franks">Frankish</a> lands of western and central Europe during the 9th and 10th centuries, with later additions and redactions. Although popular legend credits <!--del_lnk--> Pope Gregory the Great with inventing Gregorian chant, scholars believe that it arose from a later <!--del_lnk--> Carolingian synthesis of Roman and <!--del_lnk--> Gallican chant.<p>Gregorian chants are organized into eight scalar <!--del_lnk--> modes. Typical melodic features include characteristic <!--del_lnk--> incipits and <!--del_lnk--> cadences, the use of <!--del_lnk--> reciting tones around which the other notes of the <!--del_lnk--> melody revolve, and a vocabulary of musical motifs woven together through a process called <!--del_lnk--> centonization to create families of related chants. Instead of <!--del_lnk--> octave scales, six-note patterns called <!--del_lnk--> hexachords underlie the modes. These patterns use elements of the modern <!--del_lnk--> diatonic scale as well as what would now be called B flat. Gregorian melodies are transcribed using <!--del_lnk--> neumes, an early form of <!--del_lnk--> musical notation from which the modern <!--del_lnk--> five-line staff developed during the 16th century. Gregorian chant played a fundamental role in the development of <!--del_lnk--> polyphony.<p>Gregorian chant was traditionally sung by <!--del_lnk--> choirs of men and boys in churches, or by women and men of <!--del_lnk--> religious orders in their chapels. It is the music of the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Rite, performed in the <!--del_lnk--> Mass and the monastic <!--del_lnk--> Office. Gregorian chant supplanted or marginalized the other indigenous plainchant traditions of the Christian West to become the official music of the Roman Catholic liturgy. Although Gregorian chant is no longer obligatory, the Roman Catholic Church still officially considers it the music most suitable for worship. During the 20th century, Gregorian chant underwent a musicological and popular resurgence.<p>

      <p>Unaccompanied singing has been part of the <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christian</a> <!--del_lnk--> liturgy since the earliest days of the Church. Until the mid-1990s, it was widely accepted that the <!--del_lnk--> psalmody of <!--del_lnk--> ancient Jewish worship significantly influenced and contributed to <!--del_lnk--> early Christian ritual and chant. This view is no longer generally accepted by scholars, due to analysis that shows that most early Christian hymns did not have Psalms for texts, and that the Psalms were not sung in <!--del_lnk--> synagogues for centuries after the <!--del_lnk--> Destruction of the Second Temple in <a href="../../wp/a/Anno_Domini.htm" title="Anno Domini">AD&nbsp;</a>70. However, early Christian rites did incorporate elements of Jewish worship that survived in later chant tradition. <!--del_lnk--> Canonical hours have their roots in Jewish prayer hours. &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Amen&quot; and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> alleluia&quot; come from <a href="../../wp/h/Hebrew_language.htm" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a>, and the threefold &quot;<!--del_lnk--> sanctus&quot; derives from the threefold &quot;kadosh&quot; of the <!--del_lnk--> Kedusha.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> New Testament mentions singing hymns during the <a href="../../wp/l/Last_Supper.htm" title="Last Supper">Last Supper</a>: &quot;When they had sung the hymn, they went out to the <!--del_lnk--> Mount of Olives&quot; <!--del_lnk--> Matthew 26.30. Other ancient witnesses such as <!--del_lnk--> Pope Clement I, <!--del_lnk--> Tertullian, <!--del_lnk--> St. Athanasius, and the abbess <!--del_lnk--> Egeria confirm the practice, although in poetic or obscure ways that shed little light on how music sounded during this period. The 3rd-century Greek &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Oxyrhynchus hymn&quot; survived with musical notation, but the connection between this hymn and the plainchant tradition is uncertain.<p>Musical elements that would later be used in the Roman Rite began to appear in the 3rd century. The <i><!--del_lnk--> Apostolic Tradition</i>, attributed to the theologian <!--del_lnk--> Hippolytus, attests the singing of <!--del_lnk--> Hallel psalms with Alleluia as the refrain in early Christian <!--del_lnk--> <i>agape</i> feasts. Chants of the Office, sung during the canonical hours, have their roots in the early 4th century, when desert monks following <!--del_lnk--> St. Anthony introduced the practice of continuous psalmody, singing the complete cycle of 150 psalms each week. Around 375, <!--del_lnk--> antiphonal psalmody became popular in the Christian East; in 386, <!--del_lnk--> St. Ambrose introduced this practice to the West.<p>Scholars are still debating how plainchant developed during the 5th through the 9th centuries, as information from this period is scarce. Around 410, <a href="../../wp/a/Augustine_of_Hippo.htm" title="Augustine of Hippo">St. Augustine</a> described the <!--del_lnk--> responsorial singing of a <!--del_lnk--> Gradual psalm at Mass. Around 678, Roman chant was taught at <a href="../../wp/y/York.htm" title="York">York</a>. Distinctive regional traditions of Western plainchant arose during this period, notably in the British Isles (<!--del_lnk--> Celtic chant), Spain (<!--del_lnk--> Mozarabic), Gaul (<!--del_lnk--> Gallican), and Italy (<!--del_lnk--> Roman, <!--del_lnk--> Old Roman, <!--del_lnk--> Ambrosian and <!--del_lnk--> Beneventan). These traditions may have evolved from a hypothetical year-round repertory of 5th-century plainchant after the western <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> collapsed.<p><a id="Origins_of_the_new_tradition" name="Origins_of_the_new_tradition"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Origins of the new tradition</span></h3>

      <p>The Gregorian repertory was systematized for use in the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Rite. According to <!--del_lnk--> James McKinnon, the core liturgy of the Roman Mass was compiled over a brief period in the late 7th century. Other scholars, including Andreas Pfisterer, have argued for an earlier origin.<p>Scholars debate whether the essentials of the melodies originated in Rome, before the 7th century, or in <a href="../../wp/f/Franks.htm" title="Franks">Francia</a>, in the 8th and early 9th centuries. Traditionalists point to evidence supporting an important role for <!--del_lnk--> Pope Gregory the Great between 590 and 604, such as that presented in H. Bewerung&#39;s article in the <i>Catholic Encyclopedia</i>. Scholarly consensus, supported by <!--del_lnk--> Willi Apel and Robert Snow, asserts instead that Gregorian chant developed around 750 from a synthesis of Roman and <!--del_lnk--> Gallican chant commissioned by <!--del_lnk--> Carolingian rulers in France. During a visit to Gaul in 752-753, <!--del_lnk--> Pope Stephen II had celebrated <!--del_lnk--> Mass using Roman chant. According to <a href="../../wp/c/Charlemagne.htm" title="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>, his father <!--del_lnk--> Pepin abolished the local <!--del_lnk--> Gallican rites in favour of the Roman use, in order to strengthen ties with Rome. In 785-786, at Charlemagne&#39;s request, <!--del_lnk--> Pope Hadrian I sent a papal <!--del_lnk--> sacramentary with Roman chants to the Carolingian court. This Roman chant was subsequently modified, influenced by local styles and Gallican chant, and later adapted into the system of eight <!--del_lnk--> modes. This Frankish-Roman Carolingian chant, augmented with new chants to complete the liturgical year, became known as &quot;Gregorian.&quot; Originally the chant was probably so named to honour the contemporary <!--del_lnk--> Pope Gregory II, but later lore attributed the authorship of chant to his more famous predecessor Gregory the Great. Gregory was portrayed dictating plainchant inspired by a dove representing the <!--del_lnk--> Holy Spirit, giving Gregorian chant the stamp of holy authority. The myth of Gregory&#39;s authorship is popularly accepted as fact to this day.<p><a id="Dissemination_and_hegemony" name="Dissemination_and_hegemony"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Dissemination and hegemony</span></h3>
      <p>Gregorian chant appeared in a remarkably uniform state across Europe within a short time. Charlemagne, once elevated to <!--del_lnk--> Holy Roman Emperor, aggressively spread Gregorian chant throughout his empire to consolidate religious and secular power, requiring the clergy to use the new repertory on pain of death. From English and German sources, Gregorian chant spread north to <!--del_lnk--> Scandinavia, <a href="../../wp/i/Iceland.htm" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> and <a href="../../wp/f/Finland.htm" title="Finland">Finland</a>. In 885, <!--del_lnk--> Pope Stephen V banned the <!--del_lnk--> Slavonic liturgy, leading to the ascendancy of Gregorian chant in Eastern Catholic lands including <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Poland</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Moravia, <a href="../../wp/s/Slovakia.htm" title="Slovakia">Slovakia</a>, and <a href="../../wp/a/Austria.htm" title="Austria">Austria</a>.<p>The other plainchant repertories of the Christian West faced severe competition from the new Gregorian chant. Charlemagne continued his father&#39;s policy of favoring the Roman Rite over the local Gallican traditions. By the 9th century the Gallican rite and chant had effectively been eliminated, although not without local resistance. The Gregorian chant of the <!--del_lnk--> Sarum Rite displaced <!--del_lnk--> Celtic chant. Gregorian coexisted with <!--del_lnk--> Beneventan chant for over a century before Beneventan chant was abolished by papal decree (1058). <!--del_lnk--> Mozarabic chant survived the influx of the <!--del_lnk--> Visigoths and <!--del_lnk--> Moors, but not the Roman-backed prelates newly installed in Spain during the <!--del_lnk--> Reconquista. Restricted to a handful of dedicated chapels, modern Mozarabic chant is highly Gregorianized and bears no musical resemblance to its original form. <!--del_lnk--> Ambrosian chant alone survived to the present day, preserved in <a href="../../wp/m/Milan.htm" title="Milan">Milan</a> due to the musical reputation and ecclesiastical authority of <!--del_lnk--> St. Ambrose.<p>Gregorian chant eventually replaced the local chant tradition of Rome itself, which is now known as <!--del_lnk--> Old Roman chant. In the 10th century, virtually no musical manuscripts were being notated in Italy. Instead, Roman Popes imported Gregorian chant from the German Holy Roman Emperors during the 10th and 11th centuries. For example, the <!--del_lnk--> Credo was added to the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Rite at the behest of the German emperor <!--del_lnk--> Henry II in 1014. Reinforced by the legend of Pope Gregory, Gregorian chant was taken to be the authentic, original chant of Rome, a misconception that continues to this day. By the 12th and 13th centuries, Gregorian chant had supplanted or marginalized all the other Western plainchant traditions.<p>Later sources of these other chant traditions show an increasing Gregorian influence, such as occasional efforts to categorize their chants into the Gregorian <!--del_lnk--> modes. Similarly, the Gregorian repertory incorporated elements of these lost plainchant traditions, which can be identified by careful stylistic and historical analysis. For example, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Improperia</i> of <!--del_lnk--> Good Friday are believed to be a remnant of the Gallican repertory.<p><a id="Early_sources_and_later_revisions" name="Early_sources_and_later_revisions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Musical form</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Melodic_types" name="Melodic_types"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Melodic types</span></h3>
      <p>Gregorian chants are categorized into three melodic types based on the number of pitches sung to each syllable. <i>Syllabic</i> chants have primarily one note per syllable. In <i>neumatic</i> chants, two or three notes per syllable predominate, while <i><!--del_lnk--> melismatic</i> chants have syllables that are sung to a long series of notes, ranging from five or six notes per syllable to over sixty in the more prolix melismas.<p>Gregorian chants fall into two broad categories of melody: <!--del_lnk--> recitatives and free melodies. The simplest kind of melody is the <b>liturgical recitative</b>. Recitative melodies are dominated by a single pitch, called the <i><!--del_lnk--> reciting tone</i>. Other pitches appear in melodic formulae for <!--del_lnk--> incipits, partial <!--del_lnk--> cadences, and full cadences. These chants are primarily syllabic. For example, the <!--del_lnk--> Collect for <!--del_lnk--> Easter consists of 127 syllables sung to 131 pitches, with 108 of these pitches being the reciting note A and the other 23 pitches flexing down to G. Liturgical recitatives are commonly found in the <!--del_lnk--> accentus chants of the liturgy, such as the intonations of the Collect, <!--del_lnk--> Epistle, and <!--del_lnk--> Gospel during the <!--del_lnk--> Mass, and in the direct <!--del_lnk--> psalmody of the <!--del_lnk--> Office.<div class="medialist listenlist">

       </ul>
      </div>
      <p><i>Psalmodic</i> chants, which intone <!--del_lnk--> psalms, include both recitatives and free melodies. Psalmodic chants include <i>direct psalmody</i> , <i>antiphonal chants</i>, and <i>responsorial chants</i>. In direct psalmody, psalm verses are sung without refrains to simple, formulaic tones. Most psalmodic chants are antiphonal and responsorial, sung to free melodies of varying complexity.<p><b>Antiphonal chants</b> such as the <!--del_lnk--> Introit, <!--del_lnk--> Offertory, and <!--del_lnk--> Communion originally referred to chants in which two choirs sang in alternation, one choir singing verses of a psalm, the other singing a refrain called an <i><!--del_lnk--> antiphon</i>. Over time, the verses were reduced in number, usually to just one psalm verse and the <!--del_lnk--> Doxology, or even omitted entirely. Antiphonal chants reflect their ancient origins as elaborate recitatives through the reciting tones in their melodies. Ordinary chants, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Kyrie and <!--del_lnk--> Gloria, are not considered antiphonal chants, although they are often performed in antiphonal style.<div class="medialist listenlist">

      <p><b>Responsorial chants</b> such as the <!--del_lnk--> Gradual, <!--del_lnk--> Tract, <!--del_lnk--> Alleluia, and the Office Responsories originally consisted of a refrain called a <i>respond</i> sung by a choir, alternating with psalm verses sung by a soloist. <!--del_lnk--> Responsorial chants are often composed of an amalgamation of various stock musical phrases, pieced together in a practice called <i><!--del_lnk--> centonization</i>. Although the Tracts lost their responds, they are strongly centonized.<div class="medialist listenlist">

      <p>Gregorian chant evolved to fulfill various functions in the Roman Catholic liturgy. Broadly speaking, liturgical recitatives are used for texts intoned by deacons or priests. Antiphonal chants accompany liturgical actions: the entrance of the officiant, the collection of offerings, and the distribution of sanctified bread and wine. Responsorial chants expand on readings and lessons.<p>The non-psalmodic chants, including the <!--del_lnk--> Ordinary of the Mass, <!--del_lnk--> sequences, and <!--del_lnk--> hymns, were originally intended for congregational singing. The structure of their texts largely defines their musical style. In sequences, the same melodic phrase is repeated in each couplet. The strophic texts of hymns use the same syllabic melody for each stanza.<p><a id="Modality" name="Modality"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Modality</span></h3>

      <p>Early plainchant, like much of Western music, is believed to have been distinguished by the use of the <!--del_lnk--> diatonic scale, possibly developing from an earlier <!--del_lnk--> pentatonic scale. Around 1025, <!--del_lnk--> Guido d&#39;Arezzo revolutionized Western music with the development of the <i>gamut</i>, in which pitches in the singing range were organized into overlapping <!--del_lnk--> hexachords. Hexachords could be built on C (the natural hexachord, C-D-E^F-G-A), F (the soft hexachord, using a B-flat, F-G-A^Bb-C-D), or G (the hard hexachord, using a B-natural, G-A-B^C-D-E). The B-flat was an integral part of the system of hexachords rather than an <!--del_lnk--> accidental. The use of notes outside of this collection was described as <!--del_lnk--> musica ficta.<p>Gregorian chant was categorized into eight <!--del_lnk--> modes, influenced by the eightfold division of Byzantine chants called the <i><!--del_lnk--> oktoechos</i>. Each mode is distinguished by its <i>final</i>, <i>dominant</i>, and <i>ambitus</i>. The <i>final</i> is the ending note, which is usually an important note in the overall structure of the melody. The <i>dominant</i> is a secondary pitch that usually serves as a <!--del_lnk--> reciting tone in the melody. <i><!--del_lnk--> Ambitus</i> refers to the range of pitches used in the melody. Melodies whose final is in the middle of the ambitus, or which have only a limited ambitus, are categorized as <i>plagal</i>, while melodies whose final is in the lower end of the ambitus and have a range of over five or six notes are categorized as <i>authentic</i>. Although corresponding plagal and authentic modes have the same final, they have different dominants. The names, rarely used in medieval times, derive from a misunderstanding of the Ancient Greek modes; the prefix &quot;Hypo-&quot; indicates corresponding plagal modes.<dl>
       <dd>Modes 1 and 2 are the authentic and plagal modes ending on D, sometimes called <!--del_lnk--> Dorian and <!--del_lnk--> Hypodorian.<dd>Modes 3 and 4 are the authentic and plagal modes ending on E, sometimes called <!--del_lnk--> Phrygian and <!--del_lnk--> Hypophrygian.<dd>Modes 5 and 6 are the authentic and plagal modes ending on F, sometimes called <!--del_lnk--> Lydian and <!--del_lnk--> Hypolydian.<dd>Modes 7 and 8 are the authentic and plagal modes ending on G, sometimes called <!--del_lnk--> Mixolydian and <!--del_lnk--> Hypomixolydian.</dl>
      <p>Although the modes with melodies ending on A, B, and C are sometimes referred to as <!--del_lnk--> Aeolian, <!--del_lnk--> Locrian, and <!--del_lnk--> Ionian, these are not considered distinct modes, and are treated as <!--del_lnk--> transpositions of whichever mode uses the same set of hexachords. The actual pitch of the Gregorian chant is not fixed, so the piece can be sung in whichever range is most comfortable.<p>Certain classes of Gregorian chant have a separate musical formula for each mode, allowing one section of the chant to transition smoothly into the next section, such as the <!--del_lnk--> psalm tones between antiphons and psalm verses.<p>Not every Gregorian chant fits neatly into Guido&#39;s hexachords or into the system of eight modes. For example, there are chants&mdash;especially from German sources&mdash;whose <!--del_lnk--> neumes suggest a warbling of pitches between the notes E and F, outside the hexachord system. Early Gregorian chant, like <!--del_lnk--> Ambrosian and <!--del_lnk--> Old Roman chant, whose melodies are most closely related to Gregorian, did not use the modal system. As the modal system gained acceptance, Gregorian chants were edited to conform to the modes, especially during 12th-century <!--del_lnk--> Cistercian reforms. Finals were altered, melodic ranges reduced, melismas trimmed, B-flats eliminated, and repeated words removed. Despite these attempts to impose modal consistency, some chants&mdash;notably Communions&mdash;defy simple modal assignment. For example, in four medieval manuscripts, the Communion <i>Circuibo</i> was transcribed using a different mode in each.<p><a id="Musical_idiom" name="Musical_idiom"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Musical idiom</span></h3>
      <p>Several features besides modality contribute to the musical idiom of Gregorian chant, giving it a distinctive musical flavor. Melodic motion is primarily <!--del_lnk--> stepwise. Skips of a third are common, and larger skips far more common than in other plainchant repertories such as <!--del_lnk--> Ambrosian chant or <!--del_lnk--> Beneventan chant. Gregorian melodies are more likely to traverse a seventh than a full octave, so that melodies rarely travel from D up to the D an octave higher, but often travel from D to the C a seventh higher, using such patterns as D-F-G-A-C. Gregorian melodies often explore chains of pitches, such as F-A-C, around which the other notes of the chant gravitate. Within each mode, certain incipits and cadences are preferred, which the modal theory alone does not explain. Chants often display complex internal structures that combine and repeat musical subphrases. This occurs notably in the <!--del_lnk--> Offertories; in chants with shorter, repeating texts such as the <!--del_lnk--> Kyrie and <!--del_lnk--> Agnus Dei; and in longer chants with clear textual divisions such as the Great Responsories, the <!--del_lnk--> Gloria, and the <!--del_lnk--> Credo.<p>Chants sometimes fall into melodically related groups. The musical phrases <!--del_lnk--> centonized to create <!--del_lnk--> Graduals and <!--del_lnk--> Tracts follow a musical &quot;grammar&quot; of sorts. Certain phrases are used only at the beginnings of chants, or only at the end, or only in certain combinations, creating musical families of chants such as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Iustus ut palma</i> family of Graduals. Several <!--del_lnk--> Introits in mode 3, including <i>Loquetur Dominus</i> above, exhibit melodic similarities. Mode 3 chants have C as a dominant, so C is the expected reciting tone. These mode 3 Introits, however, use both G and C as reciting tones, and often begin with a decorated leap from G to C to establish this tonality. Similar examples exist throughout the repertory.<p><a id="Notation" name="Notation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Notation</span></h3>

      <p>The earliest notated sources of Gregorian chant used symbols called <i><!--del_lnk--> neumes</i> to indicate changes in pitch and duration within each syllable, but not the specific pitches of individual notes, nor the relative starting pitches of each neume. Scholars postulate that this practice may have been derived from <!--del_lnk--> cheironomic hand-gestures, the <!--del_lnk--> ekphonetic notation of <!--del_lnk--> Byzantine chant, punctuation marks, or diacritical accents. Later innovations included the use of <i>heightened</i> or <i>diastemic</i> neumes showing the relative pitches between neumes, and a musical staff marking one line with a particular pitch, usually C or F. Additional symbols developed, such as the <i>custos</i>, placed at the end of a system to show the next pitch. Other symbols indicated changes in articulation, duration, or tempo, such as a letter &quot;t&quot; to indicate a <!--del_lnk--> tenuto. Another form of early notation used a system of letters corresponding to different pitches, much as <!--del_lnk--> Shaker music is notated.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>By the 13th century, the neumes of Gregorian chant were usually written in <i>square notation</i> on a four-line staff with a clef, as in the <i>Graduale Aboense</i> pictured above. In square notation, small groups of ascending notes on a syllable are shown as stacked squares, read from bottom to top, while descending notes are written with diamonds read from left to right. When a syllable has a large number of notes, a series of smaller such groups of neumes are written in succession, read from left to right. The oriscus, quilisma, and liquescent neumes indicate special vocal treatments, whose exact nature is unconfirmed. B-flat is indicated by a &quot;soft b&quot; placed to the left of the entire neume in which the note occurs, as shown in the &quot;Kyrie&quot; to the right. When necessary, a &quot;hard b&quot; with a descender indicates B-natural. This system of square notation is standard in modern chantbooks. <a id="Performance" name="Performance"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Performance</span></h2>

      <p>Chant was traditionally reserved for men, as it was originally sung by the all-male clergy during the <!--del_lnk--> Mass and the prayers of the <!--del_lnk--> Office. Outside the larger cities, the number of available clergy dropped, and lay men started singing these parts. In <!--del_lnk--> convents, women were permitted to sing the Mass and Office as a function of their consecrated life, but the choir was still considered an official liturgical duty reserved to clergy, so lay women were not allowed to sing in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Schola cantorum</i> or other choirs.<p>Chant was normally sung in unison. Later innovations included <i><!--del_lnk--> tropes</i>, extra words or notes added to a chant, and <i><!--del_lnk--> organum</i>, improvisational harmonies focusing on octaves, fifths, fourths, and, later, thirds. Neither tropes nor organum, however, belong to the chant repertory proper. The main exception to this is the sequence, whose origins lay in troping the extended <!--del_lnk--> melisma of <!--del_lnk--> Alleluia chants known as the <!--del_lnk--> jubilus, but the sequences, like the tropes, were later officially suppressed. The <!--del_lnk--> Council of Trent struck sequences from the Gregorian corpus, except those for <!--del_lnk--> Easter, <!--del_lnk--> Pentecost, <!--del_lnk--> Corpus Christi and <!--del_lnk--> All Souls&#39; Day.<p>We do not know much about the particular vocal stylings or performance practices used for Gregorian chant in the Middle Ages. On occasion, the clergy was urged to have their singers perform with more restraint and piety. This suggests that virtuosic performances occurred, contrary to the modern stereotype of Gregorian chant as slow-moving mood music. This tension between musicality and piety goes far back; <!--del_lnk--> Gregory the Great himself criticized the practice of promoting clerics based on their charming singing rather than their preaching. However, <!--del_lnk--> Odo of Cluny, a renowned monastic reformer, praised the intellectual and musical virtuosity to be found in chant:<dl>
       <dd><i>&quot;For in these [Offertories and Communions] there are the most varied kinds of ascent, descent, repeat..., delight for the</i> cognoscenti<i>, difficulty for the beginners, and an admirable organization... that widely differs from other chants; they are not so much made according to the rules of music... but rather evince the authority and validity... of music.&quot;</i></dl>
      <p>True antiphonal performance by two alternating choruses still occurs, as in certain German monasteries. However, antiphonal chants are generally performed in responsorial style by a solo cantor alternating with a chorus. This practice appears to have begun in the Middle Ages. Another medieval innovation had the solo cantor sing the opening words of responsorial chants, with the full chorus finishing the end of the opening phrase. This innovation allowed the soloist to fix the pitch of the chant for the chorus and to cue the choral entrance.<p><a id="Rhythm" name="Rhythm"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Rhythm</span></h3>
      <p>Because of the ambiguity of medieval notation, rhythm in Gregorian chant is contested among scholars. Certain neumes such as the <i>pressus</i> indicate repeated notes, which may indicate lengthening or repercussion. By the 13th century, with the widespread use of square notation, most chant was sung with an approximately equal duration allotted to each note, although Jerome of Moravia cites exceptions in which certain notes, such as the final notes of a chant, are lengthened. Later redactions such as the <i>Editio medicaea</i> of 1614 rewrote chant so that melismas, with their melodic accent, fell on accented syllables. This aesthetic held sway until the re-examination of chant in the late 19th century by such scholars as Wagner, Pothier, and Mocquereau, who fell into two camps.<p>One school of thought, including Wagner, Jammers, and Lipphardt, advocated imposing rhythmic meters on chants, although they disagreed how that should be done. An opposing interpretation, represented by Pothier and Mocquereau, supported a free rhythm of equal note values, although some notes are lengthened for textual emphasis or musical effect. The modern Solesmes editions of Gregorian chant follow this interpretation. Mocquereau divided melodies into two- and three-note phrases, each beginning with an <i>ictus</i>, an accented musical pulse akin to a downbeat, notated in chantbooks as a small vertical mark. These basic melodic units combined into larger phrases through a complex system expressed by <!--del_lnk--> cheironomic hand-gestures. This approach prevailed during the twentieth century, propagated by Justine Ward&#39;s program of music education for children, until Vatican II diminished the liturgical role of chant and new scholarship &quot;essentially discredited&quot; Mocquereau&#39;s rhythmic theories.<p>Common modern practice favors performing Gregorian chant with no beat or regular metric accent, largely for aesthetic reasons. The text determines the accent while the melodic contour determines the phrasing. The note lengthenings recommended by the Solesmes school remain influential, though not prescriptive.<p><a id="Liturgical_functions" name="Liturgical_functions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Liturgical functions</span></h2>
      <p>Gregorian chant is sung in the Office during the <!--del_lnk--> canonical hours and in the liturgy of the <!--del_lnk--> Mass. Texts known as <i><!--del_lnk--> accentus</i> are intoned by bishops, priests, and deacons, mostly on a single <!--del_lnk--> reciting tone with simple melodic formulae at certain places in each sentence. More complex chants are sung by trained soloists and choirs. The most complete collection of chants is the <i><!--del_lnk--> Liber usualis</i>, which contains the chants for the <!--del_lnk--> Tridentine Mass and the most commonly used Office chants. Outside of monasteries, the more compact <i><!--del_lnk--> Graduale Romanum</i> is commonly used.<p><a id="Proper_chants_of_the_Mass" name="Proper_chants_of_the_Mass"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Proper chants of the Mass</span></h3>
      <p>The Introit, Gradual, Alleluia, Tract, Sequence, Offertory and Communion chants are part of the <!--del_lnk--> Proper of the Mass. &quot;Proper&quot; is cognate with &quot;property&quot;; each feast day possesses its own specific texts and chants for these parts of the liturgy.<p><!--del_lnk--> Introits cover the procession of the officiants. Introits are antiphonal chants, typically consisting of an antiphon, a psalm verse, a repeat of the antiphon, an intonation of the <!--del_lnk--> Doxology, and a final repeat of the antiphon. <!--del_lnk--> Reciting tones often dominate their melodic structures.<p><!--del_lnk--> Graduals are responsorial chants that intone a lesson following the reading of the <!--del_lnk--> Epistle. Graduals usually result from <i><!--del_lnk--> centonization</i>; stock musical phrases are assembled like a patchwork to create the full melody of the chant, creating families of musically related melodies.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Alleluia is known for the <i><!--del_lnk--> jubilus</i>, an extended joyful melisma. It is common for different Alleluia texts to share essentially the same melody. The process of applying an existing melody to a new Alleluia text is called <i>adaptation</i>. Alleluias are not sung during penitential times, such as <!--del_lnk--> Lent. Instead, a <!--del_lnk--> Tract is chanted, usually with texts from the Psalms. Tracts, like Graduals, are highly centonized.<p><!--del_lnk--> Sequences are sung poems based on couplets. Although many sequences are not part of the liturgy and thus not part of the Gregorian repertory proper, Gregorian sequences include such well-known chants as <i><!--del_lnk--> Victimae paschali laudes</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Veni Sancte Spiritus</i>. According to <!--del_lnk--> Notker Balbulus, an early sequence writer, their origins lie in the addition of words to the long <!--del_lnk--> melismas of the jubilus of Alleluia chants.<p><!--del_lnk--> Offertories are sung during the giving of offerings. Offertories once had highly prolix melodies in their verses, but the use of verses in Gregorian Offertories disappeared around the 12th century.<p><!--del_lnk--> Communions are sung during the distribution of the <!--del_lnk--> Eucharist. Communion melodies are often tonally unstable, alternating between B-natural and B-flat. Such Communions often do not fit unambiguously into a single <!--del_lnk--> musical mode.<p><a id="Ordinary_chants_of_the_Mass" name="Ordinary_chants_of_the_Mass"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Ordinary chants of the Mass</span></h3>
      <p>The Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, Benedictus and Agnus Dei use the same text in every service of the Mass. Because they follow the regular invariable &quot;order&quot; of the Mass, these chants are called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Ordinary.&quot;<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Kyrie consists of a threefold repetition of &quot;Kyrie eleison&quot; (&quot;Lord, have mercy&quot;), a threefold repetition of &quot;Christe eleison&quot; (&quot;Christ have mercy&quot;), followed by another threefold repetition of &quot;Kyrie eleison.&quot; In older chants, &quot;Kyrie eleison imas&quot; (&quot;Lord, have mercy on us&quot;) can be found. The Kyrie is distinguished by its use of the <!--del_lnk--> Greek language instead of Latin. Because of the textual repetition, various musical repeat structures occur in these chants. The following, Kyrie ad. lib. VI as transmitted in a Cambrai manuscript, uses the form ABA CDC EFE&#39;, with shifts in <!--del_lnk--> tessitura between sections. The E&#39; section, on the final &quot;Kyrie eleison,&quot; itself has an aa&#39;b structure, contributing to the sense of climax.<div class="medialist listenlist">

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Gloria recites the Greater <!--del_lnk--> Doxology, and the <!--del_lnk--> Credo intones the <!--del_lnk--> Nicene Creed. Because of the length of these texts, these chants often break into musical subsections corresponding with textual breaks. Because the Credo was the last Ordinary chant to be added to the Mass, there are relatively few Credo melodies in the Gregorian corpus.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Sanctus and the <!--del_lnk--> Agnus Dei, like the Kyrie, also contain repeated texts, which their musical structures often exploit.<p>Technically, the <!--del_lnk--> Ite missa est and the <!--del_lnk--> Benedicamus Domino, which conclude the Mass, belong to the Ordinary. They have their own Gregorian melodies, but because they are short and simple, and have rarely been the subject of later musical composition, they are often omitted in discussion.<p><a id="Chants_of_the_Office" name="Chants_of_the_Office"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Chants of the Office</span></h3>
      <p>Gregorian chant is sung in the <!--del_lnk--> canonical hours of the <!--del_lnk--> monastic Office, primarily in antiphons used to sing the <!--del_lnk--> Psalms, in the Great Responsories of <!--del_lnk--> Matins, and the Short Responsories of the Lesser Hours and <!--del_lnk--> Compline.

      <p>Gregorian chant had a significant impact on the development of <a href="../../wp/m/Medieval_music.htm" title="Medieval music">medieval</a> and <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance_music.htm" title="Renaissance music">Renaissance music</a>. Modern staff notation developed directly from Gregorian neumes. The square notation that had been devised for plainchant was borrowed and adapted for other kinds of music. Certain groupings of neumes were used to indicate repeating rhythms called <!--del_lnk--> rhythmic modes. Rounded noteheads increasingly replaced the older squares and lozenges in the 15th and 16th centuries, although chantbooks conservatively maintained the square notation. By the 16th century, the fifth line added to the <!--del_lnk--> musical staff had become standard. The <!--del_lnk--> bass clef and the <!--del_lnk--> flat, <!--del_lnk--> natural, and <!--del_lnk--> sharp accidentals derived directly from Gregorian notation.<p>Gregorian melodies provided musical material and served as models for <!--del_lnk--> tropes and <!--del_lnk--> liturgical dramas. Vernacular hymns such as &quot;Christ ist erstanden&quot; and &quot;Nun bitten wir den heiligen Geist&quot; adapted original Gregorian melodies to translated texts. Secular tunes such as the popular Renaissance &quot;<!--del_lnk--> In Nomine&quot; were based on Gregorian melodies. Beginning with the improvised harmonizations of Gregorian chant known as <!--del_lnk--> organum, Gregorian chants became a driving force in medieval and Renaissance <!--del_lnk--> polyphony. Often, a Gregorian chant (sometimes in modified form) would be used as a <i><!--del_lnk--> cantus firmus</i>, so that the consecutive notes of the chant determined the harmonic progression. The Marian antiphons, especially <i>Alma Redemptoris Mater</i>, were frequently arranged by Renaissance composers. The use of chant as a cantus firmus was the predominant practice until the <a href="../../wp/b/Baroque.htm" title="Baroque">Baroque</a> period, when the stronger harmonic progressions made possible by an independent bass line became standard.<p>The Catholic Church later allowed polyphonic arrangements to replace the Gregorian chant of the Ordinary of the Mass. This is why the Mass as a compositional form, as set by composers like <!--del_lnk--> Palestrina or <a href="../../wp/w/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart.htm" title="Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart">Mozart</a>, features a Kyrie but not an Introit. The Propers may also be replaced by choral settings on certain solemn occasions. Among the composers who most frequently wrote polyphonic settings of the Propers were <!--del_lnk--> William Byrd and <!--del_lnk--> Tom&aacute;s Luis de Victoria. These polyphonic arrangements usually incorporate elements of the original chant.<p><a name="20th_century"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">20th century</span></h3>
      <p>The renewed interest in <!--del_lnk--> early music in the late 19th century left its mark on 20th-century music. Gregorian influences in classical music include the choral setting of four chants in &quot;Quatre motets sur des th&egrave;mes Gr&eacute;goriens&quot; by <!--del_lnk--> Maurice Durufl&eacute;, the carols of <!--del_lnk--> Peter Maxwell Davies, and the choral work of <!--del_lnk--> Arvo P&auml;rt. Gregorian chant has been incorporated into other genres, such as <!--del_lnk--> Enigma&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Sadeness (Part I)&quot;, the chant interpretation of pop and rock by the German band <!--del_lnk--> Gregorian, the <!--del_lnk--> techno project <!--del_lnk--> E Nomine, and the work of <!--del_lnk--> black metal band <!--del_lnk--> Deathspell Omega. Norwegian black metal bands utilize Gregorian-style chants for clean vocal approach, featuring singers such as <!--del_lnk--> Garm or <!--del_lnk--> ICS Vortex of <!--del_lnk--> Borknagar and <!--del_lnk--> Dimmu Borgir, and <!--del_lnk--> Ihsahn of the band <!--del_lnk--> Emperor. The modal melodies of chant provide unusual sounds to ears attuned to modern scales.<p>Gregorian chant as plainchant experienced a popular resurgence during the <!--del_lnk--> New Age music and <!--del_lnk--> world music movements of the 1980s and &#39;90s. The iconic album was <i><!--del_lnk--> Chant</i>, recorded by the <!--del_lnk--> Benedictine Monks of <!--del_lnk--> Santo Domingo de Silos, which was marketed as music to inspire timeless calm and serenity. It became <!--del_lnk--> conventional wisdom that listening to Gregorian chant increased the production of <!--del_lnk--> beta waves in the brain, reinforcing the popular reputation of Gregorian chant as tranquilizing music.<p>Gregorian chant has often been parodied for its supposed monotony, both before and after the release of <i>Chant</i>. Famous references include the flagellant monks in <i><!--del_lnk--> Monty Python and the Holy Grail</i> intoning &quot;Pie Jesu Domine&quot; and the <!--del_lnk--> karaoke machine of <!--del_lnk--> public domain music featuring &quot;The Languid and Bittersweet &#39;Gregorian Chant No. 5&#39;&quot; in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Mystery Science Theatre 3000</i> episode <i><!--del_lnk--> Pod People</i>.<p>The <a href="../../wp/a/Asteroid.htm" title="Asteroid">asteroid</a> <!--del_lnk--> 100019 Gregorianik is <!--del_lnk--> named in its honour, using the German short form of the term.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_chant&quot;</div>
