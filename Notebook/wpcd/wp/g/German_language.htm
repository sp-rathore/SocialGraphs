Generally, German immigrant communities in the USA have lost their mother tongue more quickly than those who moved to South America, possibly because for German speakers, English is easier to learn than Portuguese or Spanish.

      <p>The history of the German language begins with the <a href="../../wp/h/High_German_consonant_shift.htm" title="High German consonant shift">High German consonant shift</a> during the <!--del_lnk--> Migration period, separating <!--del_lnk--> South Germanic dialects from common <!--del_lnk--> West Germanic. The earliest testimonies of <!--del_lnk--> Old High German are from scattered <!--del_lnk--> Elder Futhark inscriptions, especially in <!--del_lnk--> Alemannic, from the <a href="../../wp/6/6th_century.htm" title="6th century">6th century</a>, the earliest glosses (<i><!--del_lnk--> Abrogans</i>) date to the <a href="../../wp/8/8th_century.htm" title="8th century">8th</a> and the oldest coherent texts (the <i><!--del_lnk--> Hildebrandslied</i>, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Muspilli</i> and the <a href="../../wp/m/Merseburg_Incantations.htm" title="Merseburg Incantations">Merseburg Incantations</a>) to the <a href="../../wp/9/9th_century.htm" title="9th century">9th century</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Old Saxon at this time belongs to the <!--del_lnk--> North Sea Germanic cultural sphere, and <!--del_lnk--> Low Saxon should fall under German rather than <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Frisian influence during the <a href="../../wp/h/Holy_Roman_Empire.htm" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>.<p>As Germany was divided into many different <!--del_lnk--> states, the only force working for a unification or <!--del_lnk--> standardisation of German during a period of several hundred years was the general preference of writers trying to write in a way that could be understood in the largest possible area.<p>When <a href="../../wp/m/Martin_Luther.htm" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a> translated the <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">Bible</a> (the <!--del_lnk--> New Testament in 1522 and the <!--del_lnk--> Old Testament, published in parts and completed in 1534) he based his translation mainly on this already developed language, which was the most widely understood language at this time. This language was based on Eastern Upper and Eastern Central German dialects and preserved much of the grammatical system of Middle High German (unlike the spoken German dialects in Central and Upper Germany that already at that time began to lose the genitive case and the preterit tense). In the beginning, copies of the Bible had a long list for each region, which translated words unknown in the region into the regional dialect. <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholics rejected Luther&#39;s translation in the beginning and tried to create their own Catholic standard (<i>gemeines Deutsch</i>) &mdash; which, however, only differed from &#39;Protestant German&#39; in some minor details. It took until the middle of the 18th century to create a standard that was widely accepted, thus ending the period of <!--del_lnk--> Early New High German.<p>German used to be the language of commerce and government in the <!--del_lnk--> Habsburg Empire, which encompassed a large area of Central and Eastern Europe. Until the mid-19th century it was essentially the language of townspeople throughout most of the Empire. It indicated that the speaker was a <!--del_lnk--> merchant, an urbanite, not their nationality. Some cities, such as <a href="../../wp/p/Prague.htm" title="Prague">Prague</a> (German: <i>Prag</i>) and <a href="../../wp/b/Budapest.htm" title="Budapest">Budapest</a> (<!--del_lnk--> Buda, German: <i>Ofen</i>), were gradually <!--del_lnk--> Germanised in the years after their incorporation into the Habsburg domain. Others, such as <a href="../../wp/b/Bratislava.htm" title="Bratislava">Bratislava</a> (German: <i>Pressburg</i>), were originally settled during the Habsburg period and were primarily German at that time. A few cities such as <a href="../../wp/m/Milan.htm" title="Milan">Milan</a> (German: <i>Mailand</i>) remained primarily non-German. However, most cities were primarily German during this time, such as Prague, <a href="../../wp/b/Budapest.htm" title="Budapest">Budapest</a>, Bratislava, <!--del_lnk--> Zagreb (German: <i>Agram</i>), and <!--del_lnk--> Ljubljana (German: <i>Laibach</i>), though they were surrounded by territory that spoke other languages.<p>Until about 1800, standard German was almost only a written language. At this time, people in urban northern Germany, who spoke dialects very different from Standard German, learnt it almost like a foreign language and tried to pronounce it as close to the spelling as possible. Prescriptive pronunciation guides used to consider northern German pronunciation to be the standard. However, the actual pronunciation of standard German varies from region to region.<p>Media and written works are almost all produced in standard German (often called <i>Hochdeutsch</i> in German) which is understood in all areas where German is spoken, except by pre-school children in areas which speak only dialect, for example <a href="../../wp/s/Switzerland.htm" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Austria.htm" title="Austria">Austria</a>. However, in this age of television, even they now usually learn to understand Standard German before school age.<p>The first dictionary of the <a href="../../wp/b/Brothers_Grimm.htm" title="Brothers Grimm">Brothers Grimm</a>, the 16 parts of which were issued between 1852 and 1860, remains the most comprehensive guide to the words of the German language. In 1860, grammatical and orthographic rules first appeared in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Duden Handbook</i>. In 1901, this was declared the standard definition of the German language. Official revisions of some of these rules were not issued until 1998, when the <!--del_lnk--> German spelling reform of 1996 was officially promulgated by governmental representatives of all German-speaking countries. Since the reform, German spelling has been in an eight-year transitional period where the reformed spelling is taught in most schools, while traditional and reformed spellings co-exist in the media. See <!--del_lnk--> German spelling reform of 1996 for an overview of the public debate concerning the reform with some major newspapers and magazines and several known writers refusing to adopt it.<p>The spelling reform of 1996 led to public controversy indeed to considerable dispute. Some state parliaments (Bundesl&auml;nder) would not accept it (North Rhine Westphalia and Bavaria). The dispute landed at one point in the highest court which made a short issue of it, claiming that the states had to decide for themselves. After 10 years, intervention by the federal parliament finally led to official adoption just in time for the new school year of 2006. The cause of the controversy evolved around the question whether a language is part of the culture which must be preserved or a means of communicating information which has to allow for growth. German has no monopoly on this fundamental dilemma.<p><a id="Classification_and_related_languages" name="Classification_and_related_languages"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Classification and related languages</span></h2>

      <p>The variation among the German dialects is considerable, with only the neighbouring dialects being mutually intelligible. Some dialects are not intelligible to people who only know standard German. However, all German dialects belong to the <!--del_lnk--> dialect continuum of High German and Low Saxon languages. In the past (roughly until the end of the Second World War), there was a dialect continuum of all the continental <!--del_lnk--> West Germanic languages because nearly any pair of neighbouring dialects were perfectly mutually intelligible.<p>The German dialect continuum is traditionally divided into <!--del_lnk--> High German and <!--del_lnk--> Low German.<p><a id="Low_Saxon" name="Low_Saxon"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Low Saxon</span></h3>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Low Saxon varieties (spoken on German territory) are considered dialects of the German language by some, but a separate language by others.

In <!--del_lnk--> 1534, the <!--del_lnk--> Luther Bible, by <a href="../../wp/m/Martin_Luther.htm" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a> was printed.

The Early New High German language gained more prestige than Low Saxon and became the language of science and literature. Other factors were that around the same time, the Hanseatic league lost its importance as new trade routes to <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Americas were established, and that the most powerful German states of that period were located in Middle and Southern Germany.<p>The 18th and 19th centuries were marked by mass <a href="../../wp/e/Education.htm" title="Education">education</a>, the language of the schools being standard German. Slowly Low Saxon was pushed back and back until it was nothing but a language spoken by the uneducated and at home. Today, Low Saxon could be divided in two groups: Low Saxon varieties with a (<i>reasonable/large/huge</i>) standard German influx, and varieties of standard German with a Low Saxon influence (<!--del_lnk--> Missingsch).<p><a id="High_German" name="High_German"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">High German</span></h3>
      <p><b>High German</b> is divided into <!--del_lnk--> Central German and <!--del_lnk--> Upper German. Central German dialects include <!--del_lnk--> Ripuarian, <!--del_lnk--> Moselle Franconian, <!--del_lnk--> Hessian, <!--del_lnk--> Thuringian, <!--del_lnk--> South Franconian, <!--del_lnk--> Lorraine Franconian and <!--del_lnk--> Upper Saxon. It is spoken in the southeastern Netherlands, eastern Belgium, Luxembourg, parts of France, and in Germany approximately between the River <!--del_lnk--> Main and the southern edge of the Lowlands. Modern Standard German is mostly based on Central German, but it should be noted that the common (but not linguistically correct) German term for modern Standard German is <i>Hochdeutsch</i>, that is, <i>High German</i>.<p>The Moselle Franconian varieties spoken in <a href="../../wp/l/Luxembourg.htm" title="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a> have been officially standardised and institutionalised and are therefore usually considered a separate language known as <!--del_lnk--> Luxembourgish.<p>Upper German dialects include <!--del_lnk--> Alemannic (for instance <!--del_lnk--> Swiss German), <!--del_lnk--> Swabian, <!--del_lnk--> East Franconian, <!--del_lnk--> Alsatian and <!--del_lnk--> Austro-Bavarian. They are spoken in parts of the <!--del_lnk--> Alsace, southern Germany, Liechtenstein, Austria, and in the German-speaking parts of Switzerland and Italy.<p><!--del_lnk--> Wymysojer, <!--del_lnk--> Sathmarisch and <!--del_lnk--> Siebenb&uuml;rgisch are High German dialects of Poland and <a href="../../wp/r/Romania.htm" title="Romania">Romania</a> respectively. The High German varieties spoken by <!--del_lnk--> Ashkenazi Jews (mostly in the former <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>) have several unique features, and are usually considered as a separate language, <!--del_lnk--> Yiddish. It is the only Germanic language that does not use the <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_alphabet.htm" title="Latin alphabet">Latin alphabet</a> as its <!--del_lnk--> standard script.<p>The dialects of German which are or were primarily spoken in colonies or communities founded by German speaking people resemble the dialects of the regions the founders came from. For example, <!--del_lnk--> Pennsylvania German resembles dialects of the <!--del_lnk--> Palatinate, and <!--del_lnk--> Hutterite German resembles dialects of <!--del_lnk--> Carinthia, while <!--del_lnk--> Venezuelan <i><!--del_lnk--> Alem&aacute;n Coloniero</i> is a <!--del_lnk--> Low Alemannic variant.<p>In Brazil the largest concentrations of German speakers (<!--del_lnk--> German Brazilians) are in <!--del_lnk--> Rio Grande do Sul, where <!--del_lnk--> Riograndenser Hunsr&uuml;ckisch was developed, especially in the areas of <!--del_lnk--> Santa Catarina, <!--del_lnk--> Paran&aacute;, and <!--del_lnk--> Esp&iacute;rito Santo.<p>In the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, the teaching of the German language to latter-age students has given rise to a pidgin variant which combines the German language with the grammar and spelling rules of the English language.

      <p>In German linguistics, only the traditional regional varieties are called dialects, not the different varieties of standard German.<p>Standard German has originated not as a traditional dialect of a specific region, but as a <!--del_lnk--> written language. However, there are places where the traditional regional dialects have been replaced by standard German; this is the case in vast stretches of Northern Germany, but also in major cities in other parts of the country and to some extent in <a href="../../wp/v/Vienna.htm" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>.<p>Standard German differs regionally, especially between German-speaking countries, especially in <!--del_lnk--> vocabulary, but also in some instances of <!--del_lnk--> pronunciation and even <!--del_lnk--> grammar. This variation must not be confused with the variation of local dialects. Even though the regional varieties of standard German are to a certain degree influenced by the local dialects, they are very distinct. German is thus considered a <!--del_lnk--> pluricentric language.<p>In most regions, the speakers use a continuum of mixtures from more dialectical varieties to more standard varieties according to situation.<p>In the German-speaking parts of <a href="../../wp/s/Switzerland.htm" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, mixtures of dialect and standard are very seldom used, and the use of standard German is largely restricted to the written language. Therefore, this situation has been called a <i>medial <!--del_lnk--> diglossia</i>. Standard German is only spoken with people who do not understand the <!--del_lnk--> Swiss German dialects at all.

      <p>German is an <!--del_lnk--> inflected language.<p><a id="Noun_inflection" name="Noun_inflection"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Noun inflection</span></h3>
      <p>German nouns inflect into:<ul>
       <li>one of four <!--del_lnk--> declension classes (cases): <!--del_lnk--> nominative, <!--del_lnk--> genitive, <!--del_lnk--> dative, and <!--del_lnk--> accusative.<li>one of three <!--del_lnk--> genders: masculine, feminine, or neuter. Word endings sometimes reveals grammatical gender for instance nouns ending in <b>...ung</b>, <b>...schaft</b> or <b>...eit</b> are feminine in <b>...chen</b> or <b>...lein</b> are neuter; others are controversial (Ex. <b>Becken</b> = basin or <b>Radio</b> = radio) sometimes depending on the region in which it is spoken. To avoid a misunderstanding usually the sentence can be reorganized.<li>two numbers: singular and plural</ul>
      <p>Although German is usually cited as an outstanding example of a highly inflected language, it should be noted that the degree of inflection is considerably less than in Old German, or in Icelandic today. The three genders have collapsed in the plural, which now behaves, grammatically, somewhat as a fourth gender. With four cases and three genders plus plural there are 16 distinct possible combinations of case and gender/number, but presently there are only six forms of the definite article used for the 16 possibilities. Inflection for case on the noun itself is required in the singular for strong masculine and neuter nouns in the genitive and sometimes in the dative. Both of these cases are losing way to substitutes in informal speech. The dative ending is considered somewhat old-fashioned in many contexts and often dropped, but it is still used in sayings and in formal speech or in written language. Weak masculine nouns share a common case ending for genitive, dative and accusative in the singular. Feminines are not declined in the singular. The plural does have an inflection for the dative. In total, seven inflectional endings (not counting plural markers) exist in German: <i>-s, -es, -n, -ns, -en, -ens, -e</i>.<p>In the German <!--del_lnk--> orthography, nouns and most words with the syntactical function of nouns are capitalised, which is supposed to make it easier for readers to find out what function a word has within the sentence. On the other hand, things get more difficult for the writer. This spelling convention is almost unique to German today (shared perhaps only by the closely related <!--del_lnk--> Luxembourgish language), although it was historically common in other languages (e.g., <!--del_lnk--> Danish), too.<p>Like most Germanic languages, German forms left-branching noun <!--del_lnk--> compounds, where the first noun modifies the category given by the second, for example: <i>Hundeh&uuml;tte</i> (eng. <i>doghouse</i>). Unlike English, where newer compounds or combinations of longer nouns are often written in <i>open</i> form with separating spaces, German (like the other German languages) nearly always uses the <i>closed</i> form without spaces, for example: Baumhaus (eng. <i>tree house</i>). Like English, German allows arbitrarily long compounds, but these are rare. (<i>See also</i> <!--del_lnk--> English compounds.)<p>The longest German word verified to be actually in (albeit very limited) use is <!--del_lnk--> Rindfleischetikettierungs&uuml;berwachungsaufgaben&uuml;bertragungsgesetz. There is even a child&#39;s game played in kindergartens and primary schools where a child begins the spelling of a word (which is not told) by naming the first letter. The next one tells the next letter, the third one tells the third and so on. The game is over when a child cannot think of another letter to be added to the word (see <!--del_lnk--> Ghost). Another popular child&#39;s game consists of building a noun compound. The first child starts with a noun or more commonly already a compound (<i>Donaudampfschifffahrtskapit&auml;n</i> (Danube Steamboat captain) is somewhat popular and infamous). The next child has to append another noun so that the compound still has a sensible meaning (Example: <i>Donaudampfschifffahrtskapit&auml;n</i> -&gt; <i>Donaudampfschiffahrtskapit&auml;nsm&uuml;tze</i> (Danube Steamboat captain&#39;s hat) -&gt; <i>Donaudampfschifffahrtskapit&auml;nsm&uuml;tzenfabrik</i> (Danube Steamboat captain&#39;s hat factory, and so on). The game ends when the next child cannot think of a word to append that would yield a meaningful compound.<p><a id="Verb_inflection" name="Verb_inflection"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Verb inflection</span></h3>
      <p>Standard German verbs inflect into:<ul>
       <li>one of two conjugation classes, <!--del_lnk--> weak and <!--del_lnk--> strong (like English).</ul>
      <p>(There is actually a third class, known as mixed verbs, which exhibit inflections combining features of both the strong and weak patterns.)<ul>
       <li>three persons: 1st, 2nd, 3rd.<li>two numbers: singular and plural<li>three <!--del_lnk--> moods: Indicative, Subjunctive, Imperative<li>two <!--del_lnk--> genera verbi: active and passive; the passive being composed and dividable into static and dynamic.<li>two non-composed tenses (Present, <!--del_lnk--> Preterite) and four composed tenses (Perfect, Plusquamperfect, Future I, Future II)<li>distinction between <!--del_lnk--> grammatical aspects is rendered by combined use of subjunctive and/or Preterite marking; thus: neither of both is plain indicative voice, sole subjunctive conveys second-hand information, subjunctive plus Preterite marking forms the conditional state, and sole Preterite is either plain indicative (in the past), or functions as a (literal) alternative for either second-hand-information or for the conditional state of the verb, when one of them may seem undistinguishable otherwise.<li>distinction between perfect and progressive aspect is and has at every stage of development been at hand as a productive category of the older language and in nearly all documented dialects, but, strangely enough, is nowadays rigorously excluded from written usage in its present normalised form.<li>disambiguation of completed vs. uncompleted forms is widely observed and regularly generated by common prefixes (blicken - to look, erblicken - to see [unrelated form: sehen - to see]).</ul>
      <p>There are also many ways to expand, and sometimes radically change, the meaning of a base verb through several prefixes. Examples: haften=to stick, verhaften=to imprison; kaufen=to buy, verkaufen=to sell; h&ouml;ren=to hear, aufh&ouml;ren=to cease.<p><a id="Syntax" name="Syntax"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Syntax</span></h3>
      <p>The word order is generally more rigid than in English except for nouns (see below). One word order is for a main and another for relative clauses. In normal positive sentences the <i>inflected</i> verb always has position 2; In questions, exclamations, and wishes, it always has position 1. In relative clauses the verb is supposed to occur at the very end. In speech some clauses are excused from this rule. For example in a subordinate clause introduced by the German word for &quot;because&quot; (weil) the verb quite often occupies the same order as in a main clause. Correct is <b>... weil ich pleite bin.</b> (...because I&#39;m broke). In the vernacular you hear <b>...weil ich bin pleite.</b>. This may be caused by mixing <b>weil</b> with a second, alternative word for &quot;because&quot;, <b>denn</b>, which confusingly is used with the main clause order (<b>...denn ich bin pleite.</b>).<p>Sentences using modal verbs separate the auxiliary putting the infinitive at the end. For example, the sentence in English &quot;Should he go home?&quot; would be rearranged in German to say &quot;Should he home go?&quot; (<b>Soll er nach Hause gehen?</b>). Thus in sentences with several subordinate or relative clauses verbs tend to gather at the end. The reader or listener then has the job of reconnecting these verbs individually to the subjects to which they belong. Compare the mental acrobatics to rearrange prepositions in the following English sentence: What did you bring that book that I don&#39;t like to be read to out of up for?<p>To ease the German syntax, a rule has been imposed to limit the number of infinitives at the end to two, placing the third infinitive or auxiliary verb that would have gone to the end to the beginning of the chain of verbs. In the sentence &quot;Should he move into the house that he just had renovated?&quot; would be rearranged to &quot;Should he into that house move which he just had renovate let?&quot;. (<b>Soll er in das Haus einziehen, das er gerade hat renovieren lassen?</b>). If there are more than three, all others are relocated to the beginning of the chain. Needless to say the rule is not exclusively applied. Many native speakers spend their entire lives without ever using it outside of school at all. It&#39;s found in newspapers, radio or tv reports and in educated circles. Mostly the situation is avoided by reorganizing the sentence.<p>The position of a noun as a subject or object in a german sentence doesn&#39;t affect the meaning of the sentence as it would in English. In a declarative sentence in English if the subject does not occur before the predicate the sentence could well be misunderstood. In a headline, for example, &quot;Man bites dog&quot; it&#39;s clear who did what to whom. To exchange the place of the subject with that of the object changes the meaning completely. In other words the word order in a sentence conveys significant information. In German, nouns and articles are declined as in Latin thus indicating its case as nominative or accusative (among others). The above example in German would be <b>Ein Mann bei&szlig;t den Hund</b> or <b>Den Hund bei&szlig;t ein Mann</b> with exactly the same meaning. If the articles are omitted, which is sometimes done in headlines (<b>Hund bei&szlig;t Mann</b>), it&#39;s like in English, the first noun is the subject. The noun following the predicate is the object.<p>Except for cases of emphasis adverbs of time have to appear in the third place in the sentence (just after the predicate). Otherwise the speaker would be recognised as non-German. For instance the German word order (in English) is: We&#39;re going tomorrow to town. (<b>Wir gehen morgen in die Stadt.</b>)<p>Many German verbs are separable meaning that the verb&#39;s prefix (often a preposition) is split off and moved to the end of the sentence, hence considered by some to be a &quot;resultative particle&quot;, unique to the German language. For example, <b>mitgehen</b> meaning &quot;to go with&quot; would be split giving <b>Gehen Sie mit?</b> (Are you also going?). Although ending English sentences with a preposition is sometimes frowned upon, this construction is standard in German.

      <p>Most German vocabulary is derived from the Germanic branch of the <!--del_lnk--> Indo-European language family, although there are significant minorities of words derived from <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a>, and most recently <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> (which, in English, is known as <!--del_lnk--> Germish or in German as <!--del_lnk--> Denglisch). At the same time, the effectiveness of the German language in forming rivals for foreign words from its inherited Germanic stem repertory is great. Thus, <!--del_lnk--> Notker Labeo was able to translate Aristotelian treatises in pure (Old High) German in the decades after the year 1000.<p>Still today, many low-key scholarlymovements try to promote the <i>Ersatz</i> (substitution) of virtually all foreign words with German alternatives: ancient, dialectal, or neologisms. It is claimed that this would also help in spreading modern or scientific notions among the less educated, and thus democratise public life, too. (Jurisprudence in Germany, for example, uses perhaps the &ldquo;purest&rdquo; tongue in terms of &quot;Germanness&quot; to be found today.)<p>The coining of new, autochthonous words, gave German a vocabulary of an estimated 40,000 words as early as the ninth century (in comparison, Latin, with a written tradition of nearly 2,500 years in an empire which ruled the Mediterranean, has grown to no more than 45,000 words today). The vocabulary of German is smaller than that of English, which has the largest lexicon of any language.<p><a id="Writing_system" name="Writing_system"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Writing system</span></h2>

      <p>German is now written using the <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_alphabet.htm" title="Latin alphabet">Latin alphabet</a>. In addition to the 26 standard letters, German has three vowels with <!--del_lnk--> Umlaut, namely <i>&auml;</i>, <i>&ouml;</i> and <i>&uuml;</i>, as well as the Eszett or scharfes S (sharp &quot;s&quot;) <i><!--del_lnk--> &szlig;</i>.<p>In German spelling before the <!--del_lnk--> reform of 1996, <i>&szlig;</i> replaced <i>ss</i> after long vowels and diphthongs and before consonants, word-, or partial-word-endings.

In <a href="../../wp/s/Switzerland.htm" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, <i>&szlig;</i> is not used at all.<p>Umlaut vowels (&auml;, &ouml;, &uuml;) can be circumscribed with ae, oe, and ue if the umlauts are not available on the keyboard used.

German readers understand those circumscriptions (although they look unusual), but they are avoided if the regular umlauts are available since &quot;ae&quot;, &quot;oe&quot; and &quot;ue&quot; can in rare cases also mean a regular vowel with silent &quot;e&quot;, in the manner of &quot;ah&quot;, &quot;oh&quot; and &quot;uh&quot;. This is often used in Westphalia, examples are the cities &quot;Raesfeld&quot; [&#x2E1;ra&#x2D0;sf&#x25B;lt] and &quot;Coesfeld&quot; [&#x2E1;ko&#x2D0;sf&#x25B;lt] near M&uuml;nster.<p>Unfortunately there is still no general agreement exactly where these Umlauts occur in the sorting sequence. Telephone directories treat them by replacing them with the base vowel followed by an &quot;e&quot;, whereas dictionaries use just the base vowel. As an example in a telephone book &quot;&Auml;rzte&quot; occurs after &quot;Adressenverlage&quot; but before &quot;Anlagenbauer&quot; (because &quot;&Auml;&quot; is replaced by &quot;Ae&quot;). In a dictionary &quot;&Auml;rzte&quot; occurs after &quot;Arzt&quot; but before &quot;Asbest&quot; (because &quot;&Auml;&quot; is treated as &quot;A&quot;).<p><a id="Past" name="Past"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Past</span></h3>
      <p>Until the early <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a>, German was mostly printed in <!--del_lnk--> blackletter <!--del_lnk--> typefaces (mostly in <!--del_lnk--> Fraktur, but also in <!--del_lnk--> Schwabacher) and written in corresponding <!--del_lnk--> handwriting (for example <!--del_lnk--> Kurrent and <!--del_lnk--> S&uuml;tterlin). These variants of the Latin alphabet are very different from the serif or sans serif <!--del_lnk--> Antiqua typefaces used today, and particularly the handwritten forms are difficult for the untrained to read. The printed forms however are claimed by some to be actually more readable when used for printing <!--del_lnk--> Germanic languages. The <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazis">Nazis</a> initially promoted Fraktur and Schwabacher since they were considered <!--del_lnk--> Aryan, although they later abolished them in <!--del_lnk--> 1941 by claiming that these letters were Jewish.<p><a id="Phonology" name="Phonology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Phonology</span></h2>

      <p>The German vowels A, O and U with or without <!--del_lnk--> umlauts are pronounced long or short depending normally upon what follows it in the syllable. If the vowel is at the end of a syllable or followed by a single consonant it is normally pronounced long (Ex. <i>Hof</i> = yard pronounced like the <i>o</i> in the English word &quot;hope&quot;). If it is followed by a double consonant like <i>ff</i>, <i>ss</i> or <i>tt</i> it is nearly always short (Ex. <i>Hoffnung</i> = Hope, pronounced similar to the first <i>o</i> in the English word &quot;bottom&quot;). A vowel followed by &quot;st&quot; is sometimes short (Ex. <i>Posten</i> = entry on an invoice) and sometimes long (Ex. <i>Kloster</i> = convent). These rules are unfortunately neither consistent nor universal. In central Germany (Hessen), for example, the <i>o</i> in the proper name &quot;Hoffmann&quot; is pronounced long as if the name were spelled &quot;Hofmann&quot;. The combination &quot;ch&quot; is always treated as a single consonant. Thus when following a vowel the vowel should be pronounced long. In the combinations &quot;ck&quot; and &quot;dt&quot; the first letter is silent. It&#39;s only there to show that the preceding vowel should be pronounced short. This rule is not universally observed. According to the rule the <i>e</i> in the name <i>Mecklenburg</i>, for example, should be pronounced with short <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[&#x25B;]</span> (like the English &quot;e&quot; in <i>bet</i>), but it is often pronounced with long <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[e&#x2D0;]</span> (like the &quot;ai&quot; in a <!--del_lnk--> Scottish English pronunciation of <i>bait</i>). This is caused by the spelling traditions of Low German dialects, where &quot;ck&quot; was used to indicate a long vowel and occurs mainly in old names from this region. The word <i>St&auml;dte</i> (= cities), for example, is pronounced with a short vowel (<span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[&#x2C8;&#x283;t&#x25B;t&#x259;]</span>) by some (Jan Hofer, ARD Television) and with a long vowel (<span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[&#x2C8;&#x283;t&#x25B;&#x2D0;t&#x259;]</span>) by others (Marietta Slomka, ZDF Television).<p>The <!--del_lnk--> digraph <i>ei</i> is pronounced <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[ai]</span> (e.g. <i>meine</i> = mine). The digraph <i>ie</i> is pronounced <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[i&#x2D0;]</span> (e.g. <i>diese</i> = this), as is <i>i</i> followed by a single consonant (e.g. <i>Berlin</i>). However, the feminine suffix <i>-in</i> (e.g. <i>Kanzlerin</i> = female chancellor) is pronounced <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[&#x26A;n]</span>, with a short vowel.<p><a id="Umlaut_.28_.C2.A8_.29" name="Umlaut_.28_.C2.A8_.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Umlaut ( &uml; )</span></h3>
      <ul>
       <li><b>&Auml;</b>: In its short form comes close to the <i>e</i> of the English word b<i>e</i>d. Its long form has no equivalent in English but comes close to the /eir/ in &quot;their&quot;.<li><b>&Ouml;</b>: In its long form comes close to the <i>ir</i> sound in the English word &quot;bird&quot;. (Ex. <i>Br&ouml;tchen</i> = roll (to eat)).<li><b>&Uuml;</b>: In its long form comes close to the <i>yu</i> sound in the English words &quot;mule&quot; or &quot;music&quot;. (Ex. <i>M&uuml;nchen</i> = Munich). It is pronounced similarly to the <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a> &quot;u&quot;.</ul>

      <ul>
       <li><b>C</b> standing alone is not a germanic letter. It never occurs at the beginning of a germanic word. In borrowed words together with &quot;h&quot; there is no single agreement on the pronunciation. It&#39;s pronounced either as the English &quot;sh&quot; in or as &quot;k&quot;. (Ex. <i>China</i>( = China) or <i>Chemie</i> (= Chemistry).<li><b>Ch</b> occurs most often but has no equivalent in English. There are two slightly different ways of pronunciation in High German: After e and i it sounds a bit like the &quot;h&quot; in &quot;huge&quot;, but is pronounced more sharply and strongly (Ex. <i>mich</i> = me). After a, o and u (dark vowels) it is as if you tried to pronounce <i>k</i> without cutting off the air above the tongue. (Ex. <i>Rache</i> = revenge). In western Germany (Rheinland) it is in any position pronounced as <i>sch</i> equivalent to the English <i>sh</i> in the word shoe. In this area distinguishing between such words as <i>Kirchen</i> (Churches) and <i>Kirschen</i> (cherries) is left up to the context.<li><b>H</b> is aspirated, as in &quot;<i>H</i>ome&quot; at the beginning of a syllable. After a vowel it&#39;s silent and just lengthens the vowel. (Ex. <i>Reh</i> = Deer)<li><b>W</b> is pronounced as /v/ as in &quot;<i>V</i>acation&quot; (Ex. Was = What)<li><b>S</b> is pronounced as /z/ as in &quot;<i>Z</i>ebra&quot; (Ex. Sonne = Sun)<li><b>Z</b> is always pronounced as /ts/.<li><b>F</b> is pronounced as /f/ as in &quot;<i>F</i>ather&quot;.<li><b>V</b> is pronounced as /f/ in words of Germanic origin (Ex. <i>Vater</i> = Father) and as /v/ in other words (Ex. E<i>v</i>idenz = Evidence)<li><b>&szlig;</b> is never used at the beginning of a word. It is pronounced as /s/ as in &quot;<i>s</i>ee&quot; (Ex. <i>Scho&szlig;</i> = lap).</ul>
      <p>The <b>th</b> sound common in English actually came from Anglo Saxon. It survived on the continent up to Old High German then disappeared with the consonant shifts about the 9th century.<p><a id="Diphthongs" name="Diphthongs"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Diphthongs</span></h3>
      <ul>
       <li><b>AU</b> occurs often and is pronounced as the English /au/ in <i>house</i> (Ex. <i>Haus</i> = house)<li><b>EI</b> is pronounced as /ai/ in &quot;I&quot; (Ex. <i>mein</i> = mine)<li><b>AI</b> is pronounced the same as their <i>EI</i>. (Ex. <i>Mai</i> = May)<li><b>IE</b> is pronounced as the long &quot;i&quot; of bee. (Ex. <i>Tier</i> = Animal)<li><b>EU</b> is pronounced as /oi/ in boy. (Ex. <i>Treu</i> = Loyal).<li><b>&Auml;U</b> is pronounced the same as their diphthong <i>EU</i>. (Ex. <i>Fr&auml;ulein</i> = Miss)</ul>

      <p>Because of the turbulent history of both Germany and the German language, the names that other peoples have chosen to use to refer to it varies more than for most other languages.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> Italian the sole name for German is still <i>tedesco</i>, from the <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>teutiscum</i>, meaning &quot;vernacular&quot;.<p><!--del_lnk--> Romanian used to use in the past the Slavonic term &quot;nem&#x163;e&#x15F;te&quot;, but &quot;German&#x103;&quot; is now widely used. Hungarian &quot;n&eacute;met&quot; is also of Slavonic origin. The Arabic name for Austria, &#x627;&#x644;&#x646;&#x645;&#x633;&#x627; (&quot;an-namsa&quot;), is derived from the Slavonic term.<p>Note also that, although the Russian term for the language is <b>&#x43D;&#x435;&#x43C;&#x435;&#x446;&#x43A;&#x438;&#x439;</b> <i>(nemetskij)</i>, the country is <b>&#x413;&#x435;&#x440;&#x43C;&#x430;&#x43D;&#x438;&#x44F;</b> <i>(Germaniya)</i>. However, in some other Slavic languages, as with Polish, the country name (<b>Niemcy</b> <i>(pl)</i>) is similar to the name of the language, (j&#x119;zyk) <b>niemiecki</b>.<p>A possible explanation for the use of &quot;mute&quot; <i>(nemoj)</i> to refer to German (and also to Germans) in Slavic languages is that Germans were the first people Slavic tribes encountered, with whom they could not communicate. The corresponding experience for the Germans was with the <!--del_lnk--> Volcae, whose name they subsequently also applied to the Slavs, see <!--del_lnk--> etymology of Vlach. Another less-attested possibility is that the Slavs first encountered a Germanic tribe called the Nemetes (which was mentioned by the Romans), and later meeting other Germans, applied the tribe&#39;s name &quot;Nemetes&quot; to all Germans.<p><a href="../../wp/h/Hebrew_language.htm" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> traditionally (nowadays this is not the case) used the Biblical term <!--del_lnk--> Ashkenaz (Genesis 10:3) to refer to Germany, or to certain parts of it, and the <!--del_lnk--> Ashkenazi Jews are those who originate from Germany and Eastern Europe and formerly spoke <!--del_lnk--> Yiddish as their native language, derived from <!--del_lnk--> Middle High German.<p>See also <!--del_lnk--> Names for Germany.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language&quot;</div>
