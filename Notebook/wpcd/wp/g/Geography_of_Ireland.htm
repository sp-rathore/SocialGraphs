The ocean is responsible for the rugged western coastline, along which are many islands, <!--del_lnk--> peninsulas, and <!--del_lnk--> headlands. The main geographical features of Ireland are low central <!--del_lnk--> plains surrounded by a ring of coastal <!--del_lnk--> mountains. The highest peak is <!--del_lnk--> Carrauntuohill (<!--del_lnk--> Irish: <i>Corr&aacute;n Tuathail</i>), which is 1041&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> m (3414&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ft). There are a number of sizable lakes along Ireland&#39;s rivers, with <!--del_lnk--> Lough Neagh the largest in either <a href="../../wp/b/British_Isles.htm" title="British Isles">Britain or Ireland</a>. The island is bisected by the <!--del_lnk--> River Shannon, at 259&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km (161&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> miles) with a 113&nbsp;km (70&nbsp;miles) estuary the longest river in Ireland which flows south from <!--del_lnk--> County Cavan in the north to meet the Atlantic just south of <a href="../../wp/l/Limerick.htm" title="Limerick">Limerick</a>.<p>The island of Ireland consists politically of the <a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_Ireland.htm" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>.

      </div>
      <p>The oldest known Irish rock is about 1.7 billion years old and is found on <!--del_lnk--> Inishtrahull Island off the coast of <!--del_lnk--> County Donegal. In other parts of Donegal, scientists have discovered rocks that began life as <a href="../../wp/g/Glacier.htm" title="Glacier">glacial</a> deposits, demonstrating that at this early period, part of what was to become Ireland was in the grip of an <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_age.htm" title="Ice age">ice age</a>. However, because of the effects of later upheavals, it is almost impossible to sequence these early rock layers correctly.<p>About 600 million years ago, at the end of the <a href="../../wp/p/Precambrian.htm" title="Precambrian">Precambrian</a> era, the Irish landmass was divided in two, with one half on the western side of the <!--del_lnk--> Iapetus Ocean and the other at the eastern side, both at about the latitude that <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> currently occupies. From the evidence of <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil.htm" title="Fossil">fossils</a> found at <!--del_lnk--> Bray Head in <!--del_lnk--> County Wicklow, Ireland was below <!--del_lnk--> sea level at this time.<p>Over the next 50 million years, these two parts drifted towards each other, eventually uniting about 440 million years ago. Fossils discovered near Clogher Head, <!--del_lnk--> County Louth, show the coming together of shoreline fauna from both sides of the original dividing ocean. The mountains of northwest Ireland were formed during the collision, as was the <a href="../../wp/g/Granite.htm" title="Granite">granite</a> that is found in locations in Donegal and Wicklow.<p>The Irish landmass was now above sea level and lying near the equator, and fossil traces of land-based life forms survive from this period. These include fossilised trees from Kiltorcan, <!--del_lnk--> County Kilkenny, widespread bony fish and freshwater <!--del_lnk--> mussel fossils and the footprints of a four-footed <!--del_lnk--> amphibian preserved in <!--del_lnk--> slate on Valentia Island, <!--del_lnk--> County Kerry. <!--del_lnk--> Old Red Sandstone also formed at this time.<p>Between 400 million and 300 million years ago, northwest <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> &ndash; including Ireland &ndash; sank beneath a warm, <a href="../../wp/c/Calcium.htm" title="Calcium">calcium</a>-rich sea. Great <!--del_lnk--> coral reefs formed in these waters, eventually creating the <!--del_lnk--> limestone that still makes up about 65 per cent of the rock <!--del_lnk--> mantle of the island. As the waters receded, <!--del_lnk--> tropical forests and <!--del_lnk--> swamps flourished. The resulting vegetable debris eventually formed coal, most of which was later eroded. This period, known as the <a href="../../wp/c/Carboniferous.htm" title="Carboniferous">Carboniferous</a> era, ended with further plate movement which saw Ireland drift further northward. The resulting pressure created those Irish mountain and hill ranges that run in a northeast to southwest direction.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>By 250 million years ago, Ireland was at the latitude of present-day <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> and had a <a href="../../wp/d/Desert.htm" title="Desert">desert</a> climate. It was at this time that most of the <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a> and <!--del_lnk--> sandstone were eroded. The thinner layers of limestone in the south of the country were also partially affected by this erosion. The limestone that was exposed by the disappearance of its sandstone mantle was affected by <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> and other factors resulting in a <!--del_lnk--> karstic landscape that can still be seen in the <!--del_lnk--> Burren in <!--del_lnk--> County Clare.<p>Shortly after this period, organic debris in the seas around Ireland began to form the gas and oil deposits that now play an important role in the island&#39;s economy. Then, about 150 million years ago, Ireland was again submerged, this time in a chalky sea that resulted in the formation of <!--del_lnk--> chalk over large parts of the surface. Traces of this survive under the <!--del_lnk--> basalt <!--del_lnk--> lava that is found in parts of the north.<p>About 65 million years ago, the <a href="../../wp/v/Volcano.htm" title="Volcano">volcanic</a> activity that formed this lava began. The <!--del_lnk--> Mourne Mountains and other mountains in the northern part of the island formed as a result of this activity. Climatic conditions at this time were warm and vegetation thrived. Vegetable debris in the <!--del_lnk--> Antrim depression formed deposits of brown coal or <!--del_lnk--> lignite which remain untouched down to the present time. The warm conditions produced high rainfall that accelerated processes of erosion and the formation of karstic landscape forms.<p>By 25 million years ago, Ireland was close to assuming its present position. The long period of erosion had resulted in considerable soil formation and most of the rock mantle was covered. In areas with good drainage, the covering consisted of brown or grey <a href="../../wp/s/Soil.htm" title="Soil">soil</a>, while in poorly drained areas the black <a href="../../wp/c/Clay.htm" title="Clay">clay</a> tended to dominate. As the climate cooled, soil formation slowed down, and a <!--del_lnk--> flora and <!--del_lnk--> fauna that would, millions of years later, be familiar to the first human inhabitants began to emerge. By about three million years ago, the present landscape of Ireland had more or less formed.<p>Since about 1.7 million years ago, the earth has been in the grip of a cycle of warm and cold stages and these have, inevitably, affected Ireland. The earliest evidence we have for this effect comes from the period known as the <!--del_lnk--> Ballylinian Warm Stage, some half a million years ago. At this time, most of what are now considered to be native Irish trees were already established on the island. The action of the ice during the cold stages was the major factor in bringing the Irish landscape to its current form.<p>Obvious impacts of the ice on the landscape include the formation of glacial valleys such as <!--del_lnk--> Glendalough in Wicklow and of <!--del_lnk--> corries, or glacial lakes. The depositing of mounds of debris under the melting ice created <!--del_lnk--> drumlins, a common feature of the landscape across the north midlands. Streams also formed under the ice and the material deposited by these formed <!--del_lnk--> eskers (<!--del_lnk--> Irish <i>eiscir</i>). The greatest of these, the Esker Riada, divides the northern and southern halves of the island and its ridge once served as the main highway connecting the east and west coasts.<p><a id="Rocks_and_soil_types" name="Rocks_and_soil_types"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Rocks and soil types</span></h3>

      <p>The large central lowland is of <!--del_lnk--> limestone covered with glacial deposits of clay and sand, with widespread bogs and lakes. The <!--del_lnk--> Bog of Allen is one of the largest bogs. The coastal mountains vary greatly in geological structure. In the south, the mountains are composed of old red <!--del_lnk--> sandstone with limestone river valleys. In <!--del_lnk--> Galway, <!--del_lnk--> Mayo, Donegal, <!--del_lnk--> Down and Wicklow, the mountains are mainly <a href="../../wp/g/Granite.htm" title="Granite">granite</a>, while much of the north-east of the country is a <!--del_lnk--> basalt plateau. An area of particular note is the <a href="../../wp/g/Giant%2527s_Causeway.htm" title="Giant&#39;s Causeway">Giant&#39;s Causeway</a>, in <!--del_lnk--> County Antrim, a mainly basalt formation.<p>The soils of the north and west tend to be poorly drained peats and <!--del_lnk--> gleys, including peaty <!--del_lnk--> podzols. In contrast, in the south and east the soils are free-draining brown earths and brown and grey-brown podzols. This is reflected in the rainfall distribution on the island, with the poorly-drained regions being those with the highest rainfalls.<p>An unusual environment is present in north <!--del_lnk--> County Clare, in an area known as <!--del_lnk--> The Burren. This <!--del_lnk--> karst-like landscape consists of limestone bedrock, with little or no soil in the inner-most areas. There are numerous sink-holes, where surface water disappears through the porous rock surface, and extensive cave systems have been formed in some areas.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Ireland consists of a mostly flat low-lying area in the midlands, ringed by mountain ranges such as (beginning in County Kerry and working counter-clockwise) the <!--del_lnk--> Macgillycuddy&#39;s Reeks, <!--del_lnk--> Comeragh Mountains, <!--del_lnk--> Blackstair Mountains, <!--del_lnk--> Wicklow Mountains, <!--del_lnk--> the Mournes, <!--del_lnk--> Glens of Antrim, <!--del_lnk--> Sperrin Mountains, <!--del_lnk--> Bluestack Mountains, <!--del_lnk--> Derryveagh Mountains, <!--del_lnk--> Ox Mountains, <!--del_lnk--> Nephinbeg Mountains and the <!--del_lnk--> Twelve Bens/<!--del_lnk--> Maumturks group. Some mountain ranges are further inland in the south of Ireland, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Galtee Mountains, <!--del_lnk--> Silvermines and <!--del_lnk--> Slieve Bloom Mountains. The highest peak is <!--del_lnk--> Carrauntuohill, which is 1041&nbsp;m (3414&nbsp;ft) high. It is in the Macgillycuddy&#39;s Reeks, a range of <a href="../../wp/g/Glacier.htm" title="Glacier">glacier</a>-carved <!--del_lnk--> sandstone mountains in <!--del_lnk--> County Kerry, in the south-west of the island. The mountains are not high - only three peaks are over 1000 m (just) and another 455 exceed 500 m. <!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Rivers_and_lakes" name="Rivers_and_lakes"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Rivers and lakes</span></h3>
      <p>The main river in Ireland is the <!--del_lnk--> River Shannon, 386&nbsp;km (240&nbsp;miles), the longest river in either <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> or <!--del_lnk--> Britain, which separates the boggy midlands of Ireland from the West of Ireland. The river develops into three lakes along its course, <!--del_lnk--> Lough Allen, <!--del_lnk--> Lough Ree, and <!--del_lnk--> Lough Derg. Of these, Lough Derg is the biggest. The River Shannon enters the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> after <!--del_lnk--> Limerick city at the Shannon Estuary.

The <!--del_lnk--> Inishowen Peninsula in <!--del_lnk--> County Donegal includes Ireland&#39;s most northerly point, <!--del_lnk--> Malin Head and several important towns including <!--del_lnk--> Buncrana on <!--del_lnk--> Lough Swilly, Carndonagh and Moville on <!--del_lnk--> Lough Foyle.<p>Ireland&#39;s most northerly land feature is Inishtrahull island, off Malin Head, although <a href="../../wp/r/Rockall.htm" title="Rockall">Rockall</a> Island may deserve this honour but its status is disputed, being claimed by the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Denmark (for the Faroe Islands) and Iceland. Its most southerly is the <!--del_lnk--> Fastnet Rock.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h2>
      <p>Ireland&#39;s climate is <a href="../../wp/t/Temperate.htm" title="Temperate">temperate</a>, though significantly warmer than almost all other locations at similar <!--del_lnk--> latitude, such as <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Poland</a> (on the continent) or <!--del_lnk--> Newfoundland (on the opposite edge of the Atlantic), due to the warming influence of the <!--del_lnk--> North Atlantic drift. The prevailing wind blows from the south-west to the north-east, breaking on the high mountains of the west coast. <a href="../../wp/r/Rain.htm" title="Rain">Rainfall</a> is therefore a particularly prominent part of western Irish life, with <!--del_lnk--> Valentia Island, off the west coast of <!--del_lnk--> County Kerry, getting almost twice as much annual rainfall as <a href="../../wp/d/Dublin.htm" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> on the east (1400&nbsp;mm vs. 762&nbsp;mm). Across the country, about 60% of the annual rainfall occurs between August and January.<p>January and February are the coldest months of the year, and mean daily air temperatures fall between 4 and 7 &deg;C during these months. July and August are the warmest, with a range of 14 to 16 &deg;C. The sunniest months are May and June, with an average of five to seven hours sunshine per day.<p>Though extreme weather events in Ireland are comparatively rare when compared with other countries in the European Continent, they do occur. Explosive Atlantic depressions, occurring mainly in the months of December, January and February, can occasionally bring winds of up to 160 km/ph (100 mph) to Western coastal counties; while the summer months, and particularly around late July/early August, sudden and violent thunderstorms can develop, more especially, but not exclusively, across midland and western areas of the country.<p>The table shows mean climate figures for the Dublin Airport weather station for the period 1961 to 1990.<table>

      <p>From an administrative viewpoint, 20 of the counties in the Republic are units of local government. The other six have more than one local authority area, producing a total of 34 county-level authorities. <!--del_lnk--> Tipperary has two parts, <!--del_lnk--> North Tipperary and <!--del_lnk--> South Tipperary. The cities of Dublin, <!--del_lnk--> Cork, <a href="../../wp/l/Limerick.htm" title="Limerick">Limerick</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Galway and <!--del_lnk--> Waterford have city councils and are administered separately from the counties bearing those names. The remaining part of <!--del_lnk--> County Dublin is split into <!--del_lnk--> Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown, <!--del_lnk--> Fingal, and <!--del_lnk--> South Dublin.<p>Electoral areas in the Republic of Ireland, called constituencies in accordance with <!--del_lnk--> Irish law, mostly follow county boundaries. Maintaining links to the county system is a mandatory consideration in the re-organisation of constituency boundaries.<p>In Northern Ireland, a major re-organisation of local government in 1973 replaced the six traditional counties and two <!--del_lnk--> county boroughs (<a href="../../wp/b/Belfast.htm" title="Belfast">Belfast</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Derry) by 26 single-tier <!--del_lnk--> districts, which, apart from Fermanagh cross the traditional county boundaries. The six counties and two county-boroughs remain in use for purposes such as <!--del_lnk--> Lieutenancy. In November 2005, <!--del_lnk--> proposals were announced which would see the number of local authorities reduced to seven.<p>The island&#39;s total <!--del_lnk--> population of approximately 6&nbsp;million people is concentrated on the east coast, particularly in Dublin and Belfast and their surrounding areas.<p><a id="Natural_resources" name="Natural_resources"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Ireland&quot;</div>
