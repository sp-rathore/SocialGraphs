      <p><b>Gordon Griffith</b> or <b>Gordon S. Griffith</b> (<!--del_lnk--> July 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1907, <a href="../../wp/c/Chicago.htm" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> October 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1958) was an <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">American</a> <!--del_lnk--> assistant director, <!--del_lnk--> film producer, and one of the first <!--del_lnk--> child actors. Griffith worked in the film industry for five decades, acting in over sixty films, and surviving the transition from <a href="../../wp/s/Silent_film.htm" title="Silent film">silent films</a> to <!--del_lnk--> talkies&mdash;films with sound. During his acting career, he worked with <a href="../../wp/c/Charlie_Chaplin.htm" title="Charlie Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a>, and was the first actor to portray both <!--del_lnk--> Tom Sawyer and <!--del_lnk--> Tarzan on film.<p>Griffith was born on <!--del_lnk--> July 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1907 in <a href="../../wp/c/Chicago.htm" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Illinois, to actors Harry Sutherland Griffith and Katherine Kiemar Griffith. He had two siblings, an older sister Gertrude, and a younger brother Graham&mdash;also an actor. Griffith was already an experienced actor when, at age seven, he got his first acting role as a regular character in the <!--del_lnk--> Little Billy serials. <!--del_lnk--> Mack Sennett of <!--del_lnk--> Keystone Studios cast Griffith in many of his <!--del_lnk--> slapstick features, including <i><!--del_lnk--> Tillie&#39;s Punctured Romance</i>, where he eventually earned supporting roles in Charlie Chaplin films.<p>His big break came with the role of young <!--del_lnk--> Tarzan, in the 1918 film <i><!--del_lnk--> Tarzan of the Apes</i>. He was required to do his own stunts, such as climbing trees, swinging from vines, and interacting closely with a <a href="../../wp/c/Chimpanzee.htm" title="Chimpanzee">chimpanzee</a>. Griffith also has several <!--del_lnk--> nude scenes in the first half of the film, making him one of the first pre-teens to appear on screen naked. Griffith appears before the actor portraying the adult Tarzan&mdash;<!--del_lnk--> Elmo Lincoln&mdash;making him the first actor to portray Tarzan in film. After seeing the film, a critic described Griffith as &quot;a youthful actor of uncommon gifts.&quot;<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Griffith received the role of Tom Sawyer in the 1920 film <i><!--del_lnk--> Huckleberry Finn</i>. Later he was again cast in the first Tarzan serial as Tarzan&#39;s son, Korak, a role that has been described as &quot;anticipating <!--del_lnk--> John Sheffield&#39;s &#39;boy&#39; roles [in later Tarzan films].&quot; Both of his parents died in the 1920s&mdash;his mother in 1921 and his father in 1926. At the time of the 1930 census, he and his brother were living with his sister and her family in <!--del_lnk--> Pasadena, California.<p>Although his career survived the transition from silent films to sound, Griffith received smaller and smaller roles&mdash;occasionally not even being credited for his performances. As his acting career cooled, Griffith moved into other areas of the film industry. At the age of twenty-three he got his first job as an assistant director. His final acting credit came six years later in 1936&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Bars of Hate</i>.<p>Griffith continued to work in the film industry until his death, working as an assistant director at <!--del_lnk--> Monogram Pictures, an associate producer under <!--del_lnk--> Robert Sherwood, and as a director and then as an associate producer for <!--del_lnk--> Gregory Ratoff Productions. In 1941, Griffith became production manager at <!--del_lnk--> Columbia Pictures, and later served as an associate producer for <!--del_lnk--> RKO, eventually becoming a producer for films such as 1956&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Alexander the Great</i>. In 1958, Griffith died of a heart attack in <!--del_lnk--> Hollywood, and was survived by his sister. <p><a id="Selected_filmography" name="Selected_filmography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Selected filmography</span></h2>
