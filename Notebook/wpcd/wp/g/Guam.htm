      <p><b>Guam</b> (<!--del_lnk--> Chamorro: <i>Gu&aring;h&aring;n</i>), officially the <b>U.S. Territory of Guam</b>, is an island in the Western <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> and is an <!--del_lnk--> organized <!--del_lnk--> unincorporated territory of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. Its inhabitants are the <!--del_lnk--> Chamorros, who first populated the island approximately 4,000 years ago. Experts theorize that the first peoples migrated from origins involved in the early trading routes, however, others speculate that the peoples more likely originated from South East Asia including Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Most early Chamorros take on the likeness of peoples from this origin, however, more and more, the people of Guam are becoming racially-mixed. It is the largest and southernmost of the <!--del_lnk--> Mariana Islands. The capital is <!--del_lnk--> Hag&aring;t&ntilde;a, formerly Agana (pronounced Aga&ntilde;a). Guam&#39;s economy is mainly supported by <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">tourism</a> (particularly from <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="../../wp/k/Korea.htm" title="Korea">Korea</a> and the <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">People&#39;s Republic of China</a>) and <!--del_lnk--> United States armed forces bases.

      <p>Guam (or Gu&aring;h&aring;n in Chamorro) is located at 13.5&deg;N 144.5&deg;E and has an area of 210 <!--del_lnk--> square miles (544 <!--del_lnk--> km&sup2;). The northern part of the island is a forested coralline limestone plateau while the south contains volcanic peaks covered in forest and grassland. A coral reef surrounds most of the island, except in areas where bays exist that provide access to small rivers and streams that run down from the hills into the Pacific Ocean and Philippine Sea. The island&#39;s population is most dense in the northern and central regions. Guam is the southernmost island in the Mariana island chain and is the largest island in Micronesia. This island chain was created as a result of the colliding of the Pacific and Philippine tectonic plates. The <!--del_lnk--> Marianas Trench, a deep <!--del_lnk--> subduction zone, lies beside the island chain to the eastern part of the island. The <!--del_lnk--> Challenger Deep, the deepest point on <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">earth</a>, is southwest of Guam at 35,797&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> feet (10,911&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> m) deep. The island experiences occasional <a href="../../wp/e/Earthquake.htm" title="Earthquake">earthquakes</a> due to being on the edge of the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Plate. In recent years, quakes with epicenters near Guam have had magnitudes ranging from 5.0 to 8.2. Unlike the <!--del_lnk--> Anatahan <a href="../../wp/v/Volcano.htm" title="Volcano">volcano</a> in the northern Marianas, Guam is not volcanically active. However, due to wind direction and proximity, volcanic ash activity does affect Guam from time to time, however, to a lesser degree.<p><a class="image" href="../../images/61/6123.jpg.htm" title=""><img alt="" height="136" longdesc="/wiki/Image:South_Guam_from_space.JPG" src="../../images/61/6123.jpg" width="200" /></a> <a class="image" href="../../images/61/6124.jpg.htm" title=""><img alt="" height="136" longdesc="/wiki/Image:Guam_from_space.JPG" src="../../images/61/6124.jpg" width="200" /></a><ul>

      <p><a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> navigator <a href="../../wp/f/Ferdinand_Magellan.htm" title="Ferdinand Magellan">Ferdinand Magellan</a> reached the island in 1521 during his circumnavigation of the globe. General <!--del_lnk--> Miguel L&oacute;pez de Legazpi claimed Guam for Spain in 1565. Spanish colonization commenced in 1668 with the arrival of Padre <!--del_lnk--> San Vitores, who established the first Catholic mission. The islands were then governed as part of the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish East Indies from the Philippines. Between 1668 and 1815, Guam was an important resting stop on the <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spanish</a> trade route between <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and the <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>. Guam, along with the rest of the Mariana and <!--del_lnk--> Caroline islands, was treated by Spain as part of their colony in the Philippines. While Guam&#39;s Chamorro culture is unique, the cultures of both Guam and the Northern Marianas were heavily influenced by Spanish culture and traditions.<p>The <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> <!--del_lnk--> took control of the island in the 1898 <!--del_lnk--> Spanish-American War. Guam came to serve as a way station for American ships traveling to and from the Philippines, while the northern Mariana islands passed to Germany then Japan.<p>During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Guam was attacked and invaded by the Japanese armed forces on December 8, 1941. The Northern Mariana Islands had become a Japanese protectorate before the war. It was the Chamorros from the Northern Marianas who were brought to Guam to serve as interpreters and in other capacities for the occupying Japanese force. The Guamanian Chamorros were treated as an occupied enemy by the Japanese military. After the war, this would cause some resentment by the Guamanian Chamorros towards the Chamorros in the Northern Marianas. To this day, Guam remains the only U.S. soil, with a sizeable population, that suffered under foreign military power occupation. Guam&#39;s occupation lasted for approximately thirty-one months. During this period, the indigenous people of Guam were subjected to forced labor, family separation, incarceration, execution, concentration camps and prostitution. The United States returned and fought the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Guam in July 21, 1944 to recapture the island from Japanese military occupation. The U.S. also captured and occupied the Northern Marianas. After the war, The <!--del_lnk--> Guam Organic Act of 1950, which established Guam as an unincorporated <!--del_lnk--> organized territory of the United States, provided for the structure of the island&#39;s government, and granted the people United States citizenship.<p><a id="Government_and_politics" name="Government_and_politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Government and politics</span></h2>

      <p>Guam is governed by a popularly elected <!--del_lnk--> governor and a <!--del_lnk--> unicameral 15 member <!--del_lnk--> legislature. Guam elects one non-voting delegate to the <!--del_lnk--> US House of Representatives, currently Congresswoman <!--del_lnk--> Madeleine Bordallo. During U.S. Presidential elections, citizens in Guam vote in a <!--del_lnk--> straw poll for their choice of president, but it doesn&#39;t count toward the general election results.<p>In the 1980s and early 1990s, there was a significant movement in favour of the Territory becoming a <!--del_lnk--> commonwealth, which would give it a political status similar to <a href="../../wp/p/Puerto_Rico.htm" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a> and the <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Mariana_Islands.htm" title="Northern Mariana Islands">Northern Mariana Islands</a>. However, the Federal government gave no response to Guam&#39;s request for Commonwealth status for a decade before Guam leaders gave up the quest in the late 1990s. Competing movements with less significant influence exist, which advocate political independence from the United States, statehood, or a combination with the Northern Mariana Islands as a single commonwealth. These proposals however, are not seen as favorable or realistic within the U.S. federal government, which argues Guam does not have the financial stability or self sufficiency to warrant such status. The same sources quickly provide evidence of Guam&rsquo;s increasing reliance on Federal spending, and question how commonwealth status or statehood would benefit the United States as a greater whole.<p><a id="Administrative_divisions" name="Administrative_divisions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Administrative divisions</span></h2>

      <p>Guam&#39;s economy depends primarily on tourism, the United States military base presence, and other federal spending. Although Guam receives no foreign aid, it does receive large transfer payments from the general revenues of the U.S. Federal Treasury into which Guam pays no income or excise taxes; under the provisions of a special law of Congress, the Guam Treasury, rather than the US Treasury, receives federal income taxes paid by military and civilian Federal employees stationed in Guam.<p>Sometimes called &quot;America in Asia,&quot; Guam is a popular destination for Japanese, Korean, and Chinese tourists, and with over 20 large hotels, a DFS Galleria, Pleasure Island aquarium, SandCastle Las Vegas shows and other shopping and entertainment features in its chief tourism city of <!--del_lnk--> Tumon, the island&#39;s economy has grown dramatically. It is a relatively short flight from Asia compared to <!--del_lnk--> Hawaii, and a series of hotels and golf courses were built to cater to tourists. Today, about 90 percent of tourists to Guam are Japanese. Significant sources of revenue include <!--del_lnk--> duty-free designer shopping outlets, and the American-style malls: <!--del_lnk--> Micronesia Mall, <!--del_lnk--> Guam Premium Outlets, and the <!--del_lnk--> Agana Shopping Centre and various businesses catering to tourists in <!--del_lnk--> Tumon.<p>The economy had been stable since 2000 due to increased tourism, mainly from Japan, but took a more recent downturn along with the rest of Asia. It is expected to stabilize with the recent news that all US Marine personnel and operations currently in Okinawa (appr.5000) will transfer to Guam sometime in 2007-2008. Guam has a 14% unemployment rate, and the government suffered a $314 million shortfall in 2003.<!--del_lnk--> <p>The following is the amount in billion of dollars, that the Government of Guam has spent in Federal grants for various government and economic expenditures minus those of the United States Armed Forces:<!--del_lnk--> <dl>

      <p>&quot;The <!--del_lnk--> Compact of Free Association between the United States of America, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands was signed in 1982, and ratified in 1986. It accorded the former entities of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands a political status of &#39;free association&#39;&quot; with the United States. The Compact was an agreement to which Guam was not a party. Over the years, it was claimed by some in Guam that Guam has had to bear the brunt of this agreement in the form of public assistance programs and public education for those from the regions involved, but was never compensated by the federal government for its expenditures.<div class="thumb tright">

Guam was added to the North American Numbering Plan in <!--del_lnk--> 1997, removing barriers of high costs of international long-distance calls to the mainland.<p>As Guam is also part of the U.S. Postal System (the postal code is <!--del_lnk--> GU), mail to Guam from the mainland is considered domestic and no additional charges are required. Private shipping companies such as UPS, DHL or FedEx also regard Guam is domestic, although this is often not reflected in the shipping charges for many mail-order companies or websites. Mail will take approximately 1-2 weeks to travel between Guam and California. Express mail and Fedex takes a minimum of three to four days to reach the U.S. Most of the residents use post office boxes to receive their mail and as their mailing addresses, though home delivery is becoming increasingly available.<p>Guam is served by the <!--del_lnk--> Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport. There are no direct flights to Guam from the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Mainland. Flights to Guam go through Hawaii, Japan, or Korea first and generally requires a layover and a plane transfer. To fly to Guam from the mainland, through Hawaii, requires a five-hour flight from San Francisco or Los Angeles, for example, and another 7.5-hour flight from Hawaii to Guam. To fly to Guam from the mainland, through Japan or Korea, requires a 10-12-hour flight from the mainland to Korea or Japan, and another 3-4-hour flight to Guam.<p>Most residents travel in Guam using personally owned cars. A limited bus system for residents exists but is relatively unused.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h2>
      <p>The climate is characterized as tropical marine. The weather is generally warm and humid with little seasonal temperature variation. The mean high temperature is 86&deg;<!--del_lnk--> F (30&nbsp;&deg;<!--del_lnk--> C) and mean low is 76&deg;<!--del_lnk--> F (24&nbsp;&deg;<!--del_lnk--> C) with an average annual rainfall of 86 <!--del_lnk--> inches (2,180&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mm). The dry season runs from December through June. The remaining months constitute the rainy season. The highest risk of typhoons is during October and November.<p>An average of three tropical storms and one typhoon pass within 180 nautical miles (330&nbsp;km) of Guam each year. The most intense typhoon to pass over Guam recently was Super Typhoon Pongsona, with sustained winds of 180 miles per hour, which slammed Guam on December 8, 2002, leaving massive destruction. After Super Typhoon Pamela in <!--del_lnk--> 1976 wooden structures began to be replaced by concrete. (See <!--del_lnk--> 1976 Pacific typhoon season, <!--del_lnk--> )<!--del_lnk-->  By the <!--del_lnk--> 1980s many homes were concrete and &quot;Typhoon proof&quot;. Since the <!--del_lnk--> 1980s wooden utility poles were slowly replaced by typhoon resistant concrete and steel poles. In the <!--del_lnk--> 1990s many home and bussiness owners installed <!--del_lnk--> typhoon shutters.<p><a id="Ecological_issues" name="Ecological_issues"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Ecological issues</span></h2>

      <p>This island also exemplifies the effects of <a href="../../wp/i/Invasive_species.htm" title="Invasive species">bioinvasion</a>: Thought to be a <!--del_lnk--> stowaway on a U.S. military transport near the end of World War II, the slightly venomous, but rather harmless, <!--del_lnk--> brown tree snake (<i>Boiga irregularis</i>) came to Guam and killed a large percentage of the native bird population on the previously snake-free island. This snake has no natural predators on the island. Although some studies have suggested a high density of the brown tree snake, residents rarely see these snakes. As prodigious climbers, the snakes were blamed for frequent blackouts in the 1980s by shorting across lines and transformers. Many power poles now have a slick metal sheath to prevent the snakes from climbing and such blackouts are now rare.<p>Many Guam residents feel that nationwide publicity concerning the brown tree snake and references to this species &quot;hanging on trees like spaghetti&quot; has caused much misinformation concerning the actual extent of the problem. While most residents acknowledge that the brown tree snake is somewhat of problem, they don&#39;t feel that it is to the extent portrayed by shows such as ABC&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> 20/20</i> in the 1990s.<p><a id="Other_invasive_animal_species" name="Other_invasive_animal_species"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other invasive animal species</span></h3>

      <p>From the 17th through 19th centuries, the Spanish introduced pigs, dogs, chickens, the Philippine deer (Cervus mariannus), <!--del_lnk--> black francolins, and <!--del_lnk--> water buffalo. Water buffalo, known as <!--del_lnk--> carabao locally, have cultural significance. Herds of these animals obstruct military base operations and harm native ecosystems. After birth control and adoption efforts were ineffective, the U.S. military began euthanizing the herds leading to organized protests from island residents. <!--del_lnk--> <p>Other introduced species include <!--del_lnk--> cane toads imported in 1937, the giant African Snail&mdash;an agricultural pest introduced during WWII&mdash;and more recently frog species which could threaten crops in addition to providing additional food for the brown tree snake population. Reports of loud chirping frogs that may have arrived from Hawaii have led to fears that the noise could even threaten Guam&#39;s tourism. <!--del_lnk-->  Introduced feral pigs and deer, over-hunting, and habitat loss from human development are also major factors in the decline and loss of Guam&#39;s native plants and animals.<p><a id="Threats_to_indigenous_plants" name="Threats_to_indigenous_plants"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Threats to indigenous plants</span></h3>
      <p>Invading animal species are not the only threat to Guam&#39;s native flora. Tinangaja, a <!--del_lnk--> virus affecting coconut palms, was first observed on the island in 1917 when <!--del_lnk--> copra production was still a major part of Guam&#39;s economy. Though coconut plantations no longer exist on the island, the dead and infected trees that have resulted from the epidemic are seen throughout the forests of Guam. <!--del_lnk-->  Also during the past century, the dense forests of northern Guam have been largely replaced by thick tangan tangan brush (<!--del_lnk--> Leucaena-native to the Americas). Much of Guam and <!--del_lnk--> Saipan&#39;s folliage was lost during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. In 1947, the U.S. military introduced tangan tangan by seeding the island from the air to prevent <!--del_lnk--> erosion. In southern Guam, non-native grass species also dominate much of the landscape.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Wildfires plague the forested (&quot;boonie&quot; or &quot;jungle&quot;) areas of Guam every <!--del_lnk--> dry season despite the island&#39;s humid climate. Most fires are man-caused with 80 percent resulting from <!--del_lnk--> arson. (See <!--del_lnk--> Territory of Guam Fire Assessment January 2004, Pgs. 6-7) <!--del_lnk--> Poachers often start fires to attract deer to the new growth. Invasive grass species that rely on fire as part of their natural life cycle grow in many regularly burned areas. <!--del_lnk--> Grasslands and &quot;barrens&quot; have replaced previously forested areas leading to greater soil <!--del_lnk--> erosion. During the <!--del_lnk--> rainy season sediment is carried by the heavy rains into the <!--del_lnk--> Fena Lake Resevoir and <!--del_lnk--> Ugum River leading to water quality problems for southern Guam. Eroded silt also destroys the marine life in reefs around the island. Soil stabilization efforts by volunteers and forestry workers to plant trees have had little success in preserving natural habitats. <!--del_lnk-->  <!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Aquatic_preserves" name="Aquatic_preserves"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Aquatic preserves</span></h3>
