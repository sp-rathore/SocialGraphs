      <p><b>Great Yarmouth</b>, often known to locals simply as <b>Yarmouth</b>, is an English coastal town in the county of <a href="../../wp/n/Norfolk.htm" title="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>. It is situated at the mouth of the <!--del_lnk--> River Yare, some <!--del_lnk--> 30km east of the city of <a href="../../wp/n/Norwich.htm" title="Norwich">Norwich</a> and <!--del_lnk--> 18 km north of the <!--del_lnk--> Suffolk town of <!--del_lnk--> Lowestoft.<p>Great Yarmouth has been a <!--del_lnk--> seaside resort since <!--del_lnk--> 1760, and is the gateway from the <!--del_lnk--> Norfolk Broads to the sea. For hundreds of years it has been a fishing port dependent on the herring fishery, and today it services the offshore <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">oil</a> rigs. The town has a popular beach and two promenades popular with locals and tourists.<p>The town itself is actually located on a thin spit of land sandwiched between the North Sea and River Yare. It is home to the historic rows and the main tourist sector on the seafront. The area is linked to <!--del_lnk--> Gorleston, <!--del_lnk--> Cobholm and Southtown by Haven Bridge and to the <!--del_lnk--> A47 and <!--del_lnk--> A12 by the Breydon Bridge.<p>The unparished urban area that makes up the town of Great Yarmouth has an area of <!--del_lnk--> 26.54 km&sup2; and according to the <!--del_lnk--> Office for National Statistics 2002 had a population of 47,288. It is the main town in the larger <!--del_lnk--> Borough of Great Yarmouth. The ONS identify a Great Yarmouth Urban Area, which has a population of 66,788, including the sub-areas of <!--del_lnk--> Caister-on-Sea (8,756) and Great Yarmouth (58,032). The wider borough of Great Yarmouth has a population of around 92,500.<p>Great Yarmouth is the fifth most deprived area in the country, in terms of social, economic, education, and safety.<p>

      <p>Yarmouth (Gernemwa, Yernemuth) lies near the site of the Roman camp of Gariannonum at the mouth of the river Yare, the convenience of its situation having attracted many fishermen from the <!--del_lnk--> Cinque Ports, a permanent settlement was made, and the town numbered 70 burgesses before the <!--del_lnk--> Norman Conquest. <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_I_of_England.htm" title="Henry I of England">Henry I</a> placed it under the rule of a reeve. The charter of <a href="../../wp/j/John_of_England.htm" title="John of England">King John</a> (<!--del_lnk--> 1208), which gave his burgesses of Yarmouth general liberties according to the customs of <a href="../../wp/o/Oxford.htm" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>, a gild merchant and weekly hustings, was amplified by several later charters asserting the rights of the borough against <!--del_lnk--> Little Yarmouth and <!--del_lnk--> Gorleston. In <!--del_lnk--> 1552 <a href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_I_of_England.htm" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth</a> granted a charter of admiralty jurisdiction, afterwards confirmed and extended by <!--del_lnk--> James I. In <!--del_lnk--> 1668 <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_II_of_England.htm" title="Charles II of England">Charles II</a> incorporated Little Yarmouth in the borough by a charter which with one brief exception remained in force until <!--del_lnk--> 1703, when <a href="../../wp/a/Anne_of_Great_Britain.htm" title="Anne of Great Britain">Anne</a> replaced the two bailiffs by a mayor.<p>A grammar school was founded in <!--del_lnk--> 1551, when the great hall of the old hospital, founded in the reign of <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_I_of_England.htm" title="Edward I of England">Edward I</a> by <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Fastolfe, was appropriated to its use. It was closed from <!--del_lnk--> 1757 to <!--del_lnk--> 1860, was re-established by the charity trustees, and settled in new buildings in <!--del_lnk--> 1872.<p>From 1808 to 1814 the Admiralty in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> could communicate with its naval ships in the port of Great Yarmouth by means of a <!--del_lnk--> shutter telegraph chain.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The town was the site of a drowning tragedy on May 2, 1845 when a suspension bridge crowded with children collapsed under the weight killing 79 people. They had gathered to watch a clown in a barrel being pulled by geese down the river. As he passed under the bridge the weight shifted, causing the chains on the south side to snap, tipping over the bridge deck.<!--del_lnk-->  The town suffered from bombing during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, but much is left of the old town, including the original over 2000 metre long protective mediaeval wall, of which about two-thirds has survived. Of the 18 towers, 11 are left. On the South Quay, there is a 17th century Merchant&#39;s House, as well as <!--del_lnk--> Tudor, <!--del_lnk--> Georgian and <!--del_lnk--> Victorian buildings. Behind South Quay, there is a maze of alleys and lanes known as &quot;The Rows&quot;. Originally there were 145 rows. Despite war damage, several have remained.<p>The northern section of the two-mile &pound;19m <!--del_lnk--> A47 Great Yarmouth Western Bypass opened in March 1986, and the southern section opened in May 1985. It is now the <!--del_lnk--> A12.<p><a id="Sights" name="Sights"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sights</span></h2>

      <p>The Tolhouse, complete with <!--del_lnk--> dungeons, dates from the late 13th century and is said to be the oldest civic building in <!--del_lnk--> Britain. It backs onto the town&#39;s central library which was recently rennovated.<p>The <a href="../../wp/m/Market.htm" title="Market">Market</a> place is one of the largest in England, and has been operating since the <a href="../../wp/1/13th_century.htm" title="13th century">13th century</a>. It is also home to the town&#39;s shopping sector and the famous Yarmouth chip stalls. The smaller area south of the market has a big screen which is used for showing GYTV and access to the town&#39;s shopping centre, Market Gates.<p><!--del_lnk--> Great Yarmouth railway station, which serves the town, is the terminus of the <!--del_lnk--> Wherry Lines from <a href="../../wp/n/Norwich.htm" title="Norwich">Norwich</a>. Before the <a href="../../wp/b/Beeching_Axe.htm" title="Beeching Axe">Beeching Axe</a> the town had a number of stations and a direct link to <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> down the east coast. The only remaining signs of these stations is the coach park where Beach Station once was and the <!--del_lnk--> A12 relief road which follows the route of the railway down into the embankment from Breydon Bridge.<p>Yarmouth has two <!--del_lnk--> piers, <!--del_lnk--> Britannia Pier and Wellington Pier. The latter of the two was demolished in 2005 and is currently being rebuilt as a family entertainment centre. Britannia Pier is home to the Britannia Theatre and a fair at the end of the pier.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The Grade 1 listed Winter Gardens building sits next to the Wellington Pier. The cast iron framed glass structure was shipped by barge from <!--del_lnk--> Torquay in 1903. It is said this was done without the loss of a single pane of glass. Over the years, it has been used as <!--del_lnk--> ballroom, <!--del_lnk--> roller skating rink and <!--del_lnk--> beer garden. In the 1990s it was converted into a <!--del_lnk--> nightclub by comedian <!--del_lnk--> Jim Davidson. Today, Winter Gardens is under use as a family leisure venue, although its future is under threat due to repair costs off the aging framework. During the winter of 2005 there were worries of the collapse of the building and during high winds it was often closed.<p>There a monument to <!--del_lnk--> Horatio Nelson, erected in <!--del_lnk--> 1819, 24 years before the completion of <!--del_lnk--> Nelson&#39;s Column in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, and now surrounded by factories. The monument, that of Britannia seated with shield and trident, faces away from the sea leading to the popular assumption of a mistake during construction. However it was actually built to face Nelson&#39;s Norfolk birthplace at <!--del_lnk--> Burnham Thorpe. The monument, known as the <!--del_lnk--> Britannia Monument is similar in form but about 2/3 the size of its <a href="../../wp/t/Trafalgar_Square.htm" title="Trafalgar Square">Trafalgar Square</a> counterpart, was originally planned to mark Nelson&#39;s victory at the <a href="../../wp/n/Nile.htm" title="Nile">Nile</a>, but fundraising was not completed until after his death and it was instead dedicated to the &quot;Lord Admiral&quot;.<p><a href="../../wp/c/Charles_Dickens.htm" title="Charles Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> used Yarmouth as a key location in his novel <i><a href="../../wp/d/David_Copperfield_%2528novel%2529.htm" title="David Copperfield (novel)">David Copperfield</a></i>. <!--del_lnk--> Anna Sewell (1820-1878), the author of <i><!--del_lnk--> Black Beauty</i>, was born in a 17th-century house in Church Plain. The house is currently up for sale.<p>The Time and Tide museum on Blackfriars Road which is managed by Norfolk Museums Service was nominated in the UK Museums Awards in 2005. It was built as part of the regeneration of the south of the town in 2003. Its location in an old herring smokery harks back to the towns status as a major fishing port. Sections of the historic <!--del_lnk--> town wall are located outside the museum.<p><a id="Church_of_St_Nicholas" name="Church_of_St_Nicholas"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Church of St Nicholas</span></h2>
      <p>The church of St. Nicholas, often said to be the largest parish church in England, was founded in by <!--del_lnk--> Herbert Losinga, the first bishop of <a href="../../wp/n/Norwich.htm" title="Norwich">Norwich</a>, and consecrated in <!--del_lnk--> 1119. It is cruciform, with a central tower, which perhaps preserves a part of the original structure, but by successive alterations the form of the church has been completely changed. The Transitional clerestoried <!--del_lnk--> nave, with columns alternately octagonal and circular, was rebuilt in the reign of <a href="../../wp/j/John_of_England.htm" title="John of England">King John</a>. A portion of the chancel is of the same date. About fifty years later the aisles were widened, so that the nave is now the narrowest part of the building.<p>A grand west front with towers and pinnacles was constructed in <!--del_lnk--> 1330-<!--del_lnk--> 1338, but the building was interrupted by a visitation of the plague. In the 16th century the ornamental <!--del_lnk--> brasses were cast into weights and the <!--del_lnk--> gravestones cut into grindstones. Within the church there were at one time 18 chapels, maintained by guilds or private families, but these were demolished by the <!--del_lnk--> Reformers, who sold the valuable utensils of the building and applied the money to the widening of the channel of the harbour.<p>During the <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth the Independents appropriated the chancel, the Presbyterians the north aisle, and the Churchmen were allowed the remainder of the building. The brick walls erected at this time to separate the different portions of the building remained till <!--del_lnk--> 1847. In <!--del_lnk--> 1864 the tower was restored, and the east end of the chancel rebuilt; in <!--del_lnk--> 1869-<!--del_lnk--> 1870 the south aisle was rebuilt; and in <!--del_lnk--> 1884 the south transept, the west end of the nave and the north aisle underwent restoration. The width of the nave is 26 ft, and the total length of the church is 236 ft.<p>St. Nicholas was bombed and nearly destroyed by fire during World War II. It has been rebuilt.<p><a id="Sports_and_leisure" name="Sports_and_leisure"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sports and leisure</span></h2>
