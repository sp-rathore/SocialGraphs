      <p>The word <b>gender</b> describes the idea that many animal species are divided into what are known as sexes, i.e. <!--del_lnk--> male and <!--del_lnk--> female, or neither. Some languages have a system of <!--del_lnk--> grammatical gender; while nouns may be classified as &quot;masculine&quot; or &quot;feminine&quot; in such languages, this is essentially a <!--del_lnk--> convention with little or no connection to their meaning. Likewise, a wide variety of phenomena have gendered characteristics ascribed to them, by analogy to male and female bodies (such as with the <!--del_lnk--> gender of connectors and fasteners) or due to <!--del_lnk--> social norms. In social sciences, the word &quot;gender&quot; is sometimes used in contrast to biological <!--del_lnk--> sex, to emphasize a social, cultural, or psychological dimension. The discipline of <!--del_lnk--> gender studies investigates and elaborates on the nature of sex and gender.<p>

      <p><i>Gender</i> comes from <!--del_lnk--> Middle English <i>gendre</i>, from <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>genus</i>, all meaning &quot;kind&quot;, &quot;sort&quot;, or &quot;type&quot;. Ultimately from the <!--del_lnk--> Proto-Indo-European root <i>gen</i>, which is also the root for &quot;kind&quot;, &quot;king&quot; and many others. It appears in Modern <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a> in the word <i>genre</i> (type, kind) and is related to the <!--del_lnk--> Greek root <i>gen-</i> (to produce), appearing in <i><!--del_lnk--> gene</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> genesis</i> and <i><a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a></i>. As a verb, it is used for <i>to breed</i> in the <!--del_lnk--> King James <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">Bible</a>:<dl>
       <dd><i>Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind.</i> &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> Leviticus, 19:19</dl>
      <p>According to <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, the Greek philosopher <!--del_lnk--> Protagoras used the terms <i>masculine</i>, <i>feminine</i>, and <i>neuter</i> to classify nouns, introducing the concept of <!--del_lnk--> grammatical gender. At least since the <a href="../../wp/1/14th_century.htm" title="14th century">14th century</a>, the word is also used to indicate male or female qualities:<dl>
       <dd><i>The Psyche, or soul, of Tiresias is of the masculine gender</i> &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Browne, <!--del_lnk--> Hydriotaphia<dd><i>I may add the gender too of the person I am to govern</i> &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> Laurence Sterne, <!--del_lnk--> A Sentimental Journey<dd><i>Black divinities of the feminine gender</i> &mdash; <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_Dickens.htm" title="Charles Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>, <!--del_lnk--> A Tale of Two Cities<dd><i>Our most lively impression is that the sun is there assumed to be of the feminine gender</i> &mdash; <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_James.htm" title="Henry James">Henry James</a>, Essays on Literature</dl>
      <p>By 1900, this usage was considered jocular by some, perhaps like the modern expression &quot;of the female persuasion&quot;. In 1926, <!--del_lnk--> Fowler&#39;s Modern English Usage suggested that &ldquo;gender...is a grammatical term only. To talk of persons...of the masculine or feminine g[ender], meaning of the male or female sex, is either a jocularity (permissible or not according to context) or a blunder.&rdquo;<p>In some parts of the social sciences, following a usage shift that began in the <!--del_lnk--> 1950s and was well established by the <!--del_lnk--> 1980s, <i>gender</i> has been used increasingly to refer to social rather than biological categories, for which the word <i>sex</i> is used:<dl>
       <dd><i>&ldquo;Today a return to separate single-sex schools may hasten the revival of separate gender roles&rdquo;</i> &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> Wendy Kaminer, in <!--del_lnk--> The Atlantic Monthly (1998)</dl>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> American Heritage Dictionary uses the following two sentences to illustrate the difference: <i>&ldquo;The effectiveness of the medication appears to depend on the sex</i> (not gender) <i>of the patient.&rdquo;</i> But: <i>&ldquo;In peasant societies, gender</i> (not sex) <i>roles are likely to be more clearly defined.&quot;</i><p>In the last half of the 20th century, the use of <i>gender</i> in academia has increased greatly, and it now outnumbers the word <i>sex</i> in the humanities, social sciences, and arts. However, in many instances, the term <i>gender</i> acts as a <!--del_lnk--> euphemism for <i>sex</i>, and the distinction between <i>sex</i> and <i>gender</i> is only fitfully observed.<p><a id="Grammatical_gender" name="Grammatical_gender"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Grammatical gender</span></h2>

      <p>In linguistics, the term &quot;grammatical gender&quot; refers to various forms of expressing biological or sociological gender, or sometimes other natural characteristics such as <!--del_lnk--> animacy, by <!--del_lnk--> inflecting words. For example, in the words <i>actor</i> and <i>actress</i> the suffix <i>-or</i> denotes &quot;male person&quot; (masculine), and the suffix <i>-ress</i> denotes &quot;female person&quot; (feminine). This type of inflection is very rare in modern <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a>, but quite common in other languages, including most languages in the <!--del_lnk--> Indo-European family. Normally, English does not mark nouns or other words for gender, although it does express gender in the third person singular personal pronouns <i>he</i> (male person), <i>she</i> (female person), and <i>it</i> (object, abstraction, or animal), and their other inflected forms.<p>A language where grammatical gender is quite active is <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a>, where, for example, in the sentences <i>Il est un grand acteur</i> &quot;He is a great actor&quot; and <i>Elle est une grande actrice</i> &quot;She is a great actress&quot;, not only do the nouns (<i>acteur</i>, <i>actrice</i>) and the pronouns (<i>il</i>, <i>elle</i>) denote the gender of their <!--del_lnk--> referent, but so do the articles (<i>un</i>, <i>une</i>; &quot;a&quot;) and the adjectives (<i>grand</i>, <i>grande</i>; &quot;great&quot;). Modern English does not exhibit such generalized forms of gender <!--del_lnk--> agreement, although <!--del_lnk--> Old English did.<p>Grammatical gender may be partly assigned by <!--del_lnk--> convention, so it doesn&#39;t always coincide with natural gender. Furthermore, the gender assigned to animals, inanimate objects and abstractions is often arbitrary. Thus, in <!--del_lnk--> Latin and <!--del_lnk--> Romance languages the word <i>Sol</i> (Sun) is masculine and the word <i>Luna</i> (Moon) is feminine, but, in <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Germanic languages in general, the opposite occurs.<p><a id="Sex" name="Sex"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sex</span></h2>

      <p>Gender can refer to the (biological) condition of being male or female, or less commonly <!--del_lnk--> hermaphrodite or <!--del_lnk--> neuter, as applied to humans, animals, and plants. In this sense, the term is a synonym for <i>sex</i>, a word that has undergone a usage shift itself, having become a synonym for <i>sexual intercourse</i>. In a study of scientists&#39; usage of &quot;gender&quot; and &quot;sex&quot;, Haig wrote:<dl>
       <dd><i>Among the reasons that working scientists have given me for choosing gender rather than sex in biological contexts are desires to signal sympathy with feminist goals, to use a more academic term, or to avoid the connotation of copulation.</i></dl>

      <p>Since the <!--del_lnk--> 1950s, the term <i>gender</i> has been increasingly used to distinguish a social role (<!--del_lnk--> gender role) and/or personal identity (<!--del_lnk--> gender identity) distinct from biological sex. Sexologist <!--del_lnk--> John Money wrote in 1955, &ldquo;[t]he term <i>gender role</i> is used to signify all those things that a person says or does to disclose himself or herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman, respectively. It includes, but is not restricted to, sexuality in the sense of eroticism.&rdquo; Elements of such a role include clothing, speech patterns, movement and other factors not solely limited to <!--del_lnk--> biological sex.<p>Many societies categorize all individuals as either <!--del_lnk--> male or <!--del_lnk--> female &mdash; however, this is not universal. Some societies recognise a <!--del_lnk--> third gender &mdash; for instance, Native American <!--del_lnk--> Two-Spirit people, and <!--del_lnk--> hijras of India and Pakistan &mdash; or even a fourth or fifth. Such categories may be an intermediate state between male and female, a state of sexlessness, or a distinct gender not dependent on male and female gender roles. <!--del_lnk--> Joan Roughgarden argues that in some non-human animal species, there can also be said to be more than two genders, in that there might be multiple templates for behaviour available to individual organisms with a given biological sex.<p>There is debate over to what extent gender is a <!--del_lnk--> social construct and to what extent it is a biological construct. One point of view in the debate is <!--del_lnk--> social constructionism, which suggests that gender is entirely a social construct. Contrary to social constructionism is <!--del_lnk--> essentialism which suggests that it is entirely a biological construct. Others&#39; opinions on the subject lie somewhere in between.<p>Some gender associations are changing as society changes, yet much controversy exists over the extent to which <!--del_lnk--> gender roles are simply <!--del_lnk--> stereotypes, arbitrary <!--del_lnk--> social constructions, or natural innate differences.<p><a id="Legal_status" name="Legal_status"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Legal status</span></h3>
      <p>A person&#39;s gender as female or male has legal significance -- gender is indicated on government documents, and laws provide differently for women and men. Some examples of how gender is legally relevant: many pension systems have different retirement ages for men or women; in many jurisdictions, certain sexual offences can only be committed by men (e.g. rape); and usually marriage is only available to different-gender couples, whereas a civil partnership is often only available for same-gender couples.<p>The question then arises as to what legally determines whether someone is male or female. In most cases this can appear obvious, but the matter is complicated for <!--del_lnk--> intersexual or <!--del_lnk--> transgender people. Different jurisdictions have adopted different answers to this question. Almost all countries permit changes of legal gender status in cases of intersexualism, when the gender assignment made at birth is determined upon further investigation to be biologically inaccurate -- technically, however, this is not a change of status per se, rather it is a recognition of a status which was deemed to exist unknown from birth. Increasingly, jurisdictions also provide a procedure for changes of legal gender for transgender people.<p><!--del_lnk--> Gender assignment, when there are any indications that genital sex might not be decisive in a particular case, is normally not defined by any single definition, but by a combination of conditions, including chromosomes and gonads. Thus, for example, in many jurisdictions a person with XY chromosomes but female gonads could be recognised as female at birth.<p>The ability to <!--del_lnk--> change legal gender for transgender people in particular has given rise to the phenomena in some jurisdictions of the same person having different genders for the purposes of different areas of the law. For example, in Australia prior to the Re Kevin decisions, a transsexual person could be recognised as the gender they identified with under many areas of the law, e.g. social security law, but not for the law of marriage. Thus, for a period it was possible for the same person to have two different genders under Australian law.<p>It is also possible in federal systems for the same person to have one gender under state law and a different gender under federal law (e.g. suppose the state recognises gender transitions, but the federal government does not).<p><a id="In_feminist_theory" name="In_feminist_theory"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">In feminist theory</span></h3>
      <p>During the 1970s there was no consensus about how the terms were to be applied. In the 1974 edition of <i><!--del_lnk--> Masculine/Feminine or Human</i>, the author uses &ldquo;<!--del_lnk--> innate gender&rdquo; and &ldquo;learned <!--del_lnk--> sex roles&rdquo;, but in the 1978 edition, the use of <i>sex</i> and <i>gender</i> is reversed. By <!--del_lnk--> 1980, most <!--del_lnk--> feminist writings had agreed on using <i>gender</i> only for socioculturally adapted <!--del_lnk--> traits.<p><a id="Other_languages" name="Other_languages"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other languages</span></h3>
      <p>In English, both <i>sex</i> and <i>gender</i> are used in contexts where they could not be substituted (sexual intercourse; anal sex; safe sex; sex worker; sex slave). Other languages, like German, use the same word <i>Geschlecht</i> to refer both to grammatical gender and to biological sex, making the distinction between <i>sex</i> and <i>gender</i> advocated by some anthropologists difficult. In some contexts, German has adopted the English loan-word <i>gender</i> to achieve this distinction. Sometimes &#39;Geschlechtsidentitaet&#39; is used as gender (although it literally means <i>gender identity</i>) and &#39;Geschlecht&#39; as sex (translation of Judith Butler&#39;s <i>Gender Trouble</i>). More common is the use of modifiers: <i>biologisches Geschlecht</i> for <i>sex</i>, <i>Geschlechtsidentit&auml;t</i> for <i>gender identity</i> and <i>Geschlechtsrolle</i> for <i>gender role</i> etc. In Swedish, &quot;gender&quot; is translated with the linguistic parallel &quot;genus&quot; also in sociological contexts, thus: Genusstudier (gender studies), genusvetenskap (gender science). &quot;Sex&quot; however, only signifies sexual relations, and not the typical Western dichotomy, a concept for which &quot;k&ouml;n&quot; is used. A common distinction is then made between &quot;k&ouml;n&quot; (sex) and &quot;genus&quot; (gender), where &quot;k&ouml;n&quot; only carries the supposedly biological connotations. In earlier literature, and occasionally in non-academic contexts, the word &quot;k&ouml;nsroll&quot; (lit. &quot;sex role&quot;, but contextually translated as &quot;gender role&quot;) can be seen.<p>In <a href="../../wp/p/Portuguese_language.htm" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a> the <!--del_lnk--> cognate of &quot;sex&quot; is commonly used for what English calls &quot;gender&quot;, even though the same word can also mean &quot;sexual relation&quot;, or &quot;genital organ&quot;. Nevertheless, the cognate of &quot;gender&quot; (also used in the sense of &quot;gender&quot;, though less frequently), has begun to be used by academics in the context of <!--del_lnk--> gender studies.<p><a id="Other_uses" name="Other_uses"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Other uses</span></h2>

German uses the word <i>Tongeschlecht</i> (&quot;Tone gender&quot;) for tonality, and the words <i>Dur</i> (from latin <i>durus</i>, hard) for <i>major</i> and <i>moll</i> (from latin <i>mollis</i>, soft) for <i>minor</i>.<dl>

In <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, God is described in masculine terms; however, the Church has historically been described in feminine terms. Of one of the several forms of the Hindu God, Shiva, is Ardhanarishwar (literally half-female God). Here Shiva manifests himself so that the left half is Female and the right half is Male. The left represents Shakti (energy, power) in the form of Goddess Parvati (otherwise his consort) and the right half Shiva. Whereas Parvati is the cause of arousal of Kama (desires), Shiva is the killer. Shiva is pervaded by the power of Parvati and Parvati is pervaded by the power of Shiva. While the stone images may seem to represent a half-male and half-female God, the true symbolic representation is of a being the whole of which is Shiva and the whole of which is Shakti at the same time. It is a 3-D representation of only shakti from one angle and only Shiva from the other. Shiva and Shakti are hence the same being representing a collective of Jnana (knowledge) and Kriya (activity). Adi Shankaracharya, the founder of non-dualistic philosophy (Advaita &ndash; &lsquo;not two&rsquo;) in Hindu thought says in his &lsquo;Saundaryalaairi&rsquo; &ndash;&ldquo; <i>Shivah Shaktayaa yukto yadi bhavati shaktah prabhavitum na che devum devona khalu kushalah spanditam api</i>&rdquo; i.e. It is only when Shiva is united with Shakti that He acquires the capability of becoming the Lord of the Universe. In the absence of Shakti, He is not even able to stir. In fact, the term &lsquo;Shiva&rsquo; originated from &lsquo;Shva&rsquo;, which implies a dead body. It is only through his inherent shakti that Shiva realizes his true nature. This mythology projects the inherent view in ancient Hinduism, that each human carries within himself both male and female components, which are forces rather than sexes, and it is the harmony between the creative and the annihilative, the strong and the soft, the proactive and the passive, that makes a true person. Such thought, leave alone entail gender equality, in fact obliterates any material distinction between the male and female altogether. This may explain why in ancient India we find evidence of homosexuality, bisexuality, androgyny, multiple sex partners and open representation of sexual pleasures in artworks like the Khajuraho temples, being accepted within prevalent social frameworks. <p><a id="Importance_of_gender" name="Importance_of_gender"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Importance of gender</span></h2>

      <p>Gender, and particularly the role of <!--del_lnk--> women is widely recognized as vitally important to <!--del_lnk--> international development issues. This often means a focus on gender-equality, ensuring <!--del_lnk--> participation, but includes an understanding of the different roles and expectation of the genders within the community.<p>As well as directly addressing inequality, attention to gender issues is regarded as important to the success of development programs, for all participants. For example, in <!--del_lnk--> microfinance it is common to target women, as besides the fact that women tend to be over-represented in the poorest segments of the population, they are also regarded as more reliable at repaying the loans. Also, it is claimed that women are more likely to use the money for the benefit of their families.<p>Development consultant <!--del_lnk--> Kamal Kar has described the particular difficulties of women in poor Bangladeshi villages where <!--del_lnk--> open defecation is practised; women are expected to not practise open defecation during daylight hours and suffer discomfort and health problems as a result.<p>Some organizations working in developing countries and in the development field have incorporated advocacy and empowerment for women into their work.
