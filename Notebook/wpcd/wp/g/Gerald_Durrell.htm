      <p><b>Gerald (&#39;Gerry&#39;) Malcolm Durrell OBE</b> (<!--del_lnk--> January 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1925 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> January 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1995) was a <!--del_lnk--> naturalist, <!--del_lnk--> zookeeper, <!--del_lnk--> conservationist, <!--del_lnk--> author, and <!--del_lnk--> television presenter. He founded what is now called the <!--del_lnk--> Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and the <!--del_lnk--> Jersey Zoo (now renamed <!--del_lnk--> Durrell Wildlife) on the <a href="../../wp/c/Channel_Islands.htm" title="Channel Islands">Channel Island</a> of <a href="../../wp/j/Jersey.htm" title="Jersey">Jersey</a> in 1958, but is perhaps best known for writing a number of books based on his life as an animal collector and enthusiast. He was the brother of the novelist <!--del_lnk--> Lawrence Durrell.<p>

      <p><a id="Early_life_in_India_and_England" name="Early_life_in_India_and_England"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early life in India and England</span></h3>
      <p>Durrell was born in <!--del_lnk--> Jamshedpur, then Bihar Province, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> on <!--del_lnk--> January 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1925. His parents had themselves been born in India but were of English and Irish descent. He was the fourth surviving and final child of <!--del_lnk--> Louisa Florence Durrell (n&eacute;e Dixie) and <!--del_lnk--> Lawrence Samuel Durrell. Durrell&#39;s father was a <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> engineer, and as befitting family status, the infant Durrell spent most of his time in the company of the ayah or nursemaid. Durrell reportedly recalls his first visit to a zoo in <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, and attributes his life-long love of animals to that encounter. The family moved to <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> after the death of his father in <!--del_lnk--> 1928. Back in England, the Durrells settled in the <!--del_lnk--> Upper Norwood - <!--del_lnk--> Cystal Palace area of South London. Durrell was enrolled in Wickwood School, but usually stayed at home feigning illness. <p><a id="The_Corfu_years" name="The_Corfu_years"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Corfu years</span></h3>
      <p>The family moved to the <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greek</a> island of <!--del_lnk--> Corfu in 1935, where Durrell began to collect and keep the local <!--del_lnk--> fauna as <!--del_lnk--> pets. The family stayed until 1939. This interval was later the basis of the book <i><!--del_lnk--> My Family and Other Animals</i> and its successors, <i>Birds, Beasts, and Relatives</i>, <i>The Garden of the Gods</i> and a few short stories. Durrell was home-schooled during this time by various family friends and private tutors, mostly friends of his eldest brother <!--del_lnk--> Lawrence (later to be a famous novelist). One of them, the Greek doctor, scientist, poet and philosopher <!--del_lnk--> Theodore Stephanides would be Durrell&#39;s friend and mentor, and his ideas would leave a lasting impression on the young Durrell. Together, they would examine and Durrell would house Corfu fauna in everything from test tubes to bathtubs. The other big influence on Durrell during these formative years, according to Durrell, was the writing of French naturalist <!--del_lnk--> Jean Henri Fabre.<p><a id="The_London_years_and_Whipsnade_Zoo" name="The_London_years_and_Whipsnade_Zoo"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The London years and Whipsnade Zoo</span></h3>
      <p>The family moved back to <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> in 1939 at the outbreak of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> . Difficult as it was in the war and post-war years to find a job, especially for a home-schooled youth, the enterprising Durrell worked as a help at an aquarium and pet store. Some reminiscences of this period can be found in <i>Fillets of Plaice</i>. His call-up for the war came in 1943, but he was exempted from military duty on medical grounds, and asked to serve the war effort by working in a farm. After the war, Durrell joined <!--del_lnk--> Whipsnade Zoo as a junior or student keeper in 1945. This move fulfilled a lifelong dream: Durrell claims that his first spoken word was &quot;zoo&quot;. <i>Beasts in My Belfry</i> recalls events of this period.<p><a id="The_early_animal_expeditions" name="The_early_animal_expeditions"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The early animal expeditions</span></h3>
      <p>Durrell left Whipsnade Zoo in May, 1946 in order to join wildlife collecting expeditions of the time, but was denied a place in the voyages due to his lack of experience. Durrell&#39;s wildlife expeditions began with a 1947 trip to the <!--del_lnk--> British Cameroons (now <a href="../../wp/c/Cameroon.htm" title="Cameroon">Cameroon</a>) with <!--del_lnk--> ornithologist <!--del_lnk--> John Yealland, financed by a &pound;3,000 <!--del_lnk--> inheritance from his father on the account of turning 21. The animals he brought back were sold to <a href="../../wp/l/London_Zoo.htm" title="London Zoo">London Zoo</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Chester Zoo, <!--del_lnk--> Paignton Zoo, <!--del_lnk--> Bristol Zoo and <!--del_lnk--> Belle Vue Zoo (<a href="../../wp/m/Manchester.htm" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>). He continued for many decades, during which time he became famous for his work for wildlife <!--del_lnk--> conservation.<p>He followed this successful expedition up with two further ones with fellow Whipsnade zookeeper Ken Smith: a repeat trip to the British Cameroon, and to <!--del_lnk--> British Guiana (now <a href="../../wp/g/Guyana.htm" title="Guyana">Guyana</a>) in 1949 and 1950 respectively. On the first of these trips, he met and befriended the enigmatic <!--del_lnk--> Fon of Bafut <!--del_lnk--> Achirimbi II, the autocratic <!--del_lnk--> West African chieftain, who would help him organize future missions.<p>Because of his dedication towards animals, Durrell housed and fed his animals with the best choices possible, never over-collected specimens, and did not collect animals with only &quot;show value&quot; which would fetch high prices. Such practices differed from other animal collecting expeditions of the time, and, as a result, Durrell was broke by the end of his third expedition. Further, due to a falling-out with <!--del_lnk--> George Cansdale, superintendent of the <a href="../../wp/l/London_Zoo.htm" title="London Zoo">London Zoo</a>, Durrell was blackballed by the British zoo community and could not secure a job in most zoos, ultimately securing a job at the aquarium at Belle Vue Zoo in Manchester for some time.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> February 26, <!--del_lnk--> 1951, after an extended courtship, Durrell married Manchester resident <!--del_lnk--> Jacqueline (&#39;Jacquie&#39;) Sonia Wolfenden &mdash; they eloped after opposition from her father. Wolfenden would go on to accompany Durrell on most of his following animal expeditions, would help found and manage the <!--del_lnk--> Jersey Zoo, and would write two humorous, bestselling memoirs on the lines of Durrell to raise money for conservation efforts. Durrell&#39;s work pressure, mood swings and drinking problem would ultimately lead to their divorce in 1979.<p>Based on encouragement from wife Jacquie, and advice from his elder brother Lawrence, Gerald Durrell started writing autobiographical accounts to raise money. His first book &mdash; <i>The Overloaded Ark</i> &mdash; was a huge success, causing Durrell to follow up with other such accounts. While Durrell only made &pound;50 for British rights (<!--del_lnk--> Faber and Faber), he obtained &pound;500 from the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. rights (<!--del_lnk--> Viking Press) for the book, and managed to raise money for a fourth expedition to <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1954. This, however, ran into a political <!--del_lnk--> coup d&#39;etat in <a href="../../wp/p/Paraguay.htm" title="Paraguay">Paraguay</a> and was unsuccessful.<p><a id="Foundations_for_the_Jersey_Zoo" name="Foundations_for_the_Jersey_Zoo"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Foundations for the Jersey Zoo</span></h3>
      <p>The publication of <i><!--del_lnk--> My Family and Other Animals</i> in 1956 caused Durrell to be well known as an author, and consequently as a naturalist for the first time. Royalties from the book, which made bestseller lists in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, helped fund Durrell&#39;s next expedition.<p>Durrell&#39;s growing disillusionment with how zoos of the time were run, and his belief that zoos should primarily act as reserve banks of endangered species, caused him to contemplate founding his own zoo. His 1957 trip to <a href="../../wp/c/Cameroon.htm" title="Cameroon">Cameroon</a> for the third and last time was primarily to collect animals which would act as the core collection of his own zoo. This expedition was filmed as well, in Durrell&#39;s first experiment with filming his work with animals. The success of the film <i>To Bafut with Beagles</i>, together with a successful radio show documenting his memories <i>Encounters with Animals</i>, made Durrell a regular on the <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a> Natural History unit for decades to come, as well as provide much needed funds for his conservation projects.<p>On return from <!--del_lnk--> Bafut, Durrell put up with his sister <!--del_lnk--> Margaret at her boarding house in the seaside resort of <!--del_lnk--> Bournemouth. The animals were housed in her gardens and garage on a temporary basis, while Durrell looked at prospective sites for a zoo. To his dismay, both <!--del_lnk--> Bournemouth and <!--del_lnk--> Poole municipalities turned down his ideas for a zoo.<p><a id="The_Zoo_and_the_Trust" name="The_Zoo_and_the_Trust"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Zoo and the Trust</span></h3>

      <p>Durrell founded the <a href="../../wp/j/Jersey_Zoological_Park.htm" title="Jersey Zoological Park">Jersey Zoological Park</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1958 to house his growing collection of animals. The site for the zoo, a 16th-century manor house, <!--del_lnk--> Les Augres Manor, came to Durrell&#39;s notice by chance after a long and unsuccessful search for a suitable site. Durrell leased the manor and set up his zoo on the redesigned manor grounds. Durrell undertook another, more successful expedition to <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a> to collect endangered species for his zoo in 1958. The zoo was opened to the public in 1959 on <!--del_lnk--> Easter Sunday.<p>As the zoo grew in size, so did the number of projects undertaken to save threatened wildlife in other parts of the world. Durrell was instrumental in founding the <!--del_lnk--> Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust, on <!--del_lnk--> July 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1963 to cope with the increasingly difficult challenges of zoo, wildlife and habitat management.<p>The Trust opened an international wing, the <!--del_lnk--> Wildlife Preservation Trust International, in USA in <!--del_lnk--> 1971, to aid international conservation efforts in a better fashion. That year, the Trust bought out Les Augres Manor from its owner, Major Hugh Fraser, giving the zoo a permanent home.<p>Durrell&#39;s initiative caused the <!--del_lnk--> Fauna and Flora Preservation Society to start the <!--del_lnk--> World Conference on Breeding Endangered Species in Captivity as an Aid to their Survival in 1972 at <a href="../../wp/j/Jersey.htm" title="Jersey">Jersey</a>, today one of the most prestigious conferences in the field. 1972 also saw <!--del_lnk--> Princess Anne becoming a <!--del_lnk--> patron of the Trust, an action which brought the Trust into media limelight, and helped raise funds.<p>The 1970s saw Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust become a leading zoo in the field of captive breeding, championing the cause among species like the Lowland <a href="../../wp/g/Gorilla.htm" title="Gorilla">Gorilla</a>, and various <a href="../../wp/m/Mauritius.htm" title="Mauritius">Mauritian</a> fauna. Durrell visited Mauritius several times and co-ordinated large scale conservation efforts in Mauritius, involving captive breeding programs for native birds and reptiles, ecological recovery of <!--del_lnk--> Round Island, training local staff, and setting up local in-situ and ex-situ conservation facilities. This ultimately led to the founding of the <!--del_lnk--> Mauritian Wildlife Foundation in 1984.<p>Jacquie Durrell separated from and then divorced Gerald Durrell in 1979, citing his increasing work pressure and associated drinking problem.<p>Durrell met his second wife <!--del_lnk--> Lee McGeorge Durrell in 1977 when he lectured at <!--del_lnk--> Duke University, where she was studying for a PhD in animal communication. They married in 1979. She co-authored a number of books with him, including <i>The Amateur Naturalist</i>, and became the Honorary Director of the Trust after his death.<p>In 1978 Durrell started the training centre for conservationists at the zoo, or the &quot;mini-university&quot; in his words. As of <!--del_lnk--> 2005, over a thousand biologists, naturalists, zoo veterinarians, and zoo architects from 104 countries have attended the International Training Centre. Durrell was also instrumental in forming the <i>Captive Breeding Specialist Group</i> of the <!--del_lnk--> World Conservation Union in <!--del_lnk--> 1982.<p>Durrell founded <i>Wildlife Preservation Trust Canada</i>, now <!--del_lnk--> Wildlife Preservation Canada, in 1985. The official appeal <i>Saving Animals from Extinction</i> was launched in 1991, at a time when British zoos were not faring well and <a href="../../wp/l/London_Zoo.htm" title="London Zoo">London Zoo</a> was in danger of closing down.<p>In 1989, Gerald Durrell and his wife Lee, along with <a href="../../wp/d/David_Attenborough.htm" title="David Attenborough">David Attenborough</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Cricket.htm" title="Cricket">cricket</a> star <!--del_lnk--> David Gower helped launch the <!--del_lnk--> World Land Trust (then the World Wide Land Conservation Trust). The initial goal of the trust was to purchase rain forest land in <a href="../../wp/b/Belize.htm" title="Belize">Belize</a> as part of the <!--del_lnk--> Programme for Belize.<p>1990 saw the Trust establish a conservation program in <a href="../../wp/m/Madagascar.htm" title="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> along the lines of the <a href="../../wp/m/Mauritius.htm" title="Mauritius">Mauritius</a> program. Durrell visited Madagascar in 1990 to start captive breeding of a number of endemic species like the <!--del_lnk--> Aye Aye.<p>Durrell chose the <a href="../../wp/d/Dodo.htm" title="Dodo">Dodo</a>, the flightless bird of Mauritius that was mercilessly hunted to extinction in the 1600s, as the logo for both the <a href="../../wp/j/Jersey_Zoological_Park.htm" title="Jersey Zoological Park">Jersey Zoo</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Trust. The children&#39;s chapter of the Trust is called the <!--del_lnk--> Dodo Club. Following his death, the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust was renamed <!--del_lnk--> Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust at the 40th anniversary of the <!--del_lnk--> Zoo on <!--del_lnk--> 26 March, 1999. The Wildlife Preservation Trust International also changed their name to <!--del_lnk--> Wildlife Trust in 2000, adopted the logo of the <!--del_lnk--> Black Tamarin.<p><a id="Final_years" name="Final_years"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Final years</span></h3>
      <p>A hard, outdoor life, coupled with heavy drinking, led Durrell to health problems in the 1980s. He underwent a hip-replacement surgery in a bid to counter <!--del_lnk--> arthritis, but suffered from liver problems. His health deteriorated rapidly after the 1990 <a href="../../wp/m/Madagascar.htm" title="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> trip. Durrell died of post-surgical complications following a <!--del_lnk--> liver transplantation, on <!--del_lnk--> January 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1995. His ashes are buried under a memorial plaque with a quote by <!--del_lnk--> William Beebe in Jersey Zoo.<p>A memorial celebrating Durrell&#39;s life and work was held at the <!--del_lnk--> Natural History Museum, <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> on <!--del_lnk--> June 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1995. Participants included personal friends like the famous television presenter <a href="../../wp/d/David_Attenborough.htm" title="David Attenborough">David Attenborough</a>, and Princess Anne.<p><a id="Durrell.27s_policy_for_zoos" name="Durrell.27s_policy_for_zoos"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Durrell&#39;s policy for zoos</span></h2>
      <p>Gerald Durrell was ahead of his time when he postulated the role that a 20th century <!--del_lnk--> zoo should play, primarily in <i>Stationary Ark</i>. His idea relies on the following bases:<ul>
       <li>The primary purpose of a zoo should be to act as a reserve of critically endangered species which need captive breeding in order to survive.<li>They can serve the secondary purposes of educating people about wildlife and natural history, and of educating biologists about the animal&#39;s habits.<li>Zoos should not be run for the purposes of entertainment only, and non-threatened species should be re-introduced into their natural habitats.<li>An animal should be present in the zoo only as a last resort, when all efforts to save it in the wild have failed.</ul>
      <p>Durrell&#39;s ideas about housing zoo animals also brings his priorities to the fore. The bases on which enclosures at Jersey are built:<ul>
       <li>Enclosures should be built keeping in mind &mdash; firstly, the comfort of the animal (including a private shelter), secondly for the convenience of the animal keeper, and finally for the viewing comfort of visitors.<li>The size of an enclosure should depend on how large their territories might be.<li>The companions of an animal should reflect not only <!--del_lnk--> ecological niche and <!--del_lnk--> biogeographic concerns, but its social abilities as well &mdash; how well it gets on with other members of its species and other species.<li>Every animal deserves food of its choice, sometimes made interesting by variation; and a mate of its choice; and a nice, and interesting environment.</ul>
      <p>Jersey Zoo was the first zoo to <i>only</i> house endangered breeding species, and has been one of the pioneers in the field of captive breeding. The International Training Centre, and the organization of the conference on captive breeding are also notable firsts.<p>Gerald Durrell initially faced stiff opposition and criticism from some members of the zoo community when he introduced the idea of <!--del_lnk--> captive breeding, and was only vindicated after successfully breeding a wide range of species. One of the most active opposition members was <!--del_lnk--> George Cansdale, superintendent of the <a href="../../wp/l/London_Zoo.htm" title="London Zoo">London Zoo</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Zoological Society of London, and wielder of considerable influence in the zoo community.<p>See also: <!--del_lnk--> Biogeography, <!--del_lnk--> Biogeographic Regions, <!--del_lnk--> Ecological niche<p><a id="Gerald_Durrell.27s_books" name="Gerald_Durrell.27s_books"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Gerald Durrell&#39;s books</span></h2>
      <p>Durrell&#39;s books, both fiction and non-fiction, have a wry, loose style that poked fun at himself as well as those around him. Perhaps his best-known work is <i>My Family and Other Animals</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1956), which tells of his idyllic, if oddball, childhood on Corfu. Later made into a TV series, it is delightfully deprecating about the whole family, especially elder brother Lawrence, who became a famous novelist. Despite Durrell&#39;s jokes at the expense of &quot;brother Larry,&quot; the two were close friends all their lives.<p>Gerald Durrell always insisted that he wrote for royalties to help the cause of environmental stewardship, not out of an inherent love for writing. Gerald Durrell describes himself as a writer in comparison to his brother Lawrence:<dl>
       <dd><i>The subtle difference between us is that he loves writing and I don&#39;t. To me it&#39;s simply a way to make money which enables me to do my animal work, nothing more.</i></dl>
      <p>However, he shows a surprising diversity and dexterity in a wide variety of writing, including:<ul>
       <li>autobiographical accounts: Most of his works are of such kind &mdash; characterized by a love for nature and animals, dry wit, crisp descriptions and humorous analogies of human beings with animals and vice versa. The most famous of these is the <!--del_lnk--> Corfu trilogy &mdash; <i>My Family and Other Animals</i>, <i>Birds, Beasts and Relatives</i>, and <i>The Garden of the Gods</i>.<li>short stories: often bordering on the <!--del_lnk--> Roald Dahl-esque, like &quot;Michelin Man&quot; in <i>Picnic and Suchlike Pandemonium</i>. The latter also has an acclaimed <!--del_lnk--> gothic horror story titled &quot;The Entrance&quot;. <i>Marrying Off Mother and Other Stories</i> also has a few short stories.<li>novels: Durrell&#39;s only two novels are <i>Rosy is My Relative</i>, the story about the bequeathed elephant which Durrell claimed is based on real life events; and <i>The Mockery Bird</i>, the fable based loosely on the story of <a href="../../wp/m/Mauritius.htm" title="Mauritius">Mauritius</a> and the <a href="../../wp/d/Dodo.htm" title="Dodo">Dodo</a>.<li>technical essays: <i>The Stationary Ark</i> is a collection of technical essays on zoo-keeping and conservation.<li>guides: <i>The Amateur Naturalist</i> is the definitive guide for a budding naturalist over the last 20 years.<li>stories for young adults: <i>The Donkey Rustlers</i> is an <!--del_lnk--> Enid Blyton-ish feel good novel, while <i>The Talking Parcel</i> is a fantasy novel for younger readers.<li>natural history books for children: <i>The New Noah</i> is a collection of encounters with animals from Durrell&#39;s previous expeditions, written with children in mind.<li>stories for children: <i>Keeper</i>, <i>Toby the Tortoise</i>, <i>The Fantastic Dinosaur Adventure</i>, and the <i>The Fantastic Flying Adventure</i> are lavishly illustrated stories for young children.<li>board and picture books: the board book series <i>Puppy Stories</i> are for infants, and the picture book <i>Island Zoo</i> is for young children about the first animals in <!--del_lnk--> Jersey Zoo.</ul>
      <p>Durrell was also a regular contributor to magazines on both sides of the Atlantic like <!--del_lnk--> Harper&#39;s, <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic Monthly, and <!--del_lnk--> The Sunday Times Supplement. He was also a regular book reviewer for <!--del_lnk--> New York Times. A number of excerpts and stories from his books were used by <!--del_lnk--> Octopus Books and <!--del_lnk--> Readers&#39; Digest Publishing, including in the <!--del_lnk--> Readers&#39; Digest Condensed Books.<p>Durrell&#39;s works have been translated into 31 languages, and made into TV serials, and feature films. He has a large cult following in <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Europe, in <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israel</a> and in various commonwealth countries, notably <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> British Library houses a collection of Durrell&#39;s books, presented by him to <!--del_lnk--> Alan G. Thomas, as part of the <!--del_lnk--> Lawrence Durrell Collection.<p><a id="Illustrators" name="Illustrators"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Illustrators</span></h4>
      <p>Durrell was a talented artist and caricaturist, but worked with numerous illustrators over the years starting with <!--del_lnk--> Sabine Braur for <i>The Overloaded Ark</i> (published by <!--del_lnk--> Faber and Faber). Two of his most productive collaborations were with <!--del_lnk--> Ralph Thompson (<i>Bafut Beagles</i>, <i>Three Singles To Adventure</i>, <i>The New Noah</i>, <i>The Drunken Forest</i>, <i>Encounters with Animals</i>, <i>A Zoo in My Luggage</i>, <i>The Whispering Land</i>, <i>Menagerie Manor</i>) (published by <!--del_lnk--> Rupert Hart-Davis) and <!--del_lnk--> Edward Mortelmans (<i>Catch Me A Colobus</i>, <i>Beasts in My Belfry</i>, <i>Golden Bats and Pink Pigeons</i>) (published by <!--del_lnk--> Collins). The illustrations are mostly sketches of animal subjects. <!--del_lnk--> Ralph Thompson has even visited the Jersey Zoological Park in-house during the sketching period for <i>Menagerie Manor</i>.<p>Other illustrators who worked with Durrell were <!--del_lnk--> Barry L.

       <li>The movie <i><!--del_lnk--> Fierce Creatures</i> was dedicated to him.<li>Durrell&#39;s book <i>Fillets of Plaice</i> is a pun on the name of the book <i>Spirit of Place</i> by elder brother <!--del_lnk--> Lawrence.<li>In the <!--del_lnk--> Discworld series of books, there is reference to a fictional book titled <i>My Family and Other Werewolves</i> &mdash; clearly a parody on <i><!--del_lnk--> My Family and Other Animals</i>.<li>Three actual books punning the name are <!--del_lnk--> Simon Doonan&#39;s humorous memoir <i>Nasty: My Family and Other Glamorous Varmints</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Josephine Feeney&#39;s comic novel <i>My Family and Other Natural Disasters</i> and <i>Stories from my life with the other animals</i> by <!--del_lnk--> James McConkey.<li>Gerald Durrell&#39;s debut book <i>The Overloaded Ark</i>, and Lawrence Durrell&#39;s <i>Reflections on a Marine Venus</i> were published simultaneously by <!--del_lnk--> Faber and Faber, with an advertisement which read: <i>Quests animal ... and human &mdash; a dual demonstration of the enviable art of Durrelling</i>.<li><i>Whatever Happened to Margo</i> was written by <!--del_lnk--> Margaret Durrell in <!--del_lnk--> 1951, but was only discovered in the attic by a granddaughter nearly 40 years later.

The <i>Garden of the Gods</i> title was changed because there is a location in the <!--del_lnk--> USA by the name <!--del_lnk--> Garden of the Gods.<li>The &quot;fight scene&quot; between Durrell&#39;s pet <!--del_lnk--> gecko Geronimo, and a larger <!--del_lnk--> praying mantis was directed by the Assistant Producer <!--del_lnk--> Nigel Marvin in the BBC 1989 TV series <i>My Family and Other Animals</i>.<li>Gerald Durrell was voted &quot;South West Hero&quot; in a poll conducted by the <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 2004, ahead of other contenders like Sir <a href="../../wp/w/Walter_Raleigh.htm" title="Walter Raleigh">Walter Raleigh</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Albert Bedane and <!--del_lnk--> Billy Butlin.

       <dd><i>We hope that there will be fireflies and glow-worms at night to guide you and butterflies in hedges and forests to greet you.</i><dd><i>We hope that your dawns will have an orchestra of bird song and that the sound of their wings and the opalescence of their colouring will dazzle you.</i><dd><i>We hope that there will still be the extraordinary varieties of creatures sharing the land of the planet with you to enchant you and enrich your lives as they have done for us.</i><dd><i>We hope that you will be grateful for having been born into such a magical world.</i></dl>
