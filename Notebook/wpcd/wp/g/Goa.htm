      <p>Goa has a long history stretching back to the 3rd century BC, when it formed part of the <!--del_lnk--> Mauryan Empire. Goa was later ruled by the <!--del_lnk--> Satavahanas of <!--del_lnk--> Kolhapur (in Maharashtra) around two thousand years ago. It eventually passed to the <!--del_lnk--> Chalukyas of <!--del_lnk--> Badami, who controlled it between 580 to 750. Over the next few centuries Goa was successively ruled by the <!--del_lnk--> Silharas, the <!--del_lnk--> Kadambas and the <!--del_lnk--> Chalukyans of <!--del_lnk--> Kalyani, rulers of <!--del_lnk--> Deccan India.<p>In 1312, Goa came under the governance of the <!--del_lnk--> Delhi Sultanate. However, the kingdom&#39;s grip on the region was weak, and by 1370 they were forced to surrender it to <!--del_lnk--> Harihara I of <!--del_lnk--> Vijayanagara. The Vijayanagara monarchs held on to the territory for the next hundred years until 1469, when it was appropriated by the <!--del_lnk--> Bahmani sultans of <!--del_lnk--> Gulbarga. After the dynasty crumbled, the area came under the hands of the <!--del_lnk--> Adil Shahis of <!--del_lnk--> Bijapur who made <!--del_lnk--> Velha Goa their auxiliary capital.<p>In 1498, <a href="../../wp/v/Vasco_da_Gama.htm" title="Vasco da Gama">Vasco da Gama</a> became the first <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European</a> to set foot in India through a sea route, landing in <!--del_lnk--> Kozhikode in <a href="../../wp/k/Kerala.htm" title="Kerala">Kerala</a>, followed by an arrival in what is now known as <!--del_lnk--> Old Goa. The Portuguese arrived with the intention of setting up a colony and seizing complete control of the spice trade from other European powers after traditional land routes to India were closed by the <!--del_lnk--> Ottoman Turks. Later, in 1510, Portuguese <!--del_lnk--> admiral <!--del_lnk--> Afonso de Albuquerque defeated the ruling Bijapur kings on behalf of a local sovereign, <!--del_lnk--> Timayya, leading to the establishment of a permanent settlement in Velha Goa (or Old Goa). The Portuguese intended it to be a colony and a naval base, distinct from the fortified enclaves established elsewhere along India&#39;s coasts.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>With the imposition of the <!--del_lnk--> Inquisition (1560&ndash;1812), many of the local residents were forcibly converted to <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> by missionaries, threatened by punishment or confiscation of land, titles or property. Many converted, however retaining parts of their Hindu heritage. To escape the Inquisition and harassment, thousands fled the state, settling down in the neighbouring towns of <!--del_lnk--> Mangalore and <!--del_lnk--> Karwar in Karnataka. With the arrival of the other European powers in India in the 16th century, most Portuguese possessions were surrounded by the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British</a> and the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a>. Portuguese possessions in India were a few <!--del_lnk--> enclaves along India&#39;s west coast, with Goa being the largest of these holdings.<p>An interesting development of the 18th century in Goa is the <!--del_lnk--> Conspiracy Of The Pintos in 1787 which was inspired by the <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>. This was the first ethnic rebellion against Portuguese rule in Goa. Goa soon became their most important possession in India, and was granted the same civic privileges as <a href="../../wp/l/Lisbon.htm" title="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>. The Portuguese encouraged its citizens to marry local women, and to settle in Goa. However, among the local population (both Christian and Hindu) this was looked down upon. Progeny of these unions called the <!--del_lnk--> mesti&ccedil;o were favourably considered by the Portuguese rulers. Subsequently, a senate was created, which maintained direct communications with the king. In 1843 the capital was moved to <!--del_lnk--> Panjim from Velha Goa. By mid-18th century the area under occupation had expanded to most of Goa&#39;s present day state limits.<p>After India gained independence from the British in 1947, Portugal refused to accede to India&#39;s demand to relinquish their control of its <!--del_lnk--> exclave. Resolution 1541 by the <!--del_lnk--> United Nations General Assembly in 1960 noted that Goa was non-self-governing and essentially showed sympathy toward <!--del_lnk--> self determination. Finally, on <!--del_lnk--> 1961-<!--del_lnk--> 12-12, the <!--del_lnk--> Indian army with 40,000 troops moved in. After a brief skirmish lasting for twenty-six hours, Goa, along with <!--del_lnk--> Daman and Diu (enclaves lying to the north of Maharashtra), was made into a centrally administered <!--del_lnk--> Union Territory. India&#39;s takeover of Goa is commemorated annually on the 19th of December (Liberation Day). The UN <!--del_lnk--> Security Council considered a resolution condemning the invasion which was vetoed by the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>. Most nations later recognised India&#39;s action, and Portugal recognised it after its <!--del_lnk--> Carnation Revolution in 1974. On <!--del_lnk--> 1987-<!--del_lnk--> 05-30, the Union Territory was split, and Goa was elevated as India&#39;s twenty-fifth state, with Daman and Diu remaining Union Territories.<div class="medialist multivideolist">

      <p>Goa encompasses an area of 3,702&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km&sup2; (1,430&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> sq mile). It lies between the latitudes 14&deg;53&#39;54&quot; N and 15&deg;40&#39;00&quot; N and longitudes 73&deg;40&#39;33&quot; E and 74&deg;20&#39;13&quot; E. Most of Goa is a part of the coastal country known as the <!--del_lnk--> Konkan, which is an escarpment rising up to the <!--del_lnk--> Western Ghats range of mountains, which separate it from the <!--del_lnk--> Deccan Plateau. The highest point is the <!--del_lnk--> Sonsogor, with an altitude of 1,167&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> metres (3,827&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> feet). Goa has a coastline of 101&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km (63&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> miles).<p>Goa&#39;s main rivers are the <!--del_lnk--> Mandovi, the <!--del_lnk--> Zuari, the <!--del_lnk--> Terekhol, <!--del_lnk--> Chapora River and the <!--del_lnk--> Betul. The Mormugao harbour on the mouth of the river Zuari is one of the best natural harbours in South Asia. The Zuari and the Mandovi are the lifelines of Goa, with their tributaries draining 69% of its geographic area. Goa has more than forty estuarine, eight marine and about ninety riverine islands. The total navigable length of Goa&#39;s rivers is 253&nbsp;km (157&nbsp;miles). Goa has more than three hundred ancient <!--del_lnk--> tanks built during the rule of the Kadamba dynasty and over a hundred medicinal springs.<p>Most of Goa&#39;s soil cover is made up of <!--del_lnk--> laterites which are rich in <!--del_lnk--> ferric <a href="../../wp/a/Aluminium.htm" title="Aluminium">aluminium</a> oxides and <!--del_lnk--> reddish in colour. Further inland and along the river banks, the soil is mostly <!--del_lnk--> alluvial and <!--del_lnk--> loamy. The soil is rich in minerals and <a href="../../wp/h/Humus.htm" title="Humus">humus</a>, thus conducive to plantation. Some of the oldest rocks in the <!--del_lnk--> Indian subcontinent are found in Goa between <!--del_lnk--> Molem and <!--del_lnk--> Anmod on Goa&#39;s border with Karnataka. The rocks are classified as <!--del_lnk--> Trondjemeitic Gneiss estimated to be 3,600 million years old, dated by the <a href="../../wp/r/Rubidium.htm" title="Rubidium">Rubidium</a> isotope dating method. A specimen of the rock is exhibited in the <!--del_lnk--> Goa University.<p>Goa, being in the <!--del_lnk--> tropical zone and near the <!--del_lnk--> Arabian Sea, has a warm and <!--del_lnk--> humid climate for most of the year. The month of May is the hottest, seeing day temperatures of over 35&deg;<!--del_lnk--> C (95&deg;<!--del_lnk--> F) coupled with high humidity. The <!--del_lnk--> monsoon rains arrive by early June and provide a much needed respite from the heat. Most of Goa&#39;s annual rainfall is received through the monsoons which last till late September.<p>Goa has a short cool season between mid-December and February. These months are marked by cool nights of around 20&deg;C (68&deg;F) and warm days of around 29&deg;C (84&deg;F) with moderate amounts of humidity. Further inland, due to altitudinal gradation, the nights are a few degrees cooler.<p><a id="Subdivisions" name="Subdivisions"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Subdivisions</span></h3>

      <p><a href="../../wp/f/Forest.htm" title="Forest">Forest</a> cover in Goa stands at 1,424&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km&sup2;, most of which is owned by the government. Most of the forests in the state are located in the interior eastern regions of the state. The <!--del_lnk--> Western Ghats, which form most of eastern Goa, have been internationally recognised as one of the biodiversity hotspots of the world. In the February 1999 issue of <i><!--del_lnk--> National Geographic Magazine</i>, Goa was compared with the <a href="../../wp/a/Amazon_Basin.htm" title="Amazon Basin">Amazon</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Congo basins for its rich tropical biodiversity.<p>The important forests products are <!--del_lnk--> bamboo canes, <!--del_lnk--> Maratha barks, <!--del_lnk--> chillar barks and the <!--del_lnk--> bhirand. <!--del_lnk--> Coconut trees are ubiquitous and are present in almost all areas of Goa barring the elevated regions. A large number of <!--del_lnk--> deciduous vegetation consisting of <!--del_lnk--> teak, <!--del_lnk--> sal, <!--del_lnk--> cashew and <a href="../../wp/m/Mango.htm" title="Mango">mango</a> trees are present. Fruits include <!--del_lnk--> jackfruits, <a href="../../wp/m/Mango.htm" title="Mango">mangos</a>, <!--del_lnk--> pineapples and <!--del_lnk--> blackberries.<p><a href="../../wp/f/Fox.htm" title="Fox">Foxes</a>, <!--del_lnk--> wild boars and <a href="../../wp/b/Bird_migration.htm" title="Bird migration">migratory</a> birds are found in the jungles of Goa.

Numerous types of fish are also caught off the coast of Goa and in its rivers. <!--del_lnk--> Crabs, <!--del_lnk--> lobsters, <!--del_lnk--> shrimps, <!--del_lnk--> jellyfish, <!--del_lnk--> oysters and <!--del_lnk--> catfish form some of the piscine catch. Goa also has a high <!--del_lnk--> snake population, which keeps the <!--del_lnk--> rodent population in control. Goa has many famous <!--del_lnk--> National Parks, including the renowned <!--del_lnk--> Salim Ali bird sanctuary. Other wildlife sanctuaries include the <!--del_lnk--> Bondla Wildlife Sanctuary, <!--del_lnk--> Molem Wildlife Sanctuary, <!--del_lnk--> Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary, <!--del_lnk--> Madei Wildlife Sanctuary, <!--del_lnk--> Netravali Wildlife Sanctuary <!--del_lnk--> Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctuaryand the <!--del_lnk--> Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary located on the island of <!--del_lnk--> Chorao.<p>Goa has more than 33% of its geographic area under government forests (1224.38 km&sup2;.) of which about 62% has been brought under Protected Areas (PA) of Wildlife Sanctuaries and National Park. Since there is a substantial area under private forests and a large tract under cashew, mango, coconut, etc. plantations, the total forest and tree cover constitutes 56.6% of the geographic area.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>

      <p>Goa&#39;s gross state domestic product for 2004 is estimated at $3 billion in current prices.<p>Goa is India&#39;s richest state with a <!--del_lnk--> GDP per capita two and a half times that of the country as a whole, and one of its fastest growth rates: 8.23% (yearly average 1990-2000).<p><a id="Industry" name="Industry"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Industry</span></h3>
      <p>The land away from the coast is rich in minerals and ores and <a href="../../wp/m/Mining.htm" title="Mining">mining</a> forms the second largest industry. Mining in Goa focuses on ores of <!--del_lnk--> iron, <!--del_lnk--> Bauxite, <a href="../../wp/m/Manganese.htm" title="Manganese">manganese</a>, clays, <!--del_lnk--> limestone and <!--del_lnk--> silica. Agriculture, while of shrinking importance to the economy over the past four decades, offers part-time employment to a sizable portion of the populace. <a href="../../wp/r/Rice.htm" title="Rice">Rice</a> is the main agricultural crop, followed by <!--del_lnk--> areca, <!--del_lnk--> cashew and <a href="../../wp/c/Coconut.htm" title="Coconut">coconut</a>. The fishing industry provides employment for about forty thousand people, though recent official figures indicate a decline of the importance of this sector and also a fall in catch, perhaps coupled with the fact that traditional fishing has given way to large-scale mechanised trawling.<p>Medium scale industries include the manufacturing of <!--del_lnk--> pesticides, <!--del_lnk--> fertilisers, <!--del_lnk--> tyres, <!--del_lnk--> tubes, <!--del_lnk--> footwear, <!--del_lnk--> chemicals, <!--del_lnk--> pharmaceuticals, <a href="../../wp/w/Wheat.htm" title="Wheat">wheat</a> products, steel rolling, fruits and fish canning, cashew nuts, textiles, <!--del_lnk--> brewery products. Goa is also notable for its low liquor prices due to its very low <!--del_lnk--> excise duty on <a href="../../wp/a/Alcohol.htm" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a>. Another source of cash inflow into the state comes from many of its citizens who work abroad and remit money to their families. Zuari Industries (2005 gross income Rs.36,302 million) and Sesa Goa (2005 gross income Rs.17,265 million) are two <i>S&amp;P CNX 500</i> conglomerates which have corporate offices in Goa.<p><a id="Services" name="Services"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Services</span></h3>
      <p>Tourism is Goa&#39;s primary industry: it handles 12% of all foreign tourist arrivals in India. Goa has two main tourist seasons: winter and summer. In the winter time, tourists from abroad (mainly Europe) come to Goa to enjoy the splendid climate. In the summertime (which, in Goa, is the rainy season), tourists from across India come to spend the holidays.<p>Tourism is generally focused on the coastal areas of Goa, with decreased tourist activity inland. In 2004 there were more than 2 million tourists reported to have visited Goa, 400,000 of which were from abroad. There are several reasons why tourists are visiting Goa in increasing numbers. First, because of the historical development of the area, the inhabitants of Goa are increasingly used to contact with foreigners. Additionally, a large portion (approx 35%) of the Goan people are Catholic. This cultural heritage from the time of the Portuguese colonization makes the state somewhat more intimate to European or American people than the rest of the Indian subcontinent. Goan culture incorporates a very nonproblematic mix of Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam.<p>The food of Goa is a mixture of foods from Portugal, Western India and Arabia (and, in the tourist season, from Kashmir as well). Goa is one of the few places in India that you can go to a restaurant and order (beside fish and chicken) both beef and pork, which are usually served very lightly spiced; beer, wine and other alcoholic drinks are sold freely.<p>These attributes, together with the fact that Goa&rsquo;s economy is among the most prosperous in India, have won Goa the nickname &quot;India for the beginners&quot; &ndash; the great differences between Europe and India, very apparent in other parts of India due to large slums and other problems, are much less pronounced.<p><a id="Transport" name="Transport"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Transport</span></h3>
      <p>Goa&#39;s main form of <!--del_lnk--> public transport largely consists of privately operated buses linking the major towns to rural areas. Government-run white-with-blue-and-red-stripes buses, maintained by a service called the <!--del_lnk--> Kadamba Transport Corporation, links both major routes (like the Panjim-Margao route) and also some of the more remote parts of the state and taluka headquarters. In large towns such as Panjim and Margao, intra-city buses serve its citizens. Public transport in Goa is not very efficient, and most buses stop plying on routes a little after dusk.<p>Residents depend heavily on their own transport, usually motorised two-wheelers. Goa has two <!--del_lnk--> National Highways passing through it. NH-17 runs along India&#39;s west coast and links Goa to Bombay in the north and <!--del_lnk--> Mangalore to the south. NH-4A running across the state connects the capital Panjim to <!--del_lnk--> Belgaum in east, linking Goa to cities in the <!--del_lnk--> Deccan. The NH-17A connects NH-17 to <!--del_lnk--> Mormugao Harbour from Cortalim, and the new NH-17B, once complete will be a four lane highway connecting Mormugao Harbour to NH-17 at another location, Verna, via <!--del_lnk--> Dabolim airport. Goa has a total of 224&nbsp;km of National highway, 232&nbsp;km of state highway and 815&nbsp;km of district highway.<p>Hired forms of transport include unmetered taxis, and, in urban areas, <!--del_lnk--> auto rickshaws. A unique form of transport in Goa is the yellow-and-black two-wheeler <!--del_lnk--> Motorcycle taxi, operated by drivers who are locally called &quot;pilots&quot;. These vehicles transport a single <!--del_lnk--> pillion rider, at fares that are usually negotiated prior or after the journey. In some places in Goa, there are river crossings which are serviced by the <!--del_lnk--> ferry boats, operated by the river navigation departments. Goa has two <a href="../../wp/r/Rail_transport.htm" title="Rail transport">rail lines</a> &ndash; one run by the South Western Railway and the other by the <!--del_lnk--> Konkan Railway. The line run by the <!--del_lnk--> South Western Railway was built during the colonial era linking the port town of Vasco da Gama to <!--del_lnk--> Hubli in <!--del_lnk--> Karnataka and passing through Margaon. The line, earlier a <!--del_lnk--> metre gauge, was recently converted to <!--del_lnk--> broad gauge. The Konkan Railway line, which was built during the 1990s, runs parallel to the coast connecting Mumbai to the <!--del_lnk--> Malabar Coast.<p>Goa&#39;s sole airport, the <!--del_lnk--> Dabolim Airport, is a military airport, though civilian flights are permitted when the fields can be spared from military uses. In addition to regular flights, the airport handles a large number of chartered flights. The Mormugao harbour near the city of Vasco handles mineral ore, petroleum, coal and international containers. Much of the shipments consist of minerals and ores from Goa&#39;s hinterland. Panjim, which is situated on the banks of the Mandovi, also has a minor port, which used to handle passenger <!--del_lnk--> steamers between Goa and Mumbai till the late 1980s.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>
      <p>A native of Goa is called a <b>Goan</b> in English, &#39;Goenkar&#39; in Konkani, &#39;Go&ecirc;s&#39; (male) or &#39;Goesa&#39; (female) in Portuguese, and a &#39;Govekar&#39; in Marathi.<p>Goa has at present a population of 1.344 million residents, making it India&#39;s fourth smallest (after Sikkim, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh). The population has a growth rate of 14.9% per annum. There are 363 people for each square kilometre of the land. 49.77% of the population live in urban areas. The sex ratio is 960 females to 1000 males. Goa&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> literacy rate is 82.32%, broken down into: males 88.88% and females 75.51%. <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> (65%), <!--del_lnk--> Catholicism (30%) and <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> are the three main <!--del_lnk--> religions in Goa. <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholicism</a> reached Goa during the period of <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European</a> colonization, which began in 1498 when the Portuguese explorer <a href="../../wp/v/Vasco_da_Gama.htm" title="Vasco da Gama">Vasco da Gama</a> arrived on the <!--del_lnk--> Malabar coast. Goa&#39;s major cities include <!--del_lnk--> Vasco, <!--del_lnk--> Margao, <!--del_lnk--> Marmagao (also known as Murgaon or Mormug&atilde;o), <!--del_lnk--> Panjim and <!--del_lnk--> Mapusa. The region connecting the last four cities is considered a <i>de facto</i> <!--del_lnk--> conurbation, or a more or less continuous urban area.<p>The official languages of <strong class="selflink">Goa</strong> are <!--del_lnk--> Konkani and <!--del_lnk--> Marathi. Following the end of Portuguese rule, the most widely used languages are <!--del_lnk--> Konkani as the primary spoken language, and <!--del_lnk--> English for official, literary or educational purposes. Language is a controversial issue in Goa, over which an agitation was fought between two contending pro-Konkani and pro-Marathi camps between 1985-87. Majority of the Goans united and fought for Konkani as their mother tongue. After the agitation ended in 1987, a complex formula grants &#39;official language&#39; status to Konkani. Given the bitter rivalry between the two lobbies, clubbed with a maudlin issue has resulted in a stalemate over the actual implementation. <a href="../../wp/p/Portuguese_language.htm" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a>, the earlier language of the elite, has been hit by shrinking numbers, though a small section still prefer it as the medium for discourse at home, while even a few Portuguese books have been published in recent years. <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a>, viewed as a language of opportunity and social mobility is widely understood by the many of the state residents. <a href="../../wp/h/Hindi.htm" title="Hindi">Hindi</a>, India&#39;s national language, is also spoken as a second language. Whereas, in the past, most people spoke Konkani, nowadays Hindi is increasingly heard due to lots of immigrants from rest of India.<p><a id="Ethnicity_and_Surnames" name="Ethnicity_and_Surnames"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Ethnicity and Surnames</span></h3>
      <p>The people of Goa are <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Aryan and are closely related to the neighbouring <!--del_lnk--> Marathi people. The majority of Goa&#39;s population comprises of the <!--del_lnk--> Aryan <!--del_lnk--> Marathas. The present <!--del_lnk--> chief minister of Goa, <!--del_lnk--> Pratapsinh Rane belongs to a royal clan of <!--del_lnk--> Maratha. The common <!--del_lnk--> surnames of <!--del_lnk--> Marathas are <!--del_lnk--> Rane, <!--del_lnk--> Sawant, <!--del_lnk--> Kadam, Porob and many others. For a listing of Goan <!--del_lnk--> Maratha surnames, see <!--del_lnk--> Maratha Clan System. Most of the <!--del_lnk--> Goan <!--del_lnk--> Marathas are closely related to the Maratha people of the neighbouring region of <!--del_lnk--> Sawantvadi, which was a former <!--del_lnk--> princely state and is often called the sister-region of Goa. The other major ethnic groups of Goa are <!--del_lnk--> Goud Saraswat Brahmins and <!--del_lnk--> Christians. The Goud Saraswats trace their lineage to the <!--del_lnk--> East Indian region of <!--del_lnk--> Bengal. They share similar surnames with <!--del_lnk--> Bengalis like <!--del_lnk--> Shenoy, <!--del_lnk--> Benegal, etc. Most of the <!--del_lnk--> Christians of Goa are of <!--del_lnk--> Dravidian descent. Many of them are <!--del_lnk--> Dalit <!--del_lnk--> converts. Due to the initial colonization of Goa, adopted <!--del_lnk--> Portuguese surnames such as <!--del_lnk--> Da Silva, D&#39;Souza, <!--del_lnk--> Pereira and such like are very common despite the fact that most people are of no Portuguese descent what-so-ever. This is evident in the caste system used by the Catholics. These Portuguese surnames are also present further down the West Coast in the largely Catholic city of <!--del_lnk--> Mangalore, in <!--del_lnk--> Karnataka State. Similar surnames are also prevalent in the neighbouring country, <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, but with some variations. Most of the Goan Hindus surnames end with &quot;<i>-Kar</i>&quot; <!--del_lnk--> suffix, similar to the surnames of <!--del_lnk--> Maharashtrian people. eg. Chandavarkar, Usgaonkar, etc. However, some Goan Hindus prefer the &quot;<i>-Car</i>&quot; <!--del_lnk--> suffix, under the influence of the <!--del_lnk--> Portuguese, eg. Salgaocar, Caro, Verlecar, Domotcar, Raiturcar, etc. The Portuguese influence goes beyond the &quot;<i>Kar</i>&quot; suffix as some traditional <!--del_lnk--> Maratha surnames are also influenced by Portuguese. eg. <!--del_lnk--> Parab turneed to Porob, <!--del_lnk--> Kadam turned to Kadoum, etc.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

      <p>The most popular celebrations in Goa are <!--del_lnk--> Christmas, <!--del_lnk--> Easter Sunday <!--del_lnk--> Ganesh Chaturthi, <!--del_lnk--> New Year&#39;s Day, the <!--del_lnk--> Shigmo festival and the <!--del_lnk--> Carnival. However, since the 1960s, the celebrations of the Shigmo and carnival have shifted to the urban centres, and in recent times these festivals are seen more as a means of attracting tourists. Celebrations for all festivals usually last for a few days and include parties and balls.<p><!--del_lnk--> Western English songs have a large following in most parts of Goa. Traditional Konkani folk songs too have a sizable following. <!--del_lnk--> Manddo, the traditional Goan music which originated in the <!--del_lnk--> nineteenth century, is sung and danced on special occasions. Goa is also known for its <!--del_lnk--> Goa trance music.<p><a href="../../wp/r/Rice.htm" title="Rice">Rice</a> with <a href="../../wp/f/Fish.htm" title="Fish">fish</a> <!--del_lnk--> curry is the staple diet in Goa.

An exotic Goan vegetable stew, known as <!--del_lnk--> Khatkhate, is very popoular dish during the celebrations of festivals, Hindu and Christian alike. <!--del_lnk--> Khatkhate contains at least five vegetables, fresh coconut, and special Goan spices that add to the aroma of <!--del_lnk--> Khatkhate. A rich <a href="../../wp/e/Egg_%2528food%2529.htm" title="Egg (food)">egg</a>-based multi-layered sweet dish known as <!--del_lnk--> bebinca is a favourite at <!--del_lnk--> Christmas. The most popular alcoholic beverage in Goa is <!--del_lnk--> feni; Cashew feni is made from the fermentation of the fruit of the cashew tree, while coconut <!--del_lnk--> feni is made from the sap of toddy palms.<p>Goa has two <!--del_lnk--> World Heritage Sites: the <!--del_lnk--> Bom Jesus Basilica and a few designated convents. The Basilica holds the mortal remains of St. <!--del_lnk--> Francis Xavier, regarded by many Catholics as the patron saint of Goa. Once every decade, the body is taken down for veneration and for public viewing. The last such event was conducted in 2004. The Velhas Conquistas regions are also known for its Goa-Portuguese style architecture.<p>In many parts of Goa, mansions constructed in the Indo-Portuguese style architecture still stand, though in some villages, most of them are in a dilapidated condition. <!--del_lnk--> Fontainhas in Panjim, has been declared a cultural quarter, and are used as a living museum showcasing the life, architecture and culture of Goa. Some influences from the Portuguese era are visible in some of Goa&#39;s temples, notably the <!--del_lnk--> Mangueshi Temple, although after 1961, many of these were demolished and reconstructed in the indigenous Indian style.<p>Football is widely popular in Goa, particularly around Margao where the main football stadium, located at the Fatorda, Margao. Football is also played in local fields, during the non-monsoon, non-planting season, particular in central coastal Goa. Many of the country&#39;s top <!--del_lnk--> NFL clubs such as the <!--del_lnk--> Vasco, <!--del_lnk--> Salgaocar, <!--del_lnk--> Dempo, <!--del_lnk--> Sporting Clube de Goa, <!--del_lnk--> Fransa-Pax Football Club and <!--del_lnk--> Churchill Brothers are based in Goa.<p>In recent decades, a growing influence of <a href="../../wp/c/Cricket.htm" title="Cricket">cricket</a> is visible, in large part fuelled by the massive coverage this sport gets on national television, thus making an impact even in a part of South Asia which hardly had any contact with the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>.<p>The state&#39;s sole stadium is the <!--del_lnk--> Fatorda stadium, located near Margao.

Goa contributes two seats to the <!--del_lnk--> Lok Sabha and one to the <!--del_lnk--> Rajya Sabha, in India&#39;s bicameral parliament.<p>Goa has a <!--del_lnk--> unicameral legislature consisting of a forty member <!--del_lnk--> Legislative Assembly, headed by a <!--del_lnk--> Chief Minister who wields the executive power. The ruling government consists of the party or coalition garnering the most seats in the state elections and enjoying the support of a <!--del_lnk--> simple majority of the House. The governor is appointed by the <!--del_lnk--> President of India. The governor&#39;s role is largely ceremonial, but plays a crucial role when it comes to deciding who should form the next government or in suspending the legislature as has happened in the recent past. After having stable governance for nearly thirty years up to 1990, Goa is now notorious for its political instability having seen fourteen governments in the span of the fifteen years between 1990 and 2005. In March 2005 the assembly was dissolved by the governor and <!--del_lnk--> President&#39;s Rule was declared, which suspended the legislature. A recent by-election in June 2005 saw the Congress coming back to power after winning three of the five seats that went to polls. The <!--del_lnk--> Congress party and the <!--del_lnk--> BJP are the two largest parties in the state. Other parties include the <!--del_lnk--> United Goans Democratic Party, the <!--del_lnk--> Nationalist Congress Party and the <!--del_lnk--> Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party is the oldest in the state, though in recent times it has lost out much of its traditional electorate.<p>Unlike other states which follows the British Indian model of civil laws framed for individual religions, the Portuguese <!--del_lnk--> Uniform Civil Code, based on the Napoleonic Codes, has been retained by the Goa government.<h2><span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h2>
      <p>Each taluka is made up of villages, each having a school run by the government. However, many of the state&#39;s residents prefer to enroll in privately run schools, which offer better facilities. All schools come under the state <!--del_lnk--> SSC whose syllabus is prescribed by the state Education department. There are also a few schools run by the all-India <!--del_lnk--> ICSE board. Most students in Goa complete their high school using English as the medium of instruction. Primary schools, on the other hand is largely run in Konkani (in private, but government-aided schools). As is the case in most of India, enrollment for vernacular media has seen a fall in numbers in favour of English medium education. One of the best English medium private schools run by <!--del_lnk--> Jesuits is <!--del_lnk--> St Ignatius of Loyola High School based in <!--del_lnk--> Margao. Formed in the 19th Century it initially began for the elite of <!--del_lnk--> Margao but later the reserve was removed due to the growing urban population.<p>After ten years of schooling, students join a <!--del_lnk--> Junior College which offers courses in popular streams such as <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">Science</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Arts, <a href="../../wp/l/Law.htm" title="Law">Law</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Commerce. Additionally, many join three year <!--del_lnk--> diploma courses. Two years of college is followed by a professional degree. The <!--del_lnk--> Goa University is the sole <a href="../../wp/u/University.htm" title="University">university</a> in the state located in <!--del_lnk--> Taleigao and all <!--del_lnk--> Goan colleges are affiliated to it. There are three <a href="../../wp/e/Engineering.htm" title="Engineering">engineering</a> colleges and one medical college in the state. The <!--del_lnk--> Goa Engineering College and <!--del_lnk--> Goa Medical College are run by the state whereas the other two engineering colleges are run by private organisations.There are also colleges offering <!--del_lnk--> pharmacy, <a href="../../wp/a/Architecture.htm" title="Architecture">architecture</a> and <!--del_lnk--> dentistry along with numerous private colleges offering <a href="../../wp/l/Law.htm" title="Law">law</a>, <!--del_lnk--> arts, <!--del_lnk--> commerce and <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">science</a>.<p>Many residents, however, choose to take up courses in other states as the demand for a course in Goa is more than that available. Goa is also well-known in India for courses in <!--del_lnk--> marine engineering, <!--del_lnk--> fisheries, hotel management and <!--del_lnk--> cuisine. The State also hosts a premier <!--del_lnk--> Business school <!--del_lnk--> Goa Institute of Management which is autonomous and was founded in 1993 by <!--del_lnk--> Fr. Romuald D&#39;souza.<p>Portuguese is taught in part of the school curriculum as a third language in some schools. The Goa University also offers bachelor and Master&#39;s degrees in Portuguese.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa&quot;</div>
