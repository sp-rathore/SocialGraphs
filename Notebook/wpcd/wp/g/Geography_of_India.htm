      <p>A great arc of mountains, composed of the <a href="../../wp/h/Himalayas.htm" title="Himalaya">Himalaya</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Hindu Kush, and <!--del_lnk--> Patkai ranges, define the Indian subcontinent. These mountains were formed by the <!--del_lnk--> ongoing tectonic collision of the <!--del_lnk--> Indian Plate with the <!--del_lnk--> Eurasian Plate which started some 50 million years ago. These mountain ranges are home to some of the tallest mountains in the world and provide a natural barrier against the cold polar winds. They also facilitate the <!--del_lnk--> monsoons that drive climate in India. The protection and climatic control they have provided has been a <!--del_lnk--> geographical quality that has assisted India&#39;s position as a <!--del_lnk--> Great power. The numerous rivers that originate in these mountains provide water to the fertile Indo-Gangetic plains. These mountains are recognised by <!--del_lnk--> biogeographers as the boundary between two of the earth&#39;s great ecozones; the <a href="../../wp/t/Temperate.htm" title="Temperate">temperate</a> <!--del_lnk--> Palearctic that covers most of Eurasia, and the <!--del_lnk--> tropical and <!--del_lnk--> subtropical <!--del_lnk--> Indomalaya ecozone that includes the Indian subcontinent and extend into <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asia and Indonesia. Historically, these ranges have served as barriers to invaders.<p>India has seven major mountain ranges having peaks of over 1,000&nbsp;m (3,300&nbsp;feet). The Himalayas are the only mountain ranges to have snow-capped peaks. These ranges are:<ol>

      <p>The Himalaya mountain range is the world&#39;s highest mountain range. They form India&#39;s north-eastern border, separating it from the rest of Asia. The Himalayas are one of the world&#39;s youngest mountain ranges, and extend almost uninterrupted for a distance of 2,500&nbsp;km (1,550&nbsp;miles), covering an area of 500,000&nbsp;km&sup2; (193,000&nbsp;square miles).<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The <b>Himalayas</b> extend from the state of <!--del_lnk--> Jammu and Kashmir in the west to the state of <!--del_lnk--> Arunachal Pradesh in the east. These states along with <!--del_lnk--> Himachal Pradesh, <!--del_lnk--> Uttaranchal, and <a href="../../wp/s/Sikkim.htm" title="Sikkim">Sikkim</a> lie mostly in the Himalayan region. Some of the Himalayan peaks range over 7,000&nbsp;m (23,000&nbsp;feet) and the <!--del_lnk--> snow line ranges between 6,000&nbsp;m (19,600&nbsp;feet) in Sikkim to around 3,000&nbsp;m (9,850&nbsp;feet) in Kashmir. <!--del_lnk--> Kangchenjunga, which lies in <a href="../../wp/s/Sikkim.htm" title="Sikkim">Sikkim</a>, is the highest point in the country&#39;s territory (undisputed). Most peaks in the Himalayas remain snowbound throughout the year.<p>The <b><!--del_lnk--> Shiwalik</b>, or lower Himalaya, consists of smaller hills towards the Indian side. Most of the rock formations are young and highly unstable, with <!--del_lnk--> landslides being a regular phenomenon during the rainy season. Many of India&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> hill stations are located on this range. The climate varies from sub tropical in the foothills to tundra at the higher elevations of these mountain ranges.<p>The mountains on India&#39;s eastern border with Myanmar are called as the <b><!--del_lnk--> Patkai</b> or the <b>Purvanchal</b>. They were created by the same tectonic processes that resulted in the formation of the Himalaya. The features of the Patkai ranges are conical peaks, steep slopes and deep valleys. The Patkai ranges are not as rugged or tall as the Himalayas. There are three hill ranges that come under the Patkai: The Patkai-Bum, the <!--del_lnk--> Garo-<!--del_lnk--> Khasi-<!--del_lnk--> Jaintia, and the <!--del_lnk--> Lushai hills. The Garo-Khasi range is in the Indian state of <!--del_lnk--> Meghalaya. The climate ranges from <a href="../../wp/t/Temperate.htm" title="Temperate">temperate</a> to <!--del_lnk--> alpine due to altitude. <!--del_lnk--> Cherrapunji, which lies on the <!--del_lnk--> windward side of these hills, has the distinction of being the wettest place in the world, receiving the highest annual rainfall.<div class="thumb tright">

It begins in eastern <!--del_lnk--> Gujarat near the <!--del_lnk--> Arabian Sea coast, then runs east through <!--del_lnk--> Maharashtra, <!--del_lnk--> Madhya Pradesh and ends in the state of <!--del_lnk--> Chhattisgarh. It extends for a distance of 900&nbsp;km with many of its peaks rising above 1000&nbsp;m (3,300&nbsp;feet). It is angular in shape, with its vertex at <!--del_lnk--> Ratnapuri and the two sides being parallel to the <!--del_lnk--> Tapti and <!--del_lnk--> Narmada river.

      <p>The <b>Thar Desert</b> (also known as the <b>Great Indian Desert</b>) is a hot <a href="../../wp/d/Desert.htm" title="Desert">desert</a> that forms a significant portion of western India. Spread over four states in <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> Punjab, <!--del_lnk--> Haryana, <!--del_lnk--> Rajasthan, and <!--del_lnk--> Gujarat it covers an area of 208,110&nbsp;km&sup2; (80,350&nbsp;mile&sup2;). The desert continues into <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> as the <!--del_lnk--> Cholistan Desert. Most of the Thar Desert is situated in <!--del_lnk--> Rajasthan, covering 61% of its geographic area. Most of the desert is rocky, with a small part of the extreme west of the desert being sandy.<p>The origin of the Thar Desert is uncertain. Some geologists consider it to be 4,000 to 10,000 years old, whereas others state that <!--del_lnk--> aridity began in this region much earlier. The area is characterised by extreme temperatures of above 45&nbsp;&deg;<!--del_lnk--> C (113&nbsp;&deg;<!--del_lnk--> F) in summer to below <!--del_lnk--> freezing in winters. Rainfall is precarious and erratic, ranging from below 120&nbsp;mm (4.72&nbsp;in) in the extreme west to 375&nbsp;mm (14.75&nbsp;in) eastward. The lack of rainfall is mainly due to the unique position of the desert with respect to the Aravalli range. The desert lies in the rain shadow area of the <a href="../../wp/b/Bay_of_Bengal.htm" title="Bay of Bengal">Bay of Bengal</a> arm of the southwest monsoon. The parallel nature of the range to the Arabian Sea arm also means that the desert does not receive much rainfall.<p>The desert can be divided into two regions, the great Desert and the little desert. The great Desert extends northwards from the edge of the <!--del_lnk--> Rann of Kutch region of Gujarat. The little desert extends from the <!--del_lnk--> River Luni between the towns of <!--del_lnk--> Jodhpur and <!--del_lnk--> Jaisalmer, up to the northern areas. The soils of the arid region are generally sandy to sandy-loam in texture. The consistency and depth vary according to the topographical features. The low-lying loams are heavier and may have a hard pan of clay, <!--del_lnk--> calcium carbonate or <a href="../../wp/g/Gypsum.htm" title="Gypsum">gypsum</a>.

      <p>The <b>Deccan</b> <!--del_lnk--> plateau is a large triangular plateau, bounded by the Vindhyas to the north and flanked by the Eastern and Western Ghats. The Deccan covers a total area of 1.9 million&nbsp;km&sup2; (735,000 mile&sup2;). It is mostly flat, with elevations ranging from 300 to 600&nbsp;m (1,000 to 2,000&nbsp;feet).<p>The name <i>Deccan</i> comes from the <!--del_lnk--> Sanskrit word <i>dakshina</i>, which means &quot;the south&quot;. The plateau slopes gently from west to east and gives rise to several peninsular <a href="../../wp/r/River.htm" title="River">rivers</a> such as the <!--del_lnk--> Godavari, the <!--del_lnk--> Krishna, the <!--del_lnk--> Kaveri and the <!--del_lnk--> Narmada. This region is mostly semi-arid as it lies on the leeward side of both Ghats. Much of the Deccan is covered by thorn scrub forest scattered with small regions of <!--del_lnk--> deciduous broadleaf forest. Climate ranges from hot summers to mild winters.<p>The <b>Chota Nagpur Plateau</b> is a plateau in eastern India, which covers much of <!--del_lnk--> Jharkhand state as well as adjacent parts of <!--del_lnk--> Orissa, <!--del_lnk--> Bihar, and <!--del_lnk--> Chhattisgarh. The total area of Chota Nagpur Plateau is approximately 65,000&nbsp;km&sup2; (25,000&nbsp;mile&sup2;). The Chota Nagpur Plateau is made up of three smaller plateaus, the Ranchi, Hazaribagh, and Kodarma plateaus. The Ranchi plateau is the largest of the plateaus, with an average elevation of 700&nbsp;m (2,300&nbsp;feet). Much of the plateau is forested, covered by the <!--del_lnk--> Chota Nagpur dry deciduous forests. The plateau is famous for its vast reserves of ores and <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a>.<p>Besides the Great Indian peninsula, the <!--del_lnk--> Kathiawar Peninsula in Gujarat is another large peninsula of India.<p><a id="East_coast" name="East_coast"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">East coast</span></h3>

      <p>India&#39;s wetland ecosystem is widely distributed from the cold and arid; from ones in the <!--del_lnk--> Ladakh region in the state of <!--del_lnk--> Jammu and Kashmir to the ones in the wet and humid climate of peninsula India. Most of the wetlands are directly or indirectly linked to India&#39;s river networks. The Indian government has identified a total of 22 wetlands for conservation. Among the protected wetlands are the tropical mangrove forests in peninsular India and the salt mudflats in western India.<p>Mangrove forests occur all along the Indian coastline, in sheltered estuaries, creeks, backwaters, salt marshes and mud flats. The mangrove area covers a total of 6,740&nbsp;km&sup2; (2,600&nbsp;mile&sup2;) which comprises 7% of the world&#39;s total mangrove cover. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands; the <!--del_lnk--> Sundarbans; <!--del_lnk--> Gulf of Kutch; deltas of the Mahanadi, Godavari and Krishna; and parts of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala have large mangrove covers.<p>Most of the identified wetlands adjoin or are parts of sanctuaries, national parks and are thus protected.<p><a id="The_Sundarbans" name="The_Sundarbans"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Sundarbans</span></h3>

The Bangladeshi and Indian portions of the jungle are listed in the <!--del_lnk--> UNESCO <!--del_lnk--> world heritage list separately as the Sundarbans and <!--del_lnk--> Sundarbans National Park respectively, though they are parts of the same forest. The Sundarbans are intersected by a complex network of <a href="../../wp/t/Tide.htm" title="Tide">tidal</a> waterways, <!--del_lnk--> mudflats and small <!--del_lnk--> islands of salt-tolerant mangrove forests, and presents an excellent example of ongoing <a href="../../wp/e/Ecology.htm" title="Ecology">ecological</a> processes.<p>The area is known for its wide range of fauna.

      <p>The <b>Rann of Kutch</b> is a <!--del_lnk--> marshy region located in the Gujarat state of India, which borders the <!--del_lnk--> Sindh region of Pakistan. The name <i>Rann</i> comes from the <a href="../../wp/h/Hindi.htm" title="Hindi">Hindi</a> word <i>ran</i> meaning &quot;salt marsh.&quot; It occupies a total area of 27,900 km&sup2; (10,800 mile&sup2;).<p>The region was originally a part of the Arabian Sea. Geologic forces, most likely by earthquakes, resulted in the damming up of the region, turning it into a large salt-water <!--del_lnk--> lagoon. This area gradually filled with silt thus turning it into a seasonal salt marsh. During the monsoons, the area turns into a shallow marsh, often flooding to knee-depth height. After the monsoons, the region turns dry and becomes parched.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h2>

      <p>India&#39;s climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert. The Himalayas, along with the <!--del_lnk--> Hindu Kush mountains in Pakistan, provide a barrier to the cold winds from <!--del_lnk--> central Asia. This keeps most of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations in similar latitudes. The Thar Desert is responsible for attracting the moisture laden monsoon winds that provide most of India&#39;s rainfall.<p>It is difficult to generalise India&#39;s climate. India&#39;s huge size sees climatic conditions in Kashmir having little relation to that in the extreme south. In addition to this, the varied topography of the land sees many regions having their own <!--del_lnk--> microclimates. Climate in India ranges from <!--del_lnk--> tropical in the south to a temperate climate in the north. Parts of India in the Himalayas have a <!--del_lnk--> polar climate.<p>Meteorologists divide the year into four main seasons for most of the country: monsoon, summer, winter and withdrawal of the monsoons. Parts of India that lie in the Himalayan region see five seasons: spring, summer, monsoons, autumn and winter. Sustained snowfalls occur only in the elevated sections.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Summer lasts between March and June in most parts of India. Temperatures exceed 40&nbsp;&deg;C (104&nbsp;&deg;F) during the day. The coastal regions exceed 30&nbsp;&deg;C (86&nbsp;&deg;F) coupled with high levels of <!--del_lnk--> humidity. In the Thar desert area temperatures can exceed 45&nbsp;&deg;C (113&nbsp;&deg;F).<p>Summer is followed by the southwest <!--del_lnk--> monsoon rains that provide most of India with its rainfall. The rain-bearing clouds are attracted to the low-pressure system created by the Thar Desert. The official date for the arrival of the monsoon is <!--del_lnk--> 1 June, when the monsoon crosses the Kerala coast. The southwest monsoon splits into two arms, the Bay of Bengal arm and the Arabian Sea arm. The Bay of Bengal arm moves north-wards crossing northeast India in early June. It then progresses eastwards, crossing Delhi by <!--del_lnk--> June 29. The Arabian Sea arm moves north-wards and deposits much of its rain on the windward side of Western Ghats. By early July, most of India receives rain from the monsoons.<p>The monsoons start retreating by August from northern India and by October from Kerala. This short period after the retreat is known as the <b>retreat of the monsoons</b> and is characterised by still weather. By November, winter starts setting in the northern areas.<p>Winters start in November in northern India and late December in southern India. Winters in peninsula India see mild to warm days and cool nights. Further north the temperature is cooler. Temperatures in some parts of the Indian plains sometimes fall below freezing. Most of northern India is plagued by <!--del_lnk--> fog during this season.<p>The highest temperature recoded in India was 50.6&nbsp;&deg;C (123.08&nbsp;&deg;F) in <!--del_lnk--> Alwar in 1955. The lowest was &minus;45&nbsp;&deg;C (&minus;49&nbsp;&deg;F) in Kashmir. Recent claims of temperatures touching 55&nbsp;&deg;C (131&nbsp;&deg;F) in Orissa have been met with some scepticism by the <!--del_lnk--> Indian Meteorological Department, largely on the method of recording of such data.<p><a id="Geology" name="Geology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geology</span></h2>

      <p>India has a varied geology spanning the entire spectrum of the geological time period. India&#39;s geological features are classified based on their era of formation.<p>The Pre-<a href="../../wp/c/Cambrian.htm" title="Cambrian">Cambrian</a> period formations of Cudappah and Vindhyan systems are spread out over the eastern and southern states. A small part of this period is spread over western and central India.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Paleozoic Era formations from the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian system are found in the Western Himalaya region in Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Mesozoic Era <!--del_lnk--> Deccan Traps formation is seen over most of the northern Deccan. Geologists believe that the Deccan Traps were the result of sub-aerial volcanic activity. The Trap soil is black in colour and conducive to agriculture. The Carboniferous system, Permian System, Triassic and Jurassic systems are seen in the western Himalayas. The Jurassic system is also seen in Rajasthan.<p><!--del_lnk--> Tertiary Period imprints are seen in parts of Manipur, Nagaland, parts of Arunachal Pradesh and along the Himalayan belt. The Cretaceous system is seen in central India in the Vindhyas and part of the Indo-Gangetic plains. The Gondowana system is also seen in the Narmada River area in the Vindhyas and Satpuras. The Eocene system is seen in the western Himalayas and Assam. Oligocene formations are seen in Kutch and in Assam.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Pleistocene system is found over central India. It is rich in minerals such as lignite, iron ore, manganese and aluminium. The Andaman and Nicobar Island groups are thought to have been formed in this era by volcanoes.<p>The Himalayas are a result of the convergence and deformation of the Indo-Australian and Eurasian Plates. Their continued convergence raises the height of the Himalayas by 1&nbsp;cm each year.<p><a id="Natural_disasters" name="Natural_disasters"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Natural disasters</span></h2>

      <p>India is prone to several <!--del_lnk--> natural disasters, responsible for huge losses in life and property. Natural disasters in India include droughts; flash floods, as well as widespread and destructive flooding from monsoonal rains; severe cyclones; tsunamis; volcanic eruptions; hurricanes; landslides; avalanche; snowstorms; and earthquakes.<p><a href="../../wp/f/Flood.htm" title="Flood">Floods</a> are the most common natural disaster in India. During the monsoon season, heavy rainfall may cause rivers to distend their banks, often flooding the surrounding areas. The Brahmaputra River is prone to perennial flooding during the monsoon season. Floods are responsible for a number of deaths and property loss in many parts of India. With the exception of a few states, almost all of India is prone to flooding.<p>Indian agriculture is heavily dependent on the monsoon as a source of water. In some parts of India, the failure of the monsoons results in water deficiency in the region causing extensive crop losses. Drought prone regions include south Maharashtra, north Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Gujarat and Rajasthan. In the past, failure of monsoons has led to famines causing great damage.<p>According to <!--del_lnk--> earthquake hazard zoning of India, <a href="../../wp/p/Plate_tectonics.htm" title="Tectonic plate">tectonic plates</a> beneath the earth&#39;s surface are responsible for yearly earthquakes along the Himalayan belt and in northeast India. This region is classified as a Zone V, indicating that it is a very high-risk area. Parts of western India, around the <!--del_lnk--> Kutch region in Gujarat and <!--del_lnk--> Koyna in Maharashtra, are classified as a Zone IV region (high risk). Other areas have a moderate to low risk chance of an earthquake occurring.<p>Cyclones are another natural disaster, affecting thousands living in the coastal regions. Cyclones are severe and bring with them heavy rains that cut off supplies and relief to the affected areas. On <!--del_lnk--> 2004-<!--del_lnk--> 12-26, a <a href="../../wp/t/Tsunami.htm" title="Tsunami">tsunami</a> caused by the <a href="../../wp/2/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake.htm" title="2004 Indian Ocean earthquake">2004 Indian Ocean earthquake</a> struck the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and India&#39;s east coast resulting in the loss of over ten thousand individuals. Until then India was thought to have negligible activity related to tsunamis, though there is historical anecdotal evidence of its occurrence in the past.<p>India has one <!--del_lnk--> active volcano: the <!--del_lnk--> Barren Island volcano which last erupted in May 2005. There is also a <!--del_lnk--> dormant volcano called the <!--del_lnk--> Narcondum and a <!--del_lnk--> Mud volcano at <!--del_lnk--> Baratang. All these volcanoes lie in the <!--del_lnk--> Andaman Islands.<p><!--del_lnk--> Landslides are common in the Lower Himalaya owing to labile rock formations due to the young age of the hills. Parts of the Western Ghats also suffer from low intensity landslides. <a href="../../wp/a/Avalanche.htm" title="Avalanche">Avalanches</a> occur in Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Sikkim.<p>During the summer months, dust storms cause immense property damage in northern India. These storms bring with it large amounts of dust from arid regions. <!--del_lnk--> Hailstones are common in parts of India, and cause severe damage to the standing crops.<p><a id="Natural_resources" name="Natural_resources"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">International agreements</span></h2>
