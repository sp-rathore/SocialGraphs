      <p><b>Great Britain</b> is an island lying off the northwestern coast of mainland <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> and to the east of <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, comprising the main territory of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. Great Britain is also used as a geopolitical term describing the combination of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, and <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a>, which together comprise the entire island and some outlying islands. In everyday speech and non-official writing in all English-speaking and most other countries, &quot;Great Britain&quot;, and simply &quot;Britain&quot;, are much more commonly used than &quot;United Kingdom&quot; to designate the sovereign state officially known as the <i>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</i> (see <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>). In addition, &quot;Great Britain&quot; and/or the abbreviation &quot;GB&quot; (or &quot;GBR&quot;) are officially used for the entire country by the <!--del_lnk--> Universal Postal Union, the International Olympic Committee, NATO, the <!--del_lnk--> International Organization for Standardization, and other organisations. (See also <!--del_lnk--> country codes and <!--del_lnk--> international licence plate codes).<p>The adjective <i>British</i> has come to refer to things associated with the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> generally such as citizenship, and not just the island of Great Britain.<p>

      <p>With an area of 80,800 <!--del_lnk--> square miles (209,000&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km&sup2;) the island of Great Britain is the largest of the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Isles.htm" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>.  It is the largest island in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> eighth largest in the world.  It is the <!--del_lnk--> third most populous island after <!--del_lnk--> Java and <!--del_lnk--> Honsh&#x16B;. <p>Great Britain stretches over approximately ten degrees of <!--del_lnk--> latitude on its longer, north-south axis. Geographically, the island is marked by low, rolling countryside in the east and south, while hills and mountains predominate in the western and northern regions. Before the end of the last <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_age.htm" title="Ice age">ice age</a>, Great Britain was a <!--del_lnk--> peninsula of Europe; the rising sea levels caused by glacial melting at the end of the ice age caused the formation of the <a href="../../wp/e/English_Channel.htm" title="English Channel">English Channel</a>, the body of water which now separates Great Britain from continental Europe at a minimum distance of 21 miles (34 km).<p>The <a href="../../wp/c/Climate.htm" title="Climate">climate</a> of Great Britain is milder than that of other regions of the <!--del_lnk--> Northern Hemisphere at the same latitude, because the warm waters of the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf Stream pass by the British Isles and exert a moderating influence on the weather. Cool, but not cold, temperatures, clouds more often than sun, and abundant rain are the rule in most years.<p><a id="Political_definition" name="Political_definition"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Political definition</span></h2>
      <p>Politically, <i>Great Britain</i> describes the combination of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, and <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a>. It includes outlying islands such as the <a href="../../wp/i/Isle_of_Wight.htm" title="Isle of Wight">Isle of Wight</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Anglesey, the <a href="../../wp/i/Isles_of_Scilly.htm" title="Isles of Scilly">Isles of Scilly</a>, the <a href="../../wp/h/Hebrides.htm" title="Hebrides">Hebrides</a>, and the island groups of <a href="../../wp/o/Orkney.htm" title="Orkney">Orkney</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Shetland.htm" title="Shetland">Shetland</a> but does not include the <a href="../../wp/i/Isle_of_Man.htm" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a> or the <a href="../../wp/c/Channel_Islands.htm" title="Channel Islands">Channel Islands</a>.<p>Over the centuries, Great Britain has evolved politically from several independent countries (England, Scotland, and Wales) through two kingdoms with a shared <!--del_lnk--> monarch (England and Scotland), a single all-island <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Great Britain, to the situation following <!--del_lnk--> 1801, in which Great Britain together with the island of <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> constituted the larger <!--del_lnk--> United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (UK). The UK became the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</a> in the <!--del_lnk--> 1920s (<!--del_lnk--> 1922) following the independence of five-sixths of Ireland as first the <!--del_lnk--> Irish Free State, a <!--del_lnk--> Dominion of the then <!--del_lnk--> British Commonwealth, and then later as an independent republic outside the British Commonwealth as the <a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_Ireland.htm" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p>As recently as 9,000 years ago, Great Britain was not an island at all. The end of the last <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_age.htm" title="Ice age">ice age</a> saw the southeastern part of Great Britain still connected by a strip of low <!--del_lnk--> marshes to the European mainland in what is now northeastern France. In <!--del_lnk--> Cheddar Gorge near <a href="../../wp/b/Bristol.htm" title="Bristol">Bristol</a>, the remains of animals native to mainland Europe such as <a href="../../wp/a/Antelope.htm" title="Antelope">antelopes</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Brown Bears, and <!--del_lnk--> Wild Horses have been found alongside a human skeleton, <!--del_lnk--> Cheddar Man, dated to about 7150 B.C. Thus, animals and humans must have moved between mainland Europe and Great Britain via a crossing. <p><!--del_lnk--> Albion (Alouion in <a href="../../wp/p/Ptolemy.htm" title="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>) is the most ancient name of Great Britain. It sometimes is used to refer to England specifically. Occasionally, it refers to Scotland, or Alba in Gaelic, Albain in Irish, and Yr Alban in Welsh[1]. Pliny the Elder in his Natural History (iv.xvi.102) applies it unequivocally to Great Britain. The origin of the name Britain may be connected with the Brythonic &#39;Prydyn&#39; (Goidelic: Cruithne), a name used to describe some northern inhabitants of the island by Britons or pre-Roman Celts in the south. &quot;It was itself named Albion, while all the islands about which we shall soon briefly speak were called the Britanniae.&quot; The name Albion was taken by medieval writers from Pliny and Ptolemy. For etymology, see <a href="#Nomenclature" title="">below</a>.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The term was used officially for the first time during the reign of <a href="../../wp/j/James_I_of_England.htm" title="James I of England">King James VI of Scotland, I of England</a>. Though England and Scotland each remained legally in existence as separate countries with their own parliaments, on <!--del_lnk--> 20 <!--del_lnk--> October <!--del_lnk--> 1604 King James proclaimed himself as &#39;King of Great Brittaine, France and Ireland&#39;, a title that continued to be used by many of his successors. In <!--del_lnk--> 1707, an <!--del_lnk--> Act of Union joined both parliaments. That Act used two different terms to describe the new all island nation, a &#39;United Kingdom&#39; and the &#39;Kingdom of Great Britain&#39;. However, the former term is regarded by many as having been a <i>description</i> of the union rather than its name at that stage. Most reference books therefore describe the all-island kingdom that existed between <!--del_lnk--> 1707 and <!--del_lnk--> 1800 as the <i>Kingdom of Great Britain.&quot;</i><p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1801, under a new <!--del_lnk--> Act of Union, this kingdom merged with the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Ireland, over which the monarch of Great Britain had ruled. The new kingdom was from then onwards unambiguously called the <!--del_lnk--> United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In <!--del_lnk--> 1922, 26 of Ireland&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> 32 counties were given independence to form a separate <!--del_lnk--> Irish Free State. The remaining truncated kingdom has therefore since then been known as the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</a>.<p><a id="Usage_and_nomenclature" name="Usage_and_nomenclature"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Usage and nomenclature</span></h2>

      <p><i><b>Great Britain</b></i> is an informal name for the political state properly known as the <i><b><a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a></b></i>.<p>This common usage is technically inaccurate as the United Kingdom includes <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, in addition to the three countries that make up Great Britain, as shown by its full name <i>&ldquo;the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&rdquo;</i>, and also because the three countries that make up Great Britain itself collectively include over 100 other islands.<p>The United Kingdom has been assigned the <!--del_lnk--> international foreign vehicle identification code of <b>GB</b>, and the ISO 3166 <!--del_lnk--> geocodes <b><!--del_lnk--> GB</b> and <b><!--del_lnk--> GBR</b>, as abbreviations for <i>&ldquo;the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&rdquo;</i>. The same abbreviation, &#39;GB&#39;, is used informally, for example, in the <a href="../../wp/o/Olympic_Games.htm" title="Olympic Games">Olympic Games</a>, where the United Kingdom team may refer to themselves as &#39;Team GB&#39;.  The <b>UK</b> abbreviation, as used in <!--del_lnk--> Internet domain names, can be confused with <a href="../../wp/u/Ukraine.htm" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>.<p>There is a similar situation with the terms <i><!--del_lnk--> Britain</i> and <i>British</i>, which are used to relate to the whole of the United Kingdom and not just the islands of Great Britain. This usage is generally considered to be correct. Examples of this are &quot;British monarchs&quot;, &quot;British culture&quot; and &quot;British citizens&quot; - which would generally be considered to embrace the whole of the United Kingdom. As if this was not confusion enough, the term &quot;British&quot; also has specific historical and archaeological usage, referring to the Celtic <!--del_lnk--> Brython peoples on the island prior to and during the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Britain.htm" title="Roman Britain">Roman occupation</a>.<p>The designation &#39;<a href="../../wp/b/British_Isles.htm" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>&#39;, usually refers to Great Britain, Ireland, the Isle of Man and all other islands as listed above. The Channel Islands are often not included in this designation, as they are located approximately 12 miles off the coast of northwestern France and are geologically related to mainland France.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> rugby league the <!--del_lnk--> RFL fields its representative side under the name <!--del_lnk--> Great Britain.<p><a id="Nomenclature" name="Nomenclature"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Nomenclature</span></h3>
      <p>The name <i>Britain</i> is derived from the name <i>Britannia</i>, used by the Romans from <i>circa</i> <!--del_lnk--> 55 BC and increasingly used to describe the island which had formerly been known as <i>insula Albionum</i>, the &quot;island of the Albions&quot;. The name <i>Britannia</i> derived from the travel writings of the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">ancient Greek</a> <!--del_lnk--> Pytheas around <!--del_lnk--> 320 BC, which described the British isles, including Ireland, as the &alpha;&iota; &Beta;&rho;&epsilon;&tau;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&iota;&alpha;&iota;, the <i>Brittanic Isles</i>.  The peoples of these islands of <i>Prettanike</i> were called the &Rho;&rho;&epsilon;&tau;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&omicron;&iota;, <i>Priteni</i> or <i>Pretani</i>. These names derived from a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Celtic language&quot; term which is likely to have reached Pytheas from the <!--del_lnk--> Gauls, who may have used it as their term for the inhabitants of the islands.  <i>Priteni</i> is the source of the <!--del_lnk--> Welsh language term <!--del_lnk--> Prydain, <i>Britain</i>, which has the same source as the <!--del_lnk--> Goidelic term <!--del_lnk--> Cruithne used to refer to the early <!--del_lnk--> Brythonic speaking inhabitants of Ireland and the north of <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>. The latter were called <a href="../../wp/p/Picts.htm" title="Picts">Picts</a> or <!--del_lnk--> Caledonians by the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a>. (See <a href="../../wp/b/British_Isles_%2528terminology%2529.htm" title="British Isles (terminology)">British Isles (terminology)</a> for further discussion of etymology).<p><b>Great Britain</b> may well be a translation of the <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a> term <b>Grande Bretagne</b>, which is used in <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> to distinguish Britain from <!--del_lnk--> Brittany (in French: <i>Bretagne</i>), which had been settled in late Roman times by Romano-Celtic troops from <!--del_lnk--> Maximus&#39; army and later by refugees from <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Britain.htm" title="Roman Britain">Roman Britain</a>, who were then under attack by the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxons. Since the English court and aristocracy was largely French-speaking for about two centuries after the <!--del_lnk--> Norman Conquest of <!--del_lnk--> 1066, the French term naturally passed into English usage. The <!--del_lnk--> Normans being descendants of <a href="../../wp/v/Viking.htm" title="Vikings">Vikings</a> who had occupied the area of Normandy for some time demanding land and tithes from Gaul in exchange for peace and no more invasions.<p><a id="Where_is_.27Minor.27_Britain.3F" name="Where_is_.27Minor.27_Britain.3F"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Where is &#39;Minor&#39; Britain?</span></h3>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> Geoffrey of Monmouth&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Historia Regum Britanniae</i> (<i>circa</i> <!--del_lnk--> 1136), the island of Great Britain was referred to as <i>Britannia major</i> (&quot;Greater Britain&quot;), to distinguish it from <i>Britannia minor</i> (&quot;Lesser Britain&quot;), the continental region which approximates to modern <!--del_lnk--> Brittany. The term &quot;Bretayne the grete&quot; was used by chroniclers as early as <!--del_lnk--> 1338, but it was not used officially until <a href="../../wp/j/James_I_of_England.htm" title="James I of England">James I</a> proclaimed himself &quot;King of Great Britain&quot; on <!--del_lnk--> 20 October <!--del_lnk--> 1604 to avoid the more cumbersome title &quot;King of England and Scotland&quot;.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> Irish, <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a> is referred to as <i>An Bhreatain Bheag</i> which means &#39;Little Britain&#39; although the closely related <a href="../../wp/s/Scottish_Gaelic_language.htm" title="Scottish Gaelic language">Scottish Gaelic</a> uses this term - &quot;<i>A&#39;Bhreatainn Bheag</i>&quot; - to refer to <!--del_lnk--> Brittany.<p><i><!--del_lnk--> Little Britain</i> is also the name of a <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a> radio and television sketch show, and the name of a street in the <!--del_lnk--> City of London.<p><a id="Other_lands_of_the_archipelago" name="Other_lands_of_the_archipelago"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Other lands of the archipelago</span></h2>
