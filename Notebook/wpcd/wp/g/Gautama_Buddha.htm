      <p>As few of the details of the Buddha&#39;s life can be independently verified, it is difficult to gauge the historical accuracy of these accounts. The main sources of information on Siddh&#x101;rtha Gautama&#39;s life are the earliest available <!--del_lnk--> Buddhist texts. The following is a summary of those narratives.<p><a id="Conception_and_birth" name="Conception_and_birth"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Conception and birth</span></h3>
      <p>According to <!--del_lnk--> tradition, Siddh&#x101;rtha was born more than 200 years before the reign of the <!--del_lnk--> Maurya king <!--del_lnk--> A&#x15B;oka (lived 304&ndash;232 BCE).<div class="thumb tright">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Siddhartha was born in <!--del_lnk--> Lumbini in modern day <a href="../../wp/n/Nepal.htm" title="Nepal">Nepal</a>. His father was Suddhodan, the chief of the <!--del_lnk--> Shakya nation, one of several ancient tribes on the growing state of <!--del_lnk--> Kosala. His mother was Queen Maya, King Sudhodhana&#39;s wife.<p>The day of the Buddha&#39;s birth is widely celebrated in Buddhist countries as <!--del_lnk--> Vesak Day. Gautama was born a <!--del_lnk--> prince, destined to a luxurious life, with three palaces (one for each season) especially built for him. On the night Gautama was conceived, <!--del_lnk--> M&#x101;y&#x101;dev&#x12B; dreamt that a white elephant entered her right side, and following the dream Siddharta was born from her right side (see image right). Various sources hold that the Buddha&#39;s mother died at his birth, a few days or seven days later. During the <!--del_lnk--> birth celebrations, the <!--del_lnk--> seer <!--del_lnk--> Asita announced that this baby would either become a great king (<!--del_lnk--> chakravartin) or a great <!--del_lnk--> holy man. His father, King &#x15A;uddhodana, wishing for Gautama to be a great king, shielded his son from religious teachings or knowledge of human <!--del_lnk--> suffering.<p>While later tradition and legend characterized &#x15A;uddhodana as a <!--del_lnk--> hereditary <!--del_lnk--> monarch, the <!--del_lnk--> descendant of the Solar Dynasty of <!--del_lnk--> Ik&#x1E63;v&#x101;ku (P&#x101;li: Okk&#x101;ka), many scholars believe that &#x15A;uddhodana was the elected chief of a tribal confederacy.<p>

As the boy reached the age of 16, his father arranged his marriage to <!--del_lnk--> Ya&#x15B;odhar&#x101; (<!--del_lnk--> P&#x101;li: Yasodhar&#x101;), a cousin of the same age. In time, she gave birth to a son, <!--del_lnk--> Rahula. Gautama spent 29 years as a prince in <!--del_lnk--> Kapilavastu, a place now situated in Nepal. Although his father ensured that Gautama was provided with everything he could want or need, Gautama felt that material wealth was not the ultimate goal of life.<p><a id="The_Great_Departure" name="The_Great_Departure"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Great Departure</span></h3>

      <p>While venturing outside of his palace, Gautama is said to have seen an old crippled man (<!--del_lnk--> old age), a <!--del_lnk--> diseased man (<!--del_lnk--> illness), a decaying <!--del_lnk--> corpse (<!--del_lnk--> death), and an <!--del_lnk--> ascetic. These four scenes are referred to as the <!--del_lnk--> four sights, or the four heavenly messengers (<!--del_lnk--> Pali: <i>devaduta</i>). Deeply depressed by these sights, he sought to overcome old age, illness, and death by living the life of an ascetic. Gautama soon left his palace, his possessions, and his entire family at age 29, to take up the lonely life of a wandering <!--del_lnk--> monk.<p>Abandoning his inheritance, he is then said to have dedicated his life to learning how to overcome suffering. He <!--del_lnk--> meditated with two hermits, and, although he achieved high levels of meditative consciousness, he was still not satisfied with his path.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Gautama then chose the robes of a <!--del_lnk--> mendicant <!--del_lnk--> monk and headed to <!--del_lnk--> Magadha in what is today <!--del_lnk--> Bihar in <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>. He began his training in the <!--del_lnk--> ascetic life and practicing vigorous techniques of physical and mental austerity. Gautama proved quite adept at these practices, and surpassed even his teachers.<p>However, he found no answer to his questions regarding freedom from sufferings Leaving behind his caring teachers, he and a small group of close companions set out to take their austerities even further. Gautama tried to find enlightenment through complete deprivation of worldly goods, including food, and became a complete <!--del_lnk--> ascetic. After nearly starving himself to death (some sources claim that he nearly drowned), Gautama began to reconsider his path. Then, he remembered a moment in childhood in which he had been watching his father start the season&#39;s plowing, and he had fallen into a naturally concentrated and focused state that was blissful and refreshing.<p><a id="The_Great_Enlightenment" name="The_Great_Enlightenment"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Great Enlightenment</span></h3>
      <p>After asceticism and concentrating on <!--del_lnk--> meditation or Anapana-sati (awareness of breathing in and out), Gautama is said to have discovered what Buddhists call the <!--del_lnk--> Middle Way&mdash;a path of moderation away from the extremes of <!--del_lnk--> self-indulgence and <!--del_lnk--> self-mortification. He accepted a little rice pudding from a village girl named <!--del_lnk--> Sujata. Then, sitting under a <!--del_lnk--> pipal tree, now known as the <!--del_lnk--> Bodhi tree in <!--del_lnk--> Bodh Gaya, he vowed never to arise until he had found the Truth. At the age of 35, he attained <!--del_lnk--> Enlightenment; according to some traditions, this occurred approximately in May, and according to others in December. Gautama, from then on, was known as &quot;The Perfectly Self-Awakened One&quot;, the <b><!--del_lnk--> Samyaksambuddha</b> (<!--del_lnk--> P&#x101;li: <b>Samm&#x101;sambuddha</b>).<p>At this point, he is believed to have stated that he had realized complete awakening and insight into the nature and cause of human suffering which was ignorance, along with steps necessary to eliminate it. These truths were then categorized into the <!--del_lnk--> Four Noble Truths; the state of supreme liberation&mdash;possible for any being&mdash;was called <!--del_lnk--> Nirvana. He then came to possess the <!--del_lnk--> Nine Characteristics, which are said to belong to every Buddha.<p>According to one of the stories in the <i><!--del_lnk--> &#x100;y&#x101;cana Sutta</i> (Samyutta Nikaya VI.1), a scripture found in the <!--del_lnk--> P&#x101;li and other <!--del_lnk--> canons, immediately after his Enlightenment, the Buddha was wondering whether or not he should teach the <i><!--del_lnk--> Dharma</i> to human beings. He was concerned that, as human beings were overpowered by greed, hatred and delusion, they would not be able to see the true <i>dharma</i>, which was subtle, deep and hard to understand. However, a divine spirit, <!--del_lnk--> Brahm&#x101; Sahampati, interceded and asked that he teach the <i>dharma</i> to the world, as &quot;there will be those who will understand the <i>Dharma</i>&quot;. With his great compassion to all beings in the universe, the Buddha agreed to become a teacher.<div class="thumb tright">

They, together with the Buddha, formed the first <!--del_lnk--> <span class="IAST Unicode" style="font-face: Arial Unicode MS, GNU Unifont, Lucida Sans Unicode; white-space: wrap; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">sa&#x1E45;gha</span>, the company of Buddhist monks, and hence, the first formation of <!--del_lnk--> Triple Gem (Buddha, Dharma and Sangha) was completed.<p>According to tradition, the Buddha emphasized ethics and correct understanding. He questioned the average person&#39;s notions of divinity and salvation. He stated that there is no intermediary between mankind and the <!--del_lnk--> divine; distant gods are subjected to <!--del_lnk--> karma themselves in decaying heavens; and the Buddha is solely a guide and teacher for the sentient beings who must tread the path of <!--del_lnk--> Nirv&#x101;&#x1E47;a (<!--del_lnk--> P&#x101;li: Nibb&#x101;na) themselves to attain the spiritual awakening called <i><!--del_lnk--> bodhi</i> and see truth and reality as it is. The Buddhist system of insight, thought, and <!--del_lnk--> meditation practice is not believed to have been revealed divinely, but by the understanding of the true nature of the mind, which could be discovered by anybody.<p>For the remaining 45 years of his life, the Buddha is said to have traveled in the <!--del_lnk--> Gangetic Plain of Northeastern <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> and Southern <a href="../../wp/n/Nepal.htm" title="Nepal">Nepal</a>, teaching his doctrine and discipline to an extremely diverse range of people&mdash; from nobles to <!--del_lnk--> outcaste street sweepers, including many adherents of rival philosophies and religions. The Buddha founded the community of Buddhist monks and nuns (the <i><!--del_lnk--> Sangha</i>) to continue the dispensation after his <b><!--del_lnk--> Parinirv&#x101;na</b> (<!--del_lnk--> P&#x101;li: Parinibb&#x101;na) or &quot;complete Nirv&#x101;na&quot;, and made thousands of converts. His religion was open to all races and classes and had no <!--del_lnk--> caste structure. On the other hand, Buddhist texts record that he was reluctant to ordain women as nuns: he eventually accepted them on the grounds that their capacity for enlightenment was equal to that of men (and the <!--del_lnk--> Lotus Sutra, in Chapter 12, contains a description of the dragon king&#39;s daughter attaining enlightenment in her present body), but he gave them certain additional rules (<a href="../../wp/v/Vinaya.htm" title="Vinaya">Vinaya</a>) to follow.<p><a id="The_Great_Passing" name="The_Great_Passing"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Great Passing</span></h3>

      <p>According to the <!--del_lnk--> Mahaparinibbana Sutta of the Pali canon, at the age of 80, the Buddha announced that he would soon enter <!--del_lnk--> Parinirvana or the final deathless state abandoning the earthly body. After this, the Buddha ate his last meal, which, according to different translations, was either a mushroom delicacy or soft pork, which he had received as an offering from a blacksmith named <!--del_lnk--> Cunda. Falling violently ill, Buddha instructed his attendant <!--del_lnk--> &#x100;nanda to convince <!--del_lnk--> Cunda that the meal eaten at his place had nothing to do with his passing and that his meal would be a source of the greatest merit as it provided the much-needed energy for the Buddha.<p>Ananda protested Buddha&#39;s decision to enter Parinirvana in the abandoned jungles of <!--del_lnk--> Ku&#x15B;in&#x101;ra (P&#x101;li: Kusin&#x101;ra) of the <!--del_lnk--> Mallas.

      <p>Buddha then asked all the attendant <!--del_lnk--> Bhikshus to clarify any doubts or questions they had. They had none. He then finally entered Parinivana. The Buddha&#39;s final words were, &quot;All composite things pass away. Strive for your own salvation with diligence.&quot; The Buddha&#39;s body was cremated and the <!--del_lnk--> relics were placed in monuments or <!--del_lnk--> stupas, some of which are believed to have survived until the present.

According to one Mahayana record in Chinese (&#x5341;&#x516B;&#x90E8;&#x8AD6; and &#x90E8;&#x57F7;&#x7570;&#x8AD6;), the coronation of A&#x15B;oka is 116 years after the death of Buddha. Therefore, the time of Buddha&#39;s passing is either 486 BCE according to Therav&#x101;da record or 383 BCE according to Mahayana record. However, the actual date traditionally accepted as the date of the Buddha&#39;s death in Therav&#x101;da countries is 544 or 543 BCE, because the reign of A&#x15B;oka was traditionally reckoned to be about 60 years earlier than current estimates (based on A&#x15B;oka&#39;s own inscriptions, and therefore among the soundest dates in early Indian history).<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Buddha is perhaps one of the few sages for whom we have mention of his rather impressive physical characteristics. He was at least six feet tall and had a strong enough body to be noticed by one of the kings and was asked to join his army as a general. He is also believed by Buddhists to have &quot;<!--del_lnk--> the 32 Signs of the Great Man&quot;.<p>Although the Buddha was not represented in human form until around the <!--del_lnk--> 1st century CE (see <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhist_art.htm" title="Buddhist art">Buddhist art</a>), his physical characteristics are described in one of the central texts of the traditional <!--del_lnk--> Pali canon, the <!--del_lnk--> Digha Nikaya. They help define the global aspect of the historical Buddha, his physical appearance is described by Prince Siddhartha&#39;s wife to his son <!--del_lnk--> Rahula upon Buddha&#39;s return in the scripture of the &quot;Lion of Men&quot;:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>Interpretations may vary, and the reliability of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Sutras</i> may be questioned. The description above is indicative of a typically <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Aryan body type.

While there is disagreement amongst various <!--del_lnk--> Buddhist sects over more esoteric aspects of Buddha&#39;s teachings and over <a href="../../wp/v/Vinaya.htm" title="Vinaya">disciplinary rules</a> for monks, there is generally agreement over these points:<ul>
       <li>The <!--del_lnk--> Four Noble Truths: that suffering is an inherent part of existence; that the origin of suffering is ignorance and the main symptoms of that ignorance are attachment and craving; that attachment and craving can be ceased; and that following the <!--del_lnk--> Noble Eightfold Path will lead to the cessation of attachment and craving and therefore suffering.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Noble Eightfold Path: right understanding, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.<li>The concept of <!--del_lnk--> dependent origination: that any phenomenon &#39;exists&#39; only because of the &lsquo;existence&rsquo; of other phenomena in a complex web of cause and effect covering time past, present and future. Because all things are thus conditioned and transient (<!--del_lnk--> anicca), they have no real independent identity (<!--del_lnk--> anatta).<li>Rejection of the <!--del_lnk--> infallibility of accepted <!--del_lnk--> scripture: Teachings should not be accepted unless they are borne out by our experience and are praised by the wise. See the <i><!--del_lnk--> Kalama Sutta</i> for details.<li><b><!--del_lnk--> Anicca</b> (Sanskrit: <b>anitya</b>): That all things are impermanent.<li><b><!--del_lnk--> Anatta</b> (Sanskrit: <b>an&#x101;tman</b>): That the perception of a constant &quot;<!--del_lnk--> self&quot; is an illusion.<li><b><!--del_lnk--> Dukkha</b> (Sanskrit: <b>du&#x1E25;kha</b>): That all beings suffer from all situations due to unclear mind.</ul>

      <p>It is unknown what language the Buddha spoke, and no conclusive documentation has been made at this point.

      <p>Buddhism is a <!--del_lnk--> dharmic religion. The systems of Buddhism and Hinduism must not be considered to be either contradictory to one another or completely self contained. Coomaraswamy wrote:<dl>

      <p>Buddhist scholar Rahula Vipola wrote that the Buddha was trying to shed the true meaning of the Vedas. Buddha is said to be a knower of the Veda (vedaj&ntilde;a) or of the Vedanta (ved&acirc;ntaj&ntilde;a) <i>(Sa.myutta, i. 168) and (Sutta Nip&acirc;ta, 463).</i><p>Hinduism and Buddhism share many common features including <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>, <!--del_lnk--> yoga, <!--del_lnk--> karma and <!--del_lnk--> dharma.

      <p>The arrival of Buddhism caused <a href="../../wp/t/Taoism.htm" title="Taoism">Taoism</a> to renew and restructure itself and address existential questions raised by Buddhism. Buddhism was seen as a kind of foreign Taoism and its scriptures were translated into Chinese with Taoist vocabulary. <!--del_lnk--> Chan (<!--del_lnk--> Seon, <!--del_lnk--> Thien, or <!--del_lnk--> Zen) Buddhism in particular holds many beliefs in common with philosophical Taoism. Some early Chinese Taoist-Buddhists thought <a href="../../wp/b/Buddha.htm" title="Buddha">Buddha</a> to be a reincarnation of <!--del_lnk--> Lao Tzu born in the land of barbarians. <p>Buddhism shares many commonalities with <b><!--del_lnk--> Neo-Confucianism</b> , which is Confucianism with more religious elements. In fact, the ritual of ancestor worship normally practiced by Confucianists, has been adapted to Chinese Buddhist beliefs.<p>In the <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japanese</a> religion of <a href="../../wp/s/Shinto.htm" title="Shinto">Shinto</a>, the long coexistence of Buddhism and Shintoism resulted in the merging of Shintoism and Buddhism. Gods in Shintoism were given a position similar to the Hindu gods in Buddhism. Moreover, because one of Mahayana Buddha&#39;s (Dainichi Nyorai) symbols was the sun, many equated Amaterasu, the Sun Goddess, as the previous reincarnation (bodhisattva) of Dainichi Nyorai. However, the Tokugawa Shogunate era saw a revival movement within Shinto. Some Shinto scholars started to argue that Buddhas were previous incarnations of Shinto gods, thus turning the position of Shintoism and Buddhism upside down. Shinto and Buddhism were officially separated after the <!--del_lnk--> Meiji Restoration.<p><a id="Islam" name="Islam"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Islam</span></h3>

      <p>The Buddhist monastic class flowed into what came to be called Islamic monasticism &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> Sufism &mdash; which has given many poets and scientists to both Islam and the world.
