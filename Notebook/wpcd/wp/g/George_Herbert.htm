      <p><b>George Herbert</b> (<!--del_lnk--> April 3, <!--del_lnk--> 1593 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> March 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1633) was a <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Welsh</a> <!--del_lnk--> poet, <!--del_lnk--> orator and a <!--del_lnk--> priest. Being born into an artistic and wealthy family, he received a good education which led on to him holding prominent positions at <a href="../../wp/u/University_of_Cambridge.htm" title="University of Cambridge">Cambridge University</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">Parliament</a>. In his late thirties he gave up his secular ambitions and took <!--del_lnk--> holy orders in the <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_England.htm" title="Church of England">Church of England</a>, spending the rest of his life as a <!--del_lnk--> rector in <!--del_lnk--> Bemerton, near <!--del_lnk--> Salisbury. Throughout his life he wrote religious poems characterized by a precision of language, a metrical versatility, and an ingenious use of imagery or conceits that was favored by the metaphysical school of poets. He is commemorated on February 27 throughout the <a href="../../wp/a/Anglican_Communion.htm" title="Anglican Communion">Anglican Communion</a> and on March 1 of the <!--del_lnk--> Calendar of Saints of the <!--del_lnk--> Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p><a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
      <p>Herbert was born in <!--del_lnk--> Montgomery in <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a>. His family was wealthy, eminent, intellectual and fond of the arts. His mother Magdalen was a patron and friend of <!--del_lnk--> John Donne and other poets; his older brother <!--del_lnk--> Edward, later Lord Herbert of Cherbury, was an important poet and philosopher, often referred to as &quot;the father of English <!--del_lnk--> deism&quot;. Herbert&#39;s father died when George was three, leaving a widow and ten children.<p>After graduating from <!--del_lnk--> Westminster School and <a href="../../wp/t/Trinity_College%252C_Cambridge.htm" title="Trinity College, Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a> (where he achieved degrees with distinction), Herbert was elected a major fellow of his college. In 1618 he was appointed Reader in <!--del_lnk--> Rhetoric at <a href="../../wp/u/University_of_Cambridge.htm" title="University of Cambridge">Cambridge</a> and in 1620 he was elected to the post of &quot;public orator&quot;, whose duties would be served by poetic skill. He held this position until 1628.<p>In 1624 he became a <!--del_lnk--> Member of Parliament, representing <!--del_lnk--> Montgomeryshire. While these positions were suited to a career at court, and <a href="../../wp/j/James_I_of_England.htm" title="James I of England">James I</a> had shown him favour, circumstances worked against him: the King died in 1625, and two influential patrons of Herbert died later in the decade.<p><a id="Priesthood" name="Priesthood"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Priesthood</span></h2>
      <p>He took up his duties in <!--del_lnk--> Bemerton, a rural parish in <!--del_lnk--> Wiltshire, about 75 miles southwest of London in 1630. Here he preached and wrote poetry; also helping to rebuild the church out of his own funds.<p>In 1633 Herbert finished a collection of poems entitled <i>The Temple: Sacred Poems and Private Ejaculations</i>, which imitates the architectural style of churches through both the meaning of the words and their visual layout. The themes of <a href="../../wp/g/God.htm" title="God">God</a> and <a href="../../wp/l/Love.htm" title="Love">love</a> are treated by Herbert as much as <a href="../../wp/p/Psychology.htm" title="Psychology">psychological</a> forces as <!--del_lnk--> metaphysical <!--del_lnk--> phenomena.<p>Suffering from poor health, Herbert died of <a href="../../wp/t/Tuberculosis.htm" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> only three years after taking holy orders. On his deathbed, he gave the manuscript of <i>The Temple</i> to <!--del_lnk--> Nicholas Ferrar, the founder of a semi-monastic Anglican religious community at <!--del_lnk--> Little Gidding (a name best known today through the poem <i><!--del_lnk--> Little Gidding</i> by <!--del_lnk--> T.S. Eliot), telling him to publish the poems if he thought they might &quot;turn to the advantage of any dejected poor soul&quot;, and otherwise, to burn them. In less than 50 years, <i>The Temple: Sacred Poems and Private Ejaculations</i> had gone through thirteen printings.<p><a id="Works" name="Works"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Works</span></h2>
      <p>All of Herbert&#39;s surviving poems are <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religious</a>, and some have been used as <!--del_lnk--> hymns. They are characterised by directness of expression and some <!--del_lnk--> conceits which can appear quaint. Many of the poems have intricate rhyme schemes, and variations of lines within stanzas.<p>Herbert also wrote <i>A Priest to the Temple</i> (or <i>The Country Parson</i>) offering practical advice to country parsons. In it, he advises that &quot;things of ordinary use&quot; such as ploughs, leaven, or dances, could be made to &quot;serve for lights even of Heavenly Truths&quot;.<p>His <i>Jacula Prudentium,</i> (sometimes seen as <i>Jacula Prudentum</i>), a collection of pithy proverbs published in 1651, included many sayings still repeated today, for example &quot;His bark is worse than his bite.&quot;<p><!--del_lnk--> Richard Baxter said, &quot;Herbert speaks to God like one that really believeth a God, and whose business in the world is most with God. Heart-work and heaven-work make up his books&quot;. Dame <!--del_lnk--> Helen Gardner adds &quot;head-work&quot; because of his &quot;intellectual vivacity&quot;.<p>Herbert influenced his fellow <!--del_lnk--> metaphysical poet <!--del_lnk--> Henry Vaughan who, in turn, influenced <!--del_lnk--> William Wordsworth.<p>George Herbert&#39;s poetry has been set to music by several composers, including <!--del_lnk--> Ralph Vaughan Williams, <!--del_lnk--> Lennox Berkeley, <!--del_lnk--> Judith Weir, <!--del_lnk--> Randall Thompson, <!--del_lnk--> William Walton and <!--del_lnk--> Patrick Larley.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Herbert&quot;</div>
