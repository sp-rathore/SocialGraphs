The City of Glasgow is also the most populous <!--del_lnk--> unitary authority area. It is situated on the <!--del_lnk--> River Clyde in the country&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> west central lowlands. People from Glasgow are known as <b>Glaswegians</b>. Glaswegian is also the name of the local <!--del_lnk--> dialect of <a href="../../wp/s/Scots_language.htm" title="Scots language">Scots</a>, which is popularly referred to as &quot;the <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow Patter&quot;.<p>The city was formerly a <!--del_lnk--> royal burgh, and was known as the <i>&quot;<!--del_lnk--> Second City of the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>&quot;</i> in the <!--del_lnk--> Victorian era. It established itself as a major <!--del_lnk--> transatlantic trading port during the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>. The Clyde was the world&#39;s pre-eminent <!--del_lnk--> shipbuilding centre, building many revolutionary and famous vessels such as the <!--del_lnk--> Cunard liners <!--del_lnk--> RMS <i><!--del_lnk--> Lusitania</i>, RMS <i><!--del_lnk--> Aquitania</i>, RMS <i><!--del_lnk--> Queen Mary</i>, RMS <i><!--del_lnk--> Queen Elizabeth</i>, RMS <i><!--del_lnk--> Queen Elizabeth 2</i>, and the Royal Yacht <i><!--del_lnk--> Britannia</i>.<p>The city grew in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to a population of over one million people, peaking at 1,088,000 in 1931. However, with population decline, due to both the large scale relocation of people to <!--del_lnk--> new towns like <!--del_lnk--> East Kilbride and <!--del_lnk--> Cumbernauld on the outskirts of the city, and successive boundary changes by the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Office and UK governments, the current population of the City of Glasgow itself is 585,090 and 1,168,270 in the urban areas surrounding the city, based on the 2001 census. Around 2,300,000 people live in the <!--del_lnk--> Greater Glasgow conurbation, defined as the City of Glasgow and the surrounding region.<p>Glasgow is the third most popular foreign tourist destination in the UK after <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Edinburgh.htm" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>. The city also has Scotland&#39;s largest and most economically important commerce and retail sector. Glasgow is also one of Europe&#39;s top 16 financial centres and is home to many of the country&#39;s leading businesses.<p>

      <p>It is common to derive the name <i>Glasgow</i> from the older <!--del_lnk--> Brythonic <i>glas cau</i> or a <!--del_lnk--> Middle Gaelic cognate, which would have meant <i>green hollow</i>. The settlement probably had an earlier Cumbric name, <i>Cathures</i>; the modern name appears for the first time in the Gaelic period (1116), as <i>Glasgu</i>. However, it is also recorded that the <!--del_lnk--> King of Strathclyde, Rhydderch Hael, welcomed <!--del_lnk--> Saint Mungo (also known as Saint Kentigern), and procured his consecration as bishop, which took place about 540. For some thirteen years Kentigern laboured in the region, building his church at the <!--del_lnk--> Molendinar Burn, and making many converts. A large community developed around him and became known as <i>Glasgu</i> (meaning the <i>dear family</i>). The confusion between the terms is not wholly resolved (<i>Dear Family</i> vs. <i>Dear Green Place</i> vs. <i>Green Hollow</i>).<p><i>Dear Green Place</i> (<i>Glaschu</i>) is often misquoted as a Gaelic translation for the city, but this was actually <!--del_lnk--> Daniel Defoe&#39;s description of the city when he visited in the early 18th century; he also claimed that Glasgow was &quot;the paradise of Scotland and one of the cleanliest and best built cities in Britain.&quot; Another writer of the time said of the River Clyde: &quot;I have never seen before any river which for natural beauty can stand competition with the Clyde. Never did a stream glide more gracefully to the ocean or through a fairer region.&quot; At that time, the city&#39;s population numbered approximately 12,000, and its structures largely consisted of compact wooden buildings, none of which remain today.<p><a id="Heraldry" name="Heraldry"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Heraldry</span></h2>
      <p>Glasgow&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Coat of Arms dates back to 1866 when the <!--del_lnk--> Lord Lyon first granted the city its patent. The Coat of Arms commemorates Glasgow&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> patron saint, Mungo, and includes four emblems &mdash; a bird, a tree, a bell, and a <!--del_lnk--> salmon with a ring in its mouth. The emblems represent <!--del_lnk--> miracles supposed to have been performed by Mungo and are listed in the following traditional rhyme:<dl>
       <dd>
        <dl>
         <dd>
          <dl>
           <dd>
            <dl>
             <dd><i>Here&#39;s the bird that never flew</i><dd><i>Here&#39;s the tree that never grew</i><dd><i>Here&#39;s the bell that never rang</i><dd><i>Here&#39;s the fish that never swam</i></dl>
          </dl>
        </dl>
      </dl>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> supporters are two salmon bearing rings, and the shield bearing the four motifs is surmounted by a castle (or sometimes a <!--del_lnk--> helm) above which is St Mungo himself.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> motto of the city, taken from a sermon preached by Mungo, is <i>Let Glasgow Flourish</i>, a shortened version of <i>Lord, Let Glasgow flourish by the preaching of the word and the praising of thy name</i>. The motto was more recently commemorated in a song called &quot;Mother Glasgow&quot;, written by Dundonian songwriter Michael Marra, and popularised by <!--del_lnk--> Hue and Cry.<br clear="right" />

      <p>Glasgow weather is typical of <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> weather and often unpredictable.<p>The summer months (May to September) are often mild but unpredictable. The winds are generally westerly, due to the warm <!--del_lnk--> Gulf Stream. The warmest month is usually July, averaging 19&deg;C (66.2&deg;F). However, temperature can change suddenly, and is normally a few degrees colder than southern <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>. Mornings may be damp and misty, or <i>dreich</i> (a Scottish term for damp and drizzly), but become sunny and warm by afternoon.<p>Though there are some rainy and windy days, spring (March to May) is fairly mild. Many of Glasgow&#39;s trees begin to flower at this time of the year and the parks and gardens are filled with spring colour.<p>Winters can be damp with few sunny days; however the Gulf Stream ensures that Glasgow stays warmer than other cities at the same latitude. Winds can be chilling and cold, though severe snowfalls are infrequent and do not last. December, January and February are the wettest months of the year, but can occasionally be sunny and clear.<p><a id="Temperature" name="Temperature"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Temperature</span></h3>

      <p>The actual city council area of Glasgow peaked in population the 1930s with a population of 1,088,000 people and for over 50 years was over 1.3 million people. However, after the peak of the 1930s the population declined, due to relocation to the &#39;new towns&#39; in clearings of the poverty-stricken inner city areas like the <!--del_lnk--> Gorbals. Glasgow was during this period of its history one of the most densely populated cities in the world. In addition, successive boundary changes reduced the official city boundaries (and hence official population) making direct comparisons difficult as the city continues to expand beyond the official city council boundaries into surrounding suburban areas, emcompassing nearly 400 square miles if all adjoining suburbs, commuter towns and villages are included.<p>There are two distinct definitions for the population of Glasgow; the <b>Glasgow City Council Area</b> (which lost the district of <!--del_lnk--> Rutherglen to <!--del_lnk--> South Lanarkshire and the <b>Greater Glasgow Urban Area</b> which includes the urban cornubation around the city.<table class="wikitable">

      <p><i>Source</i><p>Since the 2001 census the population decline has stabilised and the population of both the City of Glasgow council area and Greater Glasgow are forecast to grow in the near future (the 2004 population of the City of Glasgow council area was 585,090). However when all suburbs and other towns forming the conurbation in the Glasgow area are included the population almost doubles in number.<p>Compared to <!--del_lnk--> Inner London (22,438 people per sq mile), Scotland&#39;s major city has less than half the current population density of the English capital (8,528). However, in 1931 the population density was 16,011, highlighting the &#39;clearances&#39; of the inner city to the suburbs and new towns that were built to empty one of Europe&#39;s most densely populated cities.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>The area of Glasgow has long been used for settlement due to the River Clyde providing a natural area for fishing. Glasgow became important in the 12th century as the site of a bishopric, reorganized by King <!--del_lnk--> David I of Scotland and <!--del_lnk--> John, <!--del_lnk--> Bishop of Glasgow. There had been an earlier religious site the exact age of which is unknown. According to doubtful hagiographical tradition, this ecclesiatical site had been established by <!--del_lnk--> Saint Kentigern. The bishopric became one of the largest and wealthiest in the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Scotland, bringing wealth and status to the town. Somewhere between 1175 and 1178 this position was strengthened even further when <a href="../../wp/j/Jocelin.htm" title="Jocelin">Bishop Jocelin</a> obtained for the episcopal settlement the status of <!--del_lnk--> burgh from King <!--del_lnk--> William the Lion, allowing the settlement to expand with the benefits of trading monopolies and other legal guarantees. Sometime between 1189 and 1195 this status was supplemented by an annual fair, which survives to this day as the <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow Fair.<p>Glasgow grew over the following centuries, and the founding of the <!--del_lnk--> University of Glasgow in 1451 and elevation of the bishopric to an archbishopric in 1492 increasing the town&#39;s religious and educational status. In the 16th century Glasgow became prominent in international trading as a hub of trade to the Americas, especially in the movement of <!--del_lnk--> tobacco, <a href="../../wp/c/Cotton.htm" title="Cotton">cotton</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Sugar.htm" title="Sugar">sugar</a>. The industries of Scotland produced <!--del_lnk--> textiles, <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Steel.htm" title="Steel">steel</a>, which were exported. <!--del_lnk--> Shipbuilding became a major industry on the Clyde, building many famous ships. By the end of the 19th century the city was known as the <i>&quot;Second City of the Empire&quot;</i> and was producing most of the ships and <!--del_lnk--> locomotives in the world. During this period, the construction of many of the city&#39;s greatest architectural masterpieces and most ambitious civic projects were being funded by its wealth.<p>The 20th century showed a great decline in the city&#39;s fortunes, especially with the effects of two <!--del_lnk--> World Wars and the <!--del_lnk--> Great Depression. The city&#39;s industries became uncompetitive, leading to high unemployment, urban decay and poor health for the city&#39;s inhabitants. At the end of the <!--del_lnk--> Second World War there were active attempts at regeneration of the city, when the Glasgow Corporation published its <i><!--del_lnk--> Bruce Report</i> which set out a comprehensive series of initiatives aimed at turning round the decline of the city.<p>By the end of the century there had been a significant resurgence in Glasgow&#39;s economic fortunes, finding a new role as a European centre for business and finance, as well an increase in tourism. The latter due to the legacy of the city&#39;s status as <!--del_lnk--> European City of Culture in 1990, and the product of its thriving artistic community. The ongoing <!--del_lnk--> regeneration of inner-city areas has led to people moving back to live in the centre of Glasgow, although some areas of the city remain amongst the most deprived in the UK.<p><a id="Districts" name="Districts"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Districts</span></h2>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> city centre is bounded by the High Street to the east, the <!--del_lnk--> River Clyde to the south and the <!--del_lnk--> M8 motorway to the west and north which was built through the Charing Cross and Anderston areas in the 1960s.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The City Centre is based on a <!--del_lnk--> grid system of streets, similar to that of <a href="../../wp/b/Barcelona.htm" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> or an American city, on the north bank of the River Clyde. The heart of the city is <!--del_lnk--> George Square, site of many of <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow&#39;s public statues and the elaborate Victorian <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow City Chambers, headquarters of <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow City Council. To the south and west are the shopping precincts of Argyle, Sauchiehall and <!--del_lnk--> Buchanan Streets. The main shopping malls are <!--del_lnk--> Buchanan Galleries and the <!--del_lnk--> St Enoch Centre, as well as the more specialised, designer malls; Princes&#39; Square and the Italian Centre. The London-based department stores, <!--del_lnk--> Selfridges and <!--del_lnk--> Harvey Nichols are planning to open in the city, further strengthening Glasgow&#39;s already impressive retail portfolio, which forms the UK&#39;s largest and most economically important commerce and retail sector after London&#39;s West End. The layout of the approximately two and a half mile long retail district of Buchanan Street, Sauchiehall Street and Argyle Street has been termed the &quot;Golden Z&quot;. In October 2005 retail locations in the area were sought after to the extent that Buchanan Street had the 7th highest shop rental fees in the world.<p>The city centre is home to most of Glasgow&#39;s main cultural venues: <!--del_lnk--> The Theatre Royal (home of <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Opera and <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Ballet), <!--del_lnk--> The Pavilion, The King&#39;s Theatre, <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, Glasgow Film Theatre, <!--del_lnk--> RSAMD, <!--del_lnk--> GoMA, <!--del_lnk--> Mitchell Library, the Centre for Contemporary Arts, <!--del_lnk--> McLellan Galleries and <!--del_lnk--> The Lighthouse Museum of Architecture, Design and the City. The world&#39;s tallest cinema, the 18 screen <!--del_lnk--> Cineworld is sited on Renfrew Street. The city centre is also home to two of Glasgow&#39;s three universities: <!--del_lnk--> Strathclyde and <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow Caledonian University.<p>

      <p>To the east is the commercial and residential district of <!--del_lnk--> Merchant City, which was formerly the residential district of the wealthy City Merchants in the 18th and early 19th centuries. As the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> and the wealth it brought to the city resulted in the expansion of Glasgow&#39;s central area westward, the original medieval centre was left behind. This area, commonly known as &quot;Old Glasgow&quot; takes in the eastern fringes of the Merchant City and some of the East End. Glasgow Cross, situated at the junction of <!--del_lnk--> High Street, Gallowgate, <!--del_lnk--> Trongate and Saltmarket was the original centre of the city. In the Cross sits the Tolbooth clock tower; all that remains of the original City Chambers, which was destroyed by fire in 1926. Moving northward up High Street towards <!--del_lnk--> Rottenrow and <!--del_lnk--> Townhead lies the 15th Century <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow Cathedral and the <!--del_lnk--> Provand&#39;s Lordship. Latterly, due to growing industrial pollution levels in the mid to late 19th century, the area fell out of favour with residents, who mostly moved to the newly developed West End and South Side districts.<p>From the late 1980s onwards, the area has been rejuvenated with luxury city centre apartments and warehouse conversions. Many new cafes and restaurants have opened. The area also contains the old Tolbooth, The Tron Theatre, The Old Fruitmarket, The Trades Hall, and the <!--del_lnk--> City Halls.<p>The area is also home to Glasgow&#39;s growing &#39;Arts Quarter&#39;, based around the Saltmarket and <!--del_lnk--> Trongate, and at the heart of the annual Merchant City Festival.<p>A large part of Glasgow&#39;s gay scene is located within the Merchant City area. This includes Polo Lounge, MODA, Delmonicas and Clone Zone.<p>Recently the city council defined (and perhaps expanded) the area known as Merchant City as far West as <!--del_lnk--> Buchanan Street, marking these boundaries with new, highly stylised metal signage.<p><a id="Financial_district" name="Financial_district"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Financial district</span></h4>
      <p>To the western edge of the city centre, occupying the areas of <!--del_lnk--> Blythswood Hill and <!--del_lnk--> Anderston, and along the Broomielaw, lies Glasgow&#39;s financial district, known as the &quot;square kilometre&quot; or more officially the <!--del_lnk--> International Financial Services District (IFSD). Since the late 1980&#39;s the ISFD has grown to become the third largest financial centre in the UK after the <!--del_lnk--> The City of London and Edinburgh. With a reputation as an established financial services centre, coupled with comprehensive support services, Glasgow continues to attract and grow new business. Of the 10 largest general insurance companies in the UK, 8 have a base or Head office in Glasgow - including <!--del_lnk--> Direct Line, <!--del_lnk--> AXA and <!--del_lnk--> Norwich Union. Key banking sector companies have also relocated to commercial property in Glasgow - <a href="../../wp/a/Abbey.htm" title="Abbey">Abbey</a>, <!--del_lnk--> HBOS, <!--del_lnk--> National Australia Bank and the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Bank of Scotland.<p>Since the late 1980s, this area of the city centre has seen the construction of many ultra-modern office blocks, a trend which continues into the 21st century with a new wave of high rise developments currently on the drawing board.<p><a id="The_West_End" name="The_West_End"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The West End</span></h3>

      <p>Glasgow&#39;s West End refers to the <!--del_lnk--> bohemian district of caf&eacute;s, bars, boutique&#39;s, upmarket hotels, clubs and restaurants in the hinterland of <!--del_lnk--> Kelvingrove Park. The west End&#39;s main thouroughfare is <!--del_lnk--> Byres Road and one of the star attractions is known as <!--del_lnk--> Ashton Lane. The west end has many diferent districts within it like, the <!--del_lnk--> University of Glasgow, <!--del_lnk--> BBC Scotland&#39;s Headquarters, <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow Botanic Gardens and the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre. The district is home to some of the wealthiest addresses in the country. The West End includes the upmarket residential areas of <!--del_lnk--> Hillhead, <!--del_lnk--> Dowanhill, <!--del_lnk--> Kelvingrove, <!--del_lnk--> Kelvinside, <!--del_lnk--> Hyndland and <!--del_lnk--> Jordanhill, the commercial and social area around <!--del_lnk--> Byres Rd and, to a lesser extent, <!--del_lnk--> Partick (a more working class area). However the name is now being used to mean anywhere to the west of <!--del_lnk--> Charing Cross. This includes areas like <!--del_lnk--> Kelvinbridge, <!--del_lnk--> Kelvindale and <!--del_lnk--> Anniesland. The spire of Sir <!--del_lnk--> George Gilbert Scott&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow University main building (the second largest <!--del_lnk--> Gothic Revival building in Britain) is a major local landmark, and can be seen for miles around, sitting atop Gilmorehill. The University itself is the fourth oldest in the English-speaking world, after <!--del_lnk--> Oxford, <a href="../../wp/u/University_of_Cambridge.htm" title="University of Cambridge">Cambridge</a> and <!--del_lnk--> St. Andrews. Much of the city&#39;s student population is based in the West End, adding to its cultural vibrancy.<p>The area is also home to the <!--del_lnk--> Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, <!--del_lnk--> Hunterian Museum, <!--del_lnk--> Kelvin Hall International Sports Arena, Henry Wood Hall (home of the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Scottish National Orchestra) and the <!--del_lnk--> Museum of Transport, which is to be rebuilt on an old dockland site at Glasgow Harbour to a design by <!--del_lnk--> Zaha Hadid. The <!--del_lnk--> West End Festival, one of Glasgow&#39;s biggest festivals, is held annually in June.<p>Glasgow is Europe&#39;s fastest growing conference and events destination, and the <!--del_lnk--> SECC is the UK&#39;s largest exhibition and conference centre. A major expansion of the SECC facilities at the former Queens Dock by <!--del_lnk--> Foster and Partners is currently planned, including a 12,000 seat arena, and a 5 star hotel and entertainments complex.<p>The area is served by bus, rail and the <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow Subway.<p><a id="The_East_End" name="The_East_End"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The East End</span></h3>

      <p>The East End is home to the famous <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow Barrowland market, popularly known as &#39;The Barras&#39;, and <!--del_lnk--> Barrowland Ballroom music hall, <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow Green, and <a href="../../wp/c/Celtic_Park.htm" title="Celtic Park">Celtic Park</a>, home of <a href="../../wp/c/Celtic_F.C..htm" title="Celtic F.C.">Celtic Football Club</a>. Many of the original sandstone <!--del_lnk--> tenements remain in this district. The East End in contrast to the West end, includes some of the most deprived areas in the UK. However, many areas of the district are not deprived in any way.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow Necropolis cemetery was created on a hill above the <!--del_lnk--> cathedral of <!--del_lnk--> St Mungo in 1831. Routes curve through the landscape uphill to the 62 metre high statue of <!--del_lnk--> John Knox at the summit, with some tombs designed by prominent local architect <!--del_lnk--> Alexander &#39;Greek&#39; Thomson. The design creates a dramatic skyline of <!--del_lnk--> obelisks, pinnacles and statues in memory of Glasgow&#39;s wealthiest inhabitants. It was described by James Curle as &#39;literally a city of the dead&#39;. The main entrance is approached by a bridge over what was the <!--del_lnk--> Molendinar Burn towards an impressive set of classical <!--del_lnk--> mausolea. The bridge, designed by James Hamilton, is known as the Bridge of Sighs because it formed the route of funeral processions.<p>There are two late 18th century tenements in Gallowgate. Dating from 1771 and 1780, both have been well restored. The construction of Charlotte Street was financed by <!--del_lnk--> David Dale, whose former pretensions can be gauged by the one remaining house, now run by the <!--del_lnk--> National Trust for Scotland. Further along Charlotte Street there stands a modern <!--del_lnk--> GKC building of some note. Once a school, it has been converted into flats. Surrounding these buildings are a series of innovative housing developments conceived as &#39;Homes for the Future&#39;, part of a project during the city&#39;s year as UK City of Architecture and Design in 1999.<p>East of Glasgow Cross is the magnificent St Andrews Church, built in 1746 and displaying a Presbyterian grandeur befitting the church of the city&#39;s wealthy Tobacco merchants. Also close by is the more modest <!--del_lnk--> Episcopalian St Andrews-by-the-Green, the oldest post-Reformation church in Scotland.<p>Overlooking <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow Green is the fa&ccedil;ade of Templeton&#39;s carpet factory, featuring vibrant polychromatic brickwork intended to evoke the <!--del_lnk--> Doge&#39;s Palace in <!--del_lnk--> Venice.<p>The extensive <!--del_lnk--> Tollcross Park was originally developed from the estate of James Dunlop, the owner of a local Steelworks. His large <!--del_lnk--> baronial mansion was built in 1848 by <!--del_lnk--> David Bryce, which later housed the city&#39;s Children&#39;s Museum until the 1980s. Today, the mansion is a sheltered housing complex.<p>The new Scottish National Indoor Sports Arena, a modern replacement for the Kelvin Hall, is planned for <!--del_lnk--> Dalmarnock. If the <!--del_lnk--> 2014 Commonwealth Games bid is successful, the area will house the Athletes&#39; Village, adjacent to the new indoor sports arena.<p>To the north of the East End lie the two massive <!--del_lnk--> gasometers of <!--del_lnk--> Provan Gas Works, which stand overlooking <!--del_lnk--> Alexandra Park and a major interchange between the M8 and M80 motorways. Often used for displaying large city advertising slogans, the towers have become an unofficial portal into the city for road users arriving from the North and East.<p><a id="The_South_Side" name="The_South_Side"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The South Side</span></h3>

The former docklands site at Pacific Quay on the south bank of the River Clyde, opposite the SECC, is the site of the <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow Science Centre and the new headquarters for <!--del_lnk--> BBC Scotland and <!--del_lnk--> SMG plc (owner of <b><!--del_lnk--> stv</b>) which are relocating there to a new purpose built digital media campus.<p>In addition, several new bridges spanning the River Clyde have been built or are currently planned, including The <!--del_lnk--> Clyde Arc at Pacific Quay and others at <!--del_lnk--> Tradeston and Springfield Quay.<p>The South Side also includes many great parks, including Linn Park, Queens Park, <!--del_lnk--> Bellahouston Park and Rouken Glen Park, and several golf clubs, including the championship course at Haggs Castle. The South Side is also home to Pollok Country Park, which is Glasgow&rsquo;s largest park and the only Country Park within the city boundaries.<p><!--del_lnk--> Govan is a district and former burgh in the south-western part of the city. It is situated on the south bank of the River Clyde, opposite <!--del_lnk--> Partick. It was an administratively independent Police Burgh from 1864 until it was incorporated into the expanding city of Glasgow in 1912.<p>Govan has a great legacy as an <a href="../../wp/e/Engineering.htm" title="Engineering">engineering</a> and <!--del_lnk--> shipbuilding centre of international repute and is home to one of two <!--del_lnk--> BAE Systems shipyards on the <!--del_lnk--> River Clyde and the precision engineering firm, <!--del_lnk--> Thales Optronics. It is also home to the Southern General Hospital, one of the largest <!--del_lnk--> teaching hospitals in the country, and the maintenance depot for the <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow Subway system.<p><a id="North_Glasgow" name="North_Glasgow"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">North Glasgow</span></h3>
      <p>North Glasgow extends out from the north of the City Centre towards the affluent suburbs of Bearsden, Milngavie, Bishopbriggs and Lenzie in <!--del_lnk--> East Dunbartonshire. However, it also contains some of the city&#39;s poorest residential areas. <!--del_lnk--> Possilpark is one such area, where levels of unemployment and drug abuse continue to be above the national average. Much of the housing in areas such as Possilpark and <!--del_lnk--> Hamiltonhill had fallen into a state of disrepair in recent years. This has led to large scale redevelopment of much of the poorer housing stock in North Glasgow, and the wider regeneration of many areas, such as <!--del_lnk--> Ruchill, which have been transformed; many run-down tenements have now been refurbished or replaced by modern <!--del_lnk--> Housing estates.<p>Much of the housing stock in North Glasgow is <!--del_lnk--> rented social housing, managed by the Glasgow <!--del_lnk--> Housing Association. In parts of the North of the city, such as <!--del_lnk--> Springburn, there are many high-rise tower blocks. These buildings were constructed in the 1960s and 1970s and were viewed as the answer to Glasgow&rsquo;s inner-city slum problems, but are now widely discredited as being poorly built and unsuited to traditional urban living, and are held responsible by many for the social alienation that exists in the poorest parts of the city today.<p>Not all areas of North Glasgow are of this nature however. <!--del_lnk--> Maryhill for example consists of well maintained traditional sandstone tenements. Although historically a <!--del_lnk--> working class area, its borders with the upmarket West End of the city mean that it is relatively wealthy compared to the rest of the North of the city, containing affluent areas such as <!--del_lnk--> Maryhill Park and <!--del_lnk--> North Kelvinside. Maryhill is also home to <!--del_lnk--> Firhill Stadium, home of <!--del_lnk--> Partick Thistle since 1909, and since 2005, the professional <!--del_lnk--> Rugby Union team, <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow Warriors. The <!--del_lnk--> junior team, <!--del_lnk--> Maryhill F.C. are also located in this part of North Glasgow.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Forth and Clyde Canal passes through this part of the city, and at one stage formed a vital part of the local economy.

Indeed, Glasgow dominated the manufacturing of locomotives, with 25% of all the world&rsquo;s trains being built in the area at one stage. It was home to the headquarters of the <!--del_lnk--> North British Locomotive Company. Today the engineering group <!--del_lnk--> Alstom&#39;s railway maintenance facility in the area is all that is left of the industry in Springburn.<p><a id="Architecture" name="Architecture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Architecture</span></h2>

      <p>Very little of <!--del_lnk--> medieval Glasgow remains, the two main landmarks from this period being the 14th century <!--del_lnk--> Provand&#39;s Lordship and <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow Cathedral. The vast majority of the city as seen today dates from the 19th century. As a result, Glasgow has an impressive heritage of <!--del_lnk--> Victorian architecture - the <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow City Chambers, the main building of the University of Glasgow, designed by Sir <!--del_lnk--> George Gilbert Scott, and the <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow School of Art, designed by <!--del_lnk--> Charles Rennie Mackintosh, being outstanding examples. Another architect who had a great and enduring impact on the city&#39;s appearance was <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Thomson, who produced a distinctive architecture based on fundamentalist classicism that gave him the nickname &quot;Greek&quot;. He was described as a &quot;quiet, stay-at-home Victorian behind whose buttoned-up facade there seethed a kind of stylistic corsair who plundered the past for the greater glory of the present&quot;.<p>The buildings reflect the wealth and self confidence of the residents of the <i>&quot;Second City of the Empire&quot;</i>. Glasgow generated immense wealth from trade and the industries that developed from the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> shipyards, <!--del_lnk--> marine engineering, <a href="../../wp/s/Steel.htm" title="Steel">steel</a> making, and <!--del_lnk--> heavy industry all contributed to the growth of the city. At one time the expression <i>&quot;Clydebuilt&quot;</i> was synonymous with quality and engineering excellence. The Templeton&#39;s Carpet Factory on <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow Green was designed to resemble the <!--del_lnk--> Doge&#39;s Palace in Venice. The allusions to another great trading city, seem appropriate.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Many of the city&#39;s most impressive buildings were built with red or blond <!--del_lnk--> sandstone, but during the industrial era those colours disappeared under a pervasive black layer of soot and pollutants from the furnaces.<p>Tenements were built to house the workers who had migrated from <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and the <a href="../../wp/s/Scottish_Highlands.htm" title="Scottish Highlands">Scottish Highlands</a> in order to feed the local demand for labour; these tenements were often overcrowded and unsanitary, and many developed into the infamous Glasgow <!--del_lnk--> slums, the <!--del_lnk--> Gorbals area being one of the most notorious.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In recent years many of these buildings have been cleaned and restored to their original appearance. Others were demolished to make way for large, barrack-like housing estates, and high-rise flats in <!--del_lnk--> tower blocks. The latter were built in large numbers during the 1960s and early 1970s; Glasgow has a higher concentration of high-rise buildings than any other city in the British Isles. At 31 storeys, the Red Road flats in the north of the city were for many years the highest residential buildings in Europe. These housing estates, known as &quot;schemes&quot;, are widely regarded as unsuccessful: many, such as <!--del_lnk--> Castlemilk, were just dormitories well away from the centre of the city with no amenities (&quot;deserts wi&#39; windaes&quot; [deserts with windows], as <!--del_lnk--> Billy Connolly put it), and their establishment led to the split up of long established community relationships. Some of the high-rise developments were poorly designed and cheaply built and became magnets for crime. Over time some have become as bad as the slum areas that they replaced, though at the time of construction they were largely welcomed. On <!--del_lnk--> 7 March <!--del_lnk--> 2003, the Glasgow Housing Association took ownership of the housing stock from the city council, and has begun a programme of demolishing the worst of the tower blocks.<p>Modern buildings in Glasgow include the <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, and along the banks of the Clyde are the <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow Science Centre and the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, whose <!--del_lnk--> Clyde Auditorium was designed by <!--del_lnk--> Sir Norman Foster, and is affectionately known as the &quot;<a href="../../wp/a/Armadillo.htm" title="Armadillo">Armadillo</a>&quot;. <!--del_lnk--> Zaha Hadid has won a competition to design the new <!--del_lnk--> Museum of Transport, which will move to the waterfront. Shopping centres include the <!--del_lnk--> Buchanan Galleries, the glass pyramid of the <!--del_lnk--> St Enoch Centre, and the upmarket Princes Square.<p>Given the history of high rises in Glasgow, the council&#39;s policy of allowing new tall buildings has attracted some controversy. The 39-storey <!--del_lnk--> Elphinstone Place mixed-use skyscraper in Charing Cross, will be the tallest building in Scotland, and is scheduled to begin construction in mid 2006. Much development is taking place along the banks of the Clyde. <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow Harbour, which neighbours <!--del_lnk--> Partick is one of the largest residential developments. The second phase was unfavourably compared to the Red Road flats, but was granted planning permission.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

It had two other professional clubs in the late 20th century: <!--del_lnk--> Clyde, which moved to <!--del_lnk--> Cumbernauld, and <!--del_lnk--> Third Lanark, which went bankrupt. There are a number of <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Junior Football Association clubs within the city as well, such as <!--del_lnk--> Pollok, <!--del_lnk--> Maryhill and <!--del_lnk--> Petershill, as well as countless numbers of amateur teams.<p>The history of football in the city, as well as the status of the <!--del_lnk--> Old Firm, attracts many visitors to football matches in the city throughout the season. It is the only city in Europe with three stadia each with a capacity of at least 50,000 seats. Hampden Park and Ibrox have also been awarded UEFA 5 star status, meaning that they are capable of hosting the final of the <!--del_lnk--> Champions League. Celtic Park however does not, owing to the changing rooms in the listed South Stand being too small. Hampden has hosted the final on three occasions, most recently in 2002. Hampden will also host the UEFA Cup final in 2007. The <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Football Association, the national governing body, and the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Football Museum are based in Glasgow, as are the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Football League, <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Premier League, <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Junior Football Association and <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Amateur Football Association.<table class="wikitable">

      <p><b>Glaswegian</b>, otherwise known as The <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow Patter is a local, anglicised variety of <a href="../../wp/s/Scots_language.htm" title="Scots language">Scots</a>.<p>Glaswegian is a dialect, more than an alternative pronunciation; words also change their meaning, e.g. &quot;away&quot; can mean &quot;leaving&quot; as in <i>A&#39;m awa</i>, an instruction to stop being a nuisance as in <i>awa wi ye</i>, or &quot;drunk&quot; or &quot;demented&quot; as in <i>he&#39;s awa wi it</i>. <i>Pieces</i> refers to &quot;sandwiches&quot;. <i>Ginger</i> is a generic term for carbonated soft drink, generally in a glass bottle (<i>A boatal a&#39; ginger</i>). Then there are words whose meaning has no obvious relationship to that in standard English: <i>coupon</i> means &quot;face&quot;, via &quot;to punch a ticket coupon&quot;. A <!--del_lnk--> headbutt has come to be known in many parts of Britain as a <i>&quot;Glasgow kiss&quot;</i>.<p>A speaker of Glaswegian might refer to those originating from the <a href="../../wp/s/Scottish_Highlands.htm" title="Scottish Highlands">Scottish Highlands</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Western Isles as <i><!--del_lnk--> teuchters</i>, while they would reciprocate by referring to Glaswegians as <i>keelies</i>. A (rather old-fashioned) Glaswegian insult is <i>hieland</i>, which means &quot;awkward&quot; and is Scots for &quot;Highland&quot;. Example: <i>that wean&#39;s got an awfu hieland wey o haudin that spuin</i> meaning &quot;that child has a very awkward way of holding that spoon&quot;.<p>The TV series <!--del_lnk--> Chewin&#39; the Fat, <!--del_lnk--> Rab C.

      <p>Glasgow is also a major education centre with four universities within 10 miles (16 km) of the city centre: the <!--del_lnk--> 15th century <!--del_lnk--> University of Glasgow (which has one of the highest ratios of students who continue living at home in Scotland), the <!--del_lnk--> University of Strathclyde, the <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow Caledonian University, and the <!--del_lnk--> University of Paisley; as well as teacher training colleges, teaching hospitals such as the <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow Royal Infirmary, the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow School of Art, and ten other further education colleges. The University of Glasgow is a member of the <!--del_lnk--> Russell Group of elite <!--del_lnk--> British Universities and is a founding member of the organisation <!--del_lnk--> Universitas 21, an international grouping of universities dedicated to setting world-wide standards for higher education.<p>Glasgow is home to a student population in excess of 168,000, the largest in Scotland and second largest in the United Kingdom, the majority of them living in the West End of the city.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>
      <p>Glasgow is the largest and most dynamic economy in Scotland and is at the hub of the metropolitan area of <!--del_lnk--> West Central Scotland which has a total population of around 2.3 million, nearly half of Scotland&#39;s total population. The city itself sustains more than 410,000 jobs in over 12,000 companies. The wider area of Glasgow <!--del_lnk--> Greater Glasgow sustains over 900,000 in 40,000 companies. Over 153,000 jobs have been created in the city since 2000 - a growth rate of 32%. The city now outstrips most of its European counterparts and rivals most North American cities in terms of growth. 55% of the residents in the <!--del_lnk--> Greater Glasgow area commute to the city every day. Manufacturing industries such as shipbuilding and heavy engineering have been gradually replaced in importance by a modern <!--del_lnk--> mixed economy, supported by public and private investment and a skilled workforce.<p>Glasgow&#39;s economy is now dominated by key <!--del_lnk--> tertiary sector industries such as financial and business services, communications, biosciences, creative industries, healthcare, retail and tourism. Between 1998 and 2001, the city&#39;s burgeoning financial services sector grew at a rate of 30%.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Glasgow has a large urban transportation system, mostly managed by the <!--del_lnk--> Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT), part of <!--del_lnk--> Transport Scotland. Until 2006 it was known as <!--del_lnk--> Strathclyde Passenger Transport and was the only Passenger Transport Executive in Scotland. SPT is formed and financed out of the twelve <!--del_lnk--> unitary authorities in the <!--del_lnk--> Greater Glasgow area including <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow City Council. It has responsibility for local train services, the Subway, certain ferries and buses.<p>The city has many bus services, almost all provided by private operators since bus deregulation in 1986, however SPT fund services where there is public need but no service. SPT also own and run the principal bus station in Glasgow, Buchanan Bus Station, which is a terminus point for many long distance intercity coach services as well as local journeys. A number of controversial &#39;<!--del_lnk--> bus corridors&#39; have been invested in by Glasgow City Council focusing on main bus routes with real time information, and bus priority measures at a significant cost. The Greater Glasgow Passenger Transport Executive (GGPTE), formerly the municipal transport operator, is as a result of bus deregulation now privately owned by <!--del_lnk--> First Group, who operate a vast bus network in the city. Other large operators in Glasgow are <!--del_lnk--> Arriva and <!--del_lnk--> Stagecoach with a number of smaller operators catering to individual districts including <!--del_lnk--> First Stop Travel and many others.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Glasgow has the most extensive <!--del_lnk--> urban rail network in the UK outside of London, with rail services travelling to a large part of the <!--del_lnk--> West of Scotland. All trains running within Scotland are operated by <!--del_lnk--> First ScotRail, who own the franchise as determined by the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Executive. This company is part of the <!--del_lnk--> First Group that runs the majority of bus services in the country. There are two main railway terminals which provide train services throughout the United Kingdom: <!--del_lnk--> Central Station and <!--del_lnk--> Queen Street Station. Local trains within Glasgow are however run by First Scotrail to the specification and requirements of SPT, who provide rolling stock in the distinctive SPT <!--del_lnk--> livery of <!--del_lnk--> Carmine and <!--del_lnk--> Cream. The city&#39;s suburban network is currently divided on both sides of the River Clyde. Many have long pressed for a link which will join the two halves of the urban railway network together, making possible through journeys via the central area without having to disembark at either Central or Queen Street and traverse the city centre by foot or road. The <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow Crossrail initiative has been proposed as a solution and is currently awaiting funding from the Scottish Executive.<p>As well as the suburban rail network, SPT also run UK&#39;s only completely underground <!--del_lnk--> metro system, the <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow Subway (nicknamed by journalists the &#39;Clockwork Orange&#39; after its 1970s renovation due to the new orange livery of the trains and its single, circular line, but not called this by locals, who actually simply refer to it as the &quot;the underground&quot;, &quot;the subway&quot; or &quot;the tube&quot;). The Subway avoids traffic between the city centre, the <!--del_lnk--> Southside and the <!--del_lnk--> West End. A single ticket is &pound;1, and a return &pound;2, however after 0930 a &quot;discovery&quot; day ticket can be purchased for &pound;1.90.<p><a id="River_transport" name="River_transport"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">River transport</span></h3>
      <p>A number of ferries used to link opposite sides of the Clyde in Glasgow. However, these have steadily disappeared, mainly due to the construction of new bridges and tunnels including the <!--del_lnk--> Erskine Bridge, <!--del_lnk--> Kingston Bridge, and the <!--del_lnk--> Clyde Tunnel, which rendered them obsolete. The only remaining crossings are the Renfrew Ferry between Renfrew and Yoker, and the Kilcreggan Ferry in <!--del_lnk--> Inverclyde, both run by SPT but outwith the city boundary. The paddle-steamer <i><!--del_lnk--> PS Waverley</i>, the last operational sea going paddle-steamer in the world, still provides services from Glasgow City Centre, mainly catering to the pleasure cruise market. A regular service by <i>Pride of the Clyde</i> waterbuses link the City Centre with <!--del_lnk--> Braehead in <!--del_lnk--> Renfrewshire, some 30 minutes downstream.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The city is the focal point of Scotland&#39;s road network and has extensive road connections to other cities. The main <!--del_lnk--> M8 motorway passes through the city centre, allowing road transport to Edinburgh and Glasgow&#39;s two airports. The M8 crosses the Clyde via the <!--del_lnk--> Kingston Bridge, and connects to the <!--del_lnk--> M77, <!--del_lnk--> M73, and <!--del_lnk--> M80 motorways that lead throughout <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> and to <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>. The M8 is the only motorway to pass through the centre of a major city in the UK. The <!--del_lnk--> M74 runs directly south towards <!--del_lnk--> Carlisle and currently terminates in the East End suburb of Tollcross, but the highly controversial M74 Completion scheme will extend the motorway into the Tradeston area to join the M8 south of the Kingston Bridge. After decades of bitter opposition from various quarters, a legal challenge to stop the extension from being built was withdrawn in 2006, and the road is now scheduled for completion by 2010.<p>Other road proposals include the <!--del_lnk--> East End Regeneration Route, which aims to complete the original <!--del_lnk--> post-war masterplan for the <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow Inner Ring Road around the city, and provide better access to deprived areas of the East End.<p><a id="Airports" name="Airports"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Airports</span></h3>
