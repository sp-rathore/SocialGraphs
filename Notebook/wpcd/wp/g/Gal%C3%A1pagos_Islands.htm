      <p>The <b>Gal&aacute;pagos Islands</b> (Spanish name: <i>Archipi&eacute;lago de Col&oacute;n</i> or <i>Islas Gal&aacute;pagos</i>, from <i>gal&aacute;pago</i>, &quot;saddle&quot;- after the shells of saddlebacked <!--del_lnk--> Gal&aacute;pagos tortoises) are an <!--del_lnk--> archipelago made up of 13 main <!--del_lnk--> volcanic islands, 6 smaller islands, and 107 rocks and <!--del_lnk--> islets. The very first island is thought to have formed between 5 and 10 million years ago, a result of <!--del_lnk--> tectonic activity.

      <p>Though the first protective legislation for the Gal&aacute;pagos was enacted in 1934 and supplemented in 1936, it was not until the late 1950s that positive action was taken to control what was happening to the native flora and fauna. In 1955, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature organized a fact-finding mission to the Gal&aacute;pagos. Two years later, in 1957, <!--del_lnk--> UNESCO in cooperation with the government of Ecuador sent another expedition to study the conservation situation and choose a site for a research station.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In 1959, the centenary year of Darwin&#39;s publication of <i>The Origin of Species</i>, the Ecuadorean government declared 97.5% of the archipelago&#39;s land area a <!--del_lnk--> national park, excepting areas already colonised. The <!--del_lnk--> Charles Darwin Foundation was founded the same year, with its international headquarters in <a href="../../wp/b/Brussels.htm" title="Brussels">Brussels</a>. Its primary objectives are to ensure the conservation of unique Gal&aacute;pagos ecosystems and promote the scientific studies necessary to fulfill its conservation functions. Conservation work began with the establishment of the <!--del_lnk--> Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz Island in 1964. During the early years, conservation programs, such as eradication of introduced species and protection of native species, were carried out by station personnel. Currently, most resident scientists pursue conservation goals; most visiting scientists&#39; work is oriented towards pure research.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>When the national park was established, approximately 1,000 to 2,000 people called the islands their home. In 1972 a census was done in the archipelago and a population of 3,488 was recorded. By the 1980s, this number had dramatically risen to more than 15,000 people, and 2006 estimates place the population around 30,000 people.<p>In 1986 the surrounding 70,000 square kilometres (43,496 sq mi.) of ocean was declared a <!--del_lnk--> marine reserve, second only in size to Australia&#39;s Great Barrier Reef. In 1990 the archipelago became a whale sanctuary. In 1978 <!--del_lnk--> UNESCO recognised the islands as a <a href="../../wp/w/World_Heritage_Site.htm" title="World Heritage Site">World Heritage Site</a>, and in 1985 a <!--del_lnk--> Biosphere Reserve. This was later extended in December 2001 to include the marine reserve.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Introduced <a href="../../wp/p/Plant.htm" title="Plant">plants</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Animal.htm" title="Animal">animals</a>, such as feral goats, cats, and cattle, brought accidentally or willingly to the islands by humans, represent the main threat to Gal&aacute;pagos. Quick to reproduce, these alien species decimate the habitats of native species. The native animals, lacking natural predators on the islands, are defenseless to introduced species and fall prey.<p>Some of the most harmful introduced plants are the Guayaba or <!--del_lnk--> Guava <i>Psidium guajava</i>, <a href="../../wp/a/Avocado.htm" title="Avocado">avocado</a> <i>Persea americana</i>, <!--del_lnk--> cascarilla <i>Cinchona pubescens</i>, <!--del_lnk--> balsa <i>Ochroma pyramidale</i>, <!--del_lnk--> blackberry <i>Rubus glaucus</i>, various <a href="../../wp/c/Citrus.htm" title="Citrus">citrus</a> (<!--del_lnk--> orange, <!--del_lnk--> grapefruit, <a href="../../wp/l/Lemon.htm" title="Lemon">lemon</a>), <!--del_lnk--> floripondio <i>Datura arborea</i>, <!--del_lnk--> higuerilla <i>Ricinus communis</i> and the <!--del_lnk--> elephant grass <i>Pennisetum purpureum</i>. These plants have invaded large areas and eliminated endemic species in the humid zones of San Cristobal, Floreana, Isabela and Santa Cruz. Also, these harmful plants are just a few of introduced species on the Galapagos Islands. There are over 700 introduced plant species today. There are only 500 native and endemic species. This difference is creating a major problem for the islands and the natural species that inhabit them.<p>Many species were introduced to the Gal&aacute;pagos by <!--del_lnk--> pirates. <!--del_lnk--> Heyerdahl quotes documents that mention that the Viceroy of <a href="../../wp/p/Peru.htm" title="Peru">Peru</a>, knowing that British pirates ate the goats that they themselves had released in the islands, ordered dogs to be freed there to eliminate the goats. Also, when colonization of Floreana by Jos&eacute; de Villamil failed, he ordered that the goats, donkeys, cows, and other animals from the farms in Floreana be transferred to other islands for the purpose of later colonization.<p>Non-native goats, pigs, dogs, rats, cats, mice, sheep, horses, donkeys, cows, poultry, ants, cockroaches, and some parasites inhabit the islands today. Dogs and cats attack the tame birds and destroy nests of birds, land tortoises, and marine turtles. They sometimes kill small Gal&aacute;pagos tortoises and iguanas. Pigs are even more harmful, covering larger areas and destroying the nests of tortoises, turtles and iguanas. Pigs also knock down vegetation in their search for roots and insects. This problem abounds in Cerro Azul volcano and Isabela, and in Santiago pigs may be the cause of the disappearance of the land iguanas that were so abundant when Darwin visited. The black rat <i><!--del_lnk--> Rattus rattus</i> attacks small Gal&aacute;pagos tortoises when they leave the nest, so that in Pinz&oacute;n they stopped the reproduction for a period of more than 50 years; only adults were found on that island. Also, where the black rat is found, the endemic rat has disappeared. Cows and donkeys eat all the available vegetation and compete with native species for the scarce water. In 1959, fishermen introduced one male and two female goats to Pinta island; by 1973 the National Park service estimated the population of goats to be over 30,000 individuals. Goats were also introduced to Marchena in 1967 and to Rabida in 1971.<p>The fast growing poultry industry on the inhabited islands has been cause for concern from local conservationists, who fear that domestic birds could introduce disease into the endemic and wild bird populations.<p>The Gal&aacute;pagos marine sanctuary is under threat from a host of illegal fishing activities, in addition to other problems of development. The most pressing threat to the Marine Reserve comes from local, mainland and foreign fishing targeting marine life illegally within the Reserve, such as sharks (hammerheads and other species) for their fins, and the harvest of sea cucumbers out of season. Development threatens both land and sea species. The growth of both the tourism industry and local populations fuelled by high birth rates and illegal immigration threaten the wildlife of the Archipelago. The recent grounding of the oil tanker, <i>Jessica</i>, and the subsequent oil spill brought this threat to world attention.<p>Currently, the rapidly growing problems development, tourism, and a human population explosion are further destroying habitats.<p>=<p><a id="Main_Islands" name="Main_Islands"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Main Islands</span></h2>

      <p>The archipelago has been known by many different names, including the &quot;Enchanted Islands&quot; because of the way in which the strong and swift <!--del_lnk--> currents made <!--del_lnk--> navigation difficult. The first crude <!--del_lnk--> navigation chart of the islands was done by the <!--del_lnk--> buccaneer <!--del_lnk--> Ambrose Cowley in 1684, and in those charts he named the islands after some of his fellow <!--del_lnk--> pirates or after the <!--del_lnk--> English noblemen who helped the pirates&#39; cause. The term &quot;Gal&aacute;pagos&quot; refers to the Spanish name given to the Giant Land Tortoises known to inhabit the islands.<p>The main islands of the archipelago (with their <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> names) are (alphabetically):<p><a id="Baltra_.28South_Seymour.29" name="Baltra_.28South_Seymour.29"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Baltra (South Seymour)</span></h4>

      <p>During WW II Baltra was established as a US Air Force Base. Crews stationed at Baltra patrolled the Pacific for enemy submarines as well as providing protection for the Panama Canal. After the war the facilities were given to the government of Ecuador. Today the island continues as an official Ecuadorian military base.<p>Until 1986, Baltra was the only airport serving the Gal&aacute;pagos. Now one of two airports, the other located on San Cristobal Island, most flights operating in and out of Gal&aacute;pagos still fly into Baltra.<p>During the 1930&#39;s scientists decided to move 70 of Baltra&#39;s Land Iguanas to the neighboring island of North Seymour as part of an experiment. This move had unexpected results for during the WWII military occupation of Baltra, the native iguanas became extinct on the island. During the 1980&#39;s iguanas from North Seymour were brought to the Darwin Station as part of a breeding and repopulation project and in the 1990&#39;s land iguanas were reintroduced to Baltra.<p><a id="Bartolom.C3.A9" name="Bartolom.C3.A9"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Bartolom&eacute;</span></h4>

      <p>The name was given in honour of King Ferdinand of Spain, who sponsored the voyage of Columbus. Fernandina has an area of 642 square kilometres (248&nbsp;mi&sup2;) and a maximum altitude of 1,494 metres (4,902&nbsp;ft). This is the youngest and westernmost island. In May 13, 2005, a new very eruptive process began on this island when an ash and water vapour cloud rose to a height of 7 <!--del_lnk--> kilometers (4.4&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mi) and lava flows descended the slopes of the volcano on the way to the sea. Punta Espinosa is a narrow stretch of land where hundreds of Marine Iguanas gather largely on black lava rocks. The famous <!--del_lnk--> Flightless Cormorant inhabits this island and also <!--del_lnk--> Gal&aacute;pagos Penguins, <!--del_lnk--> Pelicans and Sea Lions are abundant. Different types of <!--del_lnk--> lava flows can be compared and the <!--del_lnk--> Mangrove Forests can be observed.<p><a id="Floreana_.28Charles_or_Santa_Mar.C3.ADa.29" name="Floreana_.28Charles_or_Santa_Mar.C3.ADa.29"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Floreana (Charles or Santa Mar&iacute;a)</span></h4>

It is also called <!--del_lnk--> Santa Maria after one of the <!--del_lnk--> caravels of Columbus. It has an area of 173 square kilometres (66.8&nbsp;mi&sup2;) and a maximum altitude of 640 metres (2,100&nbsp;ft). It is one of the islands with the most interesting human history and one of the earliest to be inhabited. Pink <a href="../../wp/f/Flamingo.htm" title="Flamingo">flamingos</a> and green sea turtles nest (December to May) in this island. The &quot;patapegada&quot; or <!--del_lnk--> Gal&aacute;pagos petrel is found here, a sea bird which spends most of its life away from land.

This island is formed by the remaining edge of a large <!--del_lnk--> crater that is submerged. Its nickname of &ldquo;the bird island&rdquo; is clearly justified. At Darwin Bay, <!--del_lnk--> frigatebirds, swallow-tailed gulls, which are the only nocturnal of its species in the world can be seen. Red-footed <a href="../../wp/b/Booby.htm" title="Booby">boobies</a>, noddy <a href="../../wp/t/Tern.htm" title="Tern">terns</a>, lava gulls, tropic birds, <a href="../../wp/d/Dove.htm" title="Dove">doves</a>, <!--del_lnk--> storm petrels and <!--del_lnk--> Darwin finches are also in sight.

      <p>This island was named in honour of Queen Isabela who sponsored the voyage of Columbus. With an area of 4,640 square kilometres (1,792&nbsp;mi&sup2;), it is the largest island of the Gal&aacute;pagos. Its highest point is Wolf Volcano with an altitude of 1,707 metres (5,600&nbsp;ft). The island&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> seahorse shape is the product of the merging of six large volcanoes into a single landmass. On this island <!--del_lnk--> Gal&aacute;pagos Penguins, <!--del_lnk--> flightless cormorants, <!--del_lnk--> marine iguanas, boobies, <!--del_lnk--> pelicans and <!--del_lnk--> Sally Lightfoot crabs abound. At the skirts and calderas of the volcanos of Isabela, Land Iguanas and Gal&aacute;pagos Tortoises can be observed, as well as <!--del_lnk--> Darwin Finches, Gal&aacute;pagos Hawks, Gal&aacute;pagos Doves and very interesting lowland vegetation. The third-largest human settlement of the archipelago, Puerto Villamil, is located at the south-eastern tip of the island.<p><a id="Marchena_.28Bindloe.29" name="Marchena_.28Bindloe.29"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Marchena (Bindloe)</span></h4>

Has an area of 4.9 square kilometres (1.9&nbsp;mi&sup2;) and a maximum altitude of 367 metres (1,204&nbsp;ft). The high amount of iron contained in the lava at R&aacute;bida give it a distinctive red colour. White-Cheeked Pintail Ducks live in a salt-water lagoon close to the beach, where brown pelicans and boobies have built their nests. Up until recently, flamingos were also found in the salt-water lagoon, but they have since moved on to other islands, likely due to a lack of food on R&aacute;bida. Nine species of Finches have been reported in this island.<p><a id="San_Crist.C3.B3bal_.28Chatham.29" name="San_Crist.C3.B3bal_.28Chatham.29"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">San Crist&oacute;bal (Chatham)</span></h4>

      <p>The European discovery of the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands occurred when Dominican <!--del_lnk--> Fray Tom&aacute;s de Berlanga, the fourth Bishop of <a href="../../wp/p/Panama.htm" title="Panama">Panama</a>, sailed to <a href="../../wp/p/Peru.htm" title="Peru">Peru</a> to settle a dispute between <!--del_lnk--> Francisco Pizarro and his lieutenants. De Berlanga&#39;s vessel drifted off course when the winds diminished, and his party reached the islands on <!--del_lnk--> March 10, <!--del_lnk--> 1535. According to a 1956 study by <!--del_lnk--> Thor Heyerdahl and Arne Skj&oslash;lsvold, remains of potsherds and other artifacts from several sites on the islands suggest visitation by South American peoples prior to the arrival of the Spanish.<p>The islands first appeared on maps in about 1570 in those drawn by <!--del_lnk--> Abraham Ortelius and <!--del_lnk--> Mercator. The islands were called &quot;Insulae de los Galopegos&quot; (Islands of the Tortoises).<p>The first English captain to visit the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands was <!--del_lnk--> Richard Hawkins, in 1593. Until the early 19th century, the archipelago was often used as a hideout by mostly English pirates who pilfered Spanish <!--del_lnk--> galleons carrying gold and silver from South America to Spain.<p><!--del_lnk--> Alexander Selkirk, whose adventures in <!--del_lnk--> Juan Fern&aacute;ndez Islands inspired <!--del_lnk--> Daniel Defoe to write <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, visited the Gal&aacute;pagos in 1708 after he was picked up from Juan Fern&aacute;ndez by the privateer Woodes Rogers. Rogers was refitting his ships in the islands after sacking <!--del_lnk--> Guayaquil.<p>The first scientific mission to the Gal&aacute;pagos arrived in 1790 under the leadership of <!--del_lnk--> Alessandro Malaspina, a Sicilian captain whose expedition was sponsored by the King of Spain. However, the records of the expedition were lost.<p>In 1793, James Colnett made a description of the flora and fauna of Gal&aacute;pagos and suggested that the islands could be used as base for the <!--del_lnk--> whalers operating in the Pacific Ocean. He also drew the first accurate navigation charts of the islands. Whalers killed and captured thousands of the Gal&aacute;pagos tortoises to extract their fat. The tortoises could also be kept on board ship as a means of providing of fresh protein as these animals could survive for several months on board without any food or water. The hunting of the tortoises was responsible for greatly diminishing, and in some cases eliminating, certain species. Along with whalers came the fur-seal hunters who brought the population of this animal close to extinction.<p><a href="../../wp/e/Ecuador.htm" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a> annexed the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands on <!--del_lnk--> February 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1832, naming it Archipelago of Ecuador. This was a new name that added to several names that had been, and are still, used to refer to the archipelago. The first governor of Gal&aacute;pagos, General Jos&eacute; de Villamil, brought a group of convicts to populate the island of Floreana and in October 1832 some artisans and farmers joined.<p><!--del_lnk--> The Voyage of the Beagle brought the survey ship <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Beagle</i> under captain <!--del_lnk--> Robert FitzRoy to the Gal&aacute;pagos on <!--del_lnk--> September 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1835 to survey approaches to harbors. The captain and others on board including his companion the young naturalist <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_Darwin.htm" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> made a scientific study of geology and biology on four of the thirteen islands before they left on <!--del_lnk--> October 20 to continue on their round-the-world expedition. The governor of the prison colony on <i>Charles Island</i> told Darwin that tortoises differed from island to island, and when specimens of birds were analysed on return to <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> it was found that many different kinds of birds were species of <!--del_lnk--> finches which were also unique to islands. These facts were crucial in Darwin&#39;s development of his <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">evolution</a> theory, which was presented in <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Origin_of_Species.htm" title="The Origin of Species">The Origin of Species</a></i>.<p>Jos&eacute; Valdiz&aacute;n and Manuel Juli&aacute;n Cobos tried a new colonization, beginning the exploitation of a type of lichen found in the islands (Roccella portentosa) used as a coloring agent. After the assassination of Valdiz&aacute;n by some of his workers, Cobos brought from the continent a group of more than a hundred workers to San Crist&oacute;bal island and tried his luck at planting sugar cane. He ruled in his plantation with an iron hand which lead to his assassination in 1904. Since 1897 Antonio Gil began another plantation in Isabela island.<p>Over the course of a whole year, from September 1904, an expedition of the Academy of Sciences of California, led by Rollo Beck, stayed in the Gal&aacute;pagos collecting scientific material on <a href="../../wp/g/Geology.htm" title="Geology">geology</a>, <!--del_lnk--> entomology, <!--del_lnk--> ornithology, <a href="../../wp/b/Botany.htm" title="Botany">botany</a>, <!--del_lnk--> zoology and <!--del_lnk--> herpetology.
