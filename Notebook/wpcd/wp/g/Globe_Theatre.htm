      <p>The original Globe was an <!--del_lnk--> Elizabethan theatre which opened in Autumn 1599 in <!--del_lnk--> Southwark, on the south bank of the <!--del_lnk--> Thames, in an area now known as <!--del_lnk--> Bankside. It was one of several major theatres that were located in the area, the others being the <!--del_lnk--> Swan, <!--del_lnk--> the Rose and The <!--del_lnk--> Hope. The Globe was the principal <!--del_lnk--> playhouse of the <!--del_lnk--> Lord Chamberlain&#39;s Men (who would become the <!--del_lnk--> King&#39;s Men in 1603). Most of Shakespeare&#39;s post-1599 <!--del_lnk--> plays were staged at the Globe, including <i><!--del_lnk--> Julius Caesar</i>, <i><a href="../../wp/m/Macbeth.htm" title="Macbeth">Macbeth</a></i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Othello</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> King Lear</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Hamlet</i><div class="thumb tleft">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>The Globe was owned by many actors, who (except for one) were also shareholders in the <!--del_lnk--> Lord Chamberlain&#39;s Men. Two of the six Globe shareholders, <!--del_lnk--> Richard Burbage and his brother <!--del_lnk--> Cuthbert Burbage, owned double shares of the whole, or 25% each; the other four men, Shakespeare, <!--del_lnk--> John Heminges, <!--del_lnk--> Augustine Phillips, and <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Pope, owned a single share, or 12.5%. (Originally <!--del_lnk--> William Kempe was intended to be the seventh partner, but he sold out his share to the four minority sharers, leaving them with more than the originally planned 10%). These initial proportions changed over time, as new sharers were added. Shakespeare&#39;s share diminished from 1/8 to 1/14, or roughly 7%, over the course of his career.<p>The Globe was built in 1599 using timber from an earlier theatre, <!--del_lnk--> The Theatre, that had been built by Richard Burbage&#39;s father, <!--del_lnk--> James Burbage, in <!--del_lnk--> Shoreditch in 1576. The Burbages originally had a 20-year <!--del_lnk--> lease of the site on which the Theatre was built. When the lease ran out, they dismantled The Theatre beam by beam and transported it over the Thames to reconstruct it as The Globe.<p>On June 29, 1613, the Globe Theatre went up in flames during a performance of <i>Henry the Eighth</i>. A theatrical cannon, set off during the performance, misfired, igniting the wooden beams and thatching. According to one of the few surviving documents of the event, no one was hurt except a man who put out his burning breeches with a bottle of ale.<p>Like all the other theatres in London, the Globe was closed down by the <!--del_lnk--> Puritans in 1642. It was destroyed in 1644 to make room for <!--del_lnk--> tenements. Its exact location remained unknown until remnants of its foundations were discovered in 1989 beneath <!--del_lnk--> Anchor Terrace on Park Street. There may be further remains beneath Anchor Terrace, but the 18th century terrace is <!--del_lnk--> listed and may not be disturbed by archaeologists.<p><a id="Layout_of_the_Globe" name="Layout_of_the_Globe"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Layout of the Globe</span></h2>
      <p>The Globe&#39;s shape and size have been pieced together by scholarly inquiry over the last two centuries. The evidence suggests that it was a three-story, 100-foot (30.5m) wide, open-air <!--del_lnk--> amphitheatre that could house around 3,000 spectators. The Globe is shown as a round building on a contemporary engraving of London. On this basis, some assume the building was <!--del_lnk--> circular, while others favour a <!--del_lnk--> polygonal shape. Archaeological evidence suggests the playhouse had twenty sides.<p>At the base of the stage, there was an area called the <i>pit</i>, (or, harking back to the old <!--del_lnk--> inn-yards, <i>yard</i>) where, for a penny, people (the &quot;groundlings&quot;) would stand to watch the performance. Groundlings would stand and eat hazelnuts during performances &mdash; during the excavation of the Globe nutshells were found preserved in the dirt &mdash; or oranges. Around the yard were three levels of seating, which were more expensive than standing: the first two were called the Twopenny Rooms and the top level was called the Penny Gallery.<div class="thumb tleft">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>A rectangular <!--del_lnk--> stage platform, also known as an &#39;apron stage&#39;, thrust out into the middle of the open-air yard. The stage measured about 43 feet (13.1m) in width, 27 feet (8.2m) in depth and was raised about 5 feet (1.52m) off the ground. On this stage, there was a <!--del_lnk--> trap door for use by performers to enter from the &quot;cellarage&quot; area beneath the stage. There may have been as many as four smaller trap doors around the stage. Often the area beneath the stage is also called &quot;hell,&quot; since supernatural beings (such as the ghost in <i>Hamlet</i>) enter and exit the stage from this area.<p>Large columns on either side of the stage supported a roof over the rear portion of the stage. This ceiling was called the &quot;heavens,&quot; and was probably painted with images of the sky. A trap door in the heavens enabled performers to &quot;fly&quot; or descend using some form of rope and harness.<p>The back wall of the stage had three doors on the first floor and a balcony on the second. The doors entered into the &quot;tiring house&quot; (backstage area) where the actors dressed and awaited their entrances. The balcony housed the musicians and could also be used for scenes requiring an upper space, such as the balcony scene in <i><a href="../../wp/r/Romeo_and_Juliet.htm" title="Romeo and Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a></i>. In addition, it could be used as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Lord&#39;s Room,&quot; where higher-paying audience members could pay to be seated &ndash; more to be seen than to see the play, since they would have been behind the performers. The dimensions of the original Globe:<ul>
       <li>Diameter: 100 ft. (30.5m) surface to surface / 99 ft. (30.2m) centre to centre<li>Yard: 70 ft. (21.3m) between post centres / 69 ft. (21m) surface to surface<li>Stage: 49 ft. 6 in. (15.1m) across<li>Stage height: 5 ft. (1.52m)<li>Gallery Depth: 15 ft. 6 in. (4.72m) overall / 15 ft. 6 in. (4.72m) between post centres<li>Overall height: 36 ft. 6 in. (11.1m)<li>Overall heights from floor to floor: 15 ft. 6 in. (4.72m), 11 ft. 3 in. (3.42m) and 9 ft. 9 in. (2.9m) to the plates.<li>Balcony floor: 18 ft. 6 in. (5.64m) above the yard, 13 ft. 6 in. (4.11m) above stage<li>Front Scenae doors: 11 ft. (3.35m) tall<li>Heavens ceiling height: 26 ft. 9 in. (8.15m) (to the height of the upper gallery floor)</ul>
      <p><a id="The_modern_Globe" name="The_modern_Globe"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">The modern Globe</span></h2>
      <p>At the instigation of <!--del_lnk--> Sam Wanamaker, a new Globe theatre was built according to an <!--del_lnk--> Elizabethan plan. The design team comprised <!--del_lnk--> Theo Crosby of <!--del_lnk--> Pentagram as the architect, <!--del_lnk--> Buro Happold as structural and services engineers and Boyden &amp; Co as quantity surveyors. It opened in 1997 under the name &quot;Shakespeare&#39;s Globe Theatre&quot; and now stages plays every summer (May to October). <!--del_lnk--> Mark Rylance was appointed as the first <!--del_lnk--> artistic director of the modern Globe in 1995. In 2006, <!--del_lnk--> Dominic Dromgoole took over.<p>The new theatre is 200 <!--del_lnk--> yards (183m) from the original site, and was the first <!--del_lnk--> thatched roof building permitted in London since the <!--del_lnk--> Great Fire of London in <!--del_lnk--> 1666.<p>As in the original Globe, the theatre is open to the sky and has a thrust stage that projects into a large circular yard surrounded by three tiers of steeply raked seating. 600 tickets to stand (and you must stand, no sitting allowed) in the yard are available for every performance at 5 pounds each. The only covered parts of the amphitheatre are the stage and the (more expensive) seated areas. Plays are put on during the summer, usually between May and the first week of October. In the winter the theatre is used for educational purposes. Tours are available all year round.<p>The reconstruction was carefully researched so that the new building would be as faithful a replica as possible. This was aided by the discovery as final plans were being made of the site of the original Globe itself. Modernisations include the addition of <!--del_lnk--> sprinklers on the roof to protect against fire, and the fact that the theatre is partly joined onto a modern lobby, visitors centre and additional backstage support areas. Due to modern Health and Safety regulations 1,500 people can be housed during a show, half the estimated 3,000 of Shakespeare&#39;s time.<p><a id="Replicas" name="Replicas"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Replicas</span></h3>
