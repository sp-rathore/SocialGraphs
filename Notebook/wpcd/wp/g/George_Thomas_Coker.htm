      <p>Coker grew up in Linden, New Jersey and became an <a href="../../wp/e/Eagle_Scout_%2528Boy_Scouts_of_America%2529.htm" title="Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)">Eagle Scout</a> in Troop 32 of Saint Elizabeth&#39;s <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a> in Linden on <!--del_lnk--> January 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1959. His passion for Scouting is one of the things that got him through his 6.5&nbsp;years as a POW in North Vietnam, and he states that it is what got him through his darkest days in the POW camps &ndash; to the point that at times all he could remember was the <!--del_lnk--> Scout Oath, but not even the names of his family members.<p>Both of Coker&#39;s older brothers were involved in Scouting and Coker first became involved when he joined <!--del_lnk--> Cub Scouts in late 1951. He completed the Cubbing program and joined Troop 32. Troop 32 had about a dozen members at that time but had over 60 members when Coker made Eagle Scout in 1959. During this time the troop formed an <!--del_lnk--> Explorer Post and <!--del_lnk--> Sea Scout unit. After making Eagle Scout, Coker joined the Sea Scout unit and worked at summer camp before the joined the Navy in October 1963. When Coker returned to Linden after being released from captivity, the Scouts were his biggest supporter. Troop 32 now had over 100 members. Local citizens turned out by the hundreds to greet him. Coker visited many of the local Scouting units. Coker was then inactive in Scouting during busy Naval career, but got involved again when his son joined Cub Scouts as a <!--del_lnk--> Tiger Cub after the family had settled in <!--del_lnk--> Virginia Beach, <!--del_lnk--> Virginia. He became the den leader of 7 boys, all of whom earned their <!--del_lnk--> Arrow of Light, the highest recognition in American Cub Scouts. They moved on to Troop 62, Virginia Beach, in May 1994; with five of them later becoming Eagle Scouts, including his son.<p>Troop 62&#39;s adults asked Coker to become <!--del_lnk--> Scoutmaster, a position in which he served for several years. Coker is also a <!--del_lnk--> Vigil Honour member of the <!--del_lnk--> Order of the Arrow (OA). Coker began serving as the lodge adviser for the Blue Heron Lodge of the OA in December 2005. He was honored by the <!--del_lnk--> Boy Scouts of America with their <!--del_lnk--> Distinguished Eagle Scout Award on <!--del_lnk--> August 09, <!--del_lnk--> 2005.<br style="clear:both;" />

      <p>Coker served as a naval aviation officer for 23&nbsp;years in the U.S. Navy from 1963&ndash;1986. He was serving as a Bombardier&ndash;Navigator of an A-6A Intruder from squadron VA-65 operating from the <!--del_lnk--> USS Constellation (CV-64), when he and his pilot, John H. &quot;Jack&quot; Fellowes, were shot down over North Vietnam on <!--del_lnk--> August 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1966. He was not released until <!--del_lnk--> March 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1973. During his captivity, he was, and still is, recognized as a leader of the POW resistance movement. Coker was one of the fiercest resistors of his captors.  In a scene from the 1997 movie <i>Faith of Our Fathers</i>, a biography of Senator <!--del_lnk--> John McCain, McCain&#39;s character attempts to memorize the names of fellow POWs. Coker is one of the names he recites in the movie and book. A fellow POW, <!--del_lnk--> CDR Paul Galanti, said &quot;George is one of my heroes...the real reason North Vietnam gave in (on the POW issue) was they wanted to get rid of George&quot;.<p>Coker was considered one of &quot;the baddest of the baddest&quot; of the POWs, a reference to his fierce resistance to his captivity. Coker and <!--del_lnk--> Air Force Captain George McKnight (another of the &quot;baddest&quot;) were cellmates for awhile and were the only POWs to ever escape from the Hao Lo Prison (&quot;<!--del_lnk--> Hanoi Hilton&quot;). They swam down the <!--del_lnk--> Red River, hid in the mud, and were recaptured 12 1/2 hours later. Coker received the <!--del_lnk--> Navy Cross for his action; the citation reads in part:<dl>
       <dd><i>...for extraordinary heroism during an extremely daring escape from a solitary confinement cell while a Prisoner of War in Hanoi, North Vietnam on 12 October 1967. During a period of particularly harsh treatment, Lieutenant Commander Coker and another prisoner executed an escape as a two-man team despite the high risk of brutal reprisal or possible loss of life. That night, after opening the cell door by removing door bolt brackets from inside the room, he proceeded over the wall and through several blocks of housing to the Domer Bridge. Walking under the bridge to the Red River&#39;s edge, he swam downstream all night and at sunrise buried himself in a mudbank in an effort to remain concealed. He was later discovered, recaptured, severely beaten for many hours, and banished to solitary confinement for two and a half years.</i></dl>
      <p>Vietnam&ndash;era POWs were released in order of capture. Fellowes and Coker were in the second large release group and were about #123 and #124. Of their 2,382&nbsp;days in captivity (6.5&nbsp;years), 2.5&nbsp;years were in solitary confinement and 2.5&nbsp;years in the &quot;Hanoi Hilton&quot;. They also spent time in several other POW camps around Hanoi.<p>Coker&#39;s return to his hometown after leaving Vietnam can be seen in the 1974 <!--del_lnk--> documentary <i><!--del_lnk--> Hearts and Minds</i>.<p><a id="Military_decorations" name="Military_decorations"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Military decorations</span></h3>

      <p>In addition to continued Scouting activities, Coker has been involved in supporting ex-POWs for many years. In December 2004, he was elected Commander of his local POW chapter, the Tidewater ex-POW Association. Coker and his wife are also active in church and civic activities, such as counseling young married couples.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Thomas_Coker&quot;</div>
