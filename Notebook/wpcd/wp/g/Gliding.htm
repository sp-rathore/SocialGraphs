      <p><b>Gliding</b> (or <b>soaring</b>) is a <!--del_lnk--> recreational activity and competitive <a href="../../wp/s/Sport.htm" title="Sport">sport</a> in which pilots fly un-powered <!--del_lnk--> aircraft known as <!--del_lnk--> gliders or sailplanes. Properly, the term <i>gliding</i> refers to descending flight of a heavier-than-air craft, whereas <i>soaring</i> is the correct term to use when the craft gains altitude or speed from rising air.<p>After launching, glider pilots search for rising air to gain height. If conditions are good enough, experienced pilots can fly many hundreds, and in some cases thousands, of kilometres before returning to their home airfields. However, if the weather deteriorates they must often land elsewhere, but some can avoid this by using engines.<p>While many glider pilots merely enjoy the sense of achievement, some competitive pilots fly in races around pre-defined courses. These <!--del_lnk--> competitions test the pilots&#39; abilities to make best use of local weather conditions as well as their flying skills. Local and national competitions are organized in many countries and there are also biennial <!--del_lnk--> World Gliding Championships.<p>Powered aircraft and winches are the two most common means of launching gliders. These and other methods (apart from self-launching motor-gliders) require assistance from other participants. Gliding clubs have thus been established to share airfields and equipment, train new pilots and maintain high safety standards.<p>

      <p>The development of heavier-than-air flight in the half-century between <!--del_lnk--> Sir George Cayley&#39;s coachman in 1853 and the <a href="../../wp/w/Wright_brothers.htm" title="Wright brothers">Wright brothers</a> mainly involved gliders (see <!--del_lnk--> aviation history). However, the <i>sport</i> of gliding only emerged after the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">First World War</a> as a result of the <a href="../../wp/t/Treaty_of_Versailles.htm" title="Treaty of Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, which imposed severe restrictions on the manufacture and use of single-seat powered aircraft in <a href="../../wp/w/Weimar_Republic.htm" title="Weimar Republic">Germany</a>. Thus, in the 1920s and 1930s, while aviators and aircraft makers in the rest of the world were working to improve the performance of powered aircraft, the Germans were designing, developing and flying ever more efficient gliders and discovering ways of using the natural forces in the atmosphere to make them fly farther and faster.<p>The first German gliding competition was held at the <!--del_lnk--> Wasserkuppe in 1920, organized by <!--del_lnk--> Oskar Ursinus. The best flight lasted two minutes and set a world distance record of 2 km. Within ten years, it had become an international event in which the achieved durations and distances had increased greatly. In 1931, Gunther Gr&ouml;nhoff flew 272 km (169 miles) from <a href="../../wp/m/Munich.htm" title="Munich">Munich</a> to <!--del_lnk--> Czechoslovakia, further than had been thought possible.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>In the 1930s, gliding spread to many other countries. In the <!--del_lnk--> 1936 Summer Olympics in <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin.htm" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> gliding was a <!--del_lnk--> demonstration sport, and it was scheduled to be a full Olympic sport in the <!--del_lnk--> 1940 Games. A glider, the <!--del_lnk--> Olympia, was developed in Germany for the event, but <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> intervened. By 1939 the major gliding records were held by <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russians</a>, including a distance record of 748 km (465 miles).<p>During the war, civilian gliding in Europe was largely suspended. Although some military operations in WWII involved <!--del_lnk--> military gliders, they did not soar and so are unrelated to the sport of gliding. Nonetheless, several German <!--del_lnk--> fighter aces in the conflict, including <!--del_lnk--> Erich Hartmann, began their flight training in gliders.<p>Gliding did not return to the Olympics after the war, for two reasons: first, the shortage of gliders following the war; and second, the failure to agree on a single model of competition glider. (Some in the community feared doing so would hinder development of new designs.) The re-introduction of <!--del_lnk--> air sports such as gliding to the Olympics has been occasionally proposed by the world governing body, the <!--del_lnk--> FAI, but this has been rejected on the grounds of lack of public interest.<p>Still, in many countries during the 1950s there were a large number of trained pilots who wanted to continue flying. Many were also <!--del_lnk--> aeronautical engineers. They started both clubs and <!--del_lnk--> manufacturers, many of which still exist. This stimulated the development of both gliding and gliders; for example, the <!--del_lnk--> Soaring Society of America grew from 1,000 members then to its present total of 16,000. The increased numbers of pilots, greater knowledge and improving technology helped set new records, so that the pre-war altitude record was doubled by 1950, and the first 1,000-km (621 statute miles) flight was done in 1964. New materials such as <!--del_lnk--> glass fibre and <!--del_lnk--> carbon fibre, advances in <!--del_lnk--> wing shapes, electronic instruments, <!--del_lnk--> GPS and improved weather forecasting have since allowed many pilots to make flights that were once extraordinary. Today almost 500 pilots have made flights over 1,000 km.<p>Instead of Olympic competition there are the <!--del_lnk--> World Gliding Championships. The first event was held at the Wasserkuppe in 1937. Since WWII it has been held every two years. There are now six <!--del_lnk--> classes open to both sexes, plus three classes for women and two junior classes. <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>, the sport&#39;s birthplace, is still a centre of the gliding world: it accounts for 30% of the world&#39;s glider pilots, and the three major <!--del_lnk--> glider manufacturers are still based there. However the sport has been taken up in many countries and there are now over 116,000 active glider pilots, plus an unknown number of military cadets. Each year many other people experience their first glider flight. It does not matter whether the countries are flat or mountainous, hot or temperate, because gliders can soar in most places.<p><a id="Soaring" name="Soaring"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Soaring</span></h2>

      <p>Glider pilots can stay airborne for hours by flying through air that is ascending as fast or faster than the glider itself is descending, thus gaining <!--del_lnk--> potential energy. The most commonly used sources of rising air are:<blockquote>
       <ul>
        <li><!--del_lnk--> thermals (updrafts of warm air),<li><!--del_lnk--> ridge lift (found where the wind blows against the face of a hill and is forced to rise), and<li><!--del_lnk--> wave lift (<!--del_lnk--> standing waves in the <a href="../../wp/e/Earth%2527s_atmosphere.htm" title="Earth&#39;s atmosphere">atmosphere</a>, analogous to the ripples on the surface of a stream).</ul>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Ridge lift rarely allows pilots to climb much higher than about 600&nbsp;m (2,000&nbsp;ft) above the terrain; thermals, depending on the climate and terrain, can allow climbs in excess of 3,000&nbsp;m (10,000&nbsp;ft) in flat country and much higher above mountains; wave lift has allowed a glider to reach an altitude of 15,447&nbsp;m (50,671&nbsp;ft). In a few countries gliders can continue to climb into the clouds in uncontrolled airspace but in many countries the pilot must stop climbing before reaching cloud-base (see <!--del_lnk--> Visual Flight Rules).<div style="float:left;border:none;width:200px;margin:1em 1em 0 0;padding:0">

      <p><a id="Thermals" name="Thermals"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Thermals</span></h4>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Thermals are streams of rising air that are formed on the ground through the warming of the surface by sunlight. If the air contains enough moisture, the water will condense from the rising air and form <!--del_lnk--> cumulus clouds. Once a thermal is encountered, the pilot usually flies in circles to keep the glider within the thermal, so gaining altitude before flying off to the next thermal and towards the destination. This is known as &#39;thermalling&#39;. Climb rates depend on conditions, but rates of several meters per second are common. Thermals can also be formed in a line usually because of the wind or the terrain, creating <!--del_lnk--> cloud streets. These can allow the pilot to fly straight while climbing in continuous lift.<p>When the air has little moisture or when an <!--del_lnk--> inversion stops the warm air from rising high enough for the moisture to condense, thermals do not create cumulus clouds. Without clouds or <!--del_lnk--> dust devils to mark the thermals, the pilot must use his skill and luck to find them using a sensitive vertical speed indicator called a <!--del_lnk--> variometer that quickly indicates climbs or descents. Typical locations to find thermals are over towns, freshly <!--del_lnk--> ploughed fields and <!--del_lnk--> asphalt roads, but thermals are often hard to associate with any feature on the ground. Occasionally thermals are caused by the exhaust gases from <!--del_lnk--> power stations or by fires.<p>As it requires rising heated air, thermalling is only effective in mid-latitudes from spring through into late summer. During winter the solar heat can only create weak thermals, but ridge and wave lift can still be used during this period.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p><a id="Ridge_lift" name="Ridge_lift"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Ridge lift</span></h4>
      <p>A <!--del_lnk--> ridge soaring pilot uses air lifted up the sides of hills. It can also be augmented by thermals when the slopes also face the sun. In places where a steady wind blows, a ridge may allow virtually unlimited time aloft, though records for duration are no longer recognized because of the danger of <!--del_lnk--> exhaustion.<p><a id="Wave_lift" name="Wave_lift"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Wave lift</span></h4>
      <p>The powerfully rising and sinking air in <!--del_lnk--> mountain waves was discovered by a glider pilot, <!--del_lnk--> Wolf Hirth, in 1933. Gliders can sometimes climb in these waves to great altitudes, if pilots use supplementary <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> to avoid <!--del_lnk--> hypoxia. This lift is often marked by long, stationary <!--del_lnk--> lenticular (lens-shaped) clouds lying perpendicular to the wind. Most altitude records for gliders have been set this way, though <a href="../../wp/t/Thunderstorm.htm" title="Thunderstorm">thunderstorms</a> have also accounted for a share. The current world distance record of 3,008&nbsp;km (1,869 statute miles) by Klaus Ohlmann (set on <!--del_lnk--> 21 January <!--del_lnk--> 2003) was flown using mountain waves in <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a>.<p>A rare wave phenomenon is known as <!--del_lnk--> Morning Glory, a <!--del_lnk--> roll cloud producing strong lift. Pilots near Australia&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Gulf of Carpentaria make use of it in <a href="../../wp/s/Spring_%2528season%2529.htm" title="Spring (season)">springtime</a>.<p><a id="Other_sources_of_lift" name="Other_sources_of_lift"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Launch methods</span></h2>

      <p>Aerotows normally use single-engined light aircraft, although <!--del_lnk--> motor gliders have also been permitted to tow gliders. The tow-plane takes the glider to the desired height and place and the glider pilot releases the rope. A weak link is often fitted to the rope to ensure that any sudden loads do not damage the <!--del_lnk--> airframe of the tow-plane.<p>During the aerotow, the glider pilot keeps the glider in one of two positions behind the tow-plane. This position can either be the &quot;low tow&quot; position, just below the <!--del_lnk--> wake from the tow-plane, or the &quot;high tow&quot; position just above the wake. In <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a> the convention is to fly in low tow, whereas in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> the high tow prevails. One aerotow variation is to attach two gliders to one tow-plane, using a short rope for the high towed glider and the long rope for the low tow.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p><a id="Winch-launching" name="Winch-launching"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Winch-launching</span></h4>
      <p>Gliders are often launched using a stationary ground-based <!--del_lnk--> winch mounted on a heavy vehicle. This method is widely used at many European clubs, often in addition to aerotowing. The engine is usually a large <!--del_lnk--> diesel, though <!--del_lnk--> hydraulic fluid engines and <!--del_lnk--> electrical motors are also used. The winch pulls in a 1,000 to 1,600&nbsp;m (3,000 to 5,500-foot) cable, made of steel wire or a synthetic fibre, attached to the glider. The cable is released at a height of about 400 to 500&nbsp;m (1,300 to 1,600 feet) after a short and steep ride.<p>The main advantage of a winch launch is its lower cost. However, the launch height is usually lower than an aerotow, so flights are shorter unless the pilot can quickly make contact with a source of lift within a few minutes of releasing the cable. Although there is a risk of the cable breaking during this type of launch, pilots are trained to deal with this.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>In a few places, gliders are launched from the top of a hill into a strong breeze using a rubber band, or &quot;<!--del_lnk--> bungee&quot;. For this launch method, the glider&#39;s main wheel rests in a small concrete trough. The hook normally used for winch-launching is instead attached to the middle of the bungee. Each end is then pulled by three or four people. One group runs slightly to the left, the other to the right. Once the tension in the bungee is high enough, the pilot releases the wheel brake and the glider&#39;s wheel pops out of the trough. The glider gains just enough energy to leave the ground and fly away from the hill.<p>Another launch method, the &quot;autotow&quot;, was used more frequently in the past. It requires a long runway, a <!--del_lnk--> pick-up truck and the cable. After gently taking up slack in the cable, the driver <a href="../../wp/a/Acceleration.htm" title="Acceleration">accelerates</a> hard and the glider rises like a kite to as much as 400 m (1300 feet) if there is a good <!--del_lnk--> headwind and a <!--del_lnk--> runway of 1.5&nbsp;km (1 mile) or more. This method has been employed upon various desert <!--del_lnk--> dry lakes. A variation on this is the &quot;reverse pulley&quot; method in which the truck drives towards the glider that it is launching with the cable passing around a pulley at the far end of the airfield. A third method uses a pulley on the vehicle, with one end of the cable fixed - a dangerous method since the glider will be pulled twice as fast as the vehicle travels, and so requiring an experienced and cautious driver.<p>Glider pilots who want to use the different types of launch methods must be in current practice in each. <!--del_lnk--> Licensing rules in some countries differentiate between aerotows and ground launch methods, due to the widely different techniques.<p><a id="Cross-country" name="Cross-country"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Cross-country</span></h2>

      <p>The distance that a glider can fly for each meter it descends is expressed as its <!--del_lnk--> lift-to-drag ratio. Depending on the <!--del_lnk--> class, this can be between 44:1 and 70:1 in modern designs. This performance combined with regular sources of rising air enables gliders to fly long distances at high speeds. The record speed for 1,000 km is 169.7 km/h (621 statute miles at 105 miles/h). Even in places with less favorable conditions (such as <!--del_lnk--> Northern Europe) most skilled pilots complete flights over 500&nbsp;km (310 miles) every year.<p>As the performance of gliders improved in the 1960s, the concept of flying as far away as possible became unpopular with the crews who had to retrieve the gliders. Pilots now usually plan to fly around a course (called a <i>task</i>) via <!--del_lnk--> turn-points, returning to the starting point.<p>Initially, ground observers confirmed that pilots had rounded the turn-points. Later, the glider pilots photographed these places and submitted the film for verification. Today, gliders carry secure <!--del_lnk--> GNSS Flight Recorders that record the position every few seconds from <!--del_lnk--> GPS satellites. These recording devices now provide the proof that the turn-points have been reached.<p>In addition to just trying to fly further, glider pilots also race each other in <!--del_lnk--> competitions. The winner is the fastest, or, if the weather conditions are poor, the furthest round the course. Tasks of up to 1,000&nbsp;km have been set and speeds of 120&nbsp;km/h are not unusual.<p>National competitions generally last one week, with international championships running over two. The winner is the pilot who has amassed the greatest number of points over all the contest days. However, these competitions have as yet failed to draw much interest outside the gliding community for several reasons. Because it would be unsafe for many gliders to cross a start line at the same time, pilots can choose their own start time. Furthermore, gliders are not visible to the spectators for long periods during each day&#39;s contest and the scoring is complex, so gliding competitions have been difficult to televise.<p>In an attempt to widen the sport&#39;s appeal, a new format, the Grand Prix, has been introduced. Innovations introduced in the Grand Prix format include simultaneous starts for a small number of gliders, tasks consisting of multiple circuits, and simplified scoring. There is decentralized Internet based competition called the <!--del_lnk--> Online Contest where pilots upload their GPS data files and are automatically scored based on distance flown. 7,800 pilots worldwide participated in this contest in 2006.<p><a id="Maximizing_speed" name="Maximizing_speed"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Maximizing speed</span></h3>
      <p>Soaring pioneer <!--del_lnk--> Paul MacCready is usually credited with developing a <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematical</a> <!--del_lnk--> theory for optimizing the speed to fly when cross-country soaring, though it was first described by Wolfgang Sp&auml;te (who later became famous for flying <!--del_lnk--> Messerschmitt Me 163 <i>Komet</i> rocket fighters with the Luftwaffe late in World War II) in 1938. The <!--del_lnk--> speed to fly theory allows the optimal cruising speed between thermals to be computed, using thermal strength, glider performance and other variables. It accounts for the fact that if a pilot flies faster between thermals, the next thermal is reached sooner. However at higher speeds the glider also sinks faster, requiring the pilot to spend more time circling to regain the altitude. The MacCready speed represents the optimal trade-off between cruising and circling. Most competition pilots use MacCready theory to optimize their flight speeds, and have the calculations programmed in their flight computers. The greatest factor in maximizing speed, however, remains the ability of the pilot to find the strongest lift.<p>On cross-country flights where strong thermals are forecast, pilots fly with water <!--del_lnk--> ballast, which is stored in tanks in the <!--del_lnk--> wings. Ballast makes the glider fly faster, but slows its climb rate in thermals. However, if the thermals are strong, the disadvantage of slower climbs are outweighed by the higher cruising speeds between them. Thus, the pilot can improve the speed over the course by several percent. To prevent over-stressing the glider, the flight manuals of gliders require that pilots dump their water before landing.<p><a id="Badges" name="Badges"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Badges</span></h3>
      <p>Achievements in gliding have been marked by the awarding of badges since the 1920s. For the lower badges, such as the first solo flight, national gliding federations set their own criteria. Typically, a bronze badge shows preparation for cross-country flight, including precise landings and a pair of two-hour flights. Higher badges follow the standards set down by the <!--del_lnk--> Federation Aeronautique Internationale (FAI). The FAI&#39;s Sporting Code defines the rules for observers and recording devices to validate the claims for badges, which are defined by kilometers of distance and meters of altitude gained. The Silver-C badge was introduced in 1930. Earning the Silver Badge shows that a glider pilot has achieved an altitude gain of at least 1,000&nbsp;m, made a five-hour duration flight, and has flown cross-country for a straight-line distance of at least 50&nbsp;km, usually, but not invariably, in separate flights. The Gold and Diamond Badges require pilots to fly higher and further. A pilot who has completed the three parts of the Diamond Badge has flown 300&nbsp;km to a pre-defined goal, has flown 500&nbsp;km in one flight (but not necessarily to a pre-defined goal) and gained 5,000&nbsp;m in height. The FAI also issues a diploma for a flight of 1,000&nbsp;km and further diplomas for increments of 250&nbsp;km.<p><a id="Landing_out" name="Landing_out"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Landing out</span></h3>

      <p>If lift is not found during a cross-country flight, for example because of deteriorating weather, the pilot must choose a field and &#39;land out&#39;. Although inconvenient and often mistaken for &quot;emergency landings&quot;, landing out (or &quot;outlanding&quot;) is a routine event in cross-country gliding. The pilot has to choose a field where the glider can be landed safely, without damaging property such as crops or livestock.<p>The glider and the pilot(s) can be retrieved from the field using a purpose-built trailer. Alternatively, if the glider has landed in a suitable field, a tow-plane can be summoned to re-launch the aircraft (as long as the property owner gives permission). The glider pilot typically pays for the time the tow-plane is in the air, both to and from the field, so this alternative can become expensive.<p><a id="Use_of_engines" name="Use_of_engines"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Use of engines</span></h3>

      <p>To avoid the inconvenience of landing out, some gliders are <!--del_lnk--> motor gliders, optionally fitted with a small engine and a retractable propeller, adding both weight and expense. &quot;Self-launching&quot; motor gliders have engines that are powerful enough to launch the glider unaided. In &quot;self-sustaining&quot; motor gliders these engines are not powerful enough for launch, but can provide enough power to climb slowly and return to the home airfield. However, engines have to be started at a height that includes a margin that would still allow a safe landing-out to be made, if the engine were to fail to start.<p>In a competition, starting the engine ends the soaring flight. Gliders without an engine are lighter and, as they do not need a safety margin for an engine-start, they can safely thermal at lower altitudes in weaker conditions. So, pilots in unpowered gliders may complete competition flights when some powered competitors cannot. Conversely, motor glider pilots can start the engine if conditions will no longer support soaring flight, while unpowered gliders will have to land out, away from the home airfield, requiring retrieval by road using the glider&#39;s trailer.<p><!--del_lnk--> Touring motor gliders have a non-retractable propeller. Since the additional <!--del_lnk--> drag reduces their performance, they are seldom used in competition. They can, however, be useful in training for cross-country flights. After take-off, the engine is switched off, and the trainee flies the aircraft as a glider. Landings in unfamiliar fields can be practiced while the motor idles. If the trainee chooses an inappropriate field, or misjudges the approach, the instructor can apply power and climb away safely, after pointing out the error.<p><a id="Aerobatics" name="Aerobatics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Aerobatics</span></h2>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Aerobatic competitions are held regularly. In this type of competition, the pilots fly a program of maneuvers (such as inverted flight, loop, roll, and various combinations). Each maneuver has a rating called the &quot;K-Factor&quot;. Maximum points are given for the maneuver if it is flown perfectly; otherwise, points are deducted. Efficient maneuvers also enable the whole program to be completed with the height available. The winner is the pilot with the most points.<p><a id="Hazards" name="Hazards"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Hazards</span></h2>
      <p>Gliders, unlike <!--del_lnk--> hang-gliders and <!--del_lnk--> paragliders, surround the pilot with a strong structure, so most accidents cause no injuries, but there are some hazards. Even though training and safe procedures are central to the ethos of the sport, a small number of fatal accidents occurs every year, almost all caused by pilot error. In particular there is a risk of mid-air collisions between gliders because the pilots tend to fly to the same areas of lift. To avoid other gliders and <!--del_lnk--> general aviation traffic, pilots must comply with the rules of the air and keep a good lookout. They also usually wear <!--del_lnk--> parachutes.

      <p>Most clubs offer trial lessons to people interested in learning to glide. <!--del_lnk--> National gliding associations have contact details for their member clubs. The pupil flies with an instructor in a two-seat glider fitted with dual controls. The instructor does the first launches and landings but otherwise the pupil uses the controls. Some clubs offer courses over several days, though, with a mixture of winch and aerotow launches, it often takes <!--del_lnk--> ab initios at least 50 training flights before they are allowed to fly solo.<p>If winches are used, the cost of learning to glide is much less than that of learning to fly powered aircraft. Training using aerotow costs more than using winches, even though fewer launches (as few as 30) might be needed. <!--del_lnk--> Simulators are also beginning to be used in training, especially during poor weather.<p>Early solo flights are restricted to within gliding range of the airfield. Further training continues after the first solo until the pupil is judged capable of taking a glider cross-country. Pilots must also familiarize themselves with the regulations, use of the radio, weather and navigation.<p><a id="Related_air_sports" name="Related_air_sports"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Related air sports</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Hang-gliding uses simpler and cheaper aircraft in which <!--del_lnk--> pilots exercise control by shifting body weight, whereas glider-pilots use conventional flight controls. Hang-gliders typically use fabric <!--del_lnk--> wings, shaped over a rigid framework. The lower aerodynamic efficiency of these wings means that shorter cross-country distances are flown than in gliders. Unlike the hang-gliders&#39; wings, <!--del_lnk--> paragliders&#39; wings have no frames and their shape is entirely formed by the pressure of the air. The aerodynamic efficiency of paragliders is lower still and so cross-country flights are even shorter. <!--del_lnk--> Radio-controlled gliding uses scale-models of gliders mainly for ridge soaring.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliding&quot;</div>
