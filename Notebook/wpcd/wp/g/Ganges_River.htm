Along with another river <!--del_lnk--> Yamuna, it forms a large and fertile <!--del_lnk--> basin, known as the <!--del_lnk--> Gangetic plains, stretching across north India and Bangladesh, and supports one of the highest densities of human population in the world.

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Gangotri Glacier in the <!--del_lnk--> Uttaranchal <a href="../../wp/h/Himalayas.htm" title="Himalaya">Himalayas</a> is the origin of the <!--del_lnk--> Bhagirathi river, which joins the <!--del_lnk--> Alaknanda river at <!--del_lnk--> Devaprayag, also in the Uttaranchal Himalayas, to form the Ganga. The river then flows through the Himalayan <!--del_lnk--> valleys and emerges into the <!--del_lnk--> north Indian plain at the town of <!--del_lnk--> Haridwar. This section sees extensive <!--del_lnk--> whitewater rafting and <!--del_lnk--> kayaking from September to March.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The Ganga then flows across the broad plains of north India (called the <!--del_lnk--> Gangetic Plains) and forms the major <!--del_lnk--> river basin of that vast region. Its tributaries include the Kosi, the <!--del_lnk--> Gomti, the Sone, and above all, the Yamuna. The <!--del_lnk--> Yamuna River &mdash; a major river in its own right, and nearly as endowed with the sanctity of religious tradition and <!--del_lnk--> legend as the Ganga, is in fact a <!--del_lnk--> tributary of the Ganga; their confluence marks the site of the pilgrim town of <!--del_lnk--> Prayag, now known as <!--del_lnk--> Allahabad. Not only sites of religious significance, but also many of the most populous industrial cities of northern India, lie on the banks of the Ganga, including <!--del_lnk--> Kanpur, <!--del_lnk--> Allahabad, <a href="../../wp/v/Varanasi.htm" title="Varanasi">Varanasi</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Patna.htm" title="Patna">Patna</a>.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Swollen by the waters of a wide basin that draws from watersheds as diverse as the Himalayas and the <!--del_lnk--> Aravallis, the Ganga forms a formidable current in the stretch between Allahabad and <!--del_lnk--> Malda, and thereafter, a large <!--del_lnk--> delta. Near the town of <!--del_lnk--> Malda in <!--del_lnk--> West Bengal, it undergoes its first attrition with the branching away of the <!--del_lnk--> Hoogly, its first <!--del_lnk--> distributary. The city of <a href="../../wp/k/Kolkata.htm" title="Kolkata">Kolkata</a> (previously <!--del_lnk--> Calcutta) stands on the banks of the Hoogly. The main stream of the river (known as the <!--del_lnk--> Padma River) then enters <a href="../../wp/b/Bangladesh.htm" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>. Here, it unites with the <!--del_lnk--> Jamuna branch of the even larger <!--del_lnk--> Brahmaputra river. The combined stream then joins with the <!--del_lnk--> Meghna River before flowing out to sea. In the flat plains of <a href="../../wp/b/Bangladesh.htm" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, the Ganges splits almost immediately into a dense network of <!--del_lnk--> distributaries, all of which finally empty into the <a href="../../wp/b/Bay_of_Bengal.htm" title="Bay of Bengal">Bay of Bengal</a>.<p>The region encompassing the <!--del_lnk--> delta near the Bay of Bengal <!--del_lnk--> coast is known as <!--del_lnk--> The Sundarbans (<i>Beautiful Forests</i>) &mdash; a region of thick <!--del_lnk--> mangrove <a href="../../wp/f/Forest.htm" title="Forest">forests</a> and one of the major <!--del_lnk--> habitats of the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Bengal Tiger. Two <!--del_lnk--> species of <a href="../../wp/d/Dolphin.htm" title="Dolphin">dolphin</a> can be found in the Ganges, the <!--del_lnk--> Ganges River Dolphin and the <!--del_lnk--> Irrawaddy Dolphin. The Ganges is also notable in that it contains a rare species of <!--del_lnk--> freshwater shark, <i><!--del_lnk--> Glyphis gangeticus</i>, about which little is known.<p><a id="The_Ganga_in_Hinduism" name="The_Ganga_in_Hinduism"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Ganga in Hinduism</span></h2>

      <p>In <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, the river Ganga (feminine) is sacred. It is <!--del_lnk--> worshipped by <!--del_lnk--> Hindus and personified as a <!--del_lnk--> goddess, who holds an important place in the Hindu religion. Hindu belief holds that <!--del_lnk--> bathing in the river on certain occasions causes the forgiveness of <!--del_lnk--> sins and helps attain <!--del_lnk--> salvation. Many people believe that this will come from bathing in Ganga at any time. People travel from distant places to immerse the <!--del_lnk--> ashes of their <a href="../../wp/f/Family.htm" title="Family">kin</a> in the waters of the Ganga; this immersion also is believed to send the ashes to <!--del_lnk--> heaven. Several places sacred to Hindus lie along the banks of the river Ganga, including <!--del_lnk--> Haridwar and <a href="../../wp/v/Varanasi.htm" title="Varanasi">Kashi</a>. People carry sacred water from the Ganges that is sealed in copper pots after making the <!--del_lnk--> pilgrimage to Kashi. It is believed that drinking water from the Ganga with one&#39;s last breath will take the soul to heaven.<p>Hindus also believe life is incomplete without bathing in the Ganga at least once in their lifetime.<p>In most Hindu families, a <!--del_lnk--> vial of water from the Ganga is kept in every house. This is done because it is auspicious to have water of the Holy Ganga in the house, and also if someone is dying, that person will be able to drink its water.<p>Many Hindus believe that the water from the Ganga can cleanse a person&#39;s soul of all past sins, and that it can also cure the ill. The ancient scriptures mention that the water of Ganges carries the blessings of the Lord&#39;s feet. Hence mother Ganges is also known as Visnupadi [Emanating from the Lotus feet of Supreme Lord Sri Visnu].<p>Some of the most important Hindu <!--del_lnk--> festivals and religious <!--del_lnk--> congregations are celebrated on the banks of the river Ganga such as the Kumbh mela or the Kumbh fair and the chhat puja.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The most important city sacred to <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> on the banks of the River Ganga is <b>Varanasi</b> or <b>Banaras</b>. It has hundreds of <!--del_lnk--> temples along the banks of the Ganga which often get flooded during the rains. This city, especially along the banks of the Ganga, is an important place of worship for the Hindus as well as a cremation ground.<p><a id="Ganga_in_Vedas" name="Ganga_in_Vedas"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Ganga in Vedas</span></h4>
      <p>The Ganga is mentioned in the Rig-Veda, the earliest of the <!--del_lnk--> Hindu <!--del_lnk--> scriptures. The Ganga is mentioned in the nadistuti (Rig Veda 10.75), which lists the rivers from east to west. In RV 6.45.31, the word Ganga is also mentioned, but it is not clear if the reference is to the river.<p>RV 3.58.6 says that &quot;your ancient home, your auspicious friendship, O Heroes, your wealth is on the banks of the Jahnavi (JahnAvyAm)&quot;. This verse could possibly refer to the Ganga. In RV 1.116.18-19, the Jahnavi and the Gangetic dolphin occur in two adjacent verses.  <p>During the early Indo-Aryan Ages, the <!--del_lnk--> Indus and the <!--del_lnk--> Saraswati were the major rivers, not the Ganga. But the later three <!--del_lnk--> Vedas seem to give much more importance to the Ganga, as shown by its numerous references.<p>According to the Hindu Purans, Goddess Ganga used to exist only in Heaven. Then prince Bhagirath worshipped Ganga to descend on earth. This is why Ganga is also known as Bhagirathi. In the Mahabharath this story is also mentioned. In fact, Ganga is a major character in the Mahabharath, where she&#39;s the mother of Bhisma.<p><a id="River_Ganges_in_Western_culture" name="River_Ganges_in_Western_culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">River Ganges in Western culture</span></h2>

      <p>In Rome&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Piazza Navona, there is a famous sculpture <i><!--del_lnk--> Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi</i> (fountain of the four rivers), a marvelous sculptural and architectural creation by <!--del_lnk--> Gian Lorenzo Bernini, set up in 1651. It symbolises four of the world&#39;s great rivers (the Ganges, the Nile, the Danube and the Plata), representing the four continents known at the time. The picture alongside shows River Ganges as visualised by Bernini.<p><a id="Pollution" name="Pollution"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Pollution</span></h2>
      <p>The Ganges collects large amounts of human <a href="../../wp/p/Pollution.htm" title="Pollution">pollutants</a> as it flows through highly populous areas. These populous areas, and other people down stream, are then exposed to these potentially hazardous accumulations. While proposals have been made for remediating this condition so far no great progress has been achieved.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The major <a href="../../wp/p/Pollution.htm" title="Pollution">polluting</a> <!--del_lnk--> industries on the Ganges are the <!--del_lnk--> leather industries, especially near <!--del_lnk--> Kanpur, which use large amounts of <a href="../../wp/c/Chromium.htm" title="Chromium">chromium</a> and other <!--del_lnk--> chemicals, and much of it finds its way into the meager flow of the Ganga. Unfortunately, this is a boom time for leather processing in <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, which many view as a form of eco-environmental dumping on the third world, and with the lax and lubricable implementation systems of the <!--del_lnk--> Uttar Pradesh government, it does not seem likely that this will go down. The <!--del_lnk--> World Bank report of <!--del_lnk--> 1992, which focused on the environmental issues, mentions the dissolved-<a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> and the river-borne decomposing material at two focal points on the Ganga.<p>However, industry is not the only source of pollution. The sheer volume of waste &mdash; estimated at nearly 1 billion litres per day - of mostly untreated raw <!--del_lnk--> sewage &mdash; is a significant factor. Also, inadequate <!--del_lnk--> cremation procedures contributes to a large number of partially burnt or unburnt <!--del_lnk--> corpses floating down the Ganga, in addition to <!--del_lnk--> livestock corpses.<p>The Ganga Action Plan has been set up under the Indian <a href="../../wp/g/Government.htm" title="Government">Government</a> <!--del_lnk--> bureaucracy and is attempting to build a number of <!--del_lnk--> waste treatment facilities, under <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> and <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> support, and to collaborate with a number of voluntary organizations. Surprisingly, the <!--del_lnk--> Hindu political parties in India are not very active in the efforts to clean up the Ganga, and it is not very high on the general religious agenda. India&#39;s government has already spent over $33 million to address the overwhelming sewage problem. However, things are looking better at the beginning of <!--del_lnk--> 2006, as <!--del_lnk--> satellite images show increased water clarity in the river.<p><a id="Ganges_Canal" name="Ganges_Canal"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Ganges Canal</span></h2>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Ganges Canal was dug from <!--del_lnk--> Haridwar to <!--del_lnk--> Kanpur in the latter half of the 19th century, and a very wide network of small <!--del_lnk--> tributary <a href="../../wp/c/Canal.htm" title="Canal">canals</a> were constructed from the main canal to act as source of irrigation in the fertile <!--del_lnk--> plains of Western <!--del_lnk--> Uttar Pradesh. The <!--del_lnk--> University of Roorkee was established at <!--del_lnk--> Roorkee to train <!--del_lnk--> Civil Engineers who could oversee the construction of this canal.
