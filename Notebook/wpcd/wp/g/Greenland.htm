      <p>Greenland was home to a number of <!--del_lnk--> Paleo-Eskimo cultures in <!--del_lnk--> prehistory, the latest of which (the <!--del_lnk--> Early Dorset culture) disappeared around the year <!--del_lnk--> 200 AD. Hereafter, the island seems to have been uninhabited for some eight centuries.<p><a href="../../wp/i/Iceland.htm" title="Iceland">Icelandic</a> settlers found the land uninhabited when they arrived <!--del_lnk--> c.<!--del_lnk--> 982. They established three settlements near the very southwestern tip of the island, where they thrived for the next few centuries, and then disappeared after over 450 years of habitation.<p>The fjords of the southern part of the island were lush and had a warmer climate at that time, possibly due to what was called the <!--del_lnk--> Medieval Warm Period. These remote communities thrived and lived off farming, hunting and trading with the motherland, and when the Scandinavian monarchs converted their domains to <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, a bishop was installed in Greenland as well. The settlements seem to have coexisted relatively peacefully with the <!--del_lnk--> Inuit, who had migrated southwards from the Arctic islands of North America around <!--del_lnk--> 1200. In <!--del_lnk--> 1261, Greenland became part of the Kingdom of Norway. Norway in turn entered into the <!--del_lnk--> Kalmar Union in <!--del_lnk--> 1397 and later the personal union of Denmark-Norway.<p>After almost five hundred years, the Scandinavian settlements simply vanished, possibly due to famine during the <a href="../../wp/1/15th_century.htm" title="15th century">fifteenth century</a> in the <!--del_lnk--> Little Ice Age, when climatic conditions deteriorated, and contact with Europe was lost. Bones from this late period were found to be in a condition consistent with malnutrition. Some believe the settlers were wiped out by <!--del_lnk--> bubonic plague or exterminated by the Inuit. Other historians have speculated that <!--del_lnk--> Basque or <!--del_lnk--> English <!--del_lnk--> pirates or <!--del_lnk--> slave traders from the <!--del_lnk--> Barbary Coast contributed to the extinction of the Greenlandic communities.<p>Denmark-Norway reasserted its latent claim to the colony in <!--del_lnk--> 1721. The island&#39;s ties with Norway were severed by the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Kiel of 1814, through which <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> gained control over mainland Norway while Denmark retained all of their common overseas possessions, which, at that time, included small territories in <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, <!--del_lnk--> West Africa and the <!--del_lnk--> West Indies, as well as the <a href="../../wp/f/Faroe_Islands.htm" title="Faroe Islands">Faroe Islands</a>, Iceland and Greenland.<p>Norway occupied and claimed parts of (then uninhabited) <!--del_lnk--> East Greenland aka <!--del_lnk--> Erik the Red&#39;s Land in July 1931, claiming that it constituted <!--del_lnk--> Terra nullius. Norway and Denmark agreed to settle the matter at the <!--del_lnk--> Permanent Court of International Justice in <!--del_lnk--> 1933, where Norway lost.<p>During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Greenland&#39;s connection to Denmark was severed on <!--del_lnk--> April 9, <!--del_lnk--> 1940 when Denmark was occupied by <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>, and Greenland was on its own. Through the <!--del_lnk--> cryolite from the mine in <!--del_lnk--> Ivigtut, Greenland was able to pay for goods bought in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> and Canada. During the War the system of government changed. <!--del_lnk--> Eske Brun was governor and ruled the Island via a <!--del_lnk--> 1925 law concerning the governing of the Island where, under extreme circumstances, the governors could take control. The other governor, Aksel Svane, was transferred to the United States as leader of the commission to supply Greenland. The <!--del_lnk--> Sirius Patrol, guarding the Northeastern shores of Greenland using <!--del_lnk--> dog sleds, detected and destroyed several German weather stations, giving Denmark a better position in the postwar turmoil.<p>Greenland had until 1940 been a protected and thereby isolated society. The Danish government, which governed the colonies of Greenland, had been convinced that the society would face exploitation from the outside world or even extinction if the country was opened up. During World War II, though, Greenland developed a sense of self-reliance during its period of self-government and independent communication with the outside world.<p>However, in 1946 a commission (with the highest Greenlandic council Landsr&aring;det as participant) recommended patience and no radical reformation of the system. Two years later the first step towards an alteration of the governing of Greenland was initiated as a grand commission was founded. In 1950 the report (G-50) was presented. Greenland was to be a modern welfare society with Denmark as the sponsor and example. In 1953 Greenland was made an equal part of the Danish Kingdom.<p>In 1979 home rule was granted.<p><a id="Etymology" name="Etymology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Etymology</span></h2>
      <p>The name Greenland comes from <!--del_lnk--> Scandinavian settlers. In the <!--del_lnk--> Norse sagas, it is said that <!--del_lnk--> Erik the Red was exiled from <a href="../../wp/i/Iceland.htm" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> for murder. He, along with his extended family and <!--del_lnk--> thralls, set out in <a href="../../wp/s/Ship.htm" title="Ship">ships</a> to find the land that was rumored to be to the northwest. After settling there, he named the land <i>Gr&oslash;nland</i> (&quot;Greenland&quot;), possibly in order to attract more people to settle there. Greenland was also called Gruntland (&quot;Ground-land&quot;) on early maps. Whether Green is an erroneous transcription of Grunt (&quot;Ground&quot;), which refers to shallow bays, or vice versa, is not known. It should also be noted, however, that the southern portion of Greenland (not covered by glacier) is indeed very green in the summer.<p><a id="Sovereignty" name="Sovereignty"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sovereignty</span></h2>
      <p>There is an on-going diplomatic <!--del_lnk--> sovereignty dispute between <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a> and Greenland (represented internationally by <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>) over the tiny <!--del_lnk--> Hans Island.<p>Greenland was one of the <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norwegian</a> Crown colonies from the <a href="../../wp/1/11th_century.htm" title="11th century">eleventh century</a> until <!--del_lnk--> 1814. At that time, the Kingdom of Norway and Denmark (the Norwegian King having succeeded to the Danish throne a few centuries earlier; see <!--del_lnk--> Denmark-Norway) found itself on the losing side of the <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleonic_Wars.htm" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>. In gratitude to <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> for her assistance in defeating Napoleon (and as a consolation for the recent loss of <a href="../../wp/f/Finland.htm" title="Finland">Finland</a> to <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>), mainland <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a> and certain Norwegian territories were transferred to Sweden &mdash; thus, the <!--del_lnk--> personal union of Norway and Denmark ended. The crown colonies of Greenland, <a href="../../wp/i/Iceland.htm" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Faeroe Islands, however, remained part of the reorganised &quot;Kingdom of Denmark.&quot;<p>Greenland became an integral part of the Kingdom of Denmark in <!--del_lnk--> 1953. It was granted <!--del_lnk--> home rule by the <!--del_lnk--> Folketing (Danish parliament) in <!--del_lnk--> 1978. The law went into effect on <!--del_lnk--> May 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1979. The <!--del_lnk--> Queen of Denmark, <!--del_lnk--> Margrethe II, remains Greenland&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Head of State. Greenlandic voters subsequently chose to leave the <!--del_lnk--> European Economic Community upon achieving self-rule.<p>

If the <!--del_lnk--> Greenland ice sheet were to completely <!--del_lnk--> melt away, sea levels would rise more than 7&nbsp;m (23&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> feet)  and Greenland would most likely become an <!--del_lnk--> archipelago.<p>Between <!--del_lnk--> 1989 and <!--del_lnk--> 1993, U.S. and European <a href="../../wp/c/Climate.htm" title="Climate">climate</a> researchers drilled into the summit of Greenland&#39;s ice sheet, obtaining a pair of two-mile (3.2&nbsp;km) long <!--del_lnk--> ice cores. Analysis of the layering and chemical composition of the cores has provided a revolutionary new record of climate change in the <!--del_lnk--> Northern Hemisphere going back about 100,000 years and illustrated that the world&#39;s <a href="../../wp/w/Weather.htm" title="Weather">weather</a> and <!--del_lnk--> temperature have often shifted rapidly from one seemingly stable state to another, with worldwide <a href="../../wp/c/Climate_change.htm" title="Climate change">consequences</a>. The glaciers of Greenland are also contributing to global sea level rise at a faster rate than was previously believed.<p>In February 2006, researchers reported that Greenland&#39;s glaciers are melting twice as fast as they were five years ago. According to satellite gravity measurements, the annual loss was estimated at 216&nbsp;km&sup3;/yr (52 cubic miles per year) by 2005. Between 1991 and 2006, monitoring of the weather at one location (Swiss Camp) found that the average winter temperature had risen almost 10 degrees Fahrenheit.<p>The American Top of the World expedition found the northernmost island in the world off of Greenland: <!--del_lnk--> ATOW1996.<p><!--del_lnk--> Qaanaaq in North West Greenland, is the most northerly place whose name is a <!--del_lnk--> palindrome.<p><a id="Topology" name="Topology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Topology</span></h2>
      <p>About 81% of its surface is covered by <a href="../../wp/i/Ice.htm" title="Ice">ice</a>, known as the Greenlandic ice cap, the weight of which has depressed the central land area to form a basin lying more than 300&nbsp;m [1,000 ft] below the surrounding ocean.<p><a id="Natural_history" name="Natural_history"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Natural history</span></h2>

      <p>Greenland suffered economic contraction in the early <!--del_lnk--> 1990s, but since <!--del_lnk--> 1993 the economy has improved. The Greenland Home Rule Government (GHRG) has pursued a tight fiscal policy since the late <!--del_lnk--> 1980s which has helped create surpluses in the public budget and low inflation. Since <!--del_lnk--> 1990, Greenland has registered a foreign trade deficit following the closure of the last remaining <a href="../../wp/l/Lead.htm" title="Lead">lead</a> and <a href="../../wp/z/Zinc.htm" title="Zinc">zinc</a> mine in 1990. Greenland today is critically dependent on <a href="../../wp/f/Fishing.htm" title="Fishing">fishing</a> and <a href="../../wp/f/Fish.htm" title="Fish">fish</a> exports; the <!--del_lnk--> shrimp fishing industry is by far the largest income earner. Despite resumption of several interesting <!--del_lnk--> hydrocarbon and <!--del_lnk--> mineral exploration activities, it will take several years before production can materialize. <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">Tourism</a> is the only sector offering any near-term potential and even this is limited due to a short season and high costs. The public sector, including publicly owned enterprises and the municipalities, plays the dominant role in Greenland&#39;s economy. About half the government revenues come from grants from the Danish Government, an important supplement to the <!--del_lnk--> gross domestic product. <!--del_lnk--> GDP per capita is equivalent to that of the weaker economies of Europe.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>Greenland has a population of 56,361, of whom 87% are Greenlandic, a mixture of <!--del_lnk--> Inuit and European races. The majority of the population are <!--del_lnk--> Evangelical Lutherans. <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Danish and <!--del_lnk--> Greenlandic are all spoken by the population.<p>Nearly all Greenlanders live along the <!--del_lnk--> fjords in the south-west of the main island, which has a milder climate. Most Greenlanders have both <!--del_lnk--> Kalaallit (<!--del_lnk--> Inuit) and <!--del_lnk--> Scandinavian ancestry, and speak <!--del_lnk--> Greenlandic (Kalaallisut) as their first language. Greenlandic is spoken by about 50,000 people, which is more than all the other <!--del_lnk--> Eskimo-Aleut languages combined. A minority of Danish migrants with no <!--del_lnk--> Inuit ancestry speak <!--del_lnk--> Danish as their first language. Both languages are official with the West Greenlandic dialect forming the basis of the official form of Greenlandic.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

FIFA rules stipulate that member nations have minimum standard pitches for international games, which mandates natural grass.
