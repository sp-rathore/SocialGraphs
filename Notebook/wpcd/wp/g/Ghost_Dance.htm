      <p>Noted in historical accounts as the <b>Ghost Dance of 1890</b>, the Ghost Dance was a religious movement incorporated into numerous <!--del_lnk--> Native American belief systems. The traditional ritual used in the Ghost Dance, the <!--del_lnk--> circle dance, has been used by many Native Americans since pre-historic times, but was first performed in accordance with Jack Wilson&#39;s teachings among the <!--del_lnk--> Nevada <!--del_lnk--> Paiute in 1889. The practice swept throughout much of the American West, quickly reaching areas of <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Oklahoma, <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">USA</a>. As the Ghost Dance spread from its original source, Native American tribes synthesized selective aspects of the ritual with their own beliefs often creating change in both the <a href="../../wp/s/Society.htm" title="Society">society</a> that integrated it and the ritual itself. At the core of the movement was the <!--del_lnk--> prophet of peace <!--del_lnk--> Jack Wilson, known as <!--del_lnk--> Wovoka among the <!--del_lnk--> Paiute, who prophesized a nonviolent end to Euro-American expansion while preaching messages of clean living, an honest life, and cross-cultural cooperation. Perhaps the best known facet of the Ghost Dance movement is the role it reportedly played in instigating the <!--del_lnk--> Wounded Knee massacre in 1890, which resulted in the deaths of 391 <!--del_lnk--> Lakota <!--del_lnk--> Sioux. The Sioux variation on the Ghost Dance tended towards <!--del_lnk--> millenarianism, an innovation which distinguished the Sioux interpretation from Jack Wilson&#39;s original teachings.<p>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Northern Paiutes living in <!--del_lnk--> Mason Valley, in what is now the <a href="../../wp/u/U.S._state.htm" title="U.S. state">U.S. state</a> of <!--del_lnk--> Nevada, at the time of settlement by Euro-American homesteaders were known collectively as the T&ouml;vusi-d&ouml;kad&ouml;, (<b>T&ouml;vusi-</b>&nbsp;: <i><!--del_lnk--> Cyperus-bulb</i> and <b>d&ouml;kad&ouml;</b>&nbsp;: <i>eaters</i>). The Northern Paiute community thrived upon a subsistence pattern of <!--del_lnk--> foraging through this locally plentiful food source for a portion of the year, also augmenting their diets with fish, <!--del_lnk--> pine nuts, and the occasional clubbing of wild game.<p>The T&ouml;vusi-d&ouml;kad&ouml; lacked any permanent <!--del_lnk--> political organization or officials, instead operating within a less stratified social system of self-proclaimed spiritually blessed individuals organizing events or activities for the betterment of the group as a whole. Usually, a community event organized was centered on the observance of a ritual at a prescribed time of year or was intended to organize activities like harvests or hunting parties. One such extraordinary instance occurred in 1869; <!--del_lnk--> Hawthorne Wodziwob, a Paiute man, organized a series of community dances to announce a vision he claimed to have had. He spoke of a journey to the land of the dead, and of promises made to him by the souls of the recently deceased. They promised to return to their loved ones within a period of 3-4 years. Wodziwob&rsquo;s peers accepted this vision, probably due to his already reputable status as a <!--del_lnk--> healer, as he urged the populace to dance the common circle dance as was customary during a time of festival. He continued preaching this message for 3 years with the help of a local &quot;weather doctor&quot; named <!--del_lnk--> Tavibo, the father of Jack Wilson.<p>Previous to <!--del_lnk--> Wodziwob&rsquo;s religious movement, a devastating <!--del_lnk--> typhoid epidemic struck in 1867. This and other European diseases killed approximately one tenth of the total population, resulting in widespread psychological and emotional trauma and bringing grave disorder to the <!--del_lnk--> economic system. Many families were prevented from continuing their <!--del_lnk--> nomadic lifestyle, following pine nut harvests and wild game herds; without any other options, most of these partial families ended up in <!--del_lnk--> Virginia City seeking wage work.<p><a id="Round_dance_precursors" name="Round_dance_precursors"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Round dance precursors</span></h3>
      <p>The physical form of the ritual associated with Ghost Dance did not originate with Jack Wilson, nor did it die with him. Referred to as the &quot;round dance,&quot; it characteristically includes a circular community dance held around an individual who leads the ceremony. Often accompanying the ritual are intermissions of <!--del_lnk--> trance, exhortations, and <!--del_lnk--> prophesying.<p>The term &ldquo;<!--del_lnk--> prophet dances&rdquo; was applied during an investigation of Native American rituals carried out by <!--del_lnk--> anthropologist Leslie Spier, a student of <!--del_lnk--> Franz Boas. He noted that versions of the round dance were present throughout much of the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Northwest including the <!--del_lnk--> Columbia plateau (a region including <!--del_lnk--> Washington, <a href="../../wp/o/Oregon.htm" title="Oregon">Oregon</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Idaho, and parts of western <!--del_lnk--> Montana). However Spier&rsquo;s study was conducted at a time when most of these rituals had already incorporated <!--del_lnk--> Christian elements, further complicating the investigation of the round dance&rsquo;s origin.<p>European impact on native populations (oftentimes prior to actual physical exploration of the more remote regions of the continent) has traditionally made it difficult to acquire &quot;pristine&quot; data on North American societies during their supposedly &quot;pre-historic&quot; or &quot;proto-historic&quot; eras. Changes in Native American societies before physical contact with Europeans can be attributed to severe disease epidemics, an increased frequency and volume in trade caused by the introduction of European goods or from Europeans purchasing local resources, and the introduction of the horse (which revolutionized the foraging lifestyle for some <!--del_lnk--> aboriginal societies).<p><!--del_lnk--> Enculturation and <!--del_lnk--> diffusion are not the only explanations for the common circle dance rituals. Anthropologist <!--del_lnk--> James Mooney was one of the first to study circle dances and observed striking similarities in rituals between tribes. However he also claimed that &ldquo;a hope and longing common to all humanity, manifests through behavior rooted in human physiology and common experience,&rdquo; alluding to either the notion of universal imprints on the human mind, or a ubiquitous behaviour drawn from universal life course events.<p><a id="Jack_Wilson.27s_vision" name="Jack_Wilson.27s_vision"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Jack Wilson&#39;s vision</span></h2>

      <p>Jack Wilson, the prophet formerly known as <!--del_lnk--> Wovoka until his adoption of a Euro-American name, was believed to have experienced a <!--del_lnk--> vision during a <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_eclipse.htm" title="Solar eclipse">solar eclipse</a> on <!--del_lnk--> January 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1889. It was reportedly not his first time experiencing a vision directly from God; but as a young adult, he claimed that he was better spiritually equipped to handle this message. Jack had received training from an experienced <!--del_lnk--> shaman in his community under his parent&rsquo;s guidance after realizing that he was having difficulty interpreting his first vision. Jack was also training to be a &quot;weather doctor,&quot; following in his father&rsquo;s footsteps, and was known throughout Mason Valley as a gifted and blessed young leader. He often presided over circle dances, symbolizing the sun&rsquo;s heavenly path across the sky, while preaching a message of universal love.<p><!--del_lnk--> Anthropologist <!--del_lnk--> James Mooney conducted an interview with the charismatic preacher in 1892, describing many of the same preachings he had given to his fellow Native Americans. This was documented in letters between tribes and in notes that Jack asked his pilgrims to take upon their arrival at Mason Valley. Jack told Mooney that he had stood before God in Heaven, and had seen many of his ancestors engaged in their favorite pastimes. The land there was filled with wild game and God showed it to him before instructing him to return home to tell his people that they must love each other, not fight, and live in peace with the whites. God also stated that Jack&rsquo;s people must work, not steal or lie, and that they must not engage in the old practices of war. God said that if his people abided by these rules, they would be united with their friends and family in the other world. In God&#39;s presence, Jack proclaimed, there would be no sickness, disease, or old age. According to Jack, he was then given a dance and commanded to bring it back to his people. If his people performed this dance, which lasted for five days, in the proper intervals, the performers would secure their happiness and hasten the reunion of the living and deceased. God purportedly gave Jack powers over weather and told him that he would be the deputy in charge of affairs in the Western United States, leaving current <!--del_lnk--> President Harrison as God&rsquo;s deputy in the East; Jack was then told to return home and preach God&rsquo;s message.<p>Jack Wilson claimed to have left the presence of God convinced that if every Indian in the West danced the new dance to &ldquo;hasten the event,&rdquo; all evil in the world would be swept away leaving a renewed Earth filled with food, love, and faith. Quickly accepted by his Paiute brethren, the new religion was termed &ldquo;Dance In A Circle.&quot; Because the first white American contact with the practice came by way of the Sioux, their expression &ldquo;Spirit Dance&rdquo; was adopted as a descriptive title for all such practices and was subsequently translated as &quot;Ghost Dance.&quot;<p><a id="Role_in_Wounded_Knee_Massacre" name="Role_in_Wounded_Knee_Massacre"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Role in Wounded Knee Massacre</span></h2>
      <p>Through Native Americans and some Euro-Americans, Jack Wilson&rsquo;s message spread across much of the western portion of the United States. Early in the religious movement many tribes sent members to investigate the self-proclaimed prophet, while other communities sent delegates only to be cordial. Regardless of their motivations, many left believers and returned to their homeland preaching his message. The Ghost Dance was also investigated by many <!--del_lnk--> Mormons from <!--del_lnk--> Utah, for whom the concept of a Native American prophet was familiar and accepted; some traveled to see Jack and evaluate whether or not he was actually a holy man who had been called of God.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>While most followers of the Ghost Dance understood Wovoka&#39;s role as being that of a teacher of pacifism and peace, others did not.<p>One alternate interpretation of the Ghost Dance may be seen in the so-called &quot;Ghost Shirts,&quot; special <!--del_lnk--> garments rumored to repel bullets through spiritual power. It is uncertain where the belief originated, although some observers such as James Mooney have argued that the most likely source is the Mormon endowment &quot;garment&quot; (which some Mormons believed would protect the <!--del_lnk--> pious wearer from danger). Despite the uncertainty of its origins, it is generally accepted that chief <!--del_lnk--> Kicking Bear brought the concept to his own people, the Lakota Sioux in 1890.<p>Another Lakota interpretation of Jack&rsquo;s religion is drawn from the idea of a &ldquo;renewed Earth&rdquo; in which &ldquo;all evil is washed away&rdquo;; the Lakota interpretation included the removal of all Euro-Americans from their lands, unlike Jack&#39;s version of the Ghost Dance which encouraged harmonious co-existence with white Americans.<p>In February of 1890, the United States government broke a Lakota treaty by adjusting the <!--del_lnk--> Great Sioux Reservation of <!--del_lnk--> South Dakota (an area that formerly encompassed the majority of the state) into five smaller reservations. This was done to accommodate homesteaders from the east and was in accordance with the government&rsquo;s clearly stated &ldquo;policy of breaking up tribal relationships&rdquo; and &ldquo;conforming Indians to the white man&rsquo;s ways, peaceably if they will, or forcibly if they must.&rdquo; Once on the reduced reservations, tribes were separated into family units on 320 acre plots, forced to farm, raise livestock, and send their children to boarding schools that forbid any inclusion of Native American traditional culture and language.<p>To help support the Sioux during the period of transition, the <!--del_lnk--> Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), was delegated the responsibility of supplementing the Sioux with food and hiring Euro-American farmers as teachers for the people. By the end of the 1890 growing season, the Sioux farmer&rsquo;s hard work trying to cultivate crops in the semi-arid region of South Dakota failed due to the inability of the land to produce agricultural yields during a time of intense heat and low rainfall. Unfortunately this was also the time when the government&rsquo;s patience with supporting the so-called &ldquo;lazy Indians&quot; ran out, resulting in rations to the Sioux being cut in half. With the <a href="../../wp/b/Bison.htm" title="Bison">bison</a> virtually eradicated from the plains a few years earlier, the Sioux had no options available to escape starvation. Increased performances of the Ghost Dance ritual ensued, frightening the supervising agents of the BIA, who successfully requested thousands of additional troops be deployed to the reservation.<p>By <!--del_lnk--> December 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1890, a leader of the <!--del_lnk--> Hunkpapa Sioux named <a href="../../wp/s/Sitting_Bull.htm" title="Sitting Bull">Sitting Bull</a> was arrested on the reservation for failing to stop his people from practicing the Ghost Dance. During the incident, a Sioux witnessing the arrest fired at one of the soldiers prompting an immediate retaliation; this conflict resulted in deaths on both sides, including the loss of Sitting Bull himself.<p><!--del_lnk--> Big Foot, a Sioux leader on the U.S. Army&rsquo;s list of troublemaking Indians, was stopped while en route to convene with the remaining Sioux chiefs. <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Army officers forced him and his people to relocate to a small camp close to the <!--del_lnk--> Pine Ridge Agency so that the soldiers could more closely watch the old chief. That evening, December 28th, the small band of Sioux erected their tipis on the banks of <!--del_lnk--> Wounded Knee Creek. The following day during an attempt by the officers to collect any remaining weapons from the band, one young Sioux warrior refused to relinquish his arms. A struggle followed in which his weapon discharged into the air. Other young Sioux warriors, dressed in their Ghost Shirts, responded by brandishing previously concealed weapons; the U.S. forces responded with <!--del_lnk--> carbine firearms. Two bands of Native American reinforcements, the Oglalas and Brules, arrived at the creek after hearing the gunshots. When the fighting had concluded, 39 U.S. soldiers lay dead amongst the 153 dead Sioux, 62 of which were women and children.<p>Following the massacre, chief <!--del_lnk--> Kicking Bear officially surrendered his weapon to General <!--del_lnk--> Nelson A. Miles. Outrage in the Eastern United States emerged as the general population learned about the events that had transpired. The U.S. government had insisted on numerous occasions that the Native American had already been successfully pacified, and many Americans felt the U.S. Army actions were harsh; some related the massacre at Wounded Knee Creek to the &quot;ungentlemanly act of kicking a man when he is already down.&quot; Public uproar played a role in the reinstatement of the previous treaty&rsquo;s terms including full rations and more monetary compensation for lands taken away.<p><a id="Relevant_anthropological_theory" name="Relevant_anthropological_theory"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Relevant anthropological theory</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Religious_revitalization_model" name="Religious_revitalization_model"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Religious revitalization model</span></h3>
      <p>Anthropologist Anthony F. C. Wallace&rsquo;s model (1956) describes the process of religious revitalization. It is derived from studies of another Native American religious movement, The Code of <!--del_lnk--> Handsome Lake, which led to the formation of the <!--del_lnk--> Longhouse Religion. <p><b>I.</b> <i>Period of generally satisfactory adaptation</i> to a group&rsquo;s social and natural environment.<p><b>II.</b> <i>Period of increased individual stress</i>. While the group as a whole is able to survive through its accustomed cultural behaviour, however changes in the social or natural environment frustrate efforts of many people to obtain normal satisfactions of their needs.<p><b>III.</b> <i>Period of cultural distortion</i>. Changes on the group&rsquo;s social or natural environment drastically reduce the capacity of accustomed cultural behaviour to satisfy most persons&rsquo; physical and emotional needs.<p><b>IV.</b> <i>Period of revitalization</i>: (1) reformulation of the cultural pattern, (2) its communication, (3) organization of a reformulated cultural pattern, (4) adaptation of the reformulated pattern to better meet the needs and preferences of the group, (5) cultural transformation, (6) routinization- the adapted reformulated cultural pattern becomes the standard cultural behaviour for the group.<p><b>V.</b> <i>New period of generally satisfactory adaptation</i> to the group&#39;s changed social and/or natural environment.<p><a id="Ghost_Dance_within_revitalization_model" name="Ghost_Dance_within_revitalization_model"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Ghost Dance within revitalization model</span></h3>
      <p>In Alice Beck Kehoe&rsquo;s <!--del_lnk--> ethnohistory of the Ghost Dance, she presents the movement within the framework of Wallace&rsquo;s model of religious revitalization. The T&ouml;vusi-d&ouml;kad&ouml;&rsquo;s age of traditional <!--del_lnk--> subsistence patterns constitutes a period of generally satisfactory cultural adaptation to their <!--del_lnk--> environment which lasted until around 1860. Corresponding with an influx of Euro-American settlers begins the second phase of Wallace&rsquo;s model hallmarked by increased individual stress placed on some members of the community. Almost the entire 1880s are placed into the model&rsquo;s third period, that of cultural distortion, due to the increased presence of Euro-American <!--del_lnk--> agribusiness and the United States&rsquo; government. With the introduction of Jack Wilson&rsquo;s Ghost Dance, the fourth period of revitalization is ushered which characteristically occurs after sufficient changes accrue to significantly warp the society&rsquo;s cultural pattern. Following the revitalization is yet another period of satisfactory adaptation which is dated to about 1900. By this time almost all sources of traditional food were eradicated from the T&ouml;vusi-d&ouml;kad&ouml;&rsquo;s long-established homeland, leading to the adoption of Euro-American subsistence methods while still maintaining a Paiute culture.<p><a id="Reason_for_rejection" name="Reason_for_rejection"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Reason for rejection</span></h3>
      <p>&ldquo;Worthless words&rdquo; was the description given to the Ghost Dance in 1890 by <!--del_lnk--> Navajo leaders. Three years later <!--del_lnk--> James Mooney arrived at the Navajo reservation in northern <!--del_lnk--> Arizona during his study of the Ghost Dance movement, only to discover that the ritual was never incorporated into Navajo society even during the brief period of its widespread acceptance in western portions of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. According to Kehoe, the movement did not gain fervor there in 1890 due to higher levels of social and economic satisfaction at that time. Another factor at play was the fear of ghosts and spirits among the Navajo, based in their own particular religious beliefs. Kehoe continues to elaborate on the circumstances of the Navajo&rsquo;s later acceptance of the <!--del_lnk--> Peyote Religion during more desperate times<p><a id="Movements_with_similarities" name="Movements_with_similarities"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Movements with similarities</span></h2>
