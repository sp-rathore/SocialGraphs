      <p>A <b>government</b> is a body that has the <!--del_lnk--> authority to make and the <!--del_lnk--> power to enforce laws within a <!--del_lnk--> civil, <a href="../../wp/c/Corporation.htm" title="Corporation">corporate</a>, <!--del_lnk--> religious, <!--del_lnk--> academic, or other <a href="../../wp/o/Organization.htm" title="Organization">organization</a> or group. In its broadest sense, &quot;to govern&quot; means to administer or supervise, whether over a <!--del_lnk--> state, a set group of people, or a collection of assets.<p>The word <i>government</i> is ultimately derived from the <!--del_lnk--> Greek <i>&kappa;&upsilon;&beta;&epsilon;&rho;&nu;&#x1FB6;&nu;</i> (<i>kybernan</i>), which means &quot;to steer&quot;.<p>Typically, &quot;the government&quot; refers to the executive function of the state. In many countries (particularly those having <!--del_lnk--> parliamentary systems), the <b><!--del_lnk--> government</b> refers to the executive branch of government or a specifically named executive, such as the <a href="../../wp/t/Tony_Blair.htm" title="Tony Blair">Blair government</a> (compare to the <b><!--del_lnk--> administration</b> as in the <a href="../../wp/g/George_W._Bush.htm" title="George W. Bush">Bush administration</a> in U.S. usage). In countries using the <!--del_lnk--> Westminster system, the <!--del_lnk--> party in government will also usually control the <!--del_lnk--> legislature.<p>

      <p>Many different forms of government have existed in the past, exist today, or may exist in the future. They are traditionally classified according to the number of people who hold political power:<ul>
       <li><a href="../../wp/a/Autocracy.htm" title="Autocracy">Autocracies</a> are governments where one individual ultimately holds all power. This category includes <!--del_lnk--> absolute monarchies as well as <!--del_lnk--> dictatorships with an all-powerful president or other central figure.<li><a href="../../wp/o/Oligarchy.htm" title="Oligarchy">Oligarchies</a> are governments where political power is held by a small group of individuals who share similar interests with each other. A common type of oligarchy is <!--del_lnk--> plutocracy, where the small group of powerful individuals is composed of the wealthiest members of society.<li><a href="../../wp/d/Democracy.htm" title="Democracy">Democracies</a> are governments where the <!--del_lnk--> people as a whole - hold political power. It may be exercised by them (<!--del_lnk--> direct democracy), or through representatives chosen by them (<!--del_lnk--> representative democracy).</ul>
      <p>The lines between some of the above forms of government can sometimes be ambiguous. For example, during the 19th century, most self-proclaimed &quot;democracies&quot; restricted voting rights to a minority of the population (e.g. property-owning males). This could qualify them as oligarchies rather than democracies. On the other hand, the voting minority was often quite large (20-30% of the population) and its members did not form the compact group with common interests that is the hallmark of most oligarchies. Thus, this form of government occupied a space between democracy and oligarchy as they are understood today.<p><a id="Ideas_about_the_origin_of_government" name="Ideas_about_the_origin_of_government"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Ideas about the origin of government</span></h2>
      <p>There are a wide range of theories about the reasons for establishing governments. The four major ones are briefly described below. Note that they do not always fully oppose each other - it is possible for a person to subscribe to a combination of ideas from two or more of these theories.<p><a id="Force_Theory" name="Force_Theory"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Force Theory</span></h3>
      <p>Many political philosophies that are opposed to the existence of a government (such as <a href="../../wp/a/Anarchism.htm" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a>, and to a lesser extent <a href="../../wp/m/Marxism.htm" title="Marxism">Marxism</a>), as well as others, emphasize the historical roots of governments - the fact that governments, along with <!--del_lnk--> private property, originated from the authority of warlords and petty despots who took, by force, certain patches of land as their own (and began exercising authority over the people living on that land). Thus, it is argued that governments exist to enforce the will of the strong and oppress the weak, maintaining and protecting the privilege of a ruling class.<p><a id="Order_and_tradition" name="Order_and_tradition"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Order and tradition</span></h3>
      <p>The various forms of <!--del_lnk--> conservatism, by contrast, generally see the government as a positive force that brings order out of chaos, establishes laws to end the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> war of all against all&quot;, encourages moral <!--del_lnk--> virtue while punishing <!--del_lnk--> vice, and respects <!--del_lnk--> tradition. Sometimes, in this view, the government is seen as something ordained by a higher power, as in the <!--del_lnk--> divine right of kings, which human beings have a duty to obey.<p><a id="Natural_rights" name="Natural_rights"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Natural rights</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Natural rights are the basis for the theory of government shared by most branches of <a href="../../wp/l/Liberalism.htm" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a> (including <a href="../../wp/l/Libertarianism.htm" title="Libertarianism">libertarianism</a>). In this view, human beings are born with certain <i>natural rights</i>, and governments are established strictly for the purpose of protecting those rights. What the <i>natural rights</i> actually <b>are</b> is a matter of dispute among liberals; indeed, each branch of liberalism has its own set of rights that it considers to be <i>natural</i>, and these rights are sometimes mutually exclusive with the rights supported by other liberals. As a result, there is some debate between natural rights theorists, ranging from modern writers such as <!--del_lnk--> Tibor Machan to <a href="../../wp/a/Age_of_Enlightenment.htm" title="Age of Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> thinkers such as <a href="../../wp/j/John_Locke.htm" title="John Locke">Locke</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Immanuel_Kant.htm" title="Immanuel Kant">Kant</a>, or <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Jefferson.htm" title="Thomas Jefferson">Jefferson</a>.<p><a id="Social_contract" name="Social_contract"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Social contract</span></h3>
      <p>One of the most influential theories of government in the past two hundred years has been the <!--del_lnk--> social contract, on which modern <a href="../../wp/d/Democracy.htm" title="Democracy">democracy</a> and most forms of <a href="../../wp/s/Socialism.htm" title="Socialism">socialism</a> are founded. The social contract theory holds that governments are created by the people in order to provide for collective needs (such as safety from crime, poverty, illiteracy) that cannot be properly satisfied using purely individual means. Governments thus exist for the purpose of serving the needs and wishes of the people, and their relationship with the people is clearly stipulated in a &quot;social contract&quot; (a <!--del_lnk--> constitution and a set of laws) which both the government and the people must abide by. If a majority is unhappy, it may change the social contract. If a minority is unhappy, it may persuade the majority to change the contract, or it may opt out of it by emigration or secession.<p><a id="Governmental_operations" name="Governmental_operations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Governmental operations</span></h2>

      <p>Governments concern themselves with regulating and administering many areas of human activity, such as <!--del_lnk--> trade, <a href="../../wp/e/Education.htm" title="Education">education</a>, or <a href="../../wp/m/Medicine.htm" title="Medicine">medicine</a>. Governments also employ different methods to maintain the established order, such as <!--del_lnk--> secrecy, <a href="../../wp/p/Police.htm" title="Police">police</a> and <!--del_lnk--> military forces, (particularly under <a href="../../wp/d/Despotism.htm" title="Despotism">despotism</a>, see also <a href="../../wp/p/Police_state.htm" title="Police state">police state</a>), making agreements with other states, and maintaining support within the state. Typical methods of maintaining support and legitimacy include providing the <a href="../../wp/i/Infrastructure.htm" title="Infrastructure">infrastructure</a> for <!--del_lnk--> administration, <!--del_lnk--> justice, <a href="../../wp/t/Transport.htm" title="Transport">transport</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Communication.htm" title="Communication">communication</a>, <!--del_lnk--> social welfare etc., claiming support from <a href="../../wp/d/Deity.htm" title="Deity">deities</a>, providing benefits to <!--del_lnk--> elites, providing <!--del_lnk--> shops for important posts within the state, limiting the power of the state through <a href="../../wp/l/Law.htm" title="Law">laws</a> and <!--del_lnk--> constitutions and appealing to <a href="../../wp/n/Nationalism.htm" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a>. Different political ideologies hold different ideas on what the government should or should not do. The modern standard unit of <!--del_lnk--> territory is a <a href="../../wp/c/Country.htm" title="Country">country</a>. In addition to the meaning used above, the word <!--del_lnk--> state can refer either to a government or to its territory. Within a territory, <!--del_lnk--> subnational entities may have <!--del_lnk--> local governments which do not have the full power of a national government (for example, they will generally lack the authority to declare war or carry out diplomacy).<p><a id="Size_of_government" name="Size_of_government"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Size of government</span></h2>
      <p>The scale to which government should exist and operate in the world is a matter of debate. Government spending in <!--del_lnk--> developed countries varies considerably but generally makes up between about 30% and 70% of their <!--del_lnk--> GDP. One major exception is the United States, where central government spending takes up less than 20% of GDP.<sup>[citation needed]</sup><p><a id="World_Government" name="World_Government"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">World Government</span></h2>
      <p>Some speculate that technological changes such as the internet and the global English language would bring a <!--del_lnk--> World Government into existence. Some consider some governments such as the <!--del_lnk--> European Commission as trends towards such a system. However, others do not see this as possible.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government&quot;</div>
