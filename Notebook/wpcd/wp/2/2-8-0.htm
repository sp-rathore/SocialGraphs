      <p>In the <!--del_lnk--> Whyte notation, a <b>2-8-0</b> is a <!--del_lnk--> railroad <!--del_lnk--> steam locomotive that has a single-axle <!--del_lnk--> leading truck followed by four powered <!--del_lnk--> driving axles. In the US, this <!--del_lnk--> wheel arrangement is commonly called a <b>Consolidation</b>.<p>The equivalent <!--del_lnk--> UIC classification is <b>1-D</b>.<p>

      <p>Of all the locomotive types that were created and experimented with in the early part of the 19th century, the 2-8-0 was a relative latecomer. The <a href="../../wp/2/2-6-0.htm" title="2-6-0">2-6-0</a>, often considered the logical forerunner to the 2-8-0, was first created in the early 1860s.<p>The first locomotive of this wheel arrangement was likely built by the <a href="../../wp/p/Pennsylvania_Railroad.htm" title="Pennsylvania Railroad">Pennsylvania Railroad</a> (PRR), but like the first 2-6-0s, this first 2-8-0 had a leading axle that was rigidly attached to the locomotive&#39;s frame. To create this 2-8-0, the PRR&#39;s master mechanic <!--del_lnk--> John P. Laird modified an existing <!--del_lnk--> 0-8-0, the <i>Bedford</i> between 1864 and 1865.<p>The locomotive <i>Consolidation</i>, built in 1865 is widely considered the first true 2-8-0 built in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. It is this locomotive that is the origin of the class name.<p>Only a few railroads purchased this locomotive type upon its introduction by <!--del_lnk--> Baldwin. Even the <!--del_lnk--> Baltimore &amp; Ohio, which had nearly 180 of this locomotive type in regular service by 1885, didn&#39;t purchase any of this type until 1873.<p>The 2-8-0 design was given a major boost in 1875 when the PRR made it the railroad&#39;s standard freight locomotive. 1875 was also the year that the Erie Railroad began replacing its <a href="../../wp/4/4-4-0.htm" title="4-4-0">4-4-0s</a> in freight service with 2-8-0s. The railroads found that the 2-8-0 could move trains twice as heavy for half the cost of their earlier brethren. From a financial standpoint, the choice of freight locomotives was clear.<p><a id="European_use" name="European_use"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">European use</span></h2>
      <p>The 2-8-0 was also a popular type in Europe, again largely as a freight hauler.<p><a id="Germany" name="Germany"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Germany</span></h3>
      <p>The 2-8-0 enjoyed a brief period of popularity in Germany during the period of the State Railways (L&auml;nderbahnen) prior to the establishment of the <!--del_lnk--> Deutsche Reichsbahn Gesellschaft (German National Railways) in <!--del_lnk--> 1920. The DRG chose the <!--del_lnk--> 2-10-0 as the heavy freight locomotive type for the new, unified rail system. Under the DRG&#39;s classification system, all 2-8-0s were assigned to series (<i>Baureihe</i>) BR 56, with different types receiving sub-classifications. The earliest type was the Prussian G7<sup>3</sup> of 1893.<p><a id="United_Kingdom" name="United_Kingdom"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">United Kingdom</span></h3>
      <p>The 2-8-0 was the standard heavy freight steam locomotive type in the 20th Century. The first 2-8-0 built in Britain was the <!--del_lnk--> Great Western Railway&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> 2800 Class from 1903. Other systems followed the GWR&#39;s lead; notable British 2-8-0s include the <!--del_lnk--> LMS Stanier Class 8F, the <!--del_lnk--> GCR Class 8K, and the <!--del_lnk--> WD Austerity 2-8-0 of the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> period.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-8-0&quot;</div>
