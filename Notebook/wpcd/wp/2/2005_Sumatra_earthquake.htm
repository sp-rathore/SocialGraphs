      <p>The <b>2005 Sumatra earthquake</b> was a major earthquake on <!--del_lnk--> March 28, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, located off the west coast of northern <a href="../../wp/s/Sumatra.htm" title="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>. Approximately 1300 people were killed by the earthquake, mostly on the island of <!--del_lnk--> Nias. The event caused panic in the region, which had recently been devastated by the massive <a href="../../wp/t/Tsunami.htm" title="Tsunami">tsunami</a> triggered by the <a href="../../wp/2/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake.htm" title="2004 Indian Ocean earthquake">2004 Indian Ocean earthquake</a>, but this earthquake generated a relatively tiny tsunami that caused limited damage.<p>The earthquake occurred at 16:09:36 <!--del_lnk--> UTC (11:09:36 P.M. local time) on <!--del_lnk--> March 28, <!--del_lnk--> 2005. The <!--del_lnk--> hypocenter was located at <span class="plainlinksneverexpand"><!--del_lnk--> <span style="white-space:nowrap">2&deg;04&prime;35&Prime;N,</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap">97&deg;00&prime;58&Prime;E</span></span>, 30 km (18.6 miles) below the surface of the <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Ocean.htm" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>, where <!--del_lnk--> subduction is forcing the <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Australian Plate to the south-west under the <!--del_lnk--> Eurasian plate Sunda edge. The area is 200 km west of <!--del_lnk--> Sibolga, <a href="../../wp/s/Sumatra.htm" title="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>, or 1400 km northwest of <a href="../../wp/j/Jakarta.htm" title="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>, roughly halfway between the islands of <!--del_lnk--> Nias and <!--del_lnk--> Simeulue. Seismic recordings give the <a href="../../wp/e/Earthquake.htm" title="Earthquake">earthquake</a> a <!--del_lnk--> magnitude of about 8.7, and effects were felt as far away as <a href="../../wp/b/Bangkok.htm" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>, a distance of 1000 km <!--del_lnk--> .<p>

      <p>The earthquake lasted for about two minutes in total. In the twenty-four hours immediately after the event, there were eight major aftershocks, measuring between 5.5 and 6.0. A debate arose among seismologists over whether this should be considered an aftershock of the December 2004 event, or a &quot;triggered earthquake&quot; as it was larger than typical aftershocks but on the same fault.<p>On the Indonesian island of <!--del_lnk--> Nias, off the coast of Sumatra, hundreds of buildings were destroyed by the earthquake. The death toll on Nias was at least one thousand, with 220 dying in <!--del_lnk--> Gunungsitoli, the island&#39;s largest town. Nearly half of Gunungsitoli&#39;s population (27,000) fled the town. The control tower at the nearby airport (<!--del_lnk--> Banaka) collapsed, forcing relief flights to operate out of <!--del_lnk--> Sibolga on nearby Sumatra.<p>The earthquake was strongly felt across the island of <a href="../../wp/s/Sumatra.htm" title="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>, and caused widespread <!--del_lnk--> power outages in the Indonesian city of <!--del_lnk--> Banda Aceh, already devastated by the December 2004 tsunami, and prompted thousands to flee their homes and seek higher ground <!--del_lnk--> . It was also strongly felt along the west coast of Thailand and Malaysia, and in <a href="../../wp/k/Kuala_Lumpur.htm" title="Kuala Lumpur">Kuala Lumpur</a> high-rise buildings were evacuated. The earthquake was felt less strongly in the <a href="../../wp/m/Maldives.htm" title="Maldives">Maldives</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, and <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>.<p><a id="Tsunami" name="Tsunami"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Tsunami</span></h2>
      <p>The earthquake caused great concern around the <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Ocean.htm" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> that it might trigger a tsunami similar to the massive one generated three months earlier by the <a href="../../wp/2/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake.htm" title="2004 Indian Ocean earthquake">2004 Indian Ocean earthquake</a> on December 26, 2004. Evacuations were carried out in coastal regions of <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Malaysia.htm" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, and <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>. This earthquake, however, produced a relatively tiny tsunami. A three-meter tsunami caused moderate damage to port and airport facilities on <!--del_lnk--> Simeulue, and a two-meter tsunami was recorded on the west coast of Nias. Much smaller waves, most detectable only in <!--del_lnk--> tide gauge recording systems, were recorded across the Indian Ocean; for example, a 25 <!--del_lnk--> cm wave was recorded at <!--del_lnk--> Colombo, Sri Lanka.<p><a href="../../wp/t/Tsunami.htm" title="Tsunami">Tsunami</a> warnings were issued by the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre, operated by the US <!--del_lnk--> National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) <!--del_lnk--> , and by the government of <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>. There were initial concerns that a major tsunami could be generated, particularly travelling south from the event&#39;s hypocenter.<p>Portions of Thailand&#39;s southern coast were evacuated as a precaution, and NOAA advised an evacuation of 600 miles of coastline in Sumatra. Evacuations also occurred in the northern <a href="../../wp/m/Malaysia.htm" title="Malaysia">Malaysian</a> states of <!--del_lnk--> Penang and <!--del_lnk--> Kedah, as well as the eastern coast of <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, where ten people were killed in the confusion of the evacuation. Many of the southern states of <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> were also put on high alert; all of these areas had seen significant damage from December&#39;s tsunami. After the detection of a minor tsunami south of the epicenter, including a 30 cm tsunami on Australia&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Cocos Islands, the island states of <a href="../../wp/m/Mauritius.htm" title="Mauritius">Mauritius</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Madagascar.htm" title="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, and the <a href="../../wp/s/Seychelles.htm" title="Seychelles">Seychelles</a> in the Indian Ocean issued warnings to their populations.<p>Although tsunami warning systems for the region had been actively discussed since the December 2004 earthquake, none had yet been implemented in the Indian Ocean.<p><a id="Humanitarian_response" name="Humanitarian_response"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Humanitarian response</span></h2>
      <p>The <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> worked with the Indonesian government to take further actions to prevent a possible catastrophe after the strong earthquake, and the US <!--del_lnk--> State Department has announced that it will help countries affected by a possible tsunami. The government of <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> announced aid of <!--del_lnk--> USD 2 million for the earthquake victims <!--del_lnk--> .<p><a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a> announced it would provide <!--del_lnk--> AUD 1 million in emergency aid, and, at the request of the <!--del_lnk--> Indonesian Government, dispatched <!--del_lnk--> Australian Defence Force medical teams and equipment to Nias. The Australian naval ship <!--del_lnk--> HMAS Kanimbla <!--del_lnk--> , having only recently left Aceh, was redeployed to the region from <a href="../../wp/s/Singapore.htm" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>. At about 9:30 (UTC) <!--del_lnk--> 2 April 2005, one of Kanimbla&#39;s two Sea King helicopters, <!--del_lnk--> Shark 02, crashed on the island of Nias while taking medical personnel to a village. Nine personnel were killed, and two others sustained injuries but were rescued from the site by the other helicopter. The crash occurred one day before a <!--del_lnk--> state visit by <!--del_lnk--> President of Indonesia <!--del_lnk--> Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to Australia, where he and <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister of Australia <a href="../../wp/j/John_Howard.htm" title="John Howard">John Howard</a> expressed mutual sorrow for their countries&#39; losses.<p><a id="External_links" name="External_links"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Sumatra_earthquake&quot;</div>
