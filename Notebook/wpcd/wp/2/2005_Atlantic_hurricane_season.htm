      <p>The <b>2005 Atlantic hurricane season</b> was the most active <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic hurricane season in recorded history, shattering previous records on repeated occasions. The impact of the season was widespread and ruinous with at least 2,280 deaths and record damages of over $100 billion <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">USD</a>. Of the storms that made <!--del_lnk--> landfall, five of the seven <!--del_lnk--> major hurricanes&mdash;<a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Dennis.htm" title="Hurricane Dennis">Dennis</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Emily, <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Katrina.htm" title="Hurricane Katrina">Katrina</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Rita, and <!--del_lnk--> Wilma&mdash;were responsible for most of the destruction. The <!--del_lnk--> Mexican states of <!--del_lnk--> Quintana Roo and <!--del_lnk--> Yucat&aacute;n and the <a href="../../wp/u/U.S._state.htm" title="U.S. state">U.S. states</a> of <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Louisiana were each struck twice by major hurricanes; <a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, the <a href="../../wp/t/The_Bahamas.htm" title="Bahamas">Bahamas</a>, <a href="../../wp/h/Haiti.htm" title="Haiti">Haiti</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Mississippi, <!--del_lnk--> Texas, and <!--del_lnk--> Tamaulipas were each struck once and in each case brushed by at least one more. The most catastrophic effects of the season were felt on the United States&#39; <!--del_lnk--> Gulf Coast, where a 30-foot (10 meter) <!--del_lnk--> storm surge from Hurricane Katrina caused devastating flooding that inundated <!--del_lnk--> New Orleans, Louisiana and destroyed most structures on the Mississippi coastline, and in <a href="../../wp/g/Guatemala.htm" title="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>, where <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Stan combined with an extratropical system to cause deadly mudslides.<p>The season officially began on <!--del_lnk--> June 1, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, and lasted until <!--del_lnk--> November 30, although it effectively persisted into January 2006 due to continued storm activity. A record twenty-eight <a href="../../wp/t/Tropical_cyclone.htm" title="Tropical cyclone">tropical</a> and <!--del_lnk--> subtropical storms formed, of which a record fifteen became hurricanes. Of these, seven strengthened into major hurricanes, a record-tying five became Category 4 hurricanes and a record four reached Category 5 strength, the highest categorization for hurricanes on the <!--del_lnk--> Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Among these Category 5 storms were Hurricanes <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Katrina.htm" title="Hurricane Katrina">Katrina</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Wilma, the former the costliest and the latter the most intense Atlantic hurricane on record.<p>

      <p>Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane expert Dr. <!--del_lnk--> William M. Gray and his associates at <!--del_lnk--> Colorado State University (CSU), and separately by forecasters with the U.S. Government&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Prior to and during the 2005 season, Dr. Gray issued four forecasts, each time increasing the predicted level of activity. The NOAA issued two forecasts, one shortly before the season and one two months into the season, drastically increasing the predicted level of activity in the second release. Nonetheless, all forecasts fell far short of the actual activity of the season.<p><a id="Preseason_forecasts" name="Preseason_forecasts"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Preseason forecasts</span></h3>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> December 3, <!--del_lnk--> 2004, Dr. Gray&#39;s team issued its first extended-range forecast for the 2005 season, predicting a slightly above-average season. Additionally, the team predicted a greatly increased chance of a major hurricane striking the <!--del_lnk--> East Coast of the United States and the <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a> peninsula. Though the forecast predicted above-average activity, the level predicted was significantly less than the <a href="../../wp/2/2004_Atlantic_hurricane_season.htm" title="2004 Atlantic hurricane season">2004 season</a>. On <!--del_lnk--> April 1, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, after confirming that <a href="../../wp/e/El_Ni%25C3%25B1o-Southern_Oscillation.htm" title="El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation">El Ni&ntilde;o</a> conditions would not develop, Dr. Gray and his team revised the December forecast upward, expecting thirteen tropical storms instead of eleven and seven hurricanes instead of six. In addition, the chance of a storm impacting the United States was raised slightly.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> May 16, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, 15 days before the season began, NOAA issued its outlook for the 2005 season, forecasting a 70% chance of above-normal activity. The <!--del_lnk--> accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) value for the season was predicted to be 120&ndash;190% of the median. Shortly thereafter, on <!--del_lnk--> May 31, the day before the season officially began, Dr. Gray&#39;s team revised its April forecast upwards to 15 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes.<p><a id="Midseason_outlook" name="Midseason_outlook"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Midseason outlook</span></h3>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> August 2, after an extraordinarily active early season, the NOAA released an updated outlook on the remainder of the season, significantly raising the expected level of activity to numbers about double those of a normal season. The ACE value was now forecast to be 180 to 270% of the median. The NOAA also noted a higher than normal confidence in the forecast of above-normal activity. On <!--del_lnk--> August 5, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, Dr. Gray and his associates followed suit and issued their updated forecast; it was consistent with NOAA&#39;s update. Although neither the NOAA nor Dr. Gray had ever forecast such high levels of activity, even the midseason outlooks fell far short of the actual level of activity.<p><a id="Storms" name="Storms"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Storms</span></h2>

      <p>The level of activity of the season had far-reaching economic consequences. Because of the vulnerability of both oil extracting and <a href="../../wp/r/Refining.htm" title="Refining">refining</a> capacity in the Gulf of Mexico, storms led to speculative spikes in the price of <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">crude oil</a>. The damage to refinery capacity in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> caused gasoline to soar to record prices (even adjusted for <!--del_lnk--> inflation). Governments in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> tapped strategic reserves of gasoline and petroleum, and shortages were reported in the days after <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Katrina.htm" title="Hurricane Katrina">Katrina</a> in areas heavily dependent on the <a href="../../wp/g/Gulf_of_Mexico.htm" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> for refined gasoline. Even weeks after the storm, prices remained elevated as the shortage in production remained over one million barrels per day.<p><!--del_lnk--> Rita damaged wells in the western Gulf of Mexico which were primarily exploratory, leading to concerns that future production would be damped for some time to come. Additionally, as the storm churned in the Gulf, forecasters predicted that it would strike <a href="../../wp/h/Houston%252C_Texas.htm" title="Houston, Texas">Houston, Texas</a>, the location of many major <a href="../../wp/o/Oil_refinery.htm" title="Oil refinery">oil refineries</a> that survived Katrina, leading to additional spikes in oil prices before the predictions changed. In Georgia, Governor <!--del_lnk--> Sonny Perdue declared &quot;<!--del_lnk--> snow days&quot; on <!--del_lnk--> September 26 and <!--del_lnk--> September 27, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, at all Georgia public schools to conserve fuel for <!--del_lnk--> school buses in anticipation of Rita&#39;s impact. However, as the storm veered away from Houston shortly before landfall, damage to refining capacity was not as great as feared.<p>Agriculture in multiple countries was hard hit by extremely heavy rains from severe storms during the season. Early in the season, <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Dennis.htm" title="Hurricane Dennis">Hurricane Dennis</a> caused significant damages to various <a href="../../wp/c/Citrus.htm" title="Citrus">citrus</a> and <a href="../../wp/v/Vegetable.htm" title="Vegetable">vegetable</a> crops in <a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, though the damages were not crippling. In <!--del_lnk--> Central America, <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Stan and associated nontropical storms dropped upwards of 20 inches (500 mm) of rain, causing, in addition to severe flash floods and mud slides, heavy damage to crops, especially to the <a href="../../wp/b/Banana.htm" title="Banana">banana</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Coffee.htm" title="Coffee">coffee</a> crops, which were nearly ready to be harvested. This caused significant economic disruption in <a href="../../wp/g/Guatemala.htm" title="Guatemala">Guatemala</a> and surrounding nations, as the rural economies are highly dependent on the coffee and banana crops. When <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Beta struck <a href="../../wp/n/Nicaragua.htm" title="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a> later in the season, it also caused heavy damages to the banana crop, but the harvests had already ended, mitigating economic disruption.<p>Katrina also had significant political consequences, as President <a href="../../wp/g/George_W._Bush.htm" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Louisiana governor <!--del_lnk--> Kathleen Blanco, and <!--del_lnk--> New Orleans mayor <!--del_lnk--> Ray Nagin all came under heavy criticism for what were considered sluggish or inappropriate responses to <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Katrina.htm" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>. On <!--del_lnk--> December 14, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, congressional hearings began to investigate whether these claims had any merit. In addition, <!--del_lnk--> Michael Brown, head of the United States <!--del_lnk--> Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), was forced to resign from his post after the organization came under fire for what was perceived as an insufficient response to Katrina.<p><a id="Forecasting_uncertainty" name="Forecasting_uncertainty"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Forecasting uncertainty</span></h2>

      <p>A number of storms that formed in 2005 exhibited unusual behaviour and challenged forecasters&#39; ability to make correct predictions. <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Vince_%25282005%2529.htm" title="Hurricane Vince (2005)">Hurricane Vince</a> formed farther northeast in the Atlantic than any other tropical cyclone on record, and then unexpectedly reached hurricane strength over waters considered too cold to support a hurricane. <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Wilma became one of the fastest-intensifying hurricanes on record, and later strengthened unexpectedly in the face of strong <!--del_lnk--> wind shear. <a href="../../wp/t/Tropical_Storm_Delta_%25282005%2529.htm" title="Tropical Storm Delta (2005)">Tropical Storm Delta</a>, <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Epsilon_%25282005%2529.htm" title="Hurricane Epsilon (2005)">Hurricane Epsilon</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Tropical_Storm_Zeta_%25282005%2529.htm" title="Tropical Storm Zeta (2005)">Tropical Storm Zeta</a> all formed over the cold waters of the late-season eastern Atlantic, much like Hurricane Vince (though at lower latitudes). All three persisted in the face of heavy wind shear, and Epsilon managed to reach hurricane strength over waters well below the temperatures previously thought necessary for hurricane formation. Epsilon became the longest-lasting December hurricane while Zeta became the longest-lasting storm in January.<p><a id="Records_and_notable_events" name="Records_and_notable_events"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Records and notable events</span></h2>

      <p>During the season 28 storms formed (27 named and one unnamed), surpassing almost all records for storm formation in the Atlantic. More tropical storms, hurricanes, and Category 5 hurricanes formed during the season than in any previously recorded Atlantic season; the only major record for number of storms the season did not capture was most major hurricanes, still held by the <!--del_lnk--> 1950 season.<p>The season was the first season to use &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; names, and when the season ran out of official alphabetical names after the use of <!--del_lnk--> Wilma, forecasters resorted to using letters from the <!--del_lnk--> Greek alphabet for the first time (although <!--del_lnk--> Alpha and <!--del_lnk--> Delta had been used for subtropical storms in the 1970s).<p>Almost every storm in 2005 has set a record for early formation. Of the twenty-eight storms which formed, twenty-two of them qualified as the earliest-forming storm of that number; starting with <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Dennis.htm" title="Hurricane Dennis">Hurricane Dennis</a>, almost every storm was such.<p><a id="Intense_storms" name="Intense_storms"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Intense storms</span></h3>

      <p>Three of the six most intense hurricanes on record formed in 2005, topped off by Hurricane Wilma&#39;s 882 <!--del_lnk--> mbar minimum pressure, shattering the 17-year-old record set by <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Gilbert. Hurricanes Emily, Katrina and Rita also attained Category 5 intensity, and Hurricanes Rita and Katrina became the fourth and sixth most intense recorded Atlantic storms, respectively. Hurricane Emily was not originally recorded as a Category 5 storm, but it was upgraded in the post-storm analysis by the <!--del_lnk--> National Hurricane Centre. The 2005 season is the only season on record with four Category 5 storms on the <!--del_lnk--> Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale; the previous record was only two. In addition, Hurricane Dennis reached Category 4 status, tying the record set by the <!--del_lnk--> 1999 season with five Category 4 storms.<p><a id="Early_strength_and_activity" name="Early_strength_and_activity"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early strength and activity</span></h3>
      <p>In July, <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Dennis.htm" title="Hurricane Dennis">Hurricane Dennis</a> became the strongest storm to form prior to August and the earliest Category 4 storm to form in the Caribbean. When <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Emily reached Category 5 intensity later in the month, the 2005 season became the only season to have two hurricanes reach Category 4 intensity before the end of July; Emily also broke Dennis&#39;s nine-day-old record for the strongest storm on record before August. Emily was also the first Category 5 hurricane ever recorded in July and the earliest by nearly three weeks (beating <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Allen). The high level of activity and strength was reflected in the <!--del_lnk--> accumulated cyclone energy value at the end of July; at 63 it was the highest ever.<p>Additionally, seven storms formed before the end of July, breaking the record of five set in the <!--del_lnk--> 1887, <!--del_lnk--> 1933, <!--del_lnk--> 1936, <!--del_lnk--> 1959, <!--del_lnk--> 1966, and <!--del_lnk--> 1995 seasons. Five of those storms formed <i>during</i> July, also a new record.<p><a id="Late_activity" name="Late_activity"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Late activity</span></h3>
      <p>After forming on <!--del_lnk--> November 29, <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Epsilon_%25282005%2529.htm" title="Hurricane Epsilon (2005)">Hurricane Epsilon</a> became the longest-lasting December hurricane on record when it maintained hurricane strength from <!--del_lnk--> December 2 to <!--del_lnk--> December 7. Epsilon is the third-strongest hurricane ever recorded in the month of December; only <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Nicole of 1998 and an unnamed storm in the <!--del_lnk--> 1925 season were stronger.<p>When <a href="../../wp/t/Tropical_Storm_Zeta_%25282005%2529.htm" title="Tropical Storm Zeta (2005)">Tropical Storm Zeta</a> formed on <!--del_lnk--> December 30, it came second only to <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Alice (also <!--del_lnk--> December 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1954, but later in the day) as the latest ever that the last storm of the season formed. Zeta also became only the second storm, after Alice, to persist through the end of year and still be active at the start of the next. In addition, Zeta was the longest-lived tropical cyclone to form in December and cross over into the next year, and it was also the longest-lived January tropical cyclone.<p><a id="Storm_names" name="Storm_names"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Storm names</span></h2>

      <p>The names to the right were used for tropical storms and hurricanes that formed in the North Atlantic in 2005. This was the same list used for the <!--del_lnk--> 1999 season, with the exceptions of Franklin and Lee, which replaced <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Floyd.htm" title="Hurricane Floyd">Floyd</a> and <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Lenny.htm" title="Hurricane Lenny">Lenny</a>. The names not retired from this list will be used again in the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season. Storms were named Franklin, Lee, Maria, Nate, Ophelia, Philippe, Rita, Stan, Tammy, Vince, Wilma, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, and Zeta for the first time in 2005 (the names Alpha and Delta had been previously used in <!--del_lnk--> 1972 for two <!--del_lnk--> subtropical storms, but this is the first time they have been used in this way). This season used fifteen previously unused names, the most ever in an Atlantic season. Additionally, a subtropical storm that formed in early October was not recognized as such at the time and so did not receive a name.<p>Vince and Wilma were the first named &quot;<!--del_lnk--> V&quot; and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> W&quot; storms ever in the Atlantic basin. The naming of Wilma exhausted the 2005 list, the first time in Atlantic naming history that all names in the list have been used. Beginning with Alpha, the 2005 season was the first time in Atlantic hurricane history that Greek letters were used due to the exhaustion of the primary list.<p><a id="Retirement" name="Retirement"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Retirement</span></h3>
      <p>In the spring of 2006, the <!--del_lnk--> World Meteorological Organization retired five hurricane names: <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Dennis.htm" title="Hurricane Dennis">Dennis</a>, <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Katrina.htm" title="Hurricane Katrina">Katrina</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Rita, <!--del_lnk--> Stan, and <!--del_lnk--> Wilma. Their replacements in the 2011 season will be Don, Katia, Rina, Sean, and Whitney, respectively. This surpassed the previous record for the number of hurricane names retired after a single season, four (held by the <!--del_lnk--> 1955, <!--del_lnk--> 1995, and <a href="../../wp/2/2004_Atlantic_hurricane_season.htm" title="2004 Atlantic hurricane season">2004</a> seasons).<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season&quot;</div>
