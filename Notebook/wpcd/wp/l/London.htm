      <p><a id="Area" name="Area"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Area</span></h3>
      <p>Today, &quot;London&quot; usually refers to the area known as <!--del_lnk--> Greater London which is also the London <!--del_lnk--> region of England. At the heart of the <!--del_lnk--> conurbation is the small, ancient <!--del_lnk--> City of London which was historically the entirety of the city. Londoners generally refer to the City of London simply as &quot;The City&quot; or the &quot;Square Mile&quot;. London&#39;s metropolitan area grew considerably during the <!--del_lnk--> Victorian era and again during the <!--del_lnk--> Interwar period with expansion halted in the 1940s by <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Green Belt legislation and has been largely static since.<p>The extent of the <!--del_lnk--> London postal district, <!--del_lnk--> Metropolitan Police District, local government area, <!--del_lnk--> London transport area, <!--del_lnk--> urban sprawl, coverage of the <!--del_lnk--> London telephone area code and <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan area have rarely been coterminous and are not currently. The area delimited by the orbital <a href="../../wp/m/M25_motorway.htm" title="M25 motorway">M25 motorway</a> is sometimes used to define the &quot;London area&quot; and the Greater London boundary has been aligned to it in places. London is split for some purposes into <!--del_lnk--> Inner London and <!--del_lnk--> Outer London.<p>The co-ordinates of the nominal centre of London (traditionally considered to be the original <!--del_lnk--> Charing Cross, near the junction of <a href="../../wp/t/Trafalgar_Square.htm" title="Trafalgar Square">Trafalgar Square</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Whitehall) are approximately <span class="plainlinksneverexpand"><!--del_lnk--> <span style="white-space:nowrap">51&deg;30&prime;29&Prime;N,</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap">00&deg;07&prime;29&Prime;W</span></span>. The <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a> may have marked the centre of <i><!--del_lnk--> Londinium</i> with the <!--del_lnk--> London Stone in the City.<p><a id="Status" name="Status"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Status</span></h3>
      <p>The entire London urban area may be classed as a &quot;city&quot; using a geographical definition, but politically it is not so. Officially, London is a region containing two smaller cities within its built-up area: the City of London and the <!--del_lnk--> City of Westminster <i>(see <a href="../../wp/c/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="City status in the United Kingdom">City status in the UK</a>)</i>.<p>Unlike most capital cities, London&#39;s status as the capital of the UK has never been granted or confirmed officially &mdash; by <!--del_lnk--> statute or in written form. Its position as the capital has formed through <!--del_lnk--> constitutional convention, making its position as <i><!--del_lnk--> de facto</i> capital a part of the <!--del_lnk--> UK&#39;s unwritten constitution.<p><a id="Geography_and_climate" name="Geography_and_climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography and climate</span></h2>

      <p>Greater London covers an area of 609 square miles (1,579 <!--del_lnk--> km&sup2;), making it one of the <!--del_lnk--> world&#39;s largest cities by area. Its primary geographical feature is the <a href="../../wp/r/River_Thames.htm" title="River Thames">Thames</a>, a <!--del_lnk--> navigable river which crosses the city from the southwest to the east. The <!--del_lnk--> Thames Valley is a <!--del_lnk--> floodplain surrounded by gently rolling hills such as <!--del_lnk--> Parliament Hill and <!--del_lnk--> Primrose Hill. These hills presented no significant obstacle to the growth of London from its origins as a port on the north side of the river, and therefore London is roughly circular.<p>The Thames was once a much broader, shallower river with extensive marshlands. It has been extensively <!--del_lnk--> embanked, and many of its London <!--del_lnk--> tributaries now flow <!--del_lnk--> underground. The Thames is a tidal river, and London is vulnerable to flooding. The threat has increased over time due to a slow but continuous rise in <a href="../../wp/t/Tide.htm" title="Tide">high water</a> level by the slow &#39;tilting&#39; of Britain (up in the north and down in the south) caused by post-<a href="../../wp/g/Glacier.htm" title="Glacier">glacial</a> <!--del_lnk--> rebound. In 1974, a decade of work began on the construction of the <!--del_lnk--> Thames Barrier across the Thames at <!--del_lnk--> Woolwich to deal with this threat, but a more substantial barrier further downstream may be necessary in the near future.<p>London has a <a href="../../wp/t/Temperate.htm" title="Temperate">temperate</a> climate with regular but generally light <!--del_lnk--> precipitation throughout the year - London is in fact amongst the driest of Europe&#39;s capitals. The warmest month is July, with an average <!--del_lnk--> temperature range at <!--del_lnk--> Greenwich of 13.6 <!--del_lnk--> &deg;C to 22.8 &deg;C (56.5 to 73.0 <!--del_lnk--> &deg;F). The coolest month is January, averaging 2.4 &deg;C to 7.9 &deg;C (35.6 to 46.2 &deg;F). Average annual <!--del_lnk--> precipitation is 583.6 <!--del_lnk--> mm(22.98 in), with February on average the driest month. Snow is uncommon, particularly because heat from the urban area can make London 5 &deg;C (9 &deg;F) hotter than the surrounding areas in winter. London is in USDA <!--del_lnk--> Hardiness zone 9, and AHS Heat Zone 2.<br clear="all" />

      <p>London&#39;s vast urban area is often described using a large set of district names (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> Bloomsbury, <!--del_lnk--> Mayfair, <!--del_lnk--> Whitechapel). These are for the most part informal designations which have become commonplace through tradition, each referring to a neighbourhood with its own distinctive character, but no official boundaries (often overlapping). One area of London which does have a strict definition is the <!--del_lnk--> City of London (usually just called The City), the largest financial district and <!--del_lnk--> central business district (<!--del_lnk--> CBD) in Europe. The City has its own governance and boundaries, giving it a distinctive status as the only completely autonomous local authority in London. London&#39;s other financial hub is the <!--del_lnk--> Docklands area in the east of the city, dominated by the <!--del_lnk--> Canary Wharf complex, whilst many other businesses locate in the <!--del_lnk--> City of Westminster which is the home of the <!--del_lnk--> UK&#39;s national government.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> West End is London&#39;s main entertainment and shopping district, with locations such as <!--del_lnk--> Oxford Street, <!--del_lnk--> Leicester Square, <!--del_lnk--> Covent Garden and <a href="../../wp/p/Piccadilly_Circus.htm" title="Piccadilly Circus">Piccadilly Circus</a> acting as tourist magnets. The <!--del_lnk--> West London area is known for fashionable and expensive residential areas such as <!--del_lnk--> Notting Hill, <!--del_lnk--> Kensington and <!--del_lnk--> Chelsea &mdash; where some propeties can sell for &pound;5,000,000 and above.<p>Meanwhile, the eastern side of London contains the <!--del_lnk--> East End &mdash; the area closest to the original <!--del_lnk--> Port of London, known for its high immigrant population, as well as for being one of the poorest areas in London. The surrounding <!--del_lnk--> East London area saw much of London&#39;s early industrial development; now, <!--del_lnk--> brownfield sites throughout the area are being redeveloped, including areas along the Thames (the <!--del_lnk--> Thames Gateway) and up the <!--del_lnk--> Lower Lea Valley, which is being developed into the <!--del_lnk--> Olympic Park for the <!--del_lnk--> 2012 Olympics. <!--del_lnk--> North London and <!--del_lnk--> South London are informal divisions of the capital made by the River Thames, although they can define varying areas.<p><a id="Built_environment" name="Built_environment"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Built environment</span></h3>

      <p>The density of London varies, with high employment density in the <!--del_lnk--> central area, high residential densities in <!--del_lnk--> inner London and lower densities in the <!--del_lnk--> suburbs. In the dense areas, most of the concentration is achieved with medium-rise buildings; <!--del_lnk--> high-rise buildings are fairly rare, even in employment centres. Thus, skyscrapers such as the City&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> &quot;Gherkin&quot;, <!--del_lnk--> Tower 42 and <!--del_lnk--> One Canada Square stand out due to both their height and their relative rarity.<p>However, developments of <!--del_lnk--> tall buildings are encouraged in the <!--del_lnk--> London Plan, which will lead to the erection of many new skyscrapers over the next few years as London goes through a high-rise boom, particularly in the two financial centres, the <!--del_lnk--> City of London and <!--del_lnk--> Canary Wharf. The 72-storey, 310 m &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Shard London Bridge&quot; by <!--del_lnk--> London Bridge station, the 288 m <!--del_lnk--> Bishopsgate Tower and around 30 other skyscrapers over 150 m are either proposed or approved and could transform the city&#39;s skyline.<p>The buildings of London are a collection of different styles accumulated mostly over the time since the <!--del_lnk--> Great Fire in 1666. Although the City is characterised by 18th and 19th century architecture, there are a number of examples of more modern construction, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Lloyd&#39;s building and <!--del_lnk--> 30 St Mary Axe. London&#39;s focal point is the mid-19th century <a href="../../wp/t/Trafalgar_Square.htm" title="Trafalgar Square">Trafalgar Square</a>, marked with <!--del_lnk--> Nelson&#39;s Column and the site of major demonstrations and street events in the capital.<p><a id="Parks_and_gardens" name="Parks_and_gardens"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Parks and gardens</span></h3>

      <p>London has a number of open spaces situated throughout the city.

More central places are the smaller Royal Parks of <!--del_lnk--> Green Park and <!--del_lnk--> St. James&#39;s Park.

      <p>Although there is some evidence of scattered pre-Roman settlement in the area, the first major settlement was founded by the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Romans</a> in AD 43, following the <!--del_lnk--> Roman invasion of Britain. This settlement was called <i>Londinium</i>, commonly believed to be the origin of the present-day name, although a Celtic origin is also possible.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The first London lasted for just seventeen years. Around AD 61, the <!--del_lnk--> Iceni tribe of <!--del_lnk--> Celts led by Queen <a href="../../wp/b/Boudica.htm" title="Boudica">Boudica</a> stormed London, burning it to the ground. The next, heavily-planned incarnation of the city prospered and superseded <!--del_lnk--> Colchester as the capital of the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Britain.htm" title="Roman Britain">Roman province</a> of <!--del_lnk--> Britannia in AD 100. At its height in the 2nd century AD, Roman London had a population of around 60,000. However, by the 3rd century AD, the city started a slow decline due to trouble in the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>, and by the 5th century AD, it was largely abandoned.<p>By 600 AD, the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxons had created a new settlement (<i><!--del_lnk--> Lundenwic</i>) about 1 km upstream from the old Roman city, around what is now <!--del_lnk--> Covent Garden. There was probably a harbour at the mouth of the <!--del_lnk--> River Fleet for fishing and trading, and this trading grew until disaster struck in 851 AD, when the city&#39;s defences were overcome by a massive <a href="../../wp/v/Viking.htm" title="Viking">Viking</a> raid and it was razed to the ground. A Viking occupation twenty years later was short-lived, and <a href="../../wp/a/Alfred_the_Great.htm" title="Alfred the Great">Alfred the Great</a>, the new King of England, established peace and moved the settlement within the <!--del_lnk--> defensive walls of the old Roman city (then called <i><!--del_lnk--> Lundenburgh</i>). The original city became <i>Ealdw&#x12B;c</i> (&quot;old city&quot;), a name surviving to the present day as <!--del_lnk--> Aldwych.<p>Subsequently, under the control of various English kings, London once again prospered as an international trading centre and political arena. However, Viking raids began again in the late 10th century, and reached a head in 1013 when they besieged the city under Danish King <a href="../../wp/c/Canute_the_Great.htm" title="Canute the Great">Canute</a> and forced English King <!--del_lnk--> Ethelred the Unready to flee. In a retaliatory attack, Ethelred&#39;s army achieved victory by pulling down <a href="../../wp/l/London_Bridge.htm" title="London Bridge">London Bridge</a> with the Danish garrison on top, and English control was re-established.<p>Canute took control of the English throne in 1017, controlling the city and country until 1042, when his death resulted in a reversion to <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon control under his pious step-son <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_the_Confessor.htm" title="Edward the Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a>, who re-founded <a href="../../wp/w/Westminster_Abbey.htm" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> and the adjacent <a href="../../wp/p/Palace_of_Westminster.htm" title="Palace of Westminster">Palace of Westminster</a>. By this time, London had become the largest and most prosperous city in England, although the official <!--del_lnk--> seat of government was still at <!--del_lnk--> Winchester.<p><a id="Norman_and_medieval_London" name="Norman_and_medieval_London"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Norman and medieval London</span></h3>

      <p>Following a victory at the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Hastings.htm" title="Battle of Hastings">Battle of Hastings</a>, <!--del_lnk--> William the Conqueror, the then <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Normandy, was crowned King of England in the newly-finished <a href="../../wp/w/Westminster_Abbey.htm" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> on <!--del_lnk--> Christmas Day 1066. William granted the citizens of London special privileges, whilst building a castle in the southeast corner of the city to keep them under control. This castle was expanded by later kings and is now known as the <a href="../../wp/t/Tower_of_London.htm" title="Tower of London">Tower of London</a>, serving first as a <!--del_lnk--> royal residence and later as a <!--del_lnk--> prison.<p>In 1097, <a href="../../wp/w/William_II_of_England.htm" title="William II of England">William II</a> began the building of <!--del_lnk--> Westminster Hall, close by the abbey of the same name. The hall proved the basis of a new <a href="../../wp/p/Palace_of_Westminster.htm" title="Palace of Westminster">Palace of Westminster</a>, the prime royal residence throughout <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">the Middle Ages</a>. Westminster became the seat of the royal court and government (persisting until the present day), whilst its distinct neighbour, the City of London, was a centre of trade and commerce and flourished under its own unique administration, the <!--del_lnk--> Corporation of London. Eventually, the adjacent cities grew together and formed the basis of modern <!--del_lnk--> central London, superseding <!--del_lnk--> Winchester as capital of England in the 12th century.<p>After the successful defeat of the <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_Armada.htm" title="Spanish Armada">Spanish Armada</a> in 1588, political stability in England allowed London to grow further. In <!--del_lnk--> 1603, <!--del_lnk--> James VI of Scotland came to the throne of England, essentially uniting the two countries. His enactment of harsh <!--del_lnk--> anti-Catholic laws made him unpopular, and an <!--del_lnk--> assassination attempt was made on <!--del_lnk--> 5 November <!--del_lnk--> 1605 &mdash; the famous <!--del_lnk--> Gunpowder Plot.<p><a href="../../wp/b/Black_Death.htm" title="Black Death">Plague</a> caused extensive problems for London in the early 17th century, culminating in the <!--del_lnk--> Great Plague in 1665-1666. This was the last major outbreak in Europe, possibly thanks to the disastrous fire of 1666. The <!--del_lnk--> Great Fire of London broke out in the original City and quickly swept through London&#39;s wooden buildings, destroying large swathes of the city (and killing off much of the disease-carrying <!--del_lnk--> rat population). Rebuilding took over ten years.<p><a id="Rise_of_modern_London" name="Rise_of_modern_London"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Rise of modern London</span></h3>

      <p>London&#39;s growth accelerated in the 18th century, and was the world&#39;s largest city from about 1831 to 1925 . This growth was aided from 1836 by London&#39;s first <!--del_lnk--> railways which put small countryside towns within easy reach of the city. The rail network expanded very rapidly, and caused these places to grow whilst London itself expanded into surrounding fields, merging with neighbouring settlements such as <!--del_lnk--> Kensington. Rising <!--del_lnk--> traffic congestion on city centre roads led to the creation of the world&#39;s first <!--del_lnk--> metro system &mdash; the <a href="../../wp/l/London_Underground.htm" title="London Underground">London Underground</a> &mdash; in 1863, driving yet further expansion and urbanisation. <p>London&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> local government system struggled to cope with the rapid growth, especially in providing the city with adequate infrastructure. Between 1855 and 1889, the <!--del_lnk--> Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure expansion. It was then replaced by the <!--del_lnk--> County of London, overseen by the <!--del_lnk--> London County Council, London&#39;s first elected city-wide administration.<div class="thumb tright">

The rebuilding during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s was characterised by a wide range of <!--del_lnk--> architectural styles and has resulted in a lack of architectural unity that has become part of London&#39;s character. In 1965 London&#39;s political boundaries were expanded to take into account the growth of the urban area outside the County of London&#39;s borders. The expanded area was called <!--del_lnk--> Greater London and was administered by the <!--del_lnk--> Greater London Council.<p>In the decades following World War II, large-scale immigration from <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth countries and beyond, transformed London into one of the most racially and culturally diverse cities in Europe. Integration of the new immigrants was not always smooth, with events such as the <!--del_lnk--> Brixton Riots in the 1980s.<p>An economic revival from the 1980s onwards re-established London&#39;s position as an eminent trading centre.

      <p>The administration of London takes place in two tiers &mdash; a city-wide, strategic tier and a local tier.

It consists of two elected parts &mdash; the <!--del_lnk--> Mayor of London, who has executive powers, and the <!--del_lnk--> London Assembly, who scrutinise the Mayor&#39;s decisions and can accept or reject his budget proposals each year. The GLA is a recent organisation, having been set up in 2000 to replace the similar <!--del_lnk--> Greater London Council (GLC) which was abolished in 1986.<p>The current Mayor of London is <!--del_lnk--> Ken Livingstone, who is in his second term of office. He was elected in 2000 as an independent candidate and again in 2004 as a <!--del_lnk--> Labour candidate. Ken Livingstone was also the leader of the GLC when it was abolished.<p>The 33 local districts are the 32 <!--del_lnk--> London boroughs and the <!--del_lnk--> City of London. They are responsible for local services not overseen by the GLA, such as local planning, schools, <!--del_lnk--> social services, and refuse collection. The London boroughs each have a council which is elected every four years by local residents.

London&#39;s relative success as a <!--del_lnk--> service industry and business centre can be attributed to a large array of factors: English becoming the new <!--del_lnk--> lingua franca; its former position as the capital of the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>; its close relationship with the US and various countries in Asia; <!--del_lnk--> English law being the most important and most used <!--del_lnk--> contract law in international business, the <a href="../../wp/m/Multiculturalism.htm" title="Multiculturalism">multi-cultural</a> infrastructure (schools, places of worship, cultural and social organisations); relatively low taxes, particularly for foreigners (non-UK domiciled residents do not get taxed on their foreign earnings); a business friendly environment (e.g. in the City of London the local government is not elected by the resident population but instead by business - the City of London is a business democracy), good transport infrastructure, particularly its aviation industry and a deregulated economy with little intervention by the government. <p>Currently, over 85% (3.2 million) of the employed population of greater London works in the services industries. Another half a million employees resident in Greater London work in manufacturing and construction, almost equally divided between both.<p>London has five major business districts: the City, Westminster, Canary Wharf, Camden &amp; Islington and Lambeth &amp; Southwark.<table class="wikitable">

      <p>London&#39;s largest industry remains finance, and its <!--del_lnk--> financial exports make it a large contributor to the UK&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> balance of payments. The City is the largest financial and business centre in Europe, home to banks, brokers, insurers and legal and accounting firms. A second, smaller financial district is developing at <!--del_lnk--> Canary Wharf to the east of the City which includes the global headquarters of <a href="../../wp/h/HSBC.htm" title="HSBC">HSBC</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Reuters, <!--del_lnk--> Barclays and many of the largest <!--del_lnk--> law firms in the world.

      <p>With increasing industrialisation, London&#39;s population grew rapidly throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, and was the most populated city in the world until overtaken by <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1925. Its population peaked at 8,615,245 in <!--del_lnk--> 1939.<p>There were an estimated 7,517,700 people living in the <!--del_lnk--> Greater London area in mid-<!--del_lnk--> 2005. However, London&#39;s continuous <!--del_lnk--> urban area extends beyond the borders of Greater London and was home to 8,278,251 people at the <!--del_lnk--> 2001 <!--del_lnk--> UK census, whilst its wider <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan area has a population of between 12 and 14 million depending on the definition of that area . As per <!--del_lnk--> Eurostat, London is the most populous city and metropolitan area of the European Union .<ul>
       <li>By <!--del_lnk--> Population of city (proper), London ranks 15th in the world.<li>By <!--del_lnk--> Population of metropolitan area, London ranks 15th in the world.<li>By <!--del_lnk--> Number of billionaires (United States Dollars), London ranks 4th in the world with 19.<li>In terms of cost of living, London is the 1st most expensive <a href="../../wp/c/City.htm" title="City">city</a> in the world to live in.</ul>
      <p>It is one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the <!--del_lnk--> industrialised world, with more than 300 languages spoken and 50 non-indigenous communities with a population of more than 10,000 living in London. The 2001 census showed that about 27% of London&#39;s population were born outside the UK, and about 29% were classified as non-white.<p>In terms of religion, London is historically dominated by <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, and has a <!--del_lnk--> large number of churches, particularly in the City. The famous <a href="../../wp/s/St_Paul%2527s_Cathedral.htm" title="St Paul&#39;s Cathedral">St Paul&#39;s Cathedral</a> in the City and <!--del_lnk--> Southwark Cathedral south of the river are <a href="../../wp/a/Anglicanism.htm" title="Anglicanism">Anglican</a> administrative centres, whilst important national and royal ceremonies are shared between St Paul&#39;s and <a href="../../wp/w/Westminster_Abbey.htm" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>. The Abbey is not to be confused with nearby <!--del_lnk--> Westminster Cathedral, a relatively recent edifice which is the largest <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic cathedral in <!--del_lnk--> England and Wales. Despite all of this, observance is very low within the <!--del_lnk--> Anglican denomination and yet considerably higher among London&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic and <!--del_lnk--> Christian Orthodox communities. <p>London is also home to sizeable <!--del_lnk--> Muslim, <!--del_lnk--> Hindu, <!--del_lnk--> Sikh, and <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> communities. Many Muslims live in <!--del_lnk--> Tower Hamlets and <!--del_lnk--> Newham; the most important Muslim edifice is <!--del_lnk--> London Central Mosque on the edge of <a href="../../wp/r/Regent%2527s_Park.htm" title="Regent&#39;s Park">Regent&#39;s Park</a>.

      <p>Transport is one of the four areas of policy administered by the Mayor of London, but the mayor&#39;s financial control is limited. The <!--del_lnk--> public transport network, administered by <!--del_lnk--> Transport for London (TfL), is the most extensive in the world, but faces congestion and reliability issues, which a large investment programme is attempting to address, including &pound;7 billion (&euro;10 billion) of improvements planned for the <!--del_lnk--> Olympics.<p><a id="Rail" name="Rail"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Rail</span></h3>
      <p>The centrepiece of the public transport network is the <a href="../../wp/l/London_Underground.htm" title="London Underground">London Underground</a>, the oldest and largest <!--del_lnk--> metro system in the world, dating from 1863. The Metro system was home to the world&#39;s first underground electric line, the <!--del_lnk--> City &amp; South London Railway, which began service in 1890. Nearly 1 billion journeys are made each year on the London Underground system. The Underground serves the central area and most suburbs to the north of the Thames, whilst those to the south are served by an extensive <!--del_lnk--> suburban rail network. Commuter and intercity railways generally do not cross the city, instead running into <!--del_lnk--> fourteen terminal stations scattered around its historic centre. The <!--del_lnk--> London bus network caters for most local journeys and carries even more passengers than the Underground. These internationally recognised buses are the trademark of London transport along-side black cabs and the underground.<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Metro systems by annual passenger ridership, London ranks 7th in the world, with 976 million passengers per year. </ul>
      <p><a id="Air" name="Air"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Air</span></h3>
      <p>London is an international transport hub, with five sizeable airports and a cross-channel rail service. <!--del_lnk--> Heathrow is the <!--del_lnk--> busiest airport in the world for international traffic; such traffic is also handled at <!--del_lnk--> Gatwick, whilst <!--del_lnk--> Stansted and <!--del_lnk--> Luton cater mostly for low-cost short-haul flights. <!--del_lnk--> London City, the smallest and most central airport, is focused on business travellers. <!--del_lnk--> Eurostar trains link London <!--del_lnk--> Waterloo station with <a href="../../wp/l/Lille.htm" title="Lille">Lille</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a> in France, and <a href="../../wp/b/Brussels.htm" title="Brussels">Brussels</a> in <a href="../../wp/b/Belgium.htm" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>.<p><!--del_lnk--> Biggin Hill is often counted as London&#39;s sixth airport. However, this is not an international airport and handles mainly chartered aircraft.<ul>
       <li>By annual passenger air traffic (2002 census), London ranks 1st in the world, with around 133,599,000 passengers using <!--del_lnk--> London Heathrow Airport, <!--del_lnk--> London Gatwick Airport, <!--del_lnk--> London Stansted Airport, <!--del_lnk--> London Luton Airport and <!--del_lnk--> London City Airport in the year 2005.</ul>
      <p><a id="Road" name="Road"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Road</span></h3>
      <p>Although the vast majority of journeys involving central London are made by public transport, travel in outer London is car-dominated. The <!--del_lnk--> inner ring road (around the city centre), the <!--del_lnk--> North and <!--del_lnk--> South Circular roads (in the suburbs) and an orbital <!--del_lnk--> motorway (the <a href="../../wp/m/M25_motorway.htm" title="M25 motorway">M25</a>, outside the built-up area) circuit the city and are intersected by a number of busy radial routes &mdash; but very few motorways penetrate into <!--del_lnk--> inner London. A plan for a comprehensive network of motorways throughout the city (the <!--del_lnk--> Ringways Plan) was prepared in the <!--del_lnk--> 1960s but was mostly cancelled in the early <!--del_lnk--> 1970s due to vociferous objections from the population and the huge costs. In 2003, a <!--del_lnk--> congestion charge was introduced to reduce traffic volumes in the city centre. With a few exceptions, motorists are required to pay &pound;8 per day to drive within a defined zone encompassing much of central London. Motorists who are residents in the defined zone can also buy a season pass which is renewed monthly.<p><a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h2>

      <p>Home to a diverse range of universities, colleges and schools, London has a significant student population (about 378,000) and is a centre of <!--del_lnk--> research and development. Most primary and secondary schools in London follow the <!--del_lnk--> same system as the rest of England.<p>With 125,000 students, the <!--del_lnk--> University of London is the largest contact teaching university in the United Kingdom and in Europe. It comprises 20 colleges as well as several smaller institutes, each with a high degree of autonomy. Constituent colleges have their own <!--del_lnk--> admissions procedures, and are effectively universities in their own right, although all degrees are awarded by the University of London rather than the individual colleges. Its constituents include multi-disciplinary colleges such as <!--del_lnk--> UCL, <!--del_lnk--> King&#39;s and <!--del_lnk--> Queen Mary and more specialised institutions such as <!--del_lnk--> Imperial, the <!--del_lnk--> London School of Economics, <!--del_lnk--> SOAS, the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Academy of Music and the <!--del_lnk--> Institute of Education.<p>London&#39;s other universities, such as <!--del_lnk--> City University, <!--del_lnk--> London Metropolitan University, <!--del_lnk--> Middlesex University, <!--del_lnk--> UEL, the <!--del_lnk--> University of Westminster and <!--del_lnk--> London South Bank University, are not part of the University of London. Some were <!--del_lnk--> polytechnics until these were granted university status in <!--del_lnk--> 1992, and others which were founded much earlier.<p>London is home to a number of important museums and other institutions which are major <!--del_lnk--> tourist attractions as well as playing a research role. The <!--del_lnk--> Natural History Museum, <!--del_lnk--> Science Museum and <!--del_lnk--> Victoria and Albert Museum (dealing with fashion and design) are clustered in <!--del_lnk--> South Kensington&#39;s &quot;museum quarter&quot;, whilst the <!--del_lnk--> British Museum houses historic artefacts from around the world. The <!--del_lnk--> British Library at <!--del_lnk--> St Pancras is the UK&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> national library, housing 150 million items. The city also houses extensive art collections, primarily in the <a href="../../wp/n/National_Gallery%252C_London.htm" title="National Gallery, London">National Gallery</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Tate Britain and <!--del_lnk--> Tate Modern.<p><a id="Society_and_culture" name="Society_and_culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Society and culture</span></h2>

London&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> theatre district is here, as are many cinemas, bars, clubs and restaurants, including the city&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Chinatown district, whilst just to the east is <!--del_lnk--> Covent Garden, an area housing speciality shops and London&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Avenue of Stars&quot; which honours achievers in the entertainment industry.<p>London&#39;s busiest shopping area is <!--del_lnk--> Oxford Street, a mainstream shopping street nearly 2 km long. The adjoining <!--del_lnk--> Bond Street in <!--del_lnk--> Mayfair is a more upmarket location along with the <!--del_lnk--> Knightsbridge area - home to the <!--del_lnk--> Harrods <!--del_lnk--> department store - to the southwest. The districts of Knightsbridge (<!--del_lnk--> Sloane Street), Mayfair (Bond Street, <!--del_lnk--> Brook Street), and Chelsea (King&#39;s Road) represent London&#39;s prestigious role in the world of fashion, being an international centre of fashion alongside Paris, Milan, New York and Tokyo. Furthermore, London has a number of markets, including <!--del_lnk--> Camden Market for fashions, <!--del_lnk--> Portobello Road for antiques and <!--del_lnk--> Borough Market for foods.<p>London offers a huge variety of cuisines as a result of its ethnically diverse population. Well-known gastronomic centres include the Bangladeshi restaurants of <!--del_lnk--> Brick Lane and the Chinese food of <!--del_lnk--> Chinatown. <!--del_lnk--> Soho offers a variety of relatively cheap international restaurants, whilst more upmarket restaurants are scattered around central London, with concentrations in <!--del_lnk--> Mayfair. Across the city, areas home to particular <a href="../../wp/e/Ethnic_group.htm" title="Ethnic group">ethnic groups</a> are often recognisable by restaurants, food shops and market stalls offering their local fare, and even the large supermarkets stock such items in areas with sizeable ethnic groups.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Caribbean-descended community in <!--del_lnk--> Notting Hill in <!--del_lnk--> West London organises the colourful <!--del_lnk--> Notting Hill Carnival, Europe&#39;s biggest street carnival, every summer.

      <p>London has been the setting for many works of literature. Two writers closely associated with the city are the diarist <!--del_lnk--> Samuel Pepys, famous among other things for his eyewitness account of the <!--del_lnk--> Great Fire, and <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_Dickens.htm" title="Charles Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>, whose representation of a foggy, snowy, grimy London of street sweepers and pickpockets is a major influence on people&#39;s vision of early <!--del_lnk--> Victorian London. <!--del_lnk--> James Boswell&#39;s biographical <i><!--del_lnk--> Life of Johnson</i> mostly takes place in London, and is the source of <!--del_lnk--> Johnson&#39;s famous aphorism: &quot;<i>When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford.</i>&quot; The earlier (1722) <i><!--del_lnk--> A Journal of the Plague Year</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Daniel Defoe is a fictionalisation of the events of the 1665 <!--del_lnk--> Great Plague. <a href="../../wp/w/William_Shakespeare.htm" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> spent a large part of his life living and working in London; his contemporary <a href="../../wp/b/Ben_Jonson.htm" title="Ben Jonson">Ben Jonson</a> was also based in London, and some of his work -- most notably his play <i><!--del_lnk--> The Alchemist</i> -- was set in the city. Later important depictions of London from the 19th and early 20th centuries are the afore-mentioned Dickens novels, and <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Conan Doyle&#39;s famous <!--del_lnk--> Sherlock Holmes stories. The 1933 novel <i><!--del_lnk--> Down and Out in Paris and London</i> by <!--del_lnk--> George Orwell describes life in poverty in both cities. A modern writer pervasively influenced by the city is <!--del_lnk--> Peter Ackroyd, in works such as <i>London: The Biography</i>, <i>The Lambs of London</i> and <i>Hawksmoor</i>. Along with <!--del_lnk--> Bloomsbury, the hilly area of <!--del_lnk--> Hampstead has traditionally been the literary heartland of London.<p>Traditionally, London has played a significant role in the film industry, and boasts major studios at <!--del_lnk--> Pinewood and <!--del_lnk--> Shepperton, both just outside West London, as well as an important <!--del_lnk--> special effects and post-production community. Many films have also used London as a location and have done much to shape international perceptions of the city. See main article <i><!--del_lnk--> London in film</i>.<p>The city also hosts a number of <!--del_lnk--> performing arts schools, including the <!--del_lnk--> Central School of Speech and Drama, whose past students include <!--del_lnk--> Judi Dench and <a href="../../wp/l/Laurence_Olivier.htm" title="Laurence Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (educators of <!--del_lnk--> Jim Broadbent and <!--del_lnk--> Donald Sutherland amongst others) and the prestigious <!--del_lnk--> Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (past students including <!--del_lnk--> Joan Collins and <!--del_lnk--> Roger Moore).<p>The <!--del_lnk--> London Film Festival is held in the city each October.<p><a id="Music" name="Music"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Music</span></h3>

London was also the host of the <a href="../../wp/c/Commonwealth_Games.htm" title="Commonwealth Games">British Empire Games</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1934.<p>London&#39;s most popular sport (for both participants and spectators) is <a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Football (soccer)">football</a>.

First, in the sixteenth century headmaster of <!--del_lnk--> St Paul&#39;s School <!--del_lnk--> Richard Mulcaster is credited with taking <!--del_lnk--> mob football and transforming it into organised and refereed team <a href="../../wp/f/Football.htm" title="Football">football</a> in order to be beneficial for schoolboys. Second, London was home to <!--del_lnk--> Ebenezer Cobb Morley who was a founding member of the <!--del_lnk--> Football Association in 1862. In 1863, he wrote to Bell&#39;s Life <a href="../../wp/n/Newspaper.htm" title="Newspaper">newspaper</a> proposing a governing body for football that led to the first meeting at the <!--del_lnk--> Freemason&#39;s Tavern in central London that created the <!--del_lnk--> Football Association, the <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a> governing body of <a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Soccer">soccer</a> and the first of its kind anywhere in the world. He wrote at his house in Barnes the first set of rules of true modern <a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Soccer">soccer</a> that were adopted by the FA and spread all over the world. It is, therefore, true to say that <a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Association football">Association football</a> (<a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Soccer">soccer</a>) was invented in London<p>London also has four <!--del_lnk--> rugby union teams in the <!--del_lnk--> Guinness Premiership (<!--del_lnk--> London Irish, <!--del_lnk--> Saracens, <!--del_lnk--> Wasps and <!--del_lnk--> NEC Harlequins), although only the Harlequins play in London (all the other three now play outside Greater London), as well as a rugby league <!--del_lnk--> Super League club in <!--del_lnk--> Harlequins RL.
