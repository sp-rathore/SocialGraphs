It faces <!--del_lnk--> Wallasey and <!--del_lnk--> Birkenhead across the <!--del_lnk--> River Mersey to the west.<p>Liverpool is governed by <!--del_lnk--> Liverpool City Council, one of five councils within the <!--del_lnk--> Metropolitan county of <!--del_lnk--> Merseyside, and is one of England&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> core cities and its fifth most populous - 441,477 in <!--del_lnk--> 2002, with 816,000 in the Liverpool Urban Area, which includes suburbs on the Liverpool side of the Mersey but not those on the <!--del_lnk--> Wirral.<p>Inhabitants of Liverpool are referred to as <b>Liverpudlians</b> and nicknamed &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Scousers&quot;, in reference to the local meal known as &#39;scouse&#39;, a form of stew.

      <p>King John&#39;s letters patent of <!--del_lnk--> 1207 announced the foundation of the borough of Liverpool and by the middle of the 16th century the population was still only around 500. In the 17th century there was slow progress in trade and population growth. A number of battles for the town were waged during the <!--del_lnk--> English Civil War, including an eighteen-day siege in <!--del_lnk--> 1644. In <!--del_lnk--> 1699 Liverpool was made a <!--del_lnk--> parish by <!--del_lnk--> Act of Parliament, that same year its first slave ship, Liverpool Merchant, set sail for Africa. As trade from the <!--del_lnk--> West Indies surpassed that of Ireland and Europe, Liverpool began to grow. The first <!--del_lnk--> wet dock in Britain was built in Liverpool in <!--del_lnk--> 1715. Substantial profits from the <!--del_lnk--> slave trade helped the town to prosper and rapidly grow. By close of the century Liverpool controlled over 41% of European and 80% of Britain&#39;s slave commerce.<p>By the start of the nineteenth century, 40% of the world&#39;s trade was passing through Liverpool and the construction of many major buildings reflected this wealth. In 1830, Liverpool (along with <a href="../../wp/m/Manchester.htm" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>) became the first city to have an intercity rail link, through the <a href="../../wp/l/Liverpool_and_Manchester_Railway.htm" title="Liverpool and Manchester Railway">Liverpool and Manchester Railway</a>. The population continued to rise rapidly, especially during the 1840s when the <!--del_lnk--> Irish began arriving by the thousands due to the <!--del_lnk--> Great Famine. By 1851, approximately 25% of the city was Irish-born. During the first part of the 20th century, Liverpool was pulling in emigrants from across Europe. During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> there were 80 <!--del_lnk--> air-raids on Merseyside, killing 2500 people and causing damage to almost half the homes in the metropolitan area. Since 1952 Liverpool has been twinned with <a href="../../wp/c/Cologne.htm" title="Cologne">Cologne</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>, a city that shared the horrifying experience of excessive aerial bombing. Significant rebuilding followed the war, including massive housing estates and the <!--del_lnk--> Seaforth Dock, the largest dock project in Britain.<p>The population of Liverpool peaked in the 1931 census, which reported 855,688 inhabitants. This had declined to 610,114 by 1961, and further to 439,476 in the 2001 census. <p>In the <!--del_lnk--> 1960s Liverpool became a centre of <!--del_lnk--> youth culture. The &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Merseybeat&quot; sound which became synonymous with The Beatles and fellow Liverpudlian pop bands of the era catapulted the city to the front of the popular music scene. Economically however the city has been in decline since the 1950s with the loss of numerous employers and from the <!--del_lnk--> 1970s onwards Liverpool&#39;s docks and traditional manufacturing industries went into sharp decline. The advent of <!--del_lnk--> containerization meant that Liverpool&#39;s docks became largely obsolete. In the early 1980s <!--del_lnk--> unemployment rates in Liverpool were amongst the highest in the UK.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1974, Liverpool became a <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan district within the newly created <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan county of <!--del_lnk--> Merseyside, it had previously been in <!--del_lnk--> Lancashire. At the end of the century Liverpool was concentrating on regeneration which still continues today, with the city winning the accolade of <!--del_lnk--> European Capital of Culture for <!--del_lnk--> 2008. Capitalising on the popularity of the <!--del_lnk--> 1960s pop group <a href="../../wp/t/The_Beatles.htm" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> and other groups of the Merseybeat era, tourism has also become a significant factor in Liverpool&#39;s economy.<p>In 2004, property developer Grosvenor started the <!--del_lnk--> Paradise Project, a &pound;920m development centred on Paradise Street, which will involve the most significant changes to Liverpool&#39;s city centre since the post-war reconstruction.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>
      <p>Liverpool is internationally known as a cultural centre, with a particularly rich history in popular music, performing and visual arts.<p>During the late 1960s, the city also became well known for the <!--del_lnk--> Liverpool poets, of whom <!--del_lnk--> Roger McGough and the late <!--del_lnk--> Adrian Henri are among the best known. The anthology <i><!--del_lnk--> The Mersey Sound</i>, by Henri, McGough and <!--del_lnk--> Brian Patten, has sold over 500,000 copies since first being published in 1967.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 2003, Liverpool was named <!--del_lnk--> European Capital of Culture for 2008. A series of cultural events during 2004-9 is planned, peaking in 2008.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Liverpool has a vibrant artistic life. Several <!--del_lnk--> pre-Raphaelites are among the important paintings in the <!--del_lnk--> Walker Art Gallery. <!--del_lnk--> Sudley House contains another major collection of pre 20th century art . The <!--del_lnk--> Tate Liverpool gallery houses the modern art collection of the Tate in the north of England. The <!--del_lnk--> FACT centre hosts touring multimedia exhibitions.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Liverpool Biennial is a festival of arts held (as the name implies) every two years. The festival generally runs from mid September to late November and comprises three main sections; the International, The Independents and New Contemporaries although many fringe events are timed to coincide. It was during this event in 2004 that <!--del_lnk--> Yoko Ono&#39;s work &quot;My mother is beautiful&quot; caused widespread public protest by exhibiting photographs of a naked woman&#39;s pubic area on the main shopping street. Despite protests the work remained in place.<p>The 2006 Biennial has recently started and will run to mid November, exhibitions can be found dotted around Liverpool City centre and include such things as the lions in front of St. Georges Hall being caged, and St. Lukes Church being filled with upturned boats, maps of the display along with some exhibitions can be found at FACT cinema/gallery.<p><a id="Sport" name="Sport"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sport</span></h2>
      <p>Liverpool has two <!--del_lnk--> Premier League football clubs: <!--del_lnk--> Everton F.C. at <!--del_lnk--> Goodison Park and <a href="../../wp/l/Liverpool_F.C..htm" title="Liverpool F.C.">Liverpool F.C.</a> at <!--del_lnk--> Anfield.

      <p>Liverpool contains over <!--del_lnk--> 2,500 listed buildings (of which 26 are Grade I listed and 85 are Grade II* listed). It is the inheritance of high-minded public spirit since the late 18th century, largely with <!--del_lnk--> Dissenter impetus, resulting in more public sculpture than in any UK city aside from <!--del_lnk--> Westminster, more listed buildings than any city apart from London and, surprisingly, more Georgian houses than the city of <!--del_lnk--> Bath. Many well-known <!--del_lnk--> architects are represented in Liverpool, including <!--del_lnk--> Peter Ellis, <!--del_lnk--> Harvey Lonsdale Elmes, <!--del_lnk--> John Foster, <!--del_lnk--> Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, <!--del_lnk--> Sir Edwin Lutyens and <!--del_lnk--> Sir Frederick Gibberd.<p><a id="Waterfront" name="Waterfront"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Waterfront</span></h3>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 2004 Liverpool&#39;s waterfront was declared as a <!--del_lnk--> UNESCO <!--del_lnk--> World Heritage site, reflecting the city&#39;s importance in the development of the world&#39;s trading system and <!--del_lnk--> dock technology.<p>The docks are central to Liverpool&#39;s history, with arguably the best-known being <!--del_lnk--> Albert Dock: the first enclosed, non-combustible dock warehouse system in the world and the first structure in Britain to be built entirely of cast iron, brick and stone, designed by <!--del_lnk--> Jesse Hartley. Restored in the <!--del_lnk--> 1980s, the Albert Dock is the largest collection of Grade I listed buildings in Britain. Part of the old dock complex is now the home to the <!--del_lnk--> Merseyside Maritime Museum, <!--del_lnk--> Museum of Liverpool Life and the <!--del_lnk--> Tate Liverpool. Other relics of the dock system include the <!--del_lnk--> Stanley Dock Tobacco Warehouse, which at the time of its construction in <!--del_lnk--> 1901, was the world&#39;s largest building in terms of area.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Pier Head is arguably the most famous image of Liverpool, the location of the <i>Three Graces</i>, three of Liverpool&#39;s most recognisable buildings. The first is the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Liver Building, built in the early <!--del_lnk--> 1900s and surmounted by two bronze domes with a <!--del_lnk--> Liver Bird (the symbol of Liverpool) on each. The second is the <!--del_lnk--> Cunard Building, the headquarters of the former <!--del_lnk--> Cunard shipping company. The third is the <!--del_lnk--> Port of Liverpool Building, the home of the former <!--del_lnk--> Mersey Docks and Harbour Board which regulated the city&#39;s docks.<p>In front of these buildings at the waters edge are the memorials to the men of the merchant navy who sailed out of the port during both World Wars. Memorials to the British mariners, Norwegian, Dutch and to the many thousands of Chinese seamen who manned Britain&#39;s ships cluster together here. Perhaps most intereting is the Chinese memorial to the men forcibly deported from the city after World War Two and to the families they left behind. see: <!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Places_of_worship" name="Places_of_worship"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Places of worship</span></h3>
      <p>The thousands of migrants and sailors passing through Liverpool resulted in a religious diversity that is still apparent today. This is reflected in the equally diverse collection of religious buildings, and two Christian cathedrals.<p>The parish church of Liverpool is the Anglican <!--del_lnk--> Our Lady and St Nicholas, colloquially known as &quot;the sailors church&quot;, which has existed near the waterfront since 1257. It regularly hosts to Catholic masses. Other notable churches include the <!--del_lnk--> Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas (built in the <!--del_lnk--> Byzantine style), and the <!--del_lnk--> Gustav Adolfus Kyrka (the Swedish Seamen&#39;s Church, reminiscent of Nordic styles).<p>Liverpool&#39;s wealth as a port city enabled the construction of two enormous <!--del_lnk--> cathedrals, both dating from the 20th century. The <!--del_lnk--> Anglican Cathedral, designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, has one of the longest <!--del_lnk--> naves, largest organs and heaviest and highest peals of bells in the world. The <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic <!--del_lnk--> Metropolitan Cathedral was initially planned to be even larger; of Sir Edwin Lutyens&#39; design, only the crypt was completed. The cathedral was eventually built to a simpler design by Sir Frederick Gibberd; while this is on a smaller scale than Lutyens&#39; original design, it still manages to incorporate the largest panel of <a href="../../wp/s/Stained_glass.htm" title="Stained glass">stained glass</a> in the world. Appropriately enough, the road running between the two cathedrals is called <!--del_lnk--> Hope Street.<p>Liverpool has a number of synagogues, of which the Grade II* listed Moorish-revival <!--del_lnk--> Princes Road Synagogue is perhaps most notable. Liverpool has a thriving Jewish community.<p>The city had one of the earliest <a href="../../wp/m/Mosque.htm" title="Mosque">mosques</a> in Britain, founded in <!--del_lnk--> 1887 by <!--del_lnk--> William Abdullah Quilliam, a lawyer who had converted to <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a>. Currently the main mosque in Liverpool is the <!--del_lnk--> Al-Rahma mosque.<p><a id="Other_notable_buildings" name="Other_notable_buildings"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other notable buildings</span></h3>
      <p>The area around <!--del_lnk--> William Brown Street has been labelled the city&#39;s &#39;Cultural Quarter&#39;, owing to the presence of the <!--del_lnk--> William Brown Library, <!--del_lnk--> Walker Art Gallery and <!--del_lnk--> World Museum Liverpool, just three of Liverpool&#39;s many neo-classical buildings. Nearby is <!--del_lnk--> St George&#39;s Hall, perhaps the most impressive of these neo-classical buildings, was built to serve both as a concert hall and as the city&#39;s law courts. Also in this area are <!--del_lnk--> Wellington&#39;s Column and the Seble Fountain.<p>Liverpool&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Town Hall dates from <!--del_lnk--> 1754 and has a beautifully-designed interior.<p>The term <i><!--del_lnk--> Red Brick University</i>, applied to many British universities dating from a similar period, was inspired by the <!--del_lnk--> University of Liverpool&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Victoria Building, noted for its clock tower.<p>Some of Liverpool&#39;s landmarks are better known for their oddness rather than for their role. <!--del_lnk--> Williamson&#39;s tunnels are architecturally unique as being the largest underground folly in the world. The <!--del_lnk--> Philharmonic Dining Rooms are noteworthy for their ornate Victorian toilets, which have become a tourist attraction in their own right.<p><a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h2>
      <p>In Liverpool primary and secondary education is available in various forms supported by the state include <!--del_lnk--> secular, <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_England.htm" title="Church of England">Church of England</a>, <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jewish">Jewish</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic. Islamic education is available at primary level, but there is currently no secondary provision.<p>One of Liverpool&#39;s important early schools was <!--del_lnk--> The Liverpool Blue Coat School; founded in <!--del_lnk--> 1708 as a charitable school, it continues today. <!--del_lnk--> The Belvedere School is one of the leading private schools in the city, along with <!--del_lnk--> Liverpool College founded in 1840 and <!--del_lnk--> Merchant Taylors&#39; School. Another of Liverpool&#39;s notable senior schools is <!--del_lnk--> St. Edward&#39;s College, a former private high school located in West Derby. Historic grammar schools, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Liverpool Institute High School &amp; <!--del_lnk--> Liverpool Collegiate, closed in the 1980s are still remembered as centres of academic excellence.<p>Liverpool has three <a href="../../wp/u/University.htm" title="University">universities</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> University of Liverpool, <!--del_lnk--> Liverpool Hope University and <!--del_lnk--> Liverpool John Moores University. <!--del_lnk--> Edge Hill University, originally founded as a <!--del_lnk--> teacher-training college in the <!--del_lnk--> Edge Hill district of Liverpool, is now located in <!--del_lnk--> Ormskirk in South-West Lancashire.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, founded to address some of the problems created by trade, continues today as a post-graduate school in the <!--del_lnk--> University of Liverpool and is one of only two institutions internationally that house the de facto standard anti-venom repository.<p><!--del_lnk--> Liverpool Hope University, founded in 1844, is situated on both sides of Taggart Avenue in Childwall and a second Campus in the City Centre (The Cornerstone). Hope is quickly making a name for itself within the Liberal Arts, the University has also enjoyed many successes in terms of high graduate employability, campus development, and a substantial increase in student applications from outside of the City.<p>Liverpool John Moores University was previously a <!--del_lnk--> polytechnic, and gained university status in <!--del_lnk--> 1992. It is named in honour of <!--del_lnk--> Sir John Moores, one of the founders of the <!--del_lnk--> Littlewoods football pools and retail group, who was a major benefactor.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts was set up by (Sir) <a href="../../wp/p/Paul_McCartney.htm" title="Paul McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1996, to train artistes and technicians. It is situated in the building which formerly housed the <!--del_lnk--> Liverpool Institute High School for Boys and is affiliated with <!--del_lnk--> Liverpool John Moores University. Recently, LIPA has been awarded the ability to issue its own degrees, and is moving towards becoming an independent higher education instution.<p>The city has one <!--del_lnk--> further education college, <!--del_lnk--> Liverpool Community College. The college will recruit around 21,000 students in the academic year 2006/07.<p><a id="Transport" name="Transport"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transport</span></h2>

Made famous by the song <i>Ferry Cross the Mersey</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Gerry and the Pacemakers, the song is now played on the ferryboats themselves every time they prepare to dock at Liverpool after a tourist cruise.<p>The Mersey is crossed upstream from Liverpool at Runcorn and Widnes, by the <!--del_lnk--> Silver Jubilee Bridge (usually known simply as the &quot;Runcorn Bridge&quot;) and the Runcorn railway bridge.<p><a id="Airport" name="Airport"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Airport</span></h3>

      <p>The economy of Liverpool is beginning to recover from its long, post-<a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> decline. Between <!--del_lnk--> 1995 and <!--del_lnk--> 2001 <!--del_lnk--> GVA per head grew at 6.3% annum. This compared with 5.8% for inner London and 5.7% for <a href="../../wp/b/Bristol.htm" title="Bristol">Bristol</a>. The rate of job growth was 9.2% compared with a national average of 4.9% for the same period, <!--del_lnk--> 1998-<!--del_lnk--> 2002. However, Liverpool is still comparatively poor; a 2001 report by CACI showed that Liverpool still had four of the ten poorest postcode districts in the country.<!--del_lnk--> <p>Like the rest of the United Kingdom the city has seen a large growth in the service sector, both public and private. Government offices include parts of the <!--del_lnk--> National Health Service and <!--del_lnk--> Home Office agencies such as the <!--del_lnk--> Criminal Records Bureau and the <!--del_lnk--> Identity and Passport Service, formerly the UK Passport Agency. Private sector service industries have invested in Liverpool too with several major call centres opening of late. The activities of the port have left the site with a communications infrastructure that had for a long time exceeded requirements.<p>Growth in the areas of <!--del_lnk--> New Media has been helped by the existence of a relatively large <!--del_lnk--> computer game development community. Sony based one of only a handful of European <!--del_lnk--> PlayStation research and development centres in Wavertree, after buying out noted software publisher <!--del_lnk--> Psygnosis. Indeed, according to a 2006 issue of industry magazine &#39;Edge&#39; (issue 162), the first professional quality PlayStation software developer&#39;s kits were largely programmed by Sony&#39;s Liverpool &#39;studio&#39; &mdash; the console has since become one of the World&#39;s most successful consumer products ever.<p>Tourism is a major factor in the economy and will be of increasing importance in the run up to the Liverpool&#39;s year as European Capital of Culture. This has led to a great increase in the provision of high quality services such as hotels, restaurants and clubs. The buildings of Liverpool not only attract tourists but also film makers, who regularly use Liverpool to double for many cities around the worlds and making it the second most filmed city in the UK.<p><a id="Twin_towns" name="Twin_towns"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Twin towns</span></h2>
