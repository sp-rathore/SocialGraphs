      <p>The concept of <i>love</i> is not amenable to one authoritative definition. It is the subject of considerable debate, enduring speculation, and thoughtful introspection. As an approximation, different aspects of <i>love</i> can be illustrated by comparing its corollaries and opposites. As a general expression of positive sentiment (a stronger form of <i>like</i>), love is commonly contrasted with <!--del_lnk--> hate (or neutral <!--del_lnk--> apathy); as a less <!--del_lnk--> self-centered and more &quot;mutual&quot; sign of intense desire, love is commonly contrasted with <!--del_lnk--> lust; and as an interpersonal relationship with romantic overtones, love is commonly contrasted with <!--del_lnk--> friendship, although other connotations of <i>love</i> may be applied to close friendships as well.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>In ordinary use, <i>love</i> usually refers to interpersonal love, an experience felt by a person for another person. Love often involves caring for or identifying with a person or thing, including oneself (cf. <!--del_lnk--> narcissism).<p>The very existence of love is itself subject to debate. Some categorically reject the notion as false or meaningless. Others call it a recently-invented abstraction, sometimes dating the &quot;invention&quot; to courtly Europe during or after the middle ages, although this is contradicted by the sizable body of ancient love poetry. Others maintain that love really exists, and is not an abstraction, but is undefinable, being an essence which is <!--del_lnk--> spiritual or <!--del_lnk--> metaphysical in nature. Some psychologists maintain that love is the action of lending one&#39;s &quot;boundary&quot; or &quot;<!--del_lnk--> self-esteem&quot; to another. Others attempt to define love by applying the definition to everyday life.<p>Cultural differences make any universal definition of love difficult to establish. Expressions of love may include the love for a <!--del_lnk--> soul or <a href="../../wp/m/Mind.htm" title="Mind">mind</a>, the love of laws and organizations, love for a body, love for nature, love of food, love of money, love for learning, love of power, love of fame, love for the respect of others, etc. Different people place varying degrees of importance on the kinds of love they receive. Love is essentially an <!--del_lnk--> abstract concept, easier to experience than to explain. Because of the complex and abstract nature of love, discourse on love is commonly reduced to a <!--del_lnk--> thought-terminating clich&eacute;, and there are a number of common <!--del_lnk--> proverbs regarding love, from Virgil&#39;s &quot;Love conquers all&quot; to <a href="../../wp/t/The_Beatles.htm" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>&#39; &quot;<!--del_lnk--> All you need is love.&quot; <a href="../../wp/b/Bertrand_Russell.htm" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a> describes love as a condition of &quot;absolute value,&quot; as opposed to <!--del_lnk--> relative value.<p>Though love is considered a positive and desirable aspect of existence, love can cause a great deal of emotional harm. Consider <a href="../../wp/r/Romeo_and_Juliet.htm" title="Romeo and Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Othello, <!--del_lnk--> Great Expectations, and other classical and popular works that enumerate how love can lead to tragedy and emotional pain. In human interactions, love becomes a peril when love is not bilateral, known as <!--del_lnk--> Unrequited love. A further peril for individuals that love, or can love others, is that love is not enduring and that many people have psychological <!--del_lnk--> defense mechanisms inhibit their ability to accept or reciprocate love.<p><a id="Human_bonding" name="Human_bonding"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Human bonding</span></h2>

      <p>People, throughout history, have often considered phenomena such as &ldquo;love at first sight&rdquo; or &ldquo;instant friendships&rdquo; to be the result of an uncontrollable <a href="../../wp/f/Force.htm" title="Force">force</a> of attraction or affinity. One of the first to theorize in this direction was the Greek philosopher <!--del_lnk--> Empedocles who in the fourth century BC argued for existence of two forces: love (<i>philia</i>) and strife (<i>neikos</i>), which were used to account for the causes of motion in the universe. These two forces were said to intermingle with the <!--del_lnk--> four elements, i.e. earth, water, air, and fire, in such a manner that love, so to say, served as the binding power linking the various parts of existence harmoniously together.<p>Later, <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a> interpreted Empedocles&rsquo; two agents as <i>attraction</i> and <i>repulsion</i>, stating that their operation is conceived in an alternate sequence. From these arguments, Plato originated the concept of &ldquo;likes attract&rdquo;, e.g. earth is thus attracted towards earth, water toward water, and fire toward fire. In modern terms this is often phrased in terms of &ldquo;birds of a feather flock together&rdquo;. Later, following developments in electrical theories, such as <a href="../../wp/c/Coulomb%2527s_law.htm" title="Coulomb&#39;s law">Coulomb&#39;s law</a>, which showed that positive and negative charges attract, analogs in human life were developed such as &quot;opposites attract.&quot; Over the last century, researcher on the nature of human mating, such as in <!--del_lnk--> evolutionary psychology, agree that pairs unite or attract to each other owing to a combination of opposites attract, e.g. people with dissimilar immune systems tend to attract, and likes attract, such similarities of personality, character, views, etc. In recent years, various human bonding theories have been developed described in terms of attachments, ties, bonds, and or affinities.<p><a id="Religious_views" name="Religious_views"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Religious views</span></h2>

      <p>Love in early religions was a mixture of ecstatic devotion and ritualised obligation to idealised natural forces (pagan polytheism). Later religions shifted emphasis towards single abstractly-oriented objects like God, law, church and state (formalised monotheism). A third view, pantheism, recognises a state or truth distinct from (and often antagonistic to) the idea that there is a difference between the worshipping subject and the worshipped object. Love is reality, of which we, moving through time, imperfectly interpret ourselves as an isolated part.<p>The <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">Bible</a> speaks of love as a set of attitudes and actions that are far broader than the concept of love as an emotional attachment. Love is seen as a set of behaviours that humankind is encouraged to act out. One is encouraged not just to love one&#39;s partner, or even one&#39;s friends but also to love one&#39;s enemies. The Bible describes this type of active love in 1 Corinthians 13:4-8:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>Romantic love is also present in the Bible, particularly the Song of Songs.

      <p>Although there exist numerous cross-cultural unified similarities as to the nature and definition of love, as in there being a thread of commitment, tenderness, and passion common to all human existence, there are differences. For example, in <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> and parts of <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asia, with arranged marriages commonplace, it is believed that love is not a necessary ingredient in the initial stages of marriage &ndash; it is something that can be created during the marriage; whereas in Western culture, by comparison, love is seen as a necessary prerequisite to marriage.<p><a id="Scientific_views" name="Scientific_views"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Scientific views</span></h2>

      <p>Throughout history, <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> and <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religion</a> have done the most speculation on the phenomenon of love. In the last century, the science of <a href="../../wp/p/Psychology.htm" title="Psychology">psychology</a> has written a great deal on the subject. In recent years, the sciences of <!--del_lnk--> evolutionary psychology, <!--del_lnk--> evolutionary biology, <a href="../../wp/a/Anthropology.htm" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a>, <!--del_lnk--> neuroscience, and <a href="../../wp/b/Biology.htm" title="Biology">biology</a> have added to our understanding of the nature and function of love.<p>Biological models of sex tend to view love as a <a href="../../wp/m/Mammal.htm" title="Mammal">mammalian</a> drive, just like <a href="../../wp/h/Hunger.htm" title="Hunger">hunger</a> or <!--del_lnk--> thirst. Psychology depicts love as a cognitive and social phenomenon. <!--del_lnk--> Psychologist <!--del_lnk--> Robert Sternberg formulated a <!--del_lnk--> Triangular theory of love and argued that love has three different components: Intimacy, Commitment, and Passion. <i>Intimacy</i> is a form by which two people can share secrets and various details of their personal lives. Intimacy is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs. <i>Commitment</i> on the other hand is the expectation that the relationship is going to last forever. The last and most common form of love is sexual attraction and passion. <i>Passionate</i> love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love. This led researchers such as Yela  to further refine the model by separating Passion into two independents components: Erotic Passion and Romantic Passion.<p><a id="Chemical_basis" name="Chemical_basis"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Chemical basis</span></h3>

      <p>Recent studies in <!--del_lnk--> neuroscience have indicated that a consistent number of chemicals are present in the brain when people testify to feeling love. These chemicals include; <!--del_lnk--> Testosterone, <!--del_lnk--> Oestrogen, <!--del_lnk--> Dopamine, <!--del_lnk--> Norepinephrine, <!--del_lnk--> Serotonin, <!--del_lnk--> Oxytocin, and <!--del_lnk--> Vasopressin. More specifically, higher levels of Testosterone and Oestrogen are present during the lustful phase of a relationship. Dopamine, Norepinephrine, and Serotonin are more commonly found during the attraction phase of a relationship. Oxytocin, and Vasopressin seemed to be more closely linked to long term bonding and relationships characterized by strong attachments.<p>In 2005, Italian scientists at <!--del_lnk--> Pavia University found that a protein molecule known as the <!--del_lnk--> nerve growth factor (NGF) has high levels when people first fall in love, but these levels return to as they were after one year. Specifically, four <!--del_lnk--> neurotrophin levels, i.e. <!--del_lnk--> NGF, <!--del_lnk--> BDNF, <!--del_lnk--> NT-3, and <!--del_lnk--> NT-4, of 58 subjects who had recently fallen in love were compared with levels in a control group who were either single or already engaged in a long-term relationship. The results showed that NGF levels were significantly higher in the subjects in love than as compared to the either of the control groups.<p><a id="Definitional_issues" name="Definitional_issues"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Definitional issues</span></h2>
      <p>Dictionaries tend to define <i>love</i> as deep affection or fondness. In colloquial use, according to polled opinion, the most favoured definitions of <i>love</i> include the words:<ol>
       <li><b><a href="../../wp/l/Life.htm" title="Life">life</a></b> - someone to whom one would give their life.<li><b><!--del_lnk--> care</b> - refers to a mental or emotional state of predisposition in which one has an interest or concern for someone or something. To care for someone, may also refer to a disquieted state of mixed uncertainty, apprehension, and responsibility; or a cause for such anxiety.<li><b><!--del_lnk--> friendship</b> - favoured interpersonal associations or relationships.<li><b><!--del_lnk--> union</b> - dissolution of loving subject into loved object; a hyper-real state of creative generosity.<li><b><a href="../../wp/f/Family.htm" title="Family">family</a></b> - people related via common ancestry(ie:Platonic love)<li><b><!--del_lnk--> bond</b> - the inner connection when another person is a part of your identity.</ol>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Thomas Jay Oord defines love as acting intentionally, in sympathetic response to others (including God), to promote overall well-being.
