      <p>Louis Jean Pasteur was born in <!--del_lnk--> Dole in the <!--del_lnk--> Jura region of <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> and grew up in the town of Arbois. His father, <!--del_lnk--> Jean Pasteur, was a <!--del_lnk--> tanner and a veteran of the <!--del_lnk--> Napoleonic wars. His aptitude was recognized by his college headmaster, who recommended that the young man apply for the <!--del_lnk--> &Eacute;cole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure, which accepted him. After serving briefly as professor of <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physics</a> at <!--del_lnk--> Dijon Lycee in <!--del_lnk--> 1848, he became professor of chemistry at <!--del_lnk--> Strasbourg University, where he met and courted <!--del_lnk--> Marie Laurent, daughter of the university&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> rector in <!--del_lnk--> 1849. Together they had five children, only two of whom survived to adulthood. Throughout his whole life, Louis Pasteur remained an ardent <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic</a>. A well-known quote illustrating this is attributed to him: &quot;I have the faith of a Breton peasant and by the time I die I hope to have the faith of a Breton peasant&#39;s wife.&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> Brittany is a rural region in France renowned for the Catholic piety of its inhabitants.)<p><a id="Work_on_chirality_and_the_polarization_of_light" name="Work_on_chirality_and_the_polarization_of_light"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Work on chirality and the polarization of light</span></h2>
      <p>In Pasteur&#39;s early works as a <!--del_lnk--> chemist, he resolved a problem concerning the nature of <!--del_lnk--> tartaric acid (<!--del_lnk--> 1849). A solution of this compound derived from living things (specifically, <!--del_lnk--> wine lees) rotated the plane of <!--del_lnk--> polarization of light passing through it. The mystery was that tartaric acid derived by <!--del_lnk--> chemical synthesis had no such effect, even though its reactions were identical and its elemental composition was the same.<div class="thumb tright">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Upon examination of the minuscule <a href="../../wp/c/Crystal.htm" title="Crystal">crystals</a> of tartaric acid, Pasteur noticed that the crystals came in two asymmetric forms that were mirror images of one another. Tediously sorting the crystals by hand gave two forms of tartaric acid: solutions of one form rotated polarized light clockwise, while the other form rotated light counterclockwise. An equal mix of the two had no polarizing effect on light. Pasteur correctly deduced the tartaric acid molecule was asymmetric and could exist in two different forms that resemble one another as would left- and right-hand gloves, and that the organic form of the compound consisted purely of the one type. As the first demonstration of <!--del_lnk--> chiral molecules, it was quite an achievement, but Pasteur then went on to his more famous work in the field of biology/medicine.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Pasteur&#39;s doctoral thesis on <!--del_lnk--> crystallography garnered him a position of professor of chemistry at the <i>Facult&eacute;</i> (College) of <!--del_lnk--> Strasbourg.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1854, he was named Dean of the new College of Science in <a href="../../wp/l/Lille.htm" title="Lille">Lille</a>. In <!--del_lnk--> 1856, he was made administrator and director of scientific studies of the <!--del_lnk--> &Eacute;cole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure.<p><a id="Germ_theory" name="Germ_theory"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Germ theory</span></h2>
      <p>Louis Pasteur demonstrated that the <!--del_lnk--> fermentation process is caused by the growth of <!--del_lnk--> microorganisms, and that the growth of microorganisms in nutrient broths is not due to <!--del_lnk--> spontaneous generation.<div class="thumb tright">
       <div style="width:153px;"><a class="internal" href="../../images/83/8318.gif.htm" title="Modified version of florence flask (Swan flask) made by Pasteur in his experiment for disproving spontaneous generation theory."><img alt="Modified version of florence flask (Swan flask) made by Pasteur in his experiment for disproving spontaneous generation theory." height="143" longdesc="/wiki/Image:Ballon.gif" src="../../images/83/8318.gif" width="151" /></a><div class="thumbcaption">
         <div class="magnify" style="float:right"><a class="internal" href="../../images/83/8318.gif.htm" title="Enlarge"><img alt="Enlarge" height="11" src="../../images/0/1.png" width="15" /></a></div> Modified version of <!--del_lnk--> florence flask <i>(Swan flask)</i> made by Pasteur in his experiment for disproving spontaneous generation theory.</div>

      <p>He exposed boiled broths to air in vessels that contained a filter to prevent all particles from passing through to the growth medium, and even in vessels with no filter at all, with air being admitted via a long tortuous tube that would not allow dust particles to pass. Nothing grew in the broths; therefore, the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, as spores on dust, rather than spontaneously generated within the broth. Thus, Pasteur dealt the death blow to the <!--del_lnk--> theory of spontaneous generation and supported germ theory.<p>While Pasteur was not the first to propose <!--del_lnk--> germ theory (<!--del_lnk--> Girolamo Fracastoro, <!--del_lnk--> Agostino Bassi, <!--del_lnk--> Friedrich Henle and others had suggested it earlier), he developed it and conducted experiments that clearly indicated its correctness and managed to convince most of <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> it was true. Today he is often regarded as the father of germ theory and <!--del_lnk--> bacteriology, together with <!--del_lnk--> Robert Koch.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Pasteur&#39;s research also showed that some microorganisms contaminated fermenting beverages. With this established, he invented a process in which liquids such as milk were heated to kill most bacteria and molds already present within them. He and <!--del_lnk--> Claude Bernard completed the first test on <!--del_lnk--> April 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1862. This process was soon afterwards known as <!--del_lnk--> pasteurization.<p>Beverage contamination led Pasteur to conclude that microorganisms infected animals and humans as well. He proposed preventing the entry of microorganisms into the human body, leading <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Lister to develop <!--del_lnk--> antiseptic methods in <!--del_lnk--> surgery.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1865, two parasitic diseases called <!--del_lnk--> p&eacute;brine and <!--del_lnk--> flacherie were killing great numbers of <!--del_lnk--> silkworms at Al&egrave;s. Pasteur worked several years proving it was a microbe attacking silkworm eggs which caused the disease, and that eliminating this microbe within silkworm nurseries would eradicate the disease.<p>Pasteur also discovered <!--del_lnk--> anaerobiosis, whereby some microorganisms can develop and live without air or <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a>.<p><a id="Immunology_and_Vaccination" name="Immunology_and_Vaccination"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Immunology and Vaccination</span></h2>
      <p>Pasteur&#39;s later work on diseases included work on chicken <a href="../../wp/c/Cholera.htm" title="Cholera">cholera</a>. During this work, a culture of the responsible <a href="../../wp/b/Bacteria.htm" title="Bacterium">bacteria</a> had spoiled and failed to induce the disease in some <a href="../../wp/c/Chicken.htm" title="Chicken">chickens</a> he was infecting with the disease. Upon reusing these healthy chickens, Pasteur discovered that he could not infect them, even with fresh bacteria; the weakened bacteria had caused the chickens to become <!--del_lnk--> immune to the disease, even though they had only caused mild symptoms.<p>This discovery was serendipitous. His assistant <!--del_lnk--> Charles Chamberland (of french origin) had been instructed to inoculate the chickens after Pasteur went on holiday. Chamberland failed to do this, but instead went on holiday himself. On his return, the month old cultures made the chickens unwell, but instead of the infection being fatal, as usual, the chickens recovered completely. Chamberland assumed an error had been made, and wanted to discard the apparently faulty culture when Pasteur stopped him. Pasteur guessed the recovered animals now might be immune to the disease, as were the animals at <!--del_lnk--> Eure-et-Loir that had recovered from anthrax.<p>In the <!--del_lnk--> 1870s, he applied this immunization method to <!--del_lnk--> anthrax, which affected <a href="../../wp/c/Cattle.htm" title="Cows">cattle</a>, and aroused interest in combating other diseases.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Pasteur publicly claimed he had made the anthrax vaccine by exposing the bacillus to oxygen. His laboratory notebooks, now in the <!--del_lnk--> Bibliotheque Nationale in <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>, in fact show Pasteur used the method of rival <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Joseph-Henri Toussaint, a <!--del_lnk--> Toulouse <!--del_lnk--> veterinary surgeon, to create the anthrax vaccine. This method used the oxidizing agent <!--del_lnk--> potassium dichromate. Pasteur&#39;s oxygen method did eventually produce a vaccine but only after he had been awarded a <!--del_lnk--> patent on the production of an anthrax vaccine.<p>The notion of a weak form of a disease causing immunity to the virulent version was not new; this had been known for a long time for <a href="../../wp/s/Smallpox.htm" title="Smallpox">smallpox</a>. Inoculation with smallpox was known to result in far less scarring, and greatly reduced mortality, in comparison to the naturally acquired disease. <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_Jenner.htm" title="Edward Jenner">Edward Jenner</a> had also discovered <!--del_lnk--> vaccination, using <!--del_lnk--> cowpox to give cross-immunity to smallpox (in 1796), and by Pasteur&#39;s time this had generally replaced the use of actual smallpox material in inoculation. The difference between smallpox vaccination and <a href="../../wp/c/Cholera.htm" title="Cholera">cholera</a> and <!--del_lnk--> anthrax vaccination was that the weakened form of the latter two disease organisms had been <i>generated artificially</i>, and so a naturally weak form of the disease organism did not need to be found.<p>This discovery revolutionized work in infectious diseases, and Pasteur gave these artificially weakened diseases the generic name of <i><!--del_lnk--> vaccines</i>, to honour Jenner&#39;s discovery. Pasteur produced the first vaccine for <a href="../../wp/r/Rabies.htm" title="Rabies">rabies</a> by growing the virus in rabbits, and then weakening it by drying the affected nerve tissue.<p>The rabies vaccine was initially created by <!--del_lnk--> Emile Roux, a French doctor and a colleague of Pasteur who had been working with a killed vaccine produced by desiccating the spinal cords of infected rabbits. The vaccine had only been tested on eleven dogs before its first human trial.<p>This vaccine was first used on 9-year old <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Meister, on <!--del_lnk--> July 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1885, after the boy was badly mauled by a rabid dog. This was done at some personal risk for Pasteur, since he was not a licensed physician and could have faced prosecution for treating the boy. However, left without treatment, the boy faced almost certain death from rabies. After consulting with colleagues, Pasteur decided to go ahead with the treatment. Fortunately, the treatment proved to be a spectacular success, with Meister avoiding the disease; thus, Pasteur was hailed as a hero and the legal matter was not pursued. The treatment&#39;s success laid the foundations for the manufacture of many other vaccines. The first of the <!--del_lnk--> Pasteur Institutes was also built on the basis of this achievement.<div class="thumb tright">
