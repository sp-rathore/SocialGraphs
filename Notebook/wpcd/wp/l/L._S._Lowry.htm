      <p><b>Laurence Stephen Lowry</b> (<!--del_lnk--> November 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1887&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> February 23, <!--del_lnk--> 1976) was an <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a> <!--del_lnk--> artist born in Barratt Street, <!--del_lnk--> Old Trafford, <a href="../../wp/m/Manchester.htm" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>. Many of his drawings and paintings depict <a href="../../wp/s/Salford.htm" title="Salford">Salford</a> and surrounding areas, including <!--del_lnk--> Pendlebury where he lived and worked for well over thirty years.<p>Lowry is famous for painting scenes of life in the <!--del_lnk--> industrial districts of <!--del_lnk--> northern England during the early 20th century. He had a distinctive style of painting and is best known for urban landscapes peopled with many human figures (&#39;matchstick men&#39;). He tended to paint these in drab colours. He also painted mysterious unpopulated landscapes, brooding portraits, and the secret &#39;marionette&#39; works (the latter only found after his death).<p>Because of his use of stylised figures and the lack of weather effects in many of his landscapes he is sometimes characterised as a <!--del_lnk--> na&iuml;ve &#39;Sunday painter&#39; although this is not the position of the galleries that have organised retrospective of his works.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p><a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h3>
      <p>His family called him &#39;Laurie&#39;. It was a difficult birth and his mother, who had been hoping for a girl, was uncomfortable even looking at him at first. Later she expressed her envy of her sister Mary, who had &quot;three splendid daughters&quot; instead of one &quot;clumsy boy&quot;.<p>After Lowry&#39;s birth his mother&#39;s health was too poor for her to continue teaching. She is reported to have been gifted and respected. She was an irritable, nervous woman who had been brought up to expect high standards by her stern father. Like him she was controlling and intolerant of failure. She used illness as a means of securing the attention and obedience of her mild and affectionate husband and she dominated her son in the same way. Lowry had an unhappy childhood. At school he made few friends and showed no academic aptitude. His father was affectionate towards him but he could not gain the approval that he craved from his mother.<p><a id="Death_of_his_parents" name="Death_of_his_parents"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Death of his parents</span></h3>
      <p>His father died in 1932 leaving debts. His mother was subject to neurosis and depression, and became bedridden. Lowry&#39;s mother had always been a very important figure in his life and now he had to care for her. He painted from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. after his mother had fallen asleep. He frequently expressed regret that he received little recognition as an artist until the year that his mother died and that she had never been able to enjoy his success. From the mid 1930s until at least 1939 Lowry took annual holidays at <!--del_lnk--> Berwick-upon-Tweed. With the outbreak of war Lowry served as a volunteer fire watcher in Manchester and accepted an invitation to become a war artist. In 1953 he was appointed Official Artist at the <!--del_lnk--> coronation of <a href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom</a>.<p>With the death of his mother in October 1939, Lowry became depressed and neglected the upkeep of his house to such a degree that the landlord repossessed it in 1948. He was not short of money and bought &quot;The Elms&quot; in Mottram-in-Longdendale, <!--del_lnk--> Hyde, Manchester. Although he considered the house ugly and uncomfortable he stayed there until his death almost thirty years later.<p><a id="Retirement" name="Retirement"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Retirement</span></h3>
      <p>Lowry retired from the Pall Mall Property Company in 1952. During his career he had risen to become chief cashier but he never stopped collecting rents. The firm had supported his development as an artist and he was allowed time off for exhibitions in addition to his normal holiday allowance. It seems, however, that he was not proud of his job; his secrecy about his employment by the Pall Mall Property Company is widely seen as a desire to present himself as a serious artist but the secrecy extended beyond the art world into his social circle.<p><!--del_lnk--> Margery Thompson first met him when she was a schoolgirl and he became part of her family circle. He attended concerts with her family and friends, visited her home and entertained her at his Pendlebury home where he shared his knowledge of painting. They remained friends until his death but he never told her that he had any work except his art.<p>In the 1950s he regularly visited friends at <!--del_lnk--> Cleator Moor, <!--del_lnk--> Cumbria (where Geoffrey Bennett was Manager at <!--del_lnk--> National Westminster Bank) and <a href="../../wp/s/Southampton.htm" title="Southampton">Southampton</a> (where Margery Thompson had moved upon her marriage). Lowry painted pictures of the bank in Cleator Moor, Southampton Floating Bridge and other scenes local to his friends&#39; homes.<p>He befriended the 23-year-old Cumbrian artist <!--del_lnk--> Sheila Fell in November 1955 and supported her career by buying several pictures that he gave to museums. In 1957 an unrelated thirteen-year-old schoolgirl called Carol Ann Lowry wrote to Lowry at her mother&#39;s urging to ask his advice on becoming an artist. He visited her home in <!--del_lnk--> Heywood, Greater Manchester some months later, and befriended the family. His friendship with Carol Ann Lowry was to last the rest of his life.<p><a id="Awards" name="Awards"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Awards</span></h3>
      <p>He was awarded an honorary <!--del_lnk--> Master of Arts from the <!--del_lnk--> University of Manchester in 1945, and <!--del_lnk--> Doctor of Letters in 1961, and given <!--del_lnk--> freedom of the City of Salford in 1965. In 1975 he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters by the <!--del_lnk--> University of Salford and the same degree by the <!--del_lnk--> University of Liverpool. The art world celebrated his 77th birthday (in 1964) with an exhibition of his work and that of 25 contemporary artists who had submitted tributes to <!--del_lnk--> Monk&#39;s Hall Museum, <!--del_lnk--> Eccles. The <!--del_lnk--> Hall&eacute; Orchestra also performed a concert in his honour and prime minister <a href="../../wp/h/Harold_Wilson.htm" title="Harold Wilson">Harold Wilson</a> used Lowry&#39;s painting <i>The Pond</i> as his official Christmas card. Lowry&#39;s painting <i>Coming out of School</i> was the stamp of highest denomination in a series issued by the <!--del_lnk--> Post Office depicting great British artists in <!--del_lnk--> 1967.<p>Lowry declined an <!--del_lnk--> OBE in 1955, a CBE in 1961, <!--del_lnk--> knighthood in 1968, and <!--del_lnk--> CH in 1972 and 1976. He holds the record for the most honours declined.<p><a id="Death_.26_Legacy" name="Death_.26_Legacy"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Death &amp; Legacy</span></h3>
      <p>He died of pneumonia at The Woods Hospital in <!--del_lnk--> Glossop on <!--del_lnk--> 23 February <!--del_lnk--> 1976 aged 88. He was buried in Chorlton (Southern Cemetery), Manchester, next to his parents. He left his estate, valued at &pound;298,459, together with a considerable number of artworks by himself and others to Carol Ann Lowry, who, in 2001, obtained trademark protection of the artist&#39;s signature. <p><a id="Personal_life" name="Personal_life"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Personal life</span></h3>
      <p>Lowry never married although he had several young female friends. He claimed never to have &quot;had a girl [friend]&quot;. He said that he lived for his mother and that all he wanted was her smile or a word of praise from her. His father was indifferent to his artistic activity and although Lowry believed that his mother did not understand his painting, &quot;she understood me and that was enough&quot;.<p>In later life, starting in the 1950s, Lowry would often spend holidays at the <!--del_lnk--> Seaburn Hotel in <!--del_lnk--> Seaburn, <!--del_lnk--> Tyne &amp; Wear, painting scenes of the beach, as well as nearby ports and coal mines. It is believed that the sea air appealed to him, as well as the industrial scenes that were very different from the <i>satanic mills</i> of Greater Manchester. Lowry is fondly remembered in the city as a kindly old man, always wrapped up even at the height of summer, who kept himself to himself.<p>When he had no sketchbook with him, Lowry would often draw scenes in pencil or charcoal on the back of scrap paper such as envelopes, serviettes, and cloakroom tickets and present them to young people sitting with their families nearby. Such serendipitous pieces are now worth thousands of pounds; a serviette sketch can be seen at the Sunderland Mariott Hotel (formerly the Seaburn Hotel).<p>He may have had <!--del_lnk--> Asperger&#39;s Syndrome (the high-functioning form of autism) but this remains a contentious diagnosis that is not shared by those that knew him personally.<p>He was a secretive and mischievous man who enjoyed stories irrespective of their truth. His friends have observed that his anecdotes were more notable for their humour than their accuracy and in many cases he set out deliberately to deceive. His stories of the fictional Ann were inconsistent and he invented other people as frameworks upon which to hang his tales. The collection of clocks in his living room were all set at different times: to some people he said that this was because he did not want to know the real time; to others he claimed that it was to save him from being deafened by their simultaneous chimes.<p>The contradictions in his life are exacerbated by this confusion. He is widely seen as a shy man but he had many long-lasting friendships including the Salford artist <!--del_lnk--> Harold Riley and made new friends throughout his adult life. He was contrary and could be selfish but he was generous and concerned for the well-being of his friends and of strangers. It may be as Sheila Fell has said: &quot;He was a great humanist. To be a humanist, one has first to love human beings, and to be a great humanist, one has to be slightly detached from them.&quot;<p>In later life he grew tired of being approached by strangers on account of his celebrity and he particularly disliked being visited at home in this way. Another of his unverifiable stories had him keeping a suitcase by the front door so that he could claim to be just leaving, a practice he claimed to have abandoned after a helpful young man insisted on taking him to the station and had to be sent off to buy a paper so that Lowry could buy a ticket for just one stop without revealing his deceit.<p>Lowry was a supporter of Manchester City Football Club.<p><a id="Works" name="Works"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Works</span></h2>
      <p>During his life Lowry made about 1000 paintings and over 8000 drawings. The lists here are some of those that are considered to be particularly significant.<p><a id="Paintings" name="Paintings"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Paintings</span></h3>

      <p>Lowry&#39;s work is held in many public and private collections. The largest collection is held by the City of Salford and displayed at the Lowry Centre. Its L. S. Lowry Collection has about 350 of his paintings and drawings. X-ray analysis has revealed hidden figures under his drawings - the &#39;Ann&#39; figures. Lowry&#39;s &quot;Going to the Match&quot; is owned by the Professional Footballers Association (PFA) and is also on display at the Lowry Centre in Salford.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Tate Gallery in London owns 23 works. The City of <a href="../../wp/s/Southampton.htm" title="Southampton">Southampton</a> owns <i>The Floating Bridge</i>, <i>The Canal Bridge</i> and <i>An Industrial Town</i>. His work is also featured at <!--del_lnk--> MOMA, in <!--del_lnk--> New York.<p><a id="Memorials" name="Memorials"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Memorials</span></h2>
      <p>In 1978, two years after his death, Mancunian duo <!--del_lnk--> Brian and Michael hit number one in the UK pop chart with their only hit, the Lowry tribute <i>Matchstalk Men And Matchstalk Cats And Dogs</i>. Written by Ancoats born Michael Coleman and produced by Kevin Parrott, the record sold 750,000 copies.<p>To mark the centenary of his birth, Royston Futter, director of the L .S. Lowry Centenary Festival on behalf of the City of Salford and the <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a> commissioned the <!--del_lnk--> Northern Ballet Theatre and <!--del_lnk--> Gillian Lynne to create a dance drama in his honour. <!--del_lnk--> A Simple Man was choreographed and directed by Lynne, with music by <!--del_lnk--> Carl Davis and starring <!--del_lnk--> Christopher Gable and <!--del_lnk--> Moira Shearer ( in her last dance role) and it won a <!--del_lnk--> BAFTA award as the best arts programme in 1988. It was subsequently transferred to the stage and first performed in Manchester in 1987 and in London at Sadlers Wells in 1988.<p>In 2000, a &pound;100-million arts and entertainment centre called <!--del_lnk--> &quot;The Lowry&quot; was opened in Salford Quays, Greater Manchester. The Lowry is named after the artist and features his work.<p>In January 2005, a statue of Lowry was unveiled in Mottram, <!--del_lnk--> Tameside.<!--del_lnk--> 1 Lowry lived 100 yards away from where the statue stands in a linked detached property, &quot;The Elms&quot;, in Stalybridge Road from 1948 up until his death in 1976. Unfortunately this has become a target for local vandals with the statue being vandalised several times since being unveiled. <!--del_lnk--> 2<p>In <!--del_lnk--> Hope High School, a <!--del_lnk--> house (a large group of pupils) is named after him.<p>The Manchester rock band Oasis paid tribute to Lowry by releasing a music video for the single &quot;The Masterplan&quot; in October 2006 which uses Lowry style animation.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._S._Lowry&quot;</div>
