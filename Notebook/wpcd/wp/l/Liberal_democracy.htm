      <p><b>Liberal democracy</b> is a <!--del_lnk--> form of government. It is a <!--del_lnk--> representative democracy in which the ability of the elected representatives to exercise <!--del_lnk--> decision-making <!--del_lnk--> power is subject to the <!--del_lnk--> rule of law, and usually moderated by a <!--del_lnk--> constitution that emphasizes the protection of the <!--del_lnk--> rights and <!--del_lnk--> freedoms of individuals, and which places constraints on the leaders and on the extent to which the <!--del_lnk--> will of the majority can be exercised against the rights of <!--del_lnk--> minorities.<p>The rights and freedoms protected by the constitutions of liberal democracies are varied, but they usually include most of the following: rights to <!--del_lnk--> due process, <!--del_lnk--> privacy, <a href="../../wp/p/Property.htm" title="Property">property</a> and equality before the law, and freedoms of <!--del_lnk--> speech, <!--del_lnk--> assembly and <!--del_lnk--> religion. In liberal democracies these rights (also known as &quot;liberal rights&quot;) may sometimes be constitutionally guaranteed, or are otherwise created by <!--del_lnk--> statutory law or <!--del_lnk--> case law, which may in turn empower various civil institutions to administer or enforce these rights.<p>Liberal democracies also tend to be characterized by <!--del_lnk--> tolerance and <!--del_lnk--> pluralism; widely differing social and political views, even those viewed as extreme or fringe, are permitted to co-exist and compete for political power on a democratic basis. Liberal democracies periodically hold <a href="../../wp/e/Election.htm" title="Election">elections</a> where groups with differing political views have the opportunity to achieve political power. In practice, these elections are nearly always won by groups who support liberal democracy; thus the system perpetuates itself.<p>The term &quot;liberal&quot; in &quot;liberal democracy&quot; does not imply that the government of such a democracy must follow the political ideology of <a href="../../wp/l/Liberalism.htm" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a>. It is merely a reference to the fact that the initial framework for modern liberal democracy was created during the <a href="../../wp/a/Age_of_Enlightenment.htm" title="Age of Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a> by philosophers advocating <!--del_lnk--> liberty. They emphasized the right of the individual to have immunity from the arbitrary exercise of authority. At present, there are numerous different political ideologies that support liberal democracy. Examples include <!--del_lnk--> conservatism, <!--del_lnk--> Christian Democracy, <!--del_lnk--> social democracy and some forms of <a href="../../wp/s/Socialism.htm" title="Socialism">socialism</a>.<p>A liberal democracy may take the form of a <!--del_lnk--> constitutional republic or a <a href="../../wp/c/Constitutional_monarchy.htm" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a>.<p>

      <p>Liberal democracies today usually have <!--del_lnk--> universal suffrage, granting all adult citizens the right to vote regardless of race, gender or property ownership. However, especially historically, some countries regarded as liberal democracies have had a more <!--del_lnk--> limited franchise. There may also be qualifications like a registration procedure to be allowed to vote. The decisions taken through elections are taken not by all of the citizens, but rather by those who choose to participate by voting.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> elections should be free and fair. The political process should be competitive. Political <!--del_lnk--> pluralism is usually defined as the presence of multiple and distinct <!--del_lnk--> political parties.<p>The liberal democratic <!--del_lnk--> constitution defines the democratic character of the state. The purpose of a constitution is often seen as a limit on the authority of the government. The American political tradition emphasise the <!--del_lnk--> separation of powers, an independent judiciary, and a system of <!--del_lnk--> checks and balances between branches of government. Many European democracies are more likely to emphasise the importance of the state being a <!--del_lnk--> Rechtsstaat that follows the principle of <!--del_lnk--> rule of law. Governmental authority is legitimately exercised only in accordance with written, publicly disclosed <!--del_lnk--> laws adopted and enforced in accordance with established procedure. Many democracies use <!--del_lnk--> federalism - (also known as vertical separation of powers) - in order to prevent abuse and increase public input by dividing governing powers between municipal, provincial and national governments.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p><a id="Rights_and_freedoms" name="Rights_and_freedoms"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Rights and freedoms</span></h3>
      <p>The most often quoted criteria for liberal democracy take the form of specific rights and freedoms. They were originally considered essential for the functioning of a liberal democracy, but they have acquired such prominence in its definition, that many people now think they are democracy. Since no state wants to admit it is &quot;unfree&quot;, and since its enemies may be depicted as &quot;tyrannies&quot; by its propagandists, they are also usually contested.<ul>
       <li>Right to life and security of person.<li>Freedom from <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slavery</a>.<li>Freedom of movement.<li>Equality before the law and <!--del_lnk--> due process under the <!--del_lnk--> rule of law.<li><!--del_lnk--> Freedom of speech.<li><!--del_lnk--> Freedom of information.<li><!--del_lnk--> Freedom of the press and access to alternative information sources.<li><!--del_lnk--> Freedom of association and <!--del_lnk--> assembly .<li><!--del_lnk--> Freedom of education.<li><!--del_lnk--> Freedom of religion.<li>An <!--del_lnk--> independent judiciary<li>The right to own <a href="../../wp/p/Property.htm" title="Property">property</a>, and to buy and sell the same, is often seen as a liberal freedom bound up with the above, though this is a very hotly contested proposition.</ul>
      <p>In practice, democracies do have specific limits on specific freedoms. There are various legal limitations like <!--del_lnk--> copyright and laws against <!--del_lnk--> defamation. There may be limits on anti-democratic speech, on attempts to undermine <a href="../../wp/h/Human_rights.htm" title="Human rights">human rights</a>, and on the promotion or justification of <a href="../../wp/t/Terrorism.htm" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a>. In the United States more than in Europe, during the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>, such restrictions applied to <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">Communists</a>. Now they are more commonly applied to organizations perceived as promoting terrorism or the incitement of group hatred. Examples include <!--del_lnk--> anti-terrorism legislation, the shutting down of <!--del_lnk--> Hezbollah satellite broadcasts, and laws against <!--del_lnk--> hate speech. Critics claim that these limitations may go too far and that there may be no due and fair judicial process.<p>The common justification for these limits is that they are necessary to guarantee the existence of democracy, or the existence of the freedoms themselves. For example, allowing free speech for those advocating mass murder undermines the right to life and security. Opinion is divided on how far democracy can extend, to include the enemies of democracy in the democratic process. If relatively small numbers of people are excluded from such freedoms for these reasons, a country may still be seen as a liberal democracy. Some argue that this is not qualitatively different from autocracies that persecutes opponents, but only quantitatively different, since only a small number of people are affected and the restrictions are less severe. Others emphasize that democracies are different. At least in theory, also opponents of democracy are allowed due process under the rule of law. In principle, democracies allow critic and change of the leaders and the political and economic system itself; it is only attempts to do so violently and promotion of such violence that is prohibited.<p><a id="Preconditions" name="Preconditions"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Preconditions</span></h3>
      <p>Although they are not part of the system of government as such, the presence of a <!--del_lnk--> middle class, and a broad and flourishing <a href="../../wp/c/Civil_society.htm" title="Civil society">civil society</a> are often seen as pre-conditions for liberal democracy.<p>For countries without a strong tradition of democratic majority rule, the introduction of free elections alone has rarely been sufficient to achieve a transition from dictatorship to democracy; a wider shift in the political culture and gradual formation of the institutions of democratic government are needed. There are various examples, like in <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>, of countries that were able to sustain democracy only temporarily or in limited form until wider cultural changes occurred to allow true majority rule.<p>One of the key aspects of democratic culture is the concept of a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> loyal opposition&quot;. This is an especially difficult cultural shift to achieve in nations where transitions of power have historically taken place through violence. The term means, in essence, that all sides in a democracy share a common commitment to its basic values. Political competitors may disagree, but they must tolerate one another and acknowledge the legitimate and important roles that each play. The ground rules of the society must encourage tolerance and civility in public debate. In such a society, the losers accept the judgment of the voters when the election is over, and allow for the peaceful transfer of power. The losers are safe in the knowledge that they will neither lose their lives nor their liberty, and will continue to participate in public life. They are loyal not to the specific policies of the government, but to the fundamental legitimacy of the state and to the democratic process itself.<p><a id="The_origins_of_liberal_democracy" name="The_origins_of_liberal_democracy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The origins of liberal democracy</span></h2>

      <p>Liberal democracy traces its origins - and its name - to the <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European</a> <a href="../../wp/1/18th_century.htm" title="18th century">18th century</a>, also known as the <a href="../../wp/a/Age_of_Enlightenment.htm" title="Age of Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a>. At the time, the vast majority of European states were <a href="../../wp/m/Monarchy.htm" title="Monarchy">monarchies</a>, with political power held either by the <!--del_lnk--> monarch or the <!--del_lnk--> aristocracy. The possibility of democracy had not been seriously considered by political theory since <!--del_lnk--> classical antiquity, and the widely held belief was that democracies would be inherently unstable and chaotic in their policies due to the changing whims of the people. It was further believed that democracy was contrary to <!--del_lnk--> human nature, as human beings were seen to be inherently evil, violent and in need of a strong leader to restrain their destructive impulses. Many European monarchs held that their power had been <!--del_lnk--> ordained by God, and that questioning their right to rule was tantamount to <!--del_lnk--> blasphemy.<p>These conventional views were challenged at first by a relatively small group of Enlightenment <!--del_lnk--> intellectuals, who believed that human affairs should be guided by <!--del_lnk--> reason and principles of liberty and equality. They argued that <!--del_lnk--> all people are created equal, and therefore political authority cannot be justified on the basis of &quot;noble blood&quot;, a supposed privileged connection to God, or any other characteristic that is alleged to make one person superior to others. They further argued that governments exist to serve the people, not vice versa, and that laws should apply to those who govern as well as to the governed (a concept known as <!--del_lnk--> rule of law).<p>Near the end of the 18th century, these ideas inspired the <!--del_lnk--> American Revolution and the <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>, which gave birth to the ideology of <a href="../../wp/l/Liberalism.htm" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a> and instituted forms of government that attempted to apply the principles of the Enlightenment philosophers into practice. Neither of these forms of government was precisely what we would call a liberal democracy we know today (the most significant difference being that voting rights were still restricted to a minority of the population), and the French attempt turned out to be short-lived, but they were the prototypes from which liberal democracy later grew. Since the supporters of these forms of government were known as liberals, the governments themselves came to be known as liberal democracies.<p>When the first prototypical liberal democracies were founded, the liberals themselves were viewed as an extreme and rather dangerous fringe group that threatened international peace and stability. The conservative <!--del_lnk--> monarchists who opposed liberalism and democracy saw themselves as defenders of traditional values and the natural order of things, and their criticism of democracy seemed vindicated when <!--del_lnk--> Napoleon Bonaparte took control of the young <!--del_lnk--> French Republic, reorganized it into the <!--del_lnk--> first French Empire and proceeded to conquer most of Europe. Napoleon was eventually defeated and the <!--del_lnk--> Holy Alliance was formed in Europe to prevent any further spread of liberalism or democracy. However, liberal democratic ideals soon became widespread among the general population, and, over the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a>, traditional monarchy was forced on a continuous defensive and withdrawal. Reforms and revolutions helped move most European countries towards liberal democracy. Liberalism ceased being a fringe opinion and joined the political mainstream. At the same time, a number of non-liberal ideologies developed that took the concept of liberal democracy and made it their own. The political spectrum changed; traditional monarchy became more and more a fringe view and liberal democracy became more and more mainstream. By the end of the 19th century, liberal democracy was no longer only a &quot;liberal&quot; idea, but an idea supported by many different ideologies. After <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> and especially after <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, liberal democracy achieved a dominant position among theories of government and is now endorsed by the vast majority of the political spectrum.<p><a id="Liberal_democracies_around_the_world" name="Liberal_democracies_around_the_world"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Liberal democracies around the world</span></h2>

      <p>Several organisations and political scientists maintain lists of free and unfree states, both in the present and going back a couple centuries. Of these, the best known may be the Polity Data Set and that produced by <!--del_lnk--> Freedom House.<p>There is general agreement that the states of the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a>, <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>, and <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> are liberal democracies.<p>Freedom House considers many of the officially democratic governments in Africa and the former Soviet Union to be undemocratic in practice, usually because the sitting government has a strong influence over election outcomes. Many of these countries are in a state of considerable flux.<p>Officially non-democratic forms of government, such as single-party states and dictatorships are more common in East Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa.<p><a id="Types_of_liberal_democracies" name="Types_of_liberal_democracies"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Types of liberal democracies</span></h2>
      <p><a id="De_facto_liberal_democracies" name="De_facto_liberal_democracies"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">De facto liberal democracies</span></h3>
      <p>Liberal democracy is sometimes the <!--del_lnk--> de facto form of government, while other forms are technically the case; for example, the <!--del_lnk--> Canadian monarchy is in fact ruled by a democratically elected <a href="../../wp/p/Parliament_of_Canada.htm" title="Parliament of Canada">Parliament</a>. In the United Kingdom, the sovereign is the hereditary monarch, but the de facto (legislative) sovereign is the people, via their elected representatives in Parliament, hence a democracy.<p>Many disagree with any form of hereditary privilege, including monarchy. Monarchists reply that the monarchy in these nations is almost entirely ceremonial rather than political.<p><a id="Proportional_and_plurality_representation" name="Proportional_and_plurality_representation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Proportional and plurality representation</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Plurality voting system award seats according to regional majorities. The political party or individual candidate who receives the most votes, wins the seat which represents that locality. There are other democratic electoral systems, such as the various forms of <!--del_lnk--> proportional representation, which award seats according to the proportion of individual votes that a party receives nation-wide or in a particular region.<p>One of the main points of contention between these two systems, is whether to have representatives who are able to effectively represent specific regions in a country, or to have all citizens&#39; vote count the same, regardless of where in the country they happen to live.<p>Some countries such as <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, address the conflict between these two forms of representation, by having two categories of seats in the lower house of their federal legislative bodies. The first category of seats is appointed according to regional popularity, and the remainder are awarded to give the parties a proportion of seats that is equal - or as equal as practicable - to their proportion of nation-wide votes. This system is commonly called <!--del_lnk--> mixed member proportional representation.<p><a id="Presidential_and_parliamentary_systems" name="Presidential_and_parliamentary_systems"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Presidential and parliamentary systems</span></h3>
      <p>A <!--del_lnk--> presidential system is a <!--del_lnk--> system of government of a <!--del_lnk--> republic where the <!--del_lnk--> executive branch is elected separately from the <!--del_lnk--> legislative. A <a href="../../wp/p/Parliamentary_system.htm" title="Parliamentary system">parliamentary system</a> is distinguished by the <!--del_lnk--> executive branch of government being dependent on the direct or indirect support of the <!--del_lnk--> parliament, often expressed through a <!--del_lnk--> vote of confidence.<p>The presidential system of democratic government has become popular in Latin America, Africa, and parts of the former Soviet Union, largely by the example of the United States. Constitutional monarchies (dominated by elected parliaments) are popular in Northern Europe and some former colonies which peacefully separated, such as Australia and Canada. Others have also arisen in Spain, East Asia, and a variety of small nations around the world. Former British territories such as South Africa, India, Ireland, and the United States opted for different forms at the time of independence. The parliamentary system is popular in the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> and neighboring countries.<p><a id="Advantages_and_disadvantages_of_liberal_democracy" name="Advantages_and_disadvantages_of_liberal_democracy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Advantages and disadvantages of liberal democracy</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Direct_democracy" name="Direct_democracy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Direct democracy</span></h3>
      <p>Some argue that &quot;liberal democracy&quot; does not respect absolute <!--del_lnk--> majority rule (except when electing representatives). The &quot;liberty&quot; of majority rule is restricted by the <!--del_lnk--> constitution or <!--del_lnk--> precedent decided by previous generations. Also, the real power is actually held by a relatively small representative body. Thus, the argument goes, &quot;liberal democracy&quot; is merely a decoration over an <a href="../../wp/o/Oligarchy.htm" title="Oligarchy">oligarchy</a>. A system of <!--del_lnk--> direct democracy would be preferable. New technology, such as <!--del_lnk--> E-democracy, may make direct democracy easier to implement.<p>Others would say that only a liberal democracy can guarantee the individual liberties of its citizens and prevent the development into a dictatorship. Unmoderated majority rule could, in this view, lead to an oppression of minorities. Another argument is that the elected leaders may be more interested and able than the average voter. A third that it takes much effort and time if everyone should gather information, discuss, and vote on most issues.<p>Some liberal democracies have elements of direct democracy such as <!--del_lnk--> referenda and <!--del_lnk--> plebiscite. <a href="../../wp/s/Switzerland.htm" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> and <a href="../../wp/u/Uruguay.htm" title="Uruguay">Uruguay</a> are some examples; likewise several states of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. Many other countries have referenda to a lesser degree in their political system.<p><a id="Ethnic_and_religious_conflicts" name="Ethnic_and_religious_conflicts"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Ethnic and religious conflicts</span></h3>
      <p>For historical reasons, many states are not culturally and ethnically homogeneous. There may be sharp ethnic, linguistic, religious and cultural divisions. In fact, some groups may be actively hostile to each other. A democracy, which by definition allows mass participation in decision-making theoretically also allows the use of the political process against &#39;enemy&#39; groups. That may be especially visible during <!--del_lnk--> democratisation, if the previous non-democratic government oppressed certain groups. It is also visible in established democracies, in the form of anti-immigrant <!--del_lnk--> populism. However, arguably the worst repressions have occurred in states without universal suffrage, like <!--del_lnk--> apartheid South Africa and Nazi Germany.<p>The collapse of the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> and the partial <!--del_lnk--> democratisation of Soviet bloc states was followed by wars and <!--del_lnk--> civil war in the former <a href="../../wp/y/Yugoslavia.htm" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>, in the <!--del_lnk--> Caucasus, and in <a href="../../wp/m/Moldova.htm" title="Moldova">Moldova</a>. Nevertheless, statistical research shows that the fall of <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">Communism</a> and the increase in the number of democratic states were accompanied by a sudden and dramatic decline in total warfare, interstate wars, <!--del_lnk--> ethnic wars, <!--del_lnk--> revolutionary wars, and the number of <!--del_lnk--> refugees and displaced people. See also the section below on Majoritarianism and Democratic peace theory.<p><a id="Bureaucracy" name="Bureaucracy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Bureaucracy</span></h3>
      <p>A persistent <a href="../../wp/l/Libertarianism.htm" title="Libertarianism">libertarian</a> and <!--del_lnk--> monarchist critique of democracy is the claim that it encourages the elected representatives to change the law without necessity, and in particular to pour forth a flood of new laws. This is seen as pernicious in several ways. New laws constrict the scope of what were previously private liberties. Rapidly changing laws make it difficult for a willing non-specialist to remain law-abiding. This may be an invitation for law-enforcement agencies to misuse power. The claimed continual complication of the law may be contrary to a claimed simple and eternal <!--del_lnk--> natural law - although there is no consensus on what this natural law is, even among advocates. Supporters of democracy point to the complex bureaucracy and regulations that has occurred in dictatorships, like many of the former Communist states.<p>Liberal democracies are also criticised for a claimed slowness and complexity of their decision-making.<p><a id="Short-term_focus" name="Short-term_focus"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Short-term focus</span></h3>
      <p>Modern liberal democracies, by definition, allow for regular changes of government. That has led to a common criticism of their short-term focus. In four or five years the government will face a new election, and it must think of how it will win that election. That would encourage a preference for policies that will bring short term benefits to the electorate (or to self-interested politicians) before the next election, rather than unpopular policy with longer term benefits. This criticism assumes that it is possible to make long term predictions for a society, something <a href="../../wp/k/Karl_Popper.htm" title="Karl Popper">Karl Popper</a> has criticized as <!--del_lnk--> historicism.<p>Besides the regular review of governing entities, short-term focus in a democracy could also be the result of collective short-term thinking. For example, consider a campaign for policies aimed at reducing environmental damage while causing temporary increase in unemployment. However, this risk applies also to other political systems.<p><a id="Public_choice_theory" name="Public_choice_theory"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Public choice theory</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Public choice theory is a branch of <a href="../../wp/e/Economics.htm" title="Economics">economics</a> that studies the decision-making behaviour of voters, politicians and government officials from the perspective of economic theory. One studied problem is that each voter has little influence and may therefore have a <!--del_lnk--> rational ignorance regarding political issues. This may allow <!--del_lnk--> special interest groups to gain <!--del_lnk--> subsidies and regulations beneficial to them but harmful to society. However, special interest groups may be equally or more influential in nondemocracies.<p><a id="Plutocracy" name="Plutocracy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Plutocracy</span></h3>
      <p><a href="../../wp/m/Marxism.htm" title="Marxism">Marxists</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Socialism.htm" title="Socialism">socialists</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Anarchism.htm" title="Anarchism">anarchists</a>, argue that liberal democracy is an integral part of the <a href="../../wp/c/Capitalism.htm" title="Capitalism">capitalist system</a> and is <!--del_lnk--> class-based and not fully democratic or <!--del_lnk--> participatory. It is <!--del_lnk--> bourgeois democracy where only the most financially powerful people rule. Because of this it is seen as fundamentally un-egalitarian, existing or operating in a way that facilitates economic exploitation.<p>The cost of political campaigning in representative democracies may mean that the system favours the rich, a form of <!--del_lnk--> plutocracy who may be a very small minority of the voters. In Athenian democracy, some public offices were <!--del_lnk--> randomly allocated to citizens, in order to inhibit the effects of plutocracy. Modern democracy may also be regarded as a dishonest farce used to keep the masses from getting restless, or a <!--del_lnk--> conspiracy for making them restless for some political agenda. It may encourage candidates to make deals with wealthy supporters, offering favorable legislation if the candidate is elected - perpetuating <!--del_lnk--> conspiracies for <!--del_lnk--> monopolization of key areas. <!--del_lnk--> Campaign finance reform is an attempt to correct this perceived problem. However, United States economist <!--del_lnk--> Steven Levitt claims in his book <!--del_lnk--> Freakonomics, that campaign spending is no guarantee of electoral success. He compared electoral success of the same pair of candidates running against one another repeatedly for the same job, as often happens in United States Congressional elections, where spending levels varied. He concludes:<dl>
       <dd>&quot;A winning candidate can cut his spending in half and lose only 1 percent of the vote. Meanwhile, a losing candidate who doubles his spending can expect to shift the vote in his favour by only that same 1 percent.&quot;</dl>
      <p>Ownership of the media by the few may lead to more specific distortion of the electoral process, since the media are themselves a vital element of that process. Some critics argue that criticism of the <!--del_lnk--> status quo or a particular agenda tends to be suppressed by such media cartels, to protect their own self-interests. Proponents respond that constitutionally protected <!--del_lnk--> freedom of speech makes it possible for both for-profit and non-profit organizations to debate the issues. They argue that media coverage in democracies simply reflects public preferences, and does not entail censorship.<p><a id="Majoritarianism" name="Majoritarianism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Majoritarianism</span></h3>

      <p>The &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot; is the fear that a democratic government, reflecting the majority view, can take action that oppresses a particular minority. Theoretically, the majority could only be a majority of those who vote and not a majority of the citizens. In those cases, one minority tyrannizes another minority in the name of the majority. It can apply in both <!--del_lnk--> direct democracy or <!--del_lnk--> representative democracy.<p>Possible examples include:<ul>
       <li>those potentially subject to <!--del_lnk--> conscription are a minority.<li>several European countries have introduced bans on personal religious symbols in public schools. Opponents see this as a violation of rights to freedom of religion. Supporters see it as following from the separation of state and religious activities.<li>prohibition of <!--del_lnk--> pornography is typically determined by what the majority is prepared to accept.<li><!--del_lnk--> recreational drug use is also typically legalised (or at least tolerated) to the degree that the majority finds acceptable. Users may see themselves as an oppressed minority, victims of unjustifiable <!--del_lnk--> criminalisation.<li>society&#39;s treatment of <!--del_lnk--> homosexuals is also cited in this context. Homosexual acts were widely criminalised in democracies until several decades ago; in some democracies they still are, reflecting the religious or sexual mores of the majority.<li>the Athenian democracy and the early United States had <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slavery</a>.<li>the majority often taxes the minority who are wealthy at <!--del_lnk--> progressively higher rates, with the intention that the wealthy will incur a larger tax burden for social purposes. However, this is generally offset to some degree, by their better access to relevant expert advice (tax consultants and lawyers).<li>in prosperous western democracies, the poor form a minority of the population, and may be disadvantaged by a majority who resent transfer taxation. Especially when they form a distinct <!--del_lnk--> underclass, the majority may use the democratic process to, in effect, withdraw the protection of the <!--del_lnk--> state.<li>An often quoted example of the &#39;tyranny of the majority&#39; is that <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> came to power by legitimate democratic procedures. The <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">Nazi</a> party gained the largest share of votes in the democratic <!--del_lnk--> Weimar republic in <!--del_lnk--> 1933. Some might consider this an example of &quot;tyranny of a minority&quot; since he never gained a majority vote, but it is common for a <!--del_lnk--> plurality to exercise power in democracies, so the rise of Hitler can not be considered irrelevant. However, his regime&#39;s large-scale human rights violations took place after the democratic system had been abolished. Also, the Weimar constitution in an &quot;emergency&quot; allowed dictatorial powers and suspension of the essentials of the constitution itself without any vote or election, something not possible in most liberal democracies.</ul>
      <p>Proponents of democracy make a number of defences concerning &#39;tyranny of the majority&#39;. One is to argue that the presence of a <!--del_lnk--> constitution protecting the rights of all citizens in many democratic countries acts as a safeguard. Generally, changes in these constitutions require the agreement of a <!--del_lnk--> supermajority of the elected representatives, or require a judge and jury to agree that evidentiary and procedural standards have been fulfilled by the state, or two different votes by the representatives separated by an election, or, sometimes, a <!--del_lnk--> referendum. These requirements are often combined. The <!--del_lnk--> separation of powers into <!--del_lnk--> legislative branch, <!--del_lnk--> executive branch, <!--del_lnk--> judicial branch also makes it more difficult for a small majority to impose their will. This means a majority can still legitimately coerce a minority (which is still ethically questionable), but such a minority would be very small and, as a practical matter, it is harder to get a larger proportion of the people to agree to such actions.<p>Another argument is that majorities and minorities can take a markedly different shape on different issues. People often agree with the majority view on some issues and agree with a minority view on other issues. One&#39;s view may also change. Thus, the members of a majority may limit oppression of a minority since they may well in the future themselves be in a minority.<p>A third common argument is that, despite the risks, majority rule is preferable to other systems, and the tyranny of the majority is in any case an improvement on a tyranny of a minority. All the possible problems mentioned above can also occur in nondemocracies with the added problem that a minority can oppress the majority. Proponents of democracy argue that empirical statistical evidence strongly shows that more democracy leads to less internal violence and mass murder by the government.. This is sometimes formulated as <!--del_lnk--> Rummel&#39;s Law, which states that the less democratic freedom a people have, the more likely their rulers are to murder them.<p><a id="Political_stability" name="Political_stability"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Political stability</span></h3>
      <p>One argument for democracy is that by creating a system where the public can remove administrations, without changing the legal basis for government, democracy aims at reducing political uncertainty and instability, and assuring citizens that however much they may disagree with present policies, they will be given a regular chance to change those who are in power, or change policies with which they disagree. This is preferable to a system where political change takes place through violence.<p>Some think that political stability may be considered as excessive when the group in power remains the same for an extended period of time. On the other hand, this is more common in nondemocracies.<p>One notable feature of liberal democracies is that their opponents (those groups who wish to abolish liberal democracy) rarely win elections. Advocates use this as an argument to support their view that liberal democracy is inherently stable and can usually only be overthrown by external force, while opponents argue that the system is inherently stacked against them despite its claims to impartiality. In the past, it was feared that democracy could be easily exploited by leaders with dictatorial aspirations, who could get themselves elected into power. However, the actual number of liberal democracies that have elected dictators into power is low. When it has occurred, it is usually after a major crisis have caused many people to doubt the system or in young/poorly functioning democracies. Some possible examples include <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> during the <!--del_lnk--> Great Depression and <!--del_lnk--> Napoleon III who become first President of the young <!--del_lnk--> Second French Republic and later Emperor.<p><a id="Effective_response_in_wartime" name="Effective_response_in_wartime"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Effective response in wartime</span></h3>
      <p>A liberal democracy, by definition, implies that power is not concentrated. One criticism is that this could be a disadvantage for a state in <a href="../../wp/w/War.htm" title="War">wartime</a>, when a fast and unified response is necessary. The legislature usually must give consent before the start of an offensive military operation, although sometimes the executive can do this on its own while keeping the legislature informed. If the democracy is attacked, then no consent is usually required for defensive operations. The people may vote against a <!--del_lnk--> conscription army. Monarchies and dictatorships can in theory act immediately and forcefully.<p>However, actual research shows that democracies are more likely to win wars than non-democracies. One explanation attributes this primarily to &quot;the transparency of the <!--del_lnk--> polities, and the stability of their preferences, once determined, democracies are better able to cooperate with their partners in the conduct of wars&quot;. Other research attributes this to superior mobilisation of resources or selection of wars that the democratic states have a high chance of winning.<p>Stam and Reiter (2002, p. 64-70) also note that the emphasis on individuality within democratic societies means that their soldiers fight with greater initiative and superior leadership. Officers in dictatorships are often selected for political loyalty rather than ability. They may be exclusively selected from a small class or religious/ethnic group that support the regime. Also this may also exclude many able officers. The leaders in nondemocracies may respond violently to any perceived criticisms or disobedience. This may make the soldiers and officers afraid to raise any objections or do anything without explicit authorisation. The lack of initiative may be particularly detrimental in modern warfare. Enemy soldiers may more easily surrender to democracies since they can expect comparatively good treatment. Nazi Germany killed almost 2/3 of the captured Soviet soldiers. 38% of the American soldiers captured by North Korea in the <!--del_lnk--> Korean War were killed.<p><a id="Better_information_on_and_corrections_of_problems" name="Better_information_on_and_corrections_of_problems"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Better information on and corrections of problems</span></h3>
      <p>A democratic system may provide better information for policy decisions. Undesirable information may more easily be ignored in dictatorships, even if this undesirable or contrarian information provides early warning of problems. The democratic system also provides a way to replace inefficient leaders and policies. Thus, problems may continue longer and crises of all kinds may be more common in autocracies.<p><a id="Corruption" name="Corruption"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Corruption</span></h3>
      <p>Research by the <!--del_lnk--> World Bank suggests that political institutions are extremely important in determining the prevalence of <!--del_lnk--> corruption: democracy, parliamentary systems, political stability, and freedom of the press are all associated with lower corruption. <!--del_lnk--> Freedom of information legislation is important for <!--del_lnk--> accountability and <!--del_lnk--> transparency. The Indian <!--del_lnk--> Right to Information Act &quot;has already engendered mass movements in the country that is bringing the lethargic, often corrupt bureaucracy to its knees and changing power equations completely.&quot;<p><a id="Terrorism" name="Terrorism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Terrorism</span></h3>
      <p>Several studies have concluded that terrorism is most common in nations with intermediate political freedom. The nations with the least terrorism are the most democratic nations<!--del_lnk--> .

      <p>Statistically, more democracy correlates with a higher gross domestic product (<!--del_lnk--> GDP) per capita.<p>However, there is disagreement regarding how much credit the democratic system can take for this. One observation is that democracy became widespread only after the <!--del_lnk--> industrial revolution and the introduction of <a href="../../wp/c/Capitalism.htm" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a>. On the other hand, the industrial revolution started in England which was one of the most democratic nations for its time.<p>Several statistical studies support the theory that more capitalism, measured for example with one the several <!--del_lnk--> Indices of Economic Freedom which has been used in hundreds of studies by independent researchers, increases <!--del_lnk--> economic growth and that this in turn increases general prosperity, reduces poverty, and causes <!--del_lnk--> democratization. This is a statistical tendency, and there are individual exceptions like <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, which is democratic but arguably not prosperous, or <a href="../../wp/b/Brunei.htm" title="Brunei">Brunei</a>, which has a high GDP but has never been democratic. There are also other studies suggesting that more democracy increases economic freedom although a few find no or even a small negative effect. One objection might be that nations like <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a> today score just below nations like <a href="../../wp/c/Chile.htm" title="Chile">Chile</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Estonia.htm" title="Estonia">Estonia</a> on economic freedom but that Sweden and Canada today have a higher GDP per capita. However, this is a misunderstanding, the studies indicate effect on economic growth and thus that future GDP per capita will be higher with higher economic freedom. It should also be noted that according to the index Sweden and Canada are among the world&#39;s most capitalist nations, due to factors such as strong <!--del_lnk--> rule of law, strong <!--del_lnk--> property rights, and few restrictions against <!--del_lnk--> free trade. Critics might argue that the Index of Economic Freedom and other methods used does not measure the degree of capitalism, preferring some other definition.<p>Some argue that economic growth due to its empowerment of citizens, will ensure a transition to democracy in countries such as China. However, other dispute this. Even if economic growth has caused democratization in the past, it may not do so in the future. Dictators may now have learned how to have economic growth without this causing more political freedom.<p>A high degree of oil or mineral exports is strongly associated with nondemocratic rule. This effect applies worldwide and not only to the Middle East. Dictators who have this form of wealth can spend more on their security apparatus and provide benefits which lessen public unrest. Also, such wealth is not followed by the social and cultural changes that may transform societies with ordinary economic growth.<p>A recent meta-analysis finds that democracy has no direct effect on economic growth. However, it has a strong and significant indirect effects which contribute to growth. Democracy is associated with higher human capital accumulation, lower <!--del_lnk--> inflation, lower political instability, and higher <!--del_lnk--> economic freedom. There is also some evidence that it is associated with larger governments and more restrictions on international trade.<p>If leaving out East Asia, then during the last forty-five years poor democracies have grown their economies 50% more rapidly than nondemocracies. Poor democracies such as the Baltic countries, Botswana, Costa Rica, Ghana, and Senegal have grown more rapidly than nondemocracies such as Angola, Syria, Uzbekistan, and Zimbabwe.<p>Of the eighty worst financial catastrophes during the last four decades, only five were in democracies. Similarly, poor democracies are half likely as nondemocracies to experience a 10 percent decline in GDP per capita over the course of a single year.<p><a id="Famines_and_refugees" name="Famines_and_refugees"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Famines and refugees</span></h3>
      <p>A prominent economist, <!--del_lnk--> Amartya Sen, has noted that no functioning democracy has ever suffered a large scale <a href="../../wp/f/Famine.htm" title="Famine">famine</a>. This includes democracies that have not been very prosperous historically, like <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, which had its last great famine in <!--del_lnk--> 1943 and many other large scale famines before that in the late nineteenth century, all under British rule. However, some others ascribe the <!--del_lnk--> Bengal famine of 1943 to the effects of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. The government of India had been becoming progressively more democratic for years. Provincial government had been entirely so since the <!--del_lnk--> Government of India Act of 1935.<p>Refugee crises almost always occur in nondemocracies.

This is not due to higher levels of foreign assistance or spending a larger percentage of <!--del_lnk--> GDP on health and education. Instead, the available resources are managed better.<p>Several health indicators (life expectancy and infant and maternal mortality) has a stronger and more significant association with democracy than they have with <!--del_lnk--> GDP per capita, size of the public sector, or income inequality.<p>In the post-Communist nations, after an initial decline, those most democratic have achieved the greatest gains in life expectancy.<p><a id="Democratic_peace_theory" name="Democratic_peace_theory"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Democratic peace theory</span></h3>

      <p>Numerous studies using many different kinds of data, definitions, and statistical analyses have found support for the democratic peace theory. The original finding was that liberal democracies have never made war with one another. More recent research has extended the theory and finds that democracies have few <!--del_lnk--> Militarized Interstate Disputes causing less than 1000 battle deaths with one another, that those MIDs that have occurred between democracies have caused few deaths, and that democracies have few <!--del_lnk--> civil wars.<p>There are various criticisms of the theory, including specific historic wars and that correlation is not causation.<p><a id="Mass_murder_by_government" name="Mass_murder_by_government"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Mass murder by government</span></h3>
