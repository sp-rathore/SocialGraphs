      <p>The <b>League of Nations</b> was a <!--del_lnk--> international organization founded after the <!--del_lnk--> Paris Peace Conference, 1919. The League&#39;s goals included <!--del_lnk--> disarmament, preventing <a href="../../wp/w/War.htm" title="War">war</a> through <!--del_lnk--> collective security, settling disputes between <a href="../../wp/c/Country.htm" title="Country">countries</a> through <!--del_lnk--> negotiation <!--del_lnk--> diplomacy and improving global <!--del_lnk--> welfare. The diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift in thought from the preceding hundred years. The League lacked an armed force of its own and so depended on the <!--del_lnk--> Great Powers to enforce its resolutions, keep to economic sanctions which the League ordered, or provide an Army, when needed, for the League to use. However, it was often very reluctant to do so.<p>After a number of notable <a href="#Successes" title="">successes</a> and some early <a href="#Specific_failures" title="">failures</a> in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the <!--del_lnk--> Axis Powers in the 1930s. The onset of the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">Second World War</a> made it clear that the League had failed in its primary purpose&mdash;to avoid any future world war. The <!--del_lnk--> United Nations Organization replaced it after <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> and inherited a number of agencies and organizations founded by the League.<p>

      <p>The concept of a peaceful community of nations had previously been described in <a href="../../wp/i/Immanuel_Kant.htm" title="Immanuel Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>&rsquo;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1795). The idea of the actual League of Nations appears to have originated with <!--del_lnk--> British Foreign Secretary <!--del_lnk--> Edward Grey, and it was enthusiastically adopted by the <!--del_lnk--> Democratic <a href="../../wp/p/President_of_the_United_States.htm" title="President of the United States">U.S. President</a> <a href="../../wp/w/Woodrow_Wilson.htm" title="Woodrow Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> and his advisor <!--del_lnk--> Colonel <!--del_lnk--> Edward M. House as a means of avoiding bloodshed like that of World War I. The creation of the League was a centrepiece of Wilson&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Fourteen Points for Peace, specifically the final point: &quot;A general association of nations must be formed under specific covenants for the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike.&quot;<p>The Paris Peace Conference accepted the proposal to create the League of Nations (<a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a>: <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Nations</i>, <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a>: <i>V&ouml;lkerbund</i>) on <!--del_lnk--> January 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1919. The Covenant of the League of Nations was drafted by a special commission, and the League was established by Part I of the Treaty of Versailles, which was signed on <!--del_lnk--> June 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1919. Initially, the <!--del_lnk--> Charter was signed by 44 <!--del_lnk--> states, including 31 states which had taken part in the war on the side of the <!--del_lnk--> Triple Entente or joined it during the conflict. Despite Wilson&#39;s efforts to establish and promote the League, for which he was awarded the <a href="../../wp/n/Nobel_Peace_Prize.htm" title="Nobel Peace Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> in 1919, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> neither <!--del_lnk--> ratified the Charter nor joined the League due to opposition from <!--del_lnk--> isolationists in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Senate.htm" title="United States Senate">U.S. Senate</a>, especially influential <!--del_lnk--> Republicans <!--del_lnk--> Henry Cabot Lodge of <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts and <!--del_lnk--> William E. Borah of <!--del_lnk--> Idaho, together with Wilson&#39;s refusal to compromise.<p>The League held its first meeting in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> on <!--del_lnk--> 10 January <!--del_lnk--> 1920. Its first action was to ratify the <a href="../../wp/t/Treaty_of_Versailles.htm" title="Treaty of Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, officially ending World War I. The headquarters of the League moved to <a href="../../wp/g/Geneva.htm" title="Geneva">Geneva</a> on <!--del_lnk--> November 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1920, where the first general assembly of the League was held on <!--del_lnk--> November 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1920 with representatives from 41 nations in attendance.<p><a id="Symbols" name="Symbols"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Symbols</span></h2>
      <p>The League of Nations had neither an official <!--del_lnk--> flag nor <!--del_lnk--> logo. Proposals for adopting an official symbol were made during the League&#39;s beginning in 1920, but the member states never reached agreement. However, League of Nations organizations used varying logos and flags (or none at all) in their own operations. An international contest was held in 1929 to find a design, which again failed to produce a symbol. One of the reasons for this failure may have been the fear by the member states that the power of the supranational organization might supercede them. Finally, in <!--del_lnk--> 1939, a semi-official emblem emerged: two five-pointed <!--del_lnk--> stars within a blue <!--del_lnk--> pentagon. The pentagon and the five-pointed stars were supposed to symbolise the five <a href="../../wp/c/Continent.htm" title="Continent">continents</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> five races of mankind. In a bow on top and at the bottom, the flag had the names in <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> (<i>League of Nations</i>) and <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a> (<i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Nations</i>). This flag was used on the building of the <!--del_lnk--> New York World&#39;s Fair in 1939 and 1940.<p><a id="Languages" name="Languages"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Languages</span></h2>
      <p>The official languages of the League of Nations were <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_language.htm" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a> (from <!--del_lnk--> 1920). In the early 1920s, there was a proposal for the League to accept <a href="../../wp/e/Esperanto.htm" title="Esperanto">Esperanto</a> as their working language. Ten delegates accepted the proposal with only one voice against, the French delegate, <!--del_lnk--> Gabriel Hanotaux. Hanotaux did not like how the <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French language</a> was losing its position as the international language of diplomacy and saw Esperanto as a threat. Two years later the League recommended that its member states include Esperanto in their educational curricula.<p><a id="Structure" name="Structure"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Structure</span></h2>
      <p>The League had three principal organs: a <!--del_lnk--> secretariat (headed by the <!--del_lnk--> General Secretary and based in <a href="../../wp/g/Geneva.htm" title="Geneva">Geneva</a>), a Council, and an Assembly. The League also had numerous Agencies and Commissions. Authorization for any action required both a unanimous vote by the Council and a majority vote in the Assembly.<p><a id="Secretariat" name="Secretariat"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Secretariat</span></h3>
      <p>The staff of the League&#39;s secretariat was responsible for preparing the agenda for the Council and Assembly and publishing reports of the meetings and other routine matters, effectively acting as the <!--del_lnk--> civil service for the League.<p>Over the life of the League from 1920&ndash;1946, the three Secretaries General were:<ul>
       <li>Sir <!--del_lnk--> James Eric Drummond, 7th Earl of Perth (UK) (1920-1933)<li><!--del_lnk--> Joseph Avenol (France) (1933-1940)<li><!--del_lnk--> Se&aacute;n Lester (Ireland) (1940-1946)</ul>
      <p>The first president was <!--del_lnk--> Paul Hymans, a well-known <a href="../../wp/b/Belgium.htm" title="Belgium">Belgian</a> politician. The General Secretary wrote annual reports on the work of the League.<p><a id="Council" name="Council"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Council</span></h3>
      <p>The League Council had the authority to deal with any matter affecting <!--del_lnk--> world peace. The Council began with four permanent members (the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>) and four non-permanent members, which were elected by the Assembly for a three-year period. The first four non-permanent members were <a href="../../wp/b/Belgium.htm" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greece</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>. The <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> was meant to be the fifth permanent member, but the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Senate.htm" title="United States Senate">United States Senate</a> was dominated by the <!--del_lnk--> Republican Party after the <!--del_lnk--> 1918 election and voted on <!--del_lnk--> March 19, <!--del_lnk--> 1920 against the <!--del_lnk--> ratification of the <a href="../../wp/t/Treaty_of_Versailles.htm" title="Treaty of Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>.<p>The initial composition of the Council was subsequently changed a number of times. The number of non-permanent members was first increased to six on <!--del_lnk--> September 22, <!--del_lnk--> 1922, and then to nine on <!--del_lnk--> September 8, <!--del_lnk--> 1926. <a href="../../wp/w/Weimar_Republic.htm" title="Weimar Republic">Germany</a> also joined the League and became a fifth permanent member of the Council on the latter date, taking the Council to a total of fifteen members. When Germany and Japan later both left the League, their places were taken by new, non-permanent, members.<p>The Council met on average five times a year, and in extraordinary sessions when required. In total, 107 public sessions were held between 1920 and 1939.<p><a id="Assembly" name="Assembly"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Assembly</span></h3>
      <p>Each member was represented and had one vote in the League Assembly. Individual member states did not always have representatives in <a href="../../wp/g/Geneva.htm" title="Geneva">Geneva</a>. The Assembly held its sessions once a year in September.<p><!--del_lnk--> &Eacute;amon de Valera was the President of the Council of the League of Nations at its 68th and Special Sessions in September and October 1932, and President of the Assembly of the League of Nations in 1938. <!--del_lnk--> Carl Joachim Hambro was President in 1939 and 1946. <!--del_lnk--> Nicolae Titulescu served as president of the League of Nations for two terms, in 1930 and 1931.<p><a id="Other_bodies" name="Other_bodies"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other bodies</span></h3>
      <p>The League oversaw the <!--del_lnk--> Permanent Court of International Justice and several other agencies and commissions created to deal with pressing international problems. These were the <!--del_lnk--> Disarmament Commission, the <a href="../../wp/w/World_Health_Organization.htm" title="World Health Organization">Health Organization</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> International Labour Organization, the <a href="#Mandates" title="">Mandates</a> Commission, the Permanent Central <!--del_lnk--> Opium Board, the Commission for <!--del_lnk--> Refugees, and the <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">Slavery</a> Commission. While the League itself is generally branded a failure, several of its Agencies and Commissions had successes within their respective mandates.<dl>
       <dt><b>Disarmament Commission</b>&nbsp;<dd>The Commission obtained initial agreement by France, Italy, Japan, and Britain to limit the size of their navies. However, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> refused to sign a 1923 disarmament treaty, and the <!--del_lnk--> Kellogg-Briand Pact, facilitated by the commission in 1928, failed in its objective of outlawing war. Ultimately, the Commission failed to halt the military buildup during the 1930s by Germany, Italy and Japan.<dt><b>Health Committee</b>&nbsp;<dd>This body focused on ending <!--del_lnk--> leprosy, <a href="../../wp/m/Malaria.htm" title="Malaria">malaria</a> and <a href="../../wp/y/Yellow_fever.htm" title="Yellow fever">yellow fever</a>, the latter two by starting an international campaign to exterminate <!--del_lnk--> mosquitoes. The Health Organization also succeeded in preventing an epidemic of <!--del_lnk--> typhus from spreading throughout Europe due to its early intervention in the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>.<dt><b>Mandates Commission</b>&nbsp;<dd>The Commission supervised League of Nations <a href="#Mandates" title="">Mandates</a>, and also organised <!--del_lnk--> plebiscites in disputed territories so that residents could decide which country they would join, most notably the plebiscite in <!--del_lnk--> Saarland in 1935.<dt><b>International Labour Organization</b>&nbsp;<dd>This body was led by <!--del_lnk--> Albert Thomas. It successfully banned the addition of <a href="../../wp/l/Lead.htm" title="Lead">lead</a> to <!--del_lnk--> paint, and convinced several countries to adopt an <!--del_lnk--> eight-hour work day and forty-eight-hour working week. It also worked to end <!--del_lnk--> child labour, increase the <!--del_lnk--> rights of women in the workplace, and make <!--del_lnk--> shipowners liable for accidents involving seamen.<dt><b>Permanent Central Opium Board</b>&nbsp;<dd>The Board was established to supervise the statistical control system introduced by the second <!--del_lnk--> International Opium Convention that mediated the production, manufacture, trade and retail of <!--del_lnk--> opium and its by-products. The Board also established a system of import certificates and export authorizations for the legal <!--del_lnk--> international trade in <!--del_lnk--> narcotics.<dt><b>Commission for Refugees</b>&nbsp;<dd>Led by <!--del_lnk--> Fridtjof Nansen, the Commission oversaw the repatriation and, when necessary the resettlement, of 400,000 refugees and ex-<!--del_lnk--> prisoners of war, most of whom were stranded in <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> at the end of World War I. It established camps in <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> in 1922 to deal with a refugee crisis in that country and to help prevent disease and hunger. It also established the <!--del_lnk--> Nansen passport as a means of identification for <!--del_lnk--> stateless peoples.<dt><b>Slavery Commission</b>&nbsp;<dd>The Commission sought to eradicate <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slavery</a> and <!--del_lnk--> slave trading across the world, and fought forced <!--del_lnk--> prostitution and <!--del_lnk--> drug trafficking, particularly in opium. It succeeded in gaining the emancipation of 200,000 slaves in <a href="../../wp/s/Sierra_Leone.htm" title="Sierra Leone">Sierra Leone</a> and organized raids against slave traders in its efforts to stop the practice of <!--del_lnk--> forced labour in <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>. It also succeeded in reducing the death rate of workers constructing the <!--del_lnk--> Tanganyika railway from 55% to 4%. In other parts of the world, the Commission kept records on slavery, prostitution and drug trafficking in an attempt to monitor those issues.</dl>
      <p>Several of these institutions were transferred to the United Nations after the <!--del_lnk--> Second World War. In addition to the International Labour Organisation, the Permanent Court of International Justice became a UN institution as the <a href="../../wp/i/International_Court_of_Justice.htm" title="International Court of Justice">International Court of Justice</a>, and the Health Organization was restructured as the <a href="../../wp/w/World_Health_Organization.htm" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a>.<p><a id="Members" name="Members"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Members</span></h2>

      <p>League of Nations Mandates were established under Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. These territories were former <!--del_lnk--> colonies of the <!--del_lnk--> German Empire and the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> that were placed under the supervision of the League following <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>. There were three Mandate classifications:<dl>
       <dt><b>&quot;A&quot; Mandate</b>&nbsp;<dd>This was a territory which &quot;<i>had reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognised, subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a &quot;Mandatory&quot; until such time as they are able to stand alone. The wishes of these communities must be a principal consideration in the selection of the Mandatory.</i>&quot; These were mainly parts of the old Ottoman Empire.<dt><b>&quot;B&quot; Mandate</b>&nbsp;<dd>This was a territory which &quot;<i>was at such a stage that the Mandatory must be responsible for the administration of the territory under conditions which will guarantee:</i><ul>
         <li><i>Freedom of <!--del_lnk--> conscience and <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religion</a></i><li><i>The maintenance of <!--del_lnk--> public order and <!--del_lnk--> morals</i><li><i>Prohibition of abuses such as the <!--del_lnk--> slave trade, the arms traffic and the <a href="../../wp/d/Distilled_beverage.htm" title="Distilled beverage">liquor</a> traffic</i><li><i>The prevention of the establishment of fortifications or military and naval bases and of military training of the natives for other than political purposes and the defence of territory</i><li><i>Equal opportunities for the trade and commerce of other Members of the League.</i>&quot;</ul>
      </dl>
      <dl>
       <dt><b>&quot;C&quot; Mandate</b>&nbsp;<dd>This was a territory &quot;<i>which, owing to the sparseness of their population, or their small size, or their remoteness from the centres of civilisation, or their geographical contiguity to the territory of the Mandatory, and other circumstances, can be best administered under the laws of the Mandatory.</i>&quot;</dl>
      <p>(Quotations taken from <i>The Essential Facts About the League of Nations</i>, a handbook published in <a href="../../wp/g/Geneva.htm" title="Geneva">Geneva</a> in 1939).<p>The territories were governed by &quot;Mandatory Powers&quot;, such as the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> in the case of the <!--del_lnk--> Mandate of Palestine and the <!--del_lnk--> Union of South Africa in the case of <!--del_lnk--> South-West Africa, until the territories were deemed capable of self-government.

Following the demise of the League, most of the remaining mandates became <!--del_lnk--> United Nations Trust Territories.<p>In addition to the Mandates, the League itself governed the <!--del_lnk--> Saarland for 15 years, before it was returned to <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Germany</a> following a plebiscite, and the <!--del_lnk--> free city of <!--del_lnk--> Danzig (now <!--del_lnk--> Gda&#x144;sk, <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Poland</a>) from <!--del_lnk--> 15 November <!--del_lnk--> 1920 to <!--del_lnk--> 1 September <!--del_lnk--> 1939.<p><a id="Successes" name="Successes"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Successes</span></h2>

      <p><a href="../../wp/%25/%25C3%2585land.htm" title="&Aring;land">&Aring;land</a> is a collection of around 6,500 islands mid-way between <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> and <a href="../../wp/f/Finland.htm" title="Finland">Finland</a>. The islands are exclusively <!--del_lnk--> Swedish-speaking, but Finland had sovereignty in the early 1900s.

The Swedish government raised the issue with the League in 1921. After close consideration, the League determined that the islands should remain a part of Finland, but be governed autonomously, averting a potential war between the two countries.<p><a id="Upper_Silesia" name="Upper_Silesia"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Upper Silesia</span></h3>
      <p>The Treaty of Versailles had ordered a <!--del_lnk--> plebiscite in <!--del_lnk--> Upper Silesia to determine whether the territory should be part of <a href="../../wp/w/Weimar_Republic.htm" title="Weimar Republic">Germany</a> or <!--del_lnk--> Poland. In the background, strong-arm tactics and discrimination against Poles led to <!--del_lnk--> rioting and eventually to the first two <!--del_lnk--> Silesian Uprisings (1919 and 1920). In the plebiscite, roughly 59.6% (around 500,000) of the votes were cast for joining Germany, and this result led to the <!--del_lnk--> Third Silesian Uprising in 1921. The League was asked to settle the matter. In 1922, a six-week investigation found that the land should be split; the decision was accepted by both countries and by the majority of Upper Silesians.<p><a id="Memel" name="Memel"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Memel</span></h3>
      <p>The port city of <!--del_lnk--> Memel (now <!--del_lnk--> Klaip&#x117;da) and <!--del_lnk--> the surrounding area was placed under League control after the end of the World War I and was governed by a French general for three years. However, the population was mostly <a href="../../wp/l/Lithuania.htm" title="Lithuania">Lithuanian</a>, and the Lithuanian government placed a claim to the territory, with Lithuanian forces invading in 1923. The League chose to cede the land around Memel to Lithuania, but declared the port should remain an international zone; Lithuania agreed. While the decision could be seen as a failure (in that the League reacted passively to the use of force), the settlement of the issue without significant bloodshed was a point in the League&#39;s favour.<p><a id="Greece_and_Bulgaria" name="Greece_and_Bulgaria"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Greece and Bulgaria</span></h3>

      <p>After an incident between sentries on the border between <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greece</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Bulgaria.htm" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> in 1925, Greek troops invaded their neighbour. Bulgaria ordered its troops to provide only token resistance, trusting the League to settle the dispute. The League did indeed condemn the Greek invasion, and called for both Greek withdrawal and compensation to Bulgaria. Greece complied, but complained about the disparity between their treatment and that of <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> (see <a href="#Corfu" title="">Corfu</a>, below).<p><a id="Saar" name="Saar"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Saar</span></h3>

      <p>The League resolved a dispute between <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq.htm" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> over the control of the former Ottoman province of <!--del_lnk--> Mosul in 1926. According to the UK, which was awarded a League of Nations <!--del_lnk--> A-mandate over Iraq in 1920 and therefore represented Iraq in its foreign affairs, Mosul belonged to Iraq; on the other hand, the new Turkish republic claimed the province as part of its historic heartland. A three person League of Nations committee was sent to the region in 1924 to study the case and in 1925 recommended the region to be connected to Iraq, under the condition that the UK would hold the mandate over Iraq for another 25 years, to assure the autonomous rights of the <!--del_lnk--> Kurdish population. The League Council adopted the recommendation and it decided on <!--del_lnk--> 16 December <!--del_lnk--> 1925 to award Mosul to Iraq. Although Turkey had accepted the League of Nations arbitration in the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, it rejected the League&#39;s decision. Nonetheless, Britain, Iraq and Turkey made a treaty on <!--del_lnk--> 5 June <!--del_lnk--> 1926, that mostly followed the decision of the League Council and also assigned Mosul to Iraq.<p><a id="Liberia" name="Liberia"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Liberia</span></h3>
      <p>Following rumours of <!--del_lnk--> forced labor in the independent African country of <a href="../../wp/l/Liberia.htm" title="Liberia">Liberia</a>, the League launched an investigation into the matter, particularly the alleged use of forced labor on the massive <i><!--del_lnk--> Firestone</i> rubber plantation in that country. In <!--del_lnk--> 1930, a report by the League implicated many government officials in the selling of contract labor, leading to the resignation of President <!--del_lnk--> Charles D.B. King, his vice-president and numerous other government officials. The League followed with a threat to establish a trusteeship over Liberia unless reforms were carried out, which became the central focus of President <!--del_lnk--> Edwin Barclay.<p><a id="Other_successes" name="Other_successes"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other successes</span></h3>
      <p>The League also worked to combat the international trade in <!--del_lnk--> opium and <!--del_lnk--> sexual slavery and helped alleviate the plight of <!--del_lnk--> refugees, particularly in Turkey in the period to 1926. One of its innovations in this area was its 1922 introduction of the <!--del_lnk--> Nansen passport, which was the first internationally recognised identity card for stateless refugees.

      <p>The League did not, in the long term, succeed. The outbreak of World War II was the immediate cause of the League&#39;s demise, but there was also a variety of other, more fundamental, flaws.<p>The League, like the modern United Nations, lacked an armed force of its own and depended on the <!--del_lnk--> Great Powers to enforce its resolutions, which they were very reluctant to do. Economic <!--del_lnk--> sanctions, which were the most severe measure the League could implement short of military action, were difficult to enforce and had no great impact on the target country, because they could simply trade with those outside the League. The problem is exemplified in the following passage, taken from <i>The Essential Facts About the League of Nations</i>, a handbook published in <a href="../../wp/g/Geneva.htm" title="Geneva">Geneva</a> in 1939:<dl>
       <dd><i>&quot;As regards the military sanctions provided for in paragraph 2 of Article 16, there is <b>no legal obligation</b> to apply them&hellip; there may be a political and moral duty incumbent on states&hellip; but, once again, there is no obligation on them.&quot;</i></dl>
      <p>The League&#39;s two most important members, Britain and France, were reluctant to use sanctions and even more reluctant to resort to military action on behalf of the League. So soon after World War I, the populations and governments of the two countries were <!--del_lnk--> pacifist. The <!--del_lnk--> British Conservatives were especially tepid on the League and preferred, when in government, to negotiate treaties without the involvement of the organization. Ultimately, Britain and France both abandoned the concept of <!--del_lnk--> collective security in favour of <!--del_lnk--> appeasement in the face of growing German militarism under <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>.<p>Representation at the League was often a problem. Though it was intended to encompass all nations, many never joined, or their time as part of the League was short. One key weakness of the League was that the United States never joined, which took away much of the League&#39;s potential power. Even though US President <a href="../../wp/w/Woodrow_Wilson.htm" title="Woodrow Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> had been a driving force behind the League&#39;s formation, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Senate.htm" title="United States Senate">United States Senate</a> voted on <!--del_lnk--> November 19, <!--del_lnk--> 1919 not to join the League.<p>The League also further weakened when some of the main powers left in the 1930s. <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> began as a permanent member of the Council, but withdrew in 1933 after the League voiced opposition to its invasion of the Chinese territory of <!--del_lnk--> Manchuria. Italy also began as a permanent member of the Council but withdrew in 1937. The League had accepted Germany as a member in 1926, deeming it a &quot;peace-loving country&quot;, but <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> pulled Germany out when he came to power in 1933. Another major power, the <!--del_lnk--> Bolshevik <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, was only a member from 1934, when it joined to antagonise Germany (which had left the year before), to <!--del_lnk--> December 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1939, when it was expelled for <!--del_lnk--> aggression against Finland.<p>The League&#39;s neutrality tended to manifest itself as indecision. The League required a unanimous vote of its nine (later fifteen) member Council to enact a resolution, so conclusive and effective action was difficult, if not impossible. It was also slow in coming to its decisions. Some decisions also required unanimous consent of the Assembly; that is, agreement by every member of the League.<p>Another important weakness of the League was that it tried to represent all nations, but most members protected their own national interests and were not committed to the League or its goals. The reluctance of all League members to use the option of military action showed this to the full. If the League had shown more resolve initially, countries, governments and dictators may have been more wary of risking its wrath in later years. These failings were, in part, among the reasons for the outbreak of World War II.<p>Moreover, the League&#39;s advocacy of disarmament for Britain and France (and other members) whilst at the same time advocating collective security meant that the League was unwittingly depriving itself of the only forceful means by which its authority would be upheld. This was because if the League was to force countries to abide by international law it would primarily be the <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Navy.htm" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> French Army which would do the fighting. Furthermore, Britain and France were not powerful enough to enforce international law across the globe, even if they wished to do so. For its members League obligations meant there was a danger that states would get drawn into international disputes which did not directly affect their respective national interests.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 23 June <!--del_lnk--> 1936, in the wake of the collapse of League efforts to restrain Italy&#39;s war of conquest against Abyssinia, <!--del_lnk--> British Prime Minister <a href="../../wp/s/Stanley_Baldwin.htm" title="Stanley Baldwin">Stanley Baldwin</a> told the <a href="../../wp/b/British_House_of_Commons.htm" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a> that <!--del_lnk--> collective security &quot;failed ultimately because of the reluctance of nearly all the nations in Europe to proceed to what I might call military sanctions.... [T]he real reason, or the main reason, was that we discovered in the process of weeks that there was no country except the aggressor country which was ready for war.... [I]f collective action is to be a reality and not merely a thing to be talked about, it means not only that every country is to be ready for war; but must be ready to go to war at once. That is a terrible thing, but it is an essential part of collective security.&quot; It was an accurate assessment and a lesson which clearly was applied in the formation of the <!--del_lnk--> North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which stood as the League&#39;s successor insofar as its role as guarantor of the security of Western Europe was concerned.<p><a id="Specific_failures" name="Specific_failures"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Specific failures</span></h2>

The city was divided into Polish Cieszyn and Czech <!--del_lnk--> &#x10C;esk&yacute; T&#x11B;&scaron;&iacute;n.

      <p>After World War I, Poland and <a href="../../wp/l/Lithuania.htm" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> both regained the independence that they had lost during the <!--del_lnk--> partitions of Poland in 1795. Though both countries shared centuries of common history in the <!--del_lnk--> Polish-Lithuanian Union and <a href="../../wp/p/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth.htm" title="Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>, rising Lithuanian <a href="../../wp/n/Nationalism.htm" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a> prevented the recreation of the former federated state. The city of <!--del_lnk--> Vilna (<!--del_lnk--> Lithuanian Vilnius, <!--del_lnk--> Polish Wilno) was made the capital of Lithuania, despite being mainly Polish in ethnicity.<p>During the <a href="../../wp/p/Polish-Soviet_War.htm" title="Polish-Soviet War">Polish-Soviet War</a> in 1920, a Polish army took control of the city. Despite the Poles&#39; claim to the city, the League chose to ask Poland to withdraw: the Poles did not. The city and its surroundings were proclaimed a separate state of <!--del_lnk--> Central Lithuania and on <!--del_lnk--> 20 February <!--del_lnk--> 1922 the local parliament passed the Unification Act and the city was incorporated into Poland as the capital of the <!--del_lnk--> Wilno Voivodship. Theoretically, British and French troops could have been asked to enforce the League&#39;s decision; however, France did not wish to antagonise Poland, which was seen as a possible ally in a future war against Germany or the Soviet Union, while Britain was not prepared to act alone. Both Britain and France also wished to have Poland as a &#39;buffer zone&#39; between Europe and the possible threat from Communist Russia. Eventually, the League accepted Wilno as a Polish town on <!--del_lnk--> March 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1923. Thus the Poles were able to keep it until <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> invasion in 1939.<p>Lithuanian authorities declined to accept the Polish authority over Vilna and treated it as a constitutional capital. It was not until the <!--del_lnk--> 1938 ultimatum, when Lithuania resolved diplomatic relations with Poland and thus de facto accepted the borders of its neighbour.<p><a id="Ruhr" name="Ruhr"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Ruhr</span></h3>

      <p>Under the Treaty of Versailles, Germany had to pay reparations. They could pay in money or in goods at a set value; however, in 1922 Germany was not able to make its payment. The next year, France and <a href="../../wp/b/Belgium.htm" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> chose to act upon this, and invaded the industrial heartland of Germany, the <!--del_lnk--> Ruhr, despite this being in direct contravention of the League&#39;s rules. With France being a major League member, and Britain hesitant to oppose its close ally, nothing was done in the League. This set a significant precedent &ndash; the League rarely acted against major powers, and occasionally broke its own rules.<p><a id="Corfu" name="Corfu"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Corfu</span></h3>
      <p>One major boundary settlement that remained to be made after World War I was that between <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greece</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Albania.htm" title="Albania">Albania</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Conference of Ambassadors, a <i><!--del_lnk--> de facto</i> body of the League, was asked to settle the issue. The Council appointed <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italian</a> general <!--del_lnk--> Enrico Tellini to oversee this. On <!--del_lnk--> 27 August <!--del_lnk--> 1923, while examining the Greek side of the border, Tellini and his staff were murdered. Italian leader <a href="../../wp/b/Benito_Mussolini.htm" title="Benito Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> was incensed, and demanded the Greeks pay reparations and execute the murderers. The Greeks, however, did not actually know who the murderers were.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 31 August, Italian forces occupied the island of <!--del_lnk--> Corfu, part of Greece, with fifteen people being killed. Initially, the League condemned Mussolini&#39;s invasion, but also recommended Greece pay compensation, to be held by the League until Tellini&#39;s killers were found. Mussolini, though he initially agreed to the League&#39;s terms, set about trying to change them. By working on the Conference of Ambassadors, he managed to make the League change its decision. Greece was forced to apologize and compensation was to be paid directly and immediately. Mussolini was able to leave Corfu in triumph. By bowing to the pressure of a large country, the League again set a dangerous and damaging example. This was one of the League&#39;s major failures.<p><a id="Mukden_Incident" name="Mukden_Incident"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Mukden Incident</span></h3>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Mukden Incident was one of the League&#39;s major setbacks and acted as the catalyst for <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>&#39;s withdrawal from the organisation. In the Mukden Incident, also known as the &quot;Manchurian Incident&quot;, the <!--del_lnk--> Japanese held control of the <!--del_lnk--> South Manchurian Railway in the <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">Chinese</a> region of <!--del_lnk--> Manchuria. They claimed that Chinese soldiers had <!--del_lnk--> sabotaged the railway, which was a major trade route between the two countries, on <!--del_lnk--> September 18, <!--del_lnk--> 1931. In fact, it is thought that the sabotage had been contrived by officers of the Japanese <!--del_lnk--> Kwantung Army without the knowledge of government in Japan, in order to catalyse a full invasion of Manchuria. In retaliation, the Japanese army, acting contrary to the civilian government&#39;s orders, occupied the entire region of Manchuria, which they renamed <!--del_lnk--> Manchukuo. This new country was only recognised internationally by Italy and Germany - the rest of the world still saw Manchuria as legally a region of China. In 1932, Japanese air and sea forces bombarded the Chinese city of <a href="../../wp/s/Shanghai.htm" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a> and the short war of <!--del_lnk--> January 28 Incident broke out.<p>The Chinese government asked the League of Nations for help, but the long voyage around the world by sailing ship for League officials to investigate the matter themselves delayed matters. When they arrived, the officials were confronted with Chinese assertions that the Japanese had invaded unlawfully, while the Japanese claimed they were acting to keep peace in the area. Despite Japan&#39;s high standing in the League, the <!--del_lnk--> Lytton Report declared Japan to be in the wrong and demanded Manchuria be returned to the Chinese. However, before the report was voted upon by the Assembly, Japan announced intentions to invade more of China. When the report passed 42-1 in the Assembly in 1933 (only Japan voted against), Japan withdrew from the League.<p>According to the <i>Covenant</i> of the League of Nations, the League should have now placed economic sanctions against Japan, or gathered an army together and declared war against it. However, neither happened. Economic <!--del_lnk--> sanctions had been rendered almost useless due to the United States Congress voting against being part of the League, despite <a href="../../wp/w/Woodrow_Wilson.htm" title="Woodrow Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>&#39;s keen involvement in the drawing up of the <a href="../../wp/t/Treaty_of_Versailles.htm" title="Treaty of Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, and his wish for America to join the League. Any economic sanctions the League now placed on its member states would be fairly pointless, as the state barred from trading with other member states could simply turn and trade with America. An army was not assembled by the League due to the self-interest of many of its member states. This meant that countries like Britain and France did not want to gather together an army for the League to use, as they were too interested and busy with their own affairs - such as keeping control of their extensive colonial lands, especially after the turmoil of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>. Japan was therefore left to keep control of Manchuria, until the <!--del_lnk--> Red Army of the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> took over the area and returned it to China at the end of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> in 1945.<p><a id="Chaco_War" name="Chaco_War"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Chaco War</span></h3>

By the time a ceasefire was negotiated on <!--del_lnk--> 12 June <!--del_lnk--> 1935, Paraguay had seized control over most of the region.

As Stanley Baldwin, the British Prime Minister, later observed, this was ultimately because no one had the military forces on hand to withstand an Italian attack. On <!--del_lnk--> 9 October <!--del_lnk--> 1935, the United States (a non-League member) refused to cooperate with any League action. It had embargoed exports of arms and war material to either combatant (in accordance with its new Neutrality Act) on <!--del_lnk--> 5 October and later (<!--del_lnk--> 29 February <!--del_lnk--> 1936) endeavored (with uncertain success) to limit exports of oil and other materials to normal peacetime levels. The League sanctions were lifted on <!--del_lnk--> 4 July <!--del_lnk--> 1936, but by that point they were a dead letter in any event.<p>As was the case with Manchuria, the vigor of the major powers in responding to the crisis in Abyssinia was tempered by their perception that the fate of this poor and far-off country, inhabited by non-Europeans, was not a central interest of theirs.<p><a id="Axis_re-armament" name="Axis_re-armament"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Axis re-armament</span></h3>

As with Japan, both Germany in 1933 &ndash; using the failure of the <!--del_lnk--> World Disarmament Conference to agree to arms parity between France and Germany as a pretext &ndash; and Italy in 1937 simply withdrew from the League rather than submit to its judgment. The League commissioner in <!--del_lnk--> Danzig was unable to deal with German claims on the city, a significant contributing factor in the outbreak of World War II in 1939. The final significant act of the League was to expel the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> in December 1939 after it <!--del_lnk--> invaded Finland.<p><a id="Demise_and_legacy" name="Demise_and_legacy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demise and legacy</span></h2>
      <p>With the onset of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, it was clear that the League had failed in its purpose &ndash; to avoid any future world war. During the war, neither the League&#39;s Assembly nor Council was able or willing to meet, and its secretariat in <a href="../../wp/g/Geneva.htm" title="Geneva">Geneva</a> was reduced to a skeleton staff, with many offices moving to North America.<p>After its failure to prevent one war, it was decided in 1945 at the <!--del_lnk--> Yalta Conference, to create a new body to supplant the League&#39;s role. This body was to be the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>. Many League bodies, for instance the <!--del_lnk--> International Labour Organization, continued to function and eventually became affiliated with the UN. At a meeting of the Assembly in 1946, the League dissolved itself and its services, mandates, and property were transferred to the UN.<p>The structure of the United Nations was intended to make it more effective than the League. The principal <!--del_lnk--> Allies in World War II (<a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">UK</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">USSR</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, <!--del_lnk--> U.S., and <a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_China.htm" title="Republic of China">China</a>) became permanent members of the <!--del_lnk--> UN Security Council, giving the new &quot;Great Powers&quot; significant international influence, mirroring the League Council. Decisions of the UN Security Council are binding on all members of the UN; however, unanimous decisions are not required, unlike the League Council. Permanent members of the UN Security Council were given a shield to protect their vital interests, which has prevented the UN acting decisively in many cases. Similarly, the UN does not have its own standing armed forces, but the UN has been more successful than the League in calling for its members to contribute to armed interventions, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Korean War, and <!--del_lnk--> peacekeeping in the <!--del_lnk--> former Yugoslavia. However, the UN has in some cases been forced to rely on economic sanctions. The UN has also been more successful than the League in attracting members from the nations of the world, making it more representative.<p><a id="Trivia" name="Trivia"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Trivia</span></h2>
