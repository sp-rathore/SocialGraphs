      <p><i><b>Lost</b></i> is an <!--del_lnk--> American <!--del_lnk--> serial drama <!--del_lnk--> television series that follows the lives of a group of <!--del_lnk--> plane crash survivors (and their pasts via flashbacks) on a mysterious <a href="../../wp/t/Tropics.htm" title="Tropics">tropical</a> island, somewhere in the <!--del_lnk--> South Pacific. The show was created by <!--del_lnk--> Jeffrey Lieber, <!--del_lnk--> J. J. Abrams and <!--del_lnk--> Damon Lindelof (who has since become the show&#39;s head writer), and is filmed primarily on location in <!--del_lnk--> Hawaii. The <!--del_lnk--> pilot episode was first broadcast on <!--del_lnk--> September 22, <!--del_lnk--> 2004. Since then, two seasons have aired and a third began on <!--del_lnk--> October 4, <!--del_lnk--> 2006. The show is produced by <!--del_lnk--> Touchstone Television, <!--del_lnk--> Bad Robot Productions and Grass Skirt Productions and airs on the <!--del_lnk--> ABC Network in the U.S. Its <!--del_lnk--> incidental music is composed by <!--del_lnk--> Michael Giacchino. The current executive producers are J.J. Abrams, Damon Lindelof, <!--del_lnk--> Carlton Cuse, <!--del_lnk--> Jack Bender, <!--del_lnk--> Jeff Pinkner and <!--del_lnk--> Bryan Burk. Because of its large <!--del_lnk--> ensemble cast and the cost of filming in Hawaii, the series is one of the most expensive on television.<p>A critical and popular success, <i>Lost</i> garnered an average of 15.5 million viewers per episode on ABC during its first year, and won numerous industry awards including the <!--del_lnk--> Emmy Award for outstanding drama series in 2005 and best American import at the British Television Awards also in 2005<p>Reflecting its devoted <!--del_lnk--> fan base, the show has become a staple of <a href="../../wp/p/Popular_culture.htm" title="Popular culture">popular culture</a> with references to the story and its elements appearing in other television shows, commercials, <!--del_lnk--> comic books, <!--del_lnk--> humor magazines and song <!--del_lnk--> lyrics.

      <p>The series began development in January 2004, when <!--del_lnk--> Lloyd Braun, head of ABC at the time, ordered an initial script based on his concept of a cross between the movie <i><!--del_lnk--> Cast Away</i> and the popular reality show <i><!--del_lnk--> Survivor</i>. Unhappy with the result and a subsequent re-write, Braun contacted J.J. Abrams, creator of the TV series <i><!--del_lnk--> Alias</i>, to write a new pilot script. Although initially hesitant, Abrams warmed to it, and eventually collaborated with Damon Lindelof to create the series&#39; style and characters. The development of the show was constrained by tight deadlines, as it had been commissioned late in the 2004 season&#39;s development cycle. Despite the short schedule, the creative team remained flexible enough to modify or create characters to fit actors they wished to cast.<p><i>Lost&#39;</i>s two-part <!--del_lnk--> pilot episode was the most expensive in the network&#39;s history, reportedly costing between <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">US$</a>10 and US$14 million, compared to the average cost of an hour-long pilot in 2005 of US$4 million. The show, which debuted on <!--del_lnk--> September 22, <!--del_lnk--> 2004, became one of the biggest critical and commercial successes of the <!--del_lnk--> 2004 television season. Along with fellow new series <i><!--del_lnk--> Desperate Housewives</i>, <i>Lost</i> helped to reverse the flagging fortunes of ABC. Yet, before it had even aired, Lloyd Braun was <!--del_lnk--> fired by executives at ABC&#39;s parent company, <!--del_lnk--> Disney, because he had <!--del_lnk--> greenlighted such an expensive and risky project.<br clear="left" />
      <p><a id="Episode_format" name="Episode_format"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Episode format</span></h3>
      <p>Episodes have a distinct structure: following a recap of events relevant to the upcoming narrative, each show begins with a <!--del_lnk--> cold open. At a dramatic juncture, the screen cuts to black and the title <!--del_lnk--> graphic, slightly out-of-focus, glides towards the viewer accompanied by an ominous, discordant sound. The <!--del_lnk--> opening credits generally appear over the scenes that immediately follow. While there is a progressive <!--del_lnk--> story arc, each episode relates events concurrently with pre-island <!--del_lnk--> flashbacks centered on a particular character. The majority of episodes end with a suspenseful <!--del_lnk--> twist or <!--del_lnk--> cliffhanger, revealed just seconds before a <!--del_lnk--> smash cut to black and the title graphic. Others, following a plot resolution, will finish with a reflective closing scene that precedes a simple <!--del_lnk--> fade out. Shortly afterwards, a preview of out-of-sequence clips from the next episode is shown.<p><a id="Music" name="Music"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Music</span></h3>

      <p><i>Lost</i> features <!--del_lnk--> incidental music composed by Michael Giacchino, whose score is primarily orchestral and incorporates several recurring themes for events and characters. The score is performed by the <!--del_lnk--> Hollywood Studio Symphony Orchestra. In the official Lost Podcast, Michael Giacchino revealed that he achieved some of the sounds for the score using unusual instruments, such as striking suspended pieces of the plane&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> fuselage.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> March 21, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, the record label <!--del_lnk--> Var&egrave;se Sarabande released the original television <!--del_lnk--> soundtrack for <i>Lost&#39;</i>s first season. The soundtrack included select full-length versions of the most popular themes of the season and the main title which was composed by series creator J.J. Abrams. Var&egrave;se Sarabande released a soundtrack featuring music from the second season of <i>Lost</i> on <!--del_lnk--> October 3, <!--del_lnk--> 2006.<p>Pop culture songs have been used sparingly in the series, given the mainly orchestral score. When such songs are featured, they usually originate from a <!--del_lnk--> diegetic source, meaning that they are usually generated by an action of one of the characters. Examples are the various songs played on Hurley&#39;s portable CD player throughout the first season or the use of the record player (which included <!--del_lnk--> Cass Elliot&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Make Your Own Kind of Music&quot;) in the second season premiere.<p>In some international broadcasts, alternate music is utilized. For instance, in the <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japanese</a> broadcast of Lost, Season 1&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> theme song is &quot;Here I am&quot; by <!--del_lnk--> Chemistry and Season 2&#39;s theme song is &quot;<!--del_lnk--> losin&#39;&quot; by <!--del_lnk--> Yuna Ito.<p><a id="Filming_locations" name="Filming_locations"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Filming locations</span></h3>
      <p><i>Lost</i> is filmed (35mm) almost entirely on the Hawaiian island of <!--del_lnk--> Oahu. The original island scenes for the pilot were filmed at <!--del_lnk--> Mokul&#x113;&#39;ia Beach, near the northwest tip of the island. Later beach scenes take place in secluded spots of the famous <!--del_lnk--> North Shore. Cave scenes in the first season were filmed on a <!--del_lnk--> sound stage built at a <!--del_lnk--> Xerox parts warehouse, which had been empty since an <!--del_lnk--> employee mass shooting took place there in 1999. The soundstage and <!--del_lnk--> production offices have since moved to the Hawaii Film Office-operated Hawaii Film Studio, at which the sets depicting Season 2&#39;s &quot;Hatch&quot; and Season 3&#39;s &quot;Hydra station&quot; interiors were built. Various urban areas in and around <!--del_lnk--> Honolulu are used as stand-ins for locations around the world, including <!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles, <!--del_lnk--> New York, <!--del_lnk--> Iowa, <a href="../../wp/s/South_Korea.htm" title="South Korea">South Korea</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq.htm" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/Nigeria.htm" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, and <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>. For example, scenes set in a <!--del_lnk--> Sydney airport were filmed at the <!--del_lnk--> Hawaii Convention Centre, while a <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>-era bunker was used as an <!--del_lnk--> Iraqi Republican Guard installation.<p>Numerous writers have taken to journeying to Hawaii to find the locations in which episodes are set. In March 2005, one <i><!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles Times</i> columnist described how he sneaked onto the set during filming on one such trip, which has led to other travel writers following in his tracks. Extensive archives of filming locations are tracked at <!--del_lnk--> About.com as well as in a repository at <!--del_lnk--> Lostvirtualtour.com.<p><a id="Online_distribution" name="Online_distribution"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Online distribution</span></h3>
      <p>In addition to traditional terrestrial and satellite broadcasting, <i>Lost</i> has been at the forefront of new television distribution methods. It was one of the first series issued through <!--del_lnk--> Apple&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> iTunes Store service for playback on an <a href="../../wp/i/IPod.htm" title="IPod">iPod</a> or within the <a href="../../wp/i/ITunes.htm" title="ITunes">iTunes</a> software. Since October 2005, new episodes, without commercials, have been available for download the day after they air on ABC.<p>In April 2006, <!--del_lnk--> Disney announced that <i>Lost</i> would be available for free online in streaming format, with advertising, on ABC&#39;s website, as part of a two-month experiment of future distribution strategies. The trial, which ran from May to June 2006, caused a stir among network affiliates who were afraid of being cut out of advertising revenue. The streaming of <i>Lost</i> episodes direct from ABC&#39;s website was only available to viewers in the United States due to international licensing agreements.<p>The UK&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Channel 4 has also allowed access to the series online. Both parts of &quot;Pilot&quot; were available to watch for free, and other episodes cost <a href="../../wp/p/Pound_sterling.htm" title="Pound sterling">GB&pound;</a>0.99 each. Season two installments are made available two weeks after their Channel 4 debut, and the episodes expire after several months. Due to licensing agreements, the service is only accessible in the UK. Channel 4 have now teamed up with NTL &amp; Telewest&#39;s On Demand function which allows the viewer to watch shows at any time. Select episodes from Season One and Season two are available to view for 24 hour rental for &pound;0.99 although the list of episodes is not complete.<p>As of third quarter, 2006, France&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> TF1 has allowed online access to the French version of season two; episodes cost <a href="../../wp/e/Euro.htm" title="Euro">&euro;</a>1.99. Each episode is issued online just after being broadcast.<p><a id="Cast_and_characters" name="Cast_and_characters"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Cast and characters</span></h2>

      <p>The current season features sixteen regular speaking roles, making it the second largest cast in American primetime television behind <i>Desperate Housewives</i>. While a large cast makes <i>Lost</i> more expensive to produce, the show&#39;s writers benefit from more flexibility in story decisions. According to series executive producer Bryan Burk, &quot;You can have more interactions between characters and create more diverse characters, more back stories, more love triangles.&quot;<p>The initial season had fourteen major speaking roles with each actor getting star <!--del_lnk--> billing. <!--del_lnk--> Naveen Andrews portrayed former Iraqi Republican guard <!--del_lnk--> Sayid Jarrah. <!--del_lnk--> Emilie de Ravin played the pregnant Australian <!--del_lnk--> Claire Littleton. <!--del_lnk--> Matthew Fox acted as the troubled surgeon and main character <!--del_lnk--> Jack Shephard. <!--del_lnk--> Jorge Garcia portrayed <!--del_lnk--> Hugo &quot;Hurley&quot; Reyes, an unlucky lotto winner. <!--del_lnk--> Maggie Grace played <!--del_lnk--> Shannon Rutherford, a former dance teacher. <!--del_lnk--> Josh Holloway acted as con man <!--del_lnk--> James &quot;Sawyer&quot; Ford. <!--del_lnk--> Yunjin Kim played <!--del_lnk--> Sun-Hwa Kwon, the daughter of a powerful Korean businessman, with <!--del_lnk--> Daniel Dae Kim as her husband <!--del_lnk--> Jin-Soo Kwon. <!--del_lnk--> Evangeline Lilly portrayed fugitive <!--del_lnk--> Kate Austen. <!--del_lnk--> Dominic Monaghan acted as an ex-rock star drug addict <!--del_lnk--> Charlie Pace. <!--del_lnk--> Terry O&#39;Quinn played the mysterious <!--del_lnk--> John Locke. <!--del_lnk--> Harold Perrineau portrayed construction worker <!--del_lnk--> Michael Dawson, while child star <!--del_lnk--> Malcolm David Kelley acted as his young son, <!--del_lnk--> Walt Lloyd. <!--del_lnk--> Ian Somerhalder played <!--del_lnk--> Boone Carlyle, chief operating officer of his mother&#39;s wedding business and step brother of Shannon.<div class="notice metadata spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><!--del_lnk--> Spoiler warning: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
      <p>During the first two seasons, some characters were written out to make room for new characters with new stories. Boone Carlyle was the first major character to be written out in season one. Malcolm David Kelley became a guest star after the events of the first season&#39;s finale, making rare appearances throughout season two. Maggie Grace&#39;s departure six episodes into season two made way for newcomers <!--del_lnk--> Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Catholic priest and former Nigerian criminal <!--del_lnk--> Eko, <!--del_lnk--> Michelle Rodriguez as airport security guard and former police officer <!--del_lnk--> Ana Lucia Cortez, and <!--del_lnk--> Cynthia Watros portraying the purported clinical psychologist <!--del_lnk--> Libby. Ana Lucia and Libby were written out of the series toward the end of season two, as was Michael.<p>In season three, <!--del_lnk--> Henry Ian Cusick received star billing as former Scottish soldier <!--del_lnk--> Desmond David Hume, as did <!--del_lnk--> Michael Emerson in the role of <!--del_lnk--> Benjamin Linus (formerly known as Henry Gale), the leader of the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Others.&quot; In addition, three new actors joined the regular cast: <!--del_lnk--> Elizabeth Mitchell, as <!--del_lnk--> Juliet, <!--del_lnk--> Kiele Sanchez who plays <!--del_lnk--> Nikki, and <!--del_lnk--> Rodrigo Santoro, who plays <!--del_lnk--> Paulo. With these additions, however, Mr. Eko was written out early in the season.<p>Numerous supporting characters have been given expansive and recurring appearances in the progressive storyline. In the second season, <!--del_lnk--> Rose Henderson played by <!--del_lnk--> L. Scott Caldwell and tail section survivor <!--del_lnk--> Bernard Nadler played by <!--del_lnk--> Sam Anderson, were featured in a flashback episode after being reunited. <!--del_lnk--> Mira Furlan as <!--del_lnk--> Danielle Rousseau, the shipwrecked Frenchwoman appeared throughout seasons one and two. Two of the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Others&quot;, <!--del_lnk--> William Mapother as <!--del_lnk--> Ethan Rom and <!--del_lnk--> M.C. Gainey as <!--del_lnk--> Tom have been shown in both flashbacks and the ongoing story. Similarly, Jack&#39;s father, <!--del_lnk--> Christian Shephard, portrayed by <!--del_lnk--> John Terry, has appeared in multiple flashbacks, of more than one main character. Also appearing in characters flashbacks and being revealed as one of the surviving tailies is <!--del_lnk--> Kimberley Joseph as Cindy.<p><a id="Season_synopses" name="Season_synopses"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Season synopses</span></h2>

More island mythologies and insights into the survivors&#39; pasts are divulged. The hatch is explored and the existence of <!--del_lnk--> The DHARMA Initiative and its benefactor, <!--del_lnk--> The Hanso Foundation, are revealed.

      <p>In parallel to its character development, episodes of <i>Lost</i> include a number of mysterious elements which have been ascribed to <!--del_lnk--> science fiction or <!--del_lnk--> supernatural phenomena. The creators of the series refer to these as part of the <a href="../../wp/m/Mythology.htm" title="Mythology">mythology</a> of the series, and they form the basis of rampant fan speculation.<p>Among the show&#39;s mythological elements is a &quot;monster&quot; which appears to roam the island; a mysterious group of inhabitants whom the survivors refer to as &quot;The Others&quot;; an organization called the &quot;DHARMA Initiative&quot; which has placed several <!--del_lnk--> research stations on the island; a sequence of numbers which have made frequent appearances in the lives of the characters, in both the past and present; and personal connections between the characters, of which they are often unaware.<p><a id="Thematic_motifs" name="Thematic_motifs"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Thematic motifs</span></h2>

Theories mainly concern the nature of the island, the origins of the &quot;monster&quot; and the &quot;Others&quot;, the meaning of the numbers, and the reasons for both the crash and the survival of some passengers.<p>Several of the more common fan theories have been discussed and rejected by the show&#39;s creators, the most common being that the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 are dead or in <!--del_lnk--> purgatory. This was specifically denied by J.J. Abrams and was also proven to be wrong by the second season&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> finale. The makers of the show have also discredited the theory that the survivors will experience, or have experienced, <!--del_lnk--> time travel, which was dismissed by <!--del_lnk--> Damon Lindelof. Likewise, speculation that <!--del_lnk--> spaceships or <!--del_lnk--> aliens influence the events on the island, or that everything seen is a fictional reality taking place in someone&#39;s mind, has also been rejected by Lindelof.<p>Carlton Cuse dismissed the theory that the island is a <!--del_lnk--> reality TV show and the castaways unwitting housemates and Damon Lindelof discredited the theory that the &quot;monster&quot; is a <!--del_lnk--> nanobot cloud similar to the one featured in <!--del_lnk--> Michael Crichton&#39;s novel <i><!--del_lnk--> Prey</i>.<div class="notice metadata spoiler" style="border-top: 2px solid #dddddd; border-bottom:2px solid #dddddd; text-align: justify; margin: 1em; padding: 0.2em;"><i><b>Spoilers end here.</b></i></div>
