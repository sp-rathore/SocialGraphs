      <p>Archaeological evidence indicates that from as early as the <!--del_lnk--> 8th millennium BC, Libya&#39;s coastal plain was inhabited by a <!--del_lnk--> Neolithic people who were skilled in the domestication of cattle and the cultivation of crops. This culture flourished for thousands of years in the region, until they were displaced or absorbed by the <!--del_lnk--> Berbers.<p>The area known in modern times as Libya was later occupied by a series of peoples, with the <!--del_lnk--> Phoenicians, <!--del_lnk--> Carthaginians, <!--del_lnk--> Greeks, <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Romans</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Vandals and <a href="../../wp/b/Byzantine_Empire.htm" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantines</a> ruling all or part of the area. Although the Greeks and Romans left ruins at <!--del_lnk--> Cyrene, <!--del_lnk--> Leptis Magna and <!--del_lnk--> Sabratha, little other evidence remains of these ancient cultures.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The Phoenicians were the first to establish trading posts in Libya, when the merchants of <!--del_lnk--> Tyre (in present-day <a href="../../wp/l/Lebanon.htm" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>) developed commercial relations with the <!--del_lnk--> Berber tribes and made treaties with them to ensure their cooperation in the exploitation of raw materials. By the <!--del_lnk--> 5th century BC, <!--del_lnk--> Carthage, the greatest of the Phoenician colonies, had extended its <!--del_lnk--> hegemony across much of North Africa, where a distinctive civilisation, known as <!--del_lnk--> Punic, came into being. Punic settlements on the Libyan coast included <!--del_lnk--> Oea (Tripoli), Labdah (<!--del_lnk--> Leptis Magna) and <!--del_lnk--> Sabratha. All these were in an area that was later called <!--del_lnk--> Tripolis, or &quot;Three Cities&quot;. Libya&#39;s current-day capital Tripoli takes its name from this.<p>The <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Greeks</a> conquered Eastern Libya when, according to tradition, emigrants from the crowded island of <!--del_lnk--> Thera were commanded by the oracle at <!--del_lnk--> Delphi to seek a new home in North Africa. In <!--del_lnk--> 631 BC, they founded the city of <!--del_lnk--> Cyrene. Within 200 years, four more important Greek cities were established in the area: <!--del_lnk--> Barce (<!--del_lnk--> Al Marj); Euhesperides (later Berenice, present-day <!--del_lnk--> Benghazi); <!--del_lnk--> Teuchira (later Arsinoe, present-day Tukrah); and <!--del_lnk--> Apollonia (Susah), the port of Cyrene. Together with Cyrene, they were known as the Pentapolis (Five Cities).<p>The <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Romans</a> unified both regions of Libya, and for more than 400 years <!--del_lnk--> Tripolitania and <!--del_lnk--> Cyrenaica became prosperous Roman provinces. Roman ruins, such as those of Leptis Magna, attest to the vitality of the region, where populous cities and even small towns enjoyed the amenities of urban life. Merchants and artisans from many parts of the Roman world established themselves in North Africa, but the character of the cities of Tripolitania remained decidedly Punic and, in Cyrenaica, Greek. <!--del_lnk--> Arabs conquered Libya in the <a href="../../wp/7/7th_century.htm" title="7th century">7th century</a> <!--del_lnk--> CE. In the following centuries, many of the indigenous peoples adopted <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a>, and also the <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic language</a> and culture. The <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman</a> Turks conquered the country in the mid-16th century, and Libya remained part of their empire, although at times virtually autonomous, until Italy invaded in 1911 and turned Libya into a colony.<p>In 1934, Italy adopted the name &quot;Libya&quot; (used by the Greeks for all of <a href="../../wp/n/North_Africa.htm" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>, except Egypt) as the official name of the colony, which consisted of the provinces of <!--del_lnk--> Cyrenaica, <!--del_lnk--> Tripolitania and <!--del_lnk--> Fezzan. <!--del_lnk--> King Idris I, Emir of Cyrenaica, led Libyan resistance to Italian occupation between the two World Wars. From 1943 to 1951, Tripolitania and Cyrenaica were under British administration, while the French controlled Fezzan. In 1944, Idris returned from exile in <a href="../../wp/c/Cairo.htm" title="Cairo">Cairo</a> but declined to resume permanent residence in Cyrenaica until the removal of some aspects of foreign control in 1947. Under the terms of the 1947 peace treaty with the Allies, Italy relinquished all claims to Libya.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> November 21, <!--del_lnk--> 1949, the <!--del_lnk--> UN General Assembly passed a resolution stating that Libya should become independent before <!--del_lnk--> January 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1952. Idris represented Libya in the subsequent UN negotiations. When Libya declared its independence on <!--del_lnk--> December 24, <!--del_lnk--> 1951, it was the first country to achieve independence through the UN, and one of the first European possessions in Africa to gain independence.

      <p>The discovery of significant <!--del_lnk--> oil reserves in 1959 and the subsequent income from <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> sales enabled one of the world&#39;s poorest nations to establish an extremely wealthy state. Although oil drastically improved the Libyan government&#39;s finances, popular resentment began to build over the increased concentration of the nation&#39;s wealth in the hands of King Idris and the national elite. This discontent continued to mount with the rise of <!--del_lnk--> Nasserism and <!--del_lnk--> Arab nationalism throughout North Africa and the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> September 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1969, a small group of military officers led by then 28-year-old army officer <!--del_lnk--> Muammar Abu Minyar al-Gaddafi staged a <i><!--del_lnk--> coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat</i> against King Idris. At the time, Idris was in Turkey for medical treatment. His nephew, Crown Prince <!--del_lnk--> Sayyid Hasan ar-Rida al-Mahdi as-Sanussi, became King. It was clear that the revolutionary officers who had announced the deposition of King Idris did not want to appoint him over the instruments of state as King. Sayyid quickly found that he had substantially less power as the new King than he had earlier had as a mere Prince. Before the end of <!--del_lnk--> September 1, Sayyid Hasan ar-Rida had been formally deposed by the revolutionary army officers and put under house arrest. Meanwhile, revolutionary officers abolished the monarchy, and proclaimed the new Libyan Arab Republic. Gaddafi was, and is to this day, referred to as the &quot;Brother Leader and Guide of the Revolution&quot; in government statements and the official press.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>

      <p>There are two branches of government in Libya. The &quot;revolutionary sector&quot; comprises Revolutionary Leader Gaddafi, the Revolutionary Committees and the remaining members of the 12-person Revolutionary Command Council, which was established in 1969. The historical revolutionary leadership is not elected and cannot be voted out of office; they are in power by virtue of their involvement in the revolution. The revolutionary sector dictates the decision-making power of the second sector, the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Jamahiriya Sector&quot;.<p>Constituting the <!--del_lnk--> legislative branch of government, this sector comprises Local People&#39;s Congresses in each of the 1,500 urban wards, 32 Sha&#39;biyat People&#39;s Congresses for the regions, and the National <!--del_lnk--> General People&#39;s Congress. These legislative bodies are represented by corresponding <!--del_lnk--> executive bodies (Local People&#39;s Committees, Sha&#39;biyat People&#39;s Committees and the National General People&#39;s Committee/Cabinet).<p>Every four years, the membership of the Local People&#39;s Congresses elects their own leaders and the <!--del_lnk--> secretaries for the People&#39;s Committees, sometimes after many debates and a critical vote. The leadership of the Local People&#39;s Congress represents the local congress at the People&#39;s Congress of the next level. The members of the National General People&#39;s Congress elect the members of the National General People&#39;s Committee (the <!--del_lnk--> Cabinet) at their annual meeting.<p>The government controls both state-run and semi-autonomous media. In cases involving a violation of &quot;these taboos&quot;, the private press, like The Tripoli Post, has been censored , although articles that are critical of policies have been requested and intentionally published by the revolutionary leadership itself as a means of initiating reforms.<p><!--del_lnk--> Political parties were banned by the 1972 Prohibition of Party Politics Act Number 71. According to the Association Act of 1971, the establishment of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) is allowed. However, because they are required to conform to the goals of the revolution, their numbers are small in comparison with those in neighbouring countries. <a href="../../wp/t/Trade_union.htm" title="Trade union">Trade unions</a> do not exist, but numerous professional associations are integrated into the state structure as a third pillar, along with the People&#39;s Congresses and Committees. These associations do not have the right to strike. Professional associations send delegates to the General People&#39;s Congress, where they have a representative mandate.<p><a id="Foreign_Relations" name="Foreign_Relations"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Foreign Relations</span></h3>

      <p>Libya&#39;s foreign policies have undergone much fluctuation and change since the state was proclaimed on <!--del_lnk--> Christmas Eve, <!--del_lnk--> 1951. As a Kingdom, Libya maintained a definitively pro-Western stance, yet was recognized as belonging to the conservative traditionalist bloc in the <!--del_lnk--> League of Arab States (Arab League), of which it became a member in 1953. The government was in close alliance with <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">Britain</a> and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>; both countries maintained military base rights in Libya. Libya also forged close ties with France, Italy, Greece, and <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, and established full diplomatic relations with the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> in 1955.<p>Although the government supported Arab causes, including the Moroccan and Algerian independence movements, it took little active part in the <!--del_lnk--> Arab-Israeli dispute or the tumultuous inter-Arab politics of the 1950s and early 1960s. The Kingdom was noted for its close association with the West, while it steered an essentially conservative course at home.<p>After the 1969 <!--del_lnk--> coup, Gaddafi closed American and British bases and partially <!--del_lnk--> nationalized foreign oil and commercial interests in Libya. He also played a key role in promoting oil <!--del_lnk--> embargoes as a political weapon for challenging the West, hoping that an oil price rise and embargo in 1973 would persuade the West, especially the United States, to end support for Israel. Gaddafi rejected both Soviet <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">communism</a> and Western <a href="../../wp/c/Capitalism.htm" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> and claimed he was charting a middle course for his government.<p>In the 1980s, Libya increasingly distanced itself from the West, and was accused of committing mass acts of state sponsored terrorism. When evidence of Libyan complicity was discovered in the <!--del_lnk--> Berlin discotheque terrorist bombing that killed two American servicemen, the United States responded by launching an <!--del_lnk--> aerial bombing attack against targets near Tripoli and <!--del_lnk--> Benghazi in April 1986.<p>In 1991, two Libyan <!--del_lnk--> intelligence agents were indicted by federal prosecutors in the U.S. and Scotland for their involvement in the December 1988 bombing of <!--del_lnk--> Pan Am flight 103. Six other Libyans were put on trial in absentia for the 1989 bombing of <!--del_lnk--> UTA Flight 772. The <!--del_lnk--> UN Security Council demanded that Libya surrender the suspects, cooperate with the Pan Am 103 and UTA 772 investigations, pay compensation to the victims&#39; families, and cease all support for terrorism. Libya&#39;s refusal to comply led to the approval of UNSC Resolution 748 on <!--del_lnk--> March 31, <!--del_lnk--> 1992, imposing sanctions on the state designed to bring about Libyan compliance. Continued Libyan defiance led to further sanctions by the UN against Libya in November 1993.<p>In 2003, more than a decade after the sanctions were put in place, Libya began to make dramatic policy changes vis-&agrave;-vis the <!--del_lnk--> Western world with the open intention of pursuing a Western-Libyan <!--del_lnk--> d&eacute;tente. The Libyan government announced its decision to abandon its <!--del_lnk--> weapons of mass destruction programs and pay almost 3 billion US dollars in compensation to the families of Pan Am flight 103 as well as UTA Flight 772. The decision was welcomed by many western nations and was seen as an important step for Libya toward rejoining the international community. Since 2003 the country has normalised its ties with the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> and the United States and has even coined the catchphrase, &#39;The Libya Model&#39;, an example intended to show the world what can be achieved through negotiation rather than force when there is goodwill on both sides.<p><a id="Human_rights" name="Human_rights"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Human rights</span></h3>

      <p>According to the U.S. Department of State&rsquo;s annual <a href="../../wp/h/Human_rights.htm" title="Human rights">human rights</a> report for 2004, Libya&rsquo;s <!--del_lnk--> authoritarian regime continued to have a poor record in the area of human rights. Some of the numerous and serious abuses on the part of the government include poor prison conditions, arbitrary arrest and detention, prisoners held incommunicado, and <!--del_lnk--> political prisoners held for many years without charge or trial. The judiciary is controlled by the state, and there is no right to a fair public trial. Libyans do not have the right to change their government. <!--del_lnk--> Freedom of speech, <!--del_lnk--> press, <!--del_lnk--> assembly, <!--del_lnk--> association, and <!--del_lnk--> religion are restricted. Independent human rights organizations are prohibited. <!--del_lnk--> Domestic violence against women appears to be widespread, and there have been reports of <!--del_lnk--> trafficking in persons. Ethnic and tribal minorities suffer discrimination, and the state continues to restrict the <!--del_lnk--> labor rights of foreign workers.<p>In 2005, the <!--del_lnk--> Freedom House rated <!--del_lnk--> political rights in Libya as &quot;7&quot; (1 representing the most free and 7 the least free rating), <!--del_lnk--> civil liberties as &quot;7&quot; and gave it the freedom rating of &quot;Not Free&quot;.<p><a id="Administrative_Divisions" name="Administrative_Divisions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Administrative Divisions</span></h2>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Libyan Desert, which covers much of eastern Libya, is one of the most arid places on earth. In places, decades may pass without <a href="../../wp/r/Rain.htm" title="Rain">rain</a>, and even in the <!--del_lnk--> highlands rainfall happens erratically, once every 5-10 years. At Uweinat, the last recorded <a href="../../wp/r/Rain.htm" title="Rainfall">rainfall</a> was in September 1998. There is a large <!--del_lnk--> depression, the <!--del_lnk--> Qattara Depression, just to the south of the northernmost scarp, with Siwa oasis at its western extremity. The depression continues in a shallower form west, to the oases of Jaghbub and Jalo.<p>Likewise, the temperature in the Libyan desert can be extreme; in 1922, the town of <!--del_lnk--> Al &#39;Aziziyah, which is located west of <a href="../../wp/t/Tripoli.htm" title="Tripoli">Tripoli</a>, recorded an air temperature of 57.8 &deg;<!--del_lnk--> C (136.0 &deg;<!--del_lnk--> F), generally accepted as the highest recorded naturally occurring air temperature reached on Earth.<p>There are a few scattered uninhabited small oases, usually linked to the major depressions, where water can be found by digging to a few feet in depth. In the west there is a widely dispersed group of oases in unconnected shallow depressions, the Kufra group, consisting of Tazerbo, Rebiana and Kufra. Aside from the scarps, the general flatness is only interrupted by a series of <!--del_lnk--> plateaus and massifs near the centre of the Libyan Desert, around the convergence of the Egyptian-Sudanese-Libyan Borders.<p>Slightly further to the south are the massifs of Arkenu, Uweinat and Kissu. These <a href="../../wp/g/Granite.htm" title="Granite">granite</a> mountains are very ancient, having formed much before the sandstones surrounding them. Arkenu and Western Uweinat are ring complexes very similar to those in the <!--del_lnk--> Air Mountains. Eastern Uweinat (the highest point in the Libyan Desert) is a raised sandstone plateau adjacent to the granite part further west. The plain to the north of Uweinat is dotted with eroded volcanic features.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>

      <p>Compared to its neighbours, Libya enjoys an extremely low level of both <!--del_lnk--> absolute and relative <a href="../../wp/p/Poverty.htm" title="Poverty">poverty</a>. Libyan officials in the past three years have made progress on economic reforms as part of a broader campaign to reintegrate the country into the international fold. This effort picked up steam after <!--del_lnk--> UN sanctions were lifted in September <!--del_lnk--> 2003, and as Libya announced in December 2003 that it would abandon programs to build weapons of mass destruction.<p>Libya has begun some market-oriented reforms. Initial steps have included applying for membership of the <!--del_lnk--> World Trade Organisation, reducing <!--del_lnk--> subsidies, and announcing plans for <!--del_lnk--> privatisation. The non-oil manufacturing and construction sectors, which account for about 20% of GDP, have expanded from processing mostly agricultural products to include the production of <!--del_lnk--> petrochemicals, <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Steel.htm" title="Steel">steel</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Aluminium.htm" title="Aluminium">aluminium</a>. Climatic conditions and poor soils severely limit agricultural output, and Libya imports about 75% of its food. Water is also a problem, with some 28% of the population not having access to safe drinking water in 2000.<p>Under the previous Prime Minister, <!--del_lnk--> Shukri Ghanem, and current prime minister <!--del_lnk--> Baghdadi Mahmudi, Libya is undergoing a business boom. Many government-run industries are being privatised. Most US sanctions have been lifted; and as of May 2006, the remaining vestiges are scheduled for removal pending US Congressional approval. Many international oil companies have returned to the country, including controversial oil giants <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Dutch_Shell.htm" title="Royal Dutch Shell">Shell</a> and <!--del_lnk--> ExxonMobil. Tourism is on the rise, bringing increased demand for hotel accommodation and for capacity at airports such as <!--del_lnk--> Tripoli International. A multi-million dollar renovation of Libyan airports has recently been approved by the government to help meet such demands. At present 300,000 people visit the country annually; the Libyan government hopes to increase this figure to an ambitious 10,000,000 by 2015.<br clear="all" />

      <p>Libya has a small population within its large territory, with a <!--del_lnk--> population density of about 3 people per square kilometre (8.5/mi&sup2;) in the two northern regions of <!--del_lnk--> Tripolitania and <!--del_lnk--> Cyrenaica, and less than one person per square kilometre (1.6/mi&sup2;) elsewhere. Libya is thus one of the least dense nations by area in the world. 90% of the people live in less than 10% of the area, mostly along the coast. More than half the population is urban, concentrated to a greater extent, in the two largest cities, <a href="../../wp/t/Tripoli.htm" title="Tripoli">Tripoli</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Benghazi. Native Libyans are primarily a mixture of <!--del_lnk--> Arabs and <!--del_lnk--> Berbers.<p>There are small <!--del_lnk--> Tuareg (a Berber population) and <!--del_lnk--> Tebu tribal groups concentrated in the south, living <!--del_lnk--> nomadic or semi-nomadic lifestyles. Among foreign residents, the largest groups are citizens of other African nations, including North Africans (primarily <!--del_lnk--> Egyptians and Tunisians), West Africans and <!--del_lnk--> Sub-Saharan Africans. Libyan Berbers and Arabs constitute 97% of the population; the other 3% are <!--del_lnk--> Sub-Saharan Africans, <!--del_lnk--> Greeks, <a href="../../wp/m/Malta.htm" title="Malta">Maltese</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Italians, <!--del_lnk--> Egyptians, <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistanis</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Turks, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">Indians</a> and Tunisians.<p>The main language spoken in Libya is <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>, which is also the official language. <!--del_lnk--> Tamazight (i.e. Berber languages), which do not have official status, are spoken by Libyan Berbers. Berber speakers live above all in the <!--del_lnk--> Jebel Nafusa region (<!--del_lnk--> Tripolitania), the town of <!--del_lnk--> Zuwarah on the coast, and the city-oases of <!--del_lnk--> Ghadames, <!--del_lnk--> Ghat and <!--del_lnk--> Awjila. In addition, Tuaregs speak <!--del_lnk--> Tamahaq, the only known Northern <!--del_lnk--> Tamasheq language. <!--del_lnk--> Italian and <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> are sometimes spoken in the big cities, although Italian speakers are mainly among the older generation.<p><a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h3>

      <p>Libya&#39;s population of 5.7 million includes 1.7 million students, over 270,000 of whom study at the <!--del_lnk--> tertiary level. Education in Libya is free for all citizens, and compulsory up until <!--del_lnk--> secondary level. The literacy rate is the highest in North Africa; over 88% of the population can read and write. After Libya&#39;s independence in 1951, its first university, the University of Libya, was established in Benghazi. In academic year 1975/76 the number of university students was estimated to be 13,418. As of 2004, this number has increased to more than 200,000, with an extra 70,000 enrolled in the higher technical and vocational sector. The rapid increase in the number of students in the higher education sector has been mirrored by an increase in the number of institutions of higher education. Since 1975 the number of universities has grown from two to nine and after their introduction in 1980, the number of higher technical and vocational institutes currently stands at 84(with 12 public universities). Libya&#39;s higher education is financed by the public budget. In 1998 the budget allocated for education represented 38.2% of the national budget.<p>The Main universities in Libya are&nbsp;:<ul>

      <p>By far the predominant religion in Libya is <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> with 97% of the population associating with the faith. The vast majority of Libyan Muslims adhere to <!--del_lnk--> Sunni Islam, which provides both a spiritual guide for individuals and a keystone for government policy, but a conspicuous minority (between 5 and 10%) adheres to <!--del_lnk--> Ibadism (a branch of <!--del_lnk--> Kharijism), above all in the Jebel Nefusa and the town of Zuwarah. This minority, both linguistic and religious, suffers from a lack of consideration by the official authorities.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Before the 1930s, the <!--del_lnk--> Sanusi Movement was the primary Islamic movement in Libya. This was a religious revival adapted to desert life. Its <i>zawaayaa</i> (lodges) were found in <!--del_lnk--> Tripolitania and <!--del_lnk--> Fezzan, but Sanusi influence was strongest in <!--del_lnk--> Cyrenaica. Rescuing the region from unrest and anarchy, the Sanusi movement gave the Cyrenaican tribal people a religious attachment and feelings of unity and purpose. This Islamic movement, which was eventually destroyed by both <!--del_lnk--> Italian invasion and later the Gaddafi government, was very conservative and somewhat different from the Islam that exists in Libya today. Gaddafi asserts that he is a devout Muslim, and his government is taking a role in supporting Islamic institutions and in worldwide proselytizing on behalf of Islam. Libyan Islam, however, has always been considered traditional, but in no way harsh compared to Islam in other countries. A Libyan form of <!--del_lnk--> Sufism is also common in parts of the country.<p>Other than the overwhelming majority of Sunni Muslims, there are also very small <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christian</a> communities, composed almost exclusively of foreigners. There is a small <a href="../../wp/a/Anglicanism.htm" title="Anglicanism">Anglican</a> community, made up mostly of African immigrant workers in Tripoli; it is part of the Egyptian Diocese. There are also an estimated 40,000 <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholics</a> in Libya who are served by two Bishops, one in Tripoli (serving the <!--del_lnk--> Italian community) and one in <!--del_lnk--> Benghazi (serving the <!--del_lnk--> Maltese community).<p>Libya was until recent times the home of one of the oldest <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jew">Jewish</a> communities in the world, dating back to at least <!--del_lnk--> 300 BC. A series of <!--del_lnk--> pogroms beginning in November of 1945 lasted for almost three years, drastically reducing Libya&#39;s Jewish population. In 1948, about 38,000 Jews remained in the country. Upon Libya&#39;s independence in 1951, most of the Jewish community emigrated. After the <!--del_lnk--> Suez Crisis in 1956, all but about 100 Jews were forced to flee.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

      <p>Libya is culturally similar to its neighboring <!--del_lnk--> Arab states. While the primary language of the country is a <!--del_lnk--> local colloquial form of Arabic, the Libyan people consider themselves very much a part of a wider Arab community. There seem to be two distinct <!--del_lnk--> dialects and a small number of village and tribal dialects. Libyan Arabs have a heritage in the traditions of the nomadic <!--del_lnk--> Bedouin and associate themselves with a particular Bedouin tribe.<p>Family life is important for Libyan families, the majority of which live in <!--del_lnk--> apartment blocks and other independent housing units, with precise modes of housing depending on their income and wealth. Although the Libyan Arabs traditionally lived nomadic lifestyles in tents, they have now settled in various towns and cities. Because of this, their old ways of life are gradually fading out. An unknown small number of Libyans still live in the desert as their families have done for centuries. Most of the population has occupations in <a href="../../wp/i/Industry.htm" title="Industry">industry</a> and <!--del_lnk--> services, and a small percentage is in <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>.<p>As with some other countries in the Arab world, Libya boasts few theatres or art galleries. Public entertainment is almost nonexistent, even in the big cities. Recently there has been a revival of the arts in Libya, especially painting: private galleries are springing up to provide a showcase for new talent. Conversely, for many years there have been no public theatres, and only a few cinemas showing foreign films. The tradition of <!--del_lnk--> folk culture is still alive and well, with troupes performing music and dance at frequent festivals, both in Libya and abroad. The main output of Libyan television is devoted to showing various styles of traditional Libyan music. <!--del_lnk--> Tuareg music and dance are popular in <!--del_lnk--> Ghadames and the south. Libyan television programmes are mostly in Arabic with a 30-minute news broadcast each evening in English and French. The government maintains strict control over all media outlets. A new analysis by the <!--del_lnk--> Committee to Protect Journalists has found Libya&rsquo;s media the most tightly controlled in the Arab world. To combat this, the government plans to introduce private media, an initiative intended to bring the country&#39;s media in from the cold.<p>Many Libyans frequent the country&#39;s beaches. They also visit Libya&#39;s beautifully-preserved archaeological sites&mdash;especially <!--del_lnk--> Leptis Magna, which is widely considered to be one of the best preserved Roman archaeological sites in the world.<p>The nation&#39;s capital, <a href="../../wp/t/Tripoli.htm" title="Tripoli">Tripoli</a>, boasts many good museums and archives; these include the Government Library, the Ethnographic Museum, the Archaeological Museum, the National Archives, the Epigraphy Museum and the Islamic Museum. The Jamahiriya Museum, built in consultation with <!--del_lnk--> UNESCO, may be the country&#39;s most famous. It houses one of the finest collections of classical art in the Mediterranean.<p>
