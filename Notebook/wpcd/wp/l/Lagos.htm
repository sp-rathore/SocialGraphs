      <p><b>Lagos</b> is the largest city in <a href="../../wp/n/Nigeria.htm" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>. As only two <!--del_lnk--> censuses (in 1972 and 1991) have been taken since independence, estimates of its population vary considerably, but generally range from 10 to 15.5 million people, making it one of the most populous cities in <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>.<p>Lagos has grown from a small <!--del_lnk--> Yoruba settlement, and undergone periods of domination by two <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="European">European</a> powers, to become the commercial and population centre of Nigeria.<p>It is also the former <!--del_lnk--> capital city of Nigeria; it has since been replaced by <a href="../../wp/a/Abuja.htm" title="Abuja">Abuja</a>. Abuja city officially gained its status as the capital city of Nigeria on <!--del_lnk--> 12 December <!--del_lnk--> 1991; although Lagos was stripped of this title much earlier, it acted as <i>de facto</i> capital until around 1991.<p>

      <p>Lagos was once a big head <!--del_lnk--> Yoruba settlement of <!--del_lnk--> Awori people called <!--del_lnk--> Eko, whose name stemmed from either <i>Eko</i> (Cassava farm) a result of the conquest of that region by the Benin Empire or Edo Empire (1470-1897). The present day Lagos state has a higher percent of this sub-group who actually migrated to the area from Isheri along the <!--del_lnk--> Ogun river. Throughout history, it was home to a number of warring tribes who had all settled in the area. During its early history, it also saw periods of rule by the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Benin.  <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> explorer <!--del_lnk--> Sequeira visited the area in <!--del_lnk--> 1472 , naming the area around the city Lagos, meaning <i>lakes</i>. From 1704-1851 it served as a major centre of the <!--del_lnk--> slave trade. In 1841 <!--del_lnk--> Oba Akitoye ascended on to the throne of Lagos and tried to bring an end to slave trading by placing a ban on the act. Lagos merchants, most notably <!--del_lnk--> Madam Tinubu, resisted the ban, deposed the king and installed his brother <!--del_lnk--> Oba Kosoko. <!--del_lnk--> Oba Akitoye while on exile met with the British who had banned slave trading in 1807, and got their backing to regain his throne. In 1851 he was reinstalled as the <!--del_lnk--> Oba of Lagos.<p>Lagos was formally annexed as a British colony in 1861. This had the dual effect of crushing the slave trade and establishing British superiority over palm and other trades. The remainder of modern-day Nigeria was seized in 1886, and when the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria was established in 1914 Lagos was declared its capital. It continued to be its capital when <a href="../../wp/n/Nigeria.htm" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> gained its independence from Britain in <!--del_lnk--> 1960. Lagos experienced rapid growth throughout the 1960s and 1970s as a result of <a href="../../wp/n/Nigeria.htm" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>&#39;s economic boom prior to the <!--del_lnk--> Biafran War. Lagos was the capital of Nigeria from 1914 - 1991; it was stripped of this title when the <!--del_lnk--> Federal Capital Territory was established at the purpose-built city of <a href="../../wp/a/Abuja.htm" title="Abuja">Abuja</a>. However, most government functions (especially the head of state) stayed in Lagos for a time since <a href="../../wp/a/Abuja.htm" title="Abuja">Abuja</a> was still under construction. In 1991, the head of state and other government functions finally moved to the newly built capital in a mass exodus. The change resulted in Lagos losing some prestige and economic leverage.<p><a id="Past_Oba_.28of_Kings.29_of_Lagos" name="Past_Oba_.28of_Kings.29_of_Lagos"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Past Oba (of Kings) of Lagos</span></h3>

      <p>The climate in Lagos is similar to that of the rest of southern Nigeria. There are two rainy seasons, with the heaviest rains falling from April to July and a weaker rainy season in October and November. There is a brief relatively dry spell in August and September and a longer dry season from December to March. Monthly rainfall between May and July averages over 300 <!--del_lnk--> mm (12 <!--del_lnk--> in), whilst in August and September it is down to 75 mm (3 inches) and in January as low as 35 mm (1.5 inches). The main dry season is accompanied by <!--del_lnk--> harmattan winds from the <!--del_lnk--> Sahara Desert, which between December and early February can be quite strong. According to <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a> <a href="../../wp/w/Weather.htm" title="Weather">Weather</a>, the average tempearature in January is 27 &ordm;C (79 &ordm;F) and for July it is 25 &ordm;C (77 &ordm;F). On average the hottest month is March; with a mean temperature of 29C (84F); whilst July is the coolest month .<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>
      <p>Lagos consists of a large <!--del_lnk--> lagoon (hence its namesake) and an <!--del_lnk--> archipelago of large islands in the lagoon. The three major islands are <!--del_lnk--> Lagos Island, <!--del_lnk--> Ikoyi, and <!--del_lnk--> Victoria. The commercial centre remains <!--del_lnk--> Lagos Island, which is connected to the mainland by three large bridges: <!--del_lnk--> Eko Bridge, <!--del_lnk--> Carter Bridge, and <!--del_lnk--> Third Mainland Bridge. <!--del_lnk--> Ikoyi and <!--del_lnk--> Victoria island are closely connected to Lagos Island. The main docks are in <!--del_lnk--> Apapa directly opposite Lagos Island. The rest of the city is built on the African mainland. Districts on the mainland include <!--del_lnk--> Ebute-Meta, <!--del_lnk--> Surulere, <!--del_lnk--> Yaba (Lagos) (site of the <!--del_lnk--> University of Lagos), <!--del_lnk--> Mushin, <!--del_lnk--> Maryland and <!--del_lnk--> Ikeja, site of <!--del_lnk--> Murtala Mohammed International Airport.<p><a id="Law_and_Government" name="Law_and_Government"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Law and Government</span></h2>
      <p>Unlike many major first world cities, but like many African and developing country cities, Lagos does not have its own mayor or council, but is instead governed as part of a regular <!--del_lnk--> Nigerian state. Since <!--del_lnk--> 1967, Lagos is part of <!--del_lnk--> Lagos State. Lagos was the headquarters of Lagos State until <!--del_lnk--> 1976, when this was moved to <!--del_lnk--> Ikeja. <p>Lagos State covers some of the area beyond the city&#39;s borders, such as <!--del_lnk--> Badagri, but its primary focus is on Lagos proper. The state of Lagos is split into 5 districts. The state is responsible for utilities including roads and transportation, power, water, health, and education.<p>The city is also home to the <!--del_lnk--> High Court of the <!--del_lnk--> Lagos State Judiciary, housed in an old colonial building on <!--del_lnk--> Lagos Island. <p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>
      <p>Lagos is Nigeria&#39;s leading <!--del_lnk--> port. The <!--del_lnk--> Port of Lagos, operated by the <!--del_lnk--> Nigerian Port Authority is split into three main sections: Lagos port, <!--del_lnk--> Apapa Port and <!--del_lnk--> Tin Can Port, all located on the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf of Guinea.  The port features a <!--del_lnk--> railhead.<p>The port handles imports of consumer goods, foodstuffs, motor vehicles, machinery, and industrial raw materials. Its export trade in timber and agricultural products such as <!--del_lnk--> cacao and <!--del_lnk--> groundnuts has declined since the early 1970s, although the port has seen growing amounts of <!--del_lnk--> crude oil exported, with export figures rising between <!--del_lnk--> 1997 and <!--del_lnk--> 2000.  Oil and <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> products provide 20% of GDP and 95% of <!--del_lnk--> foreign exchange earnings in Nigeria as a whole. <p>Lagos is also Nigeria&#39;s commercial centre. Many of the country&#39;s largest banks and financial institutions are located here. Many of the country&#39;s well known &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Nigerian Scams&quot; are conducted here as well.<p>More than half of Nigeria&#39;s industrial capacity is located in Lagos&#39;s mainland suburbs, particularly in the Ikeja industrial estate. A wide range of manufactured goods are produced in the city, including machinery, motor vehicles, electronic equipment, chemicals, beer, processed food, and textiles.<p><a id="Transport" name="Transport"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transport</span></h2>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Ferries and <!--del_lnk--> highways link the parts of the city together. However, transport links within Lagos are congested, due in part to the geography of the city, as well as its explosive population growth.<p>The city is filled with poor quality buses and motorcycles that are a vital part of Lagos&#39; Transport Network. They are notorious for crashes and robberies and it is recommended that tourists do not travel on them.<p>An agency called Lagos Metropolitan Transport Authority (LAMATA) has been created to solve the transportation problems in Lagos. A chain of salt-water lagoons runs west to <!--del_lnk--> Badagry and also east toward <!--del_lnk--> Ogun State. The <!--del_lnk--> Bus Rapid Transit scheme is set to be launched on the 4th of June 2006.The Lagos - Ibadan <!--del_lnk--> expressway and the Lagos - Abeokuta <!--del_lnk--> expressway are the major arterial routes in the city and serve as an inter-state highway to Ibadan, Oyo state and Abeokuta, Ogun State respectively. The Lagos - Ibadan <!--del_lnk--> expressway also serves as a Christian highway because every first friday of every month, the highway links over 500,000 Lagosians with the kilometer 42 Redeemed Christian Church camp.<p><!--del_lnk--> Murtala Mohammed International Airport serves the city.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>
      <p>As no census has been completed in Lagos since 1991, definitive demographic information is hard to come by. There is clear evidence of startling population growth in Lagos. A census is being taken and compiled (as of March 2006) for the whole of Nigeria, even imposing curfews to ensure accurate counts. This will provide the most accurate numbers to date for Lagos. This census will not include religious or tribal affilitaion, as these are controversial issues with two major religions (Islam and Christianity) and three major ethnicities.<p>Lagos is, by most estimates, one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. The <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> predicts that the city&#39;s metropolitan area, which had only about 290,000 inhabitants in <!--del_lnk--> 1950, will exceed 20 million by <!--del_lnk--> 2010. This will make Lagos one of the world&#39;s five largest cities. <p>In Nigeria as a whole, there are more than 250 ethnic groups. <p><a id="Neighborhoods" name="Neighborhoods"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Neighborhoods</span></h2>
      <p>The Lagos Mainland is the center of most of the population that commute to work on Lagos Island which in some respects is the economic nerve centre of Nigeria. The area is also particularly famous for its music and nightlife, notably in areas around <!--del_lnk--> Yaba and <!--del_lnk--> Surulere, as well as the National Stadium Complex. Other areas of the mainland include the middle class, slums, and suburbs of <!--del_lnk--> Ebute-Meta, <!--del_lnk--> Surulere, <!--del_lnk--> Yaba (site of the <!--del_lnk--> University of Lagos), <!--del_lnk--> Mushin, and <!--del_lnk--> Ikeja.<p><!--del_lnk--> Lagos Island is the nerve centre of the city and contains many of the largest markets in Lagos, its <!--del_lnk--> central business district, the central mosque, and the oba&#39;s palace. Though largely derelict, Tinubu Square on Lagos Island is a site of historical importance; it was here that the Amalgamation ceremony that unified the North and South took place in 1914.<p>

Lagos has given birth to a variety of styles such as <!--del_lnk--> highlife, <!--del_lnk--> juju, <!--del_lnk--> fuji, and <!--del_lnk--> Afrobeat.

       <br /> Lagos is the centre of the famous Nigerian film industry, often referred to as &#39;<!--del_lnk--> Nollywood.&#39; Many of the large film producers have offices in Surulere, Lagos, though there aren&#39;t any film studios in <!--del_lnk--> Nollywood, in the <!--del_lnk--> Hollywood sense. Idumota market on Lagos Island is the primary distribution centre. Also many films are shot in the Festac area of Lagos.<p>
