      <p>Barrientos was born in <!--del_lnk--> Medina del Campo in the year <!--del_lnk--> 1382, the son of Pedro Gutierre de Barrientos, a servant of <!--del_lnk--> Ferdinand I of Aragon, who was killed during a battle in service to the king. It is probable, though not possible to conclusively demonstrate, that his family were originally <!--del_lnk--> Marranos&mdash;that is, <!--del_lnk--> Sephardic Jews who were forced in ancient times to adopt the identity of <!--del_lnk--> Christians, either through coercion, or who, for form&#39;s sake, became <!--del_lnk--> Catholic converts in service to the Crown. He was born into the court and was treated as one of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Infantes de Arag&oacute;n</i> (&quot;Princes of Aragon&quot;; the children of <!--del_lnk--> Fernando I and <!--del_lnk--> Eleanor of Alburquerque), which explains why he was a part of&mdash;-at least at first&mdash;the internal Castilian struggles against <!--del_lnk--> &Aacute;lvaro de Luna, the <!--del_lnk--> Constable of <!--del_lnk--> Castile, <!--del_lnk--> Grand Master of the <!--del_lnk--> military order of Santiago, and favorite of King John II.<p>Barrientos first studied to be a Domican Friar in Medina, then at the <!--del_lnk--> Convent of San Esteban in Salamanca in <!--del_lnk--> 1406. Following the completion of his education, he took a teaching position at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Salamanca, where he conducted classes in <!--del_lnk--> theology and <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>. While at the University, he met and befriended another eminent figure, <!--del_lnk--> Tom&aacute;s de Torquemada. Barrientos and Torquemada had many things in common: they were both likely of Jewish origin; belonged to the Dominican Order; came from villages in the <!--del_lnk--> province of Valladolid; and, undoubtedly, shared ideas on the religious problem of Castile.<p>Barrientos was so outstanding in his teaching that in 1416 he was offered and accepted a chair at the university as professor of theology. Adding more prestige to the position, it is thought that this was the first time the University of Salamanca had endorsed this type of professorship. He remained there until 1433, when King <!--del_lnk--> John II nominated him to the post of royal <!--del_lnk--> confessor and further entrusted him with the education of his sons, <!--del_lnk--> Prince Henry (who would go on to become &quot;the Impotent&quot; King) and later, Prince Alfonso (b. 1453 - d. 1468).<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Barrientos was appointed an <!--del_lnk--> Inquisitor during this time, and in 1438, he was elected <!--del_lnk--> Bishop of <!--del_lnk--> Segovia. On <!--del_lnk--> May 3, <!--del_lnk--> 1440 a church council was convened in the Church of San Miguel of <!--del_lnk--> Tur&eacute;gano, at which he presented his <!--del_lnk--> synodal commandments for the theological and pastoral formation of his clergymen. Being loyal to John II, in 1442 he reformed the diocese of Segovia, which had been under the influence of the rebellious prince Henry, to serve the province of <!--del_lnk--> &Aacute;vila in supporting the King. Later, he engineered a conciliation in the <!--del_lnk--> Tordesillas area to create a joint front in the face of the opposition of the Kingdoms of <!--del_lnk--> Navarre and <!--del_lnk--> Aragon. In 1444 he occupied the diocese of Cuenca and in the following year he lent the diocese&#39;s aid to the region&#39;s troops in the battle of <!--del_lnk--> Olmedo. Similarly, in 1449, he pledged the arms of the diocese in defense against the troops of don Alonso de Arag&oacute;n and other Castilian noblemen who opposed the king. One offered him the <!--del_lnk--> archbishopric seat of <!--del_lnk--> Santiago de Compostela, but he rejected this enticement.<p>Despite his important religious responsibilities, Bishop Barrientos never neglected his duty to the state, serving throughout his career as adviser first to <!--del_lnk--> John II, later to <!--del_lnk--> Henry IV, and possibly as an instructor of the future Queen and then stepsister of the king, <!--del_lnk--> Isabella of Castile as well as being named tutor to John II&#39;s youngest son, prince Alphonsus in the King&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> will. From his privileged position of confidence it is likely that he decisively influenced their politics, as the religious policy views of all three monarchs closely resembled Barrientos&#39; known theological policy leanings. Nevertheless, Barrientos deplored both kings for their sheepishness, and it is likely he conspired against Henry IV before his crowning given his close relationship with the <!--del_lnk--> Princes of Arag&oacute;n.<p>His work as man of state was as discreet as it was fundamental. He worked (or plotted) in close proximity to John II, at first as a <!--del_lnk--> partisan supporter of the Princes of Arag&oacute;n, but later as a faithful follower of John II, once he became king. Ultimately, he became a very powerful and rich man despite the <!--del_lnk--> vow of poverty associated with the <!--del_lnk--> Dominican Order.<p>Although <!--del_lnk--> &Aacute;lvaro de Luna had been a favorite of John II, acting as one of his main advisors, and wielded great power as Grand Master of the military order of Santiago, The king&#39;s second wife, <!--del_lnk--> Isabel de Portugal, was offended at the immense influence of the constable, and urged her husband to free himself from slavery to his favorite. In 1453 the king succumbed; Alvaro was arrested, tried and condemned. He was executed at <!--del_lnk--> Valladolid on <!--del_lnk--> 2 June <!--del_lnk--> 1453. Barrientos stepped into the power vacuum, replacing Luna in the government of Castile until the death of John II just a year later. Following the crowning of Henry IV, Barrientos separated to some extent from the affairs of the state over disagreements with the new monarch. Despite his eventful political life, he had still time to found diverse convent houses&mdash;the <i>Hospital de San Sebasti&aacute;n de Cuenca</i> and <i>Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Piedad de Medina del Campo</i>&mdash;and to write numerous books, reflecting his adherence to the philosophy of <!--del_lnk--> scholasticism. Barrientos died in Cuenca on <!--del_lnk--> May 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1469 and was laid to rest in the second of the two convents he founded.<p><a id="Activities_as_inquisitor_and_policy_on_conversion" name="Activities_as_inquisitor_and_policy_on_conversion"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Activities as inquisitor and policy on conversion</span></h2>
      <p>At the end of <a href="../../wp/1/15th_century.htm" title="15th century">15th century</a>, a wide sector of Spanish society held hostile views toward Jews; as the <!--del_lnk--> Franciscan, <!--del_lnk--> Alphonso de Spina explains in his treatise, Fortalitium Fidei: <i>&quot;Entraron, &iexcl;oh Se&ntilde;or!, en tu reba&ntilde;o los lobos rapaces. Nadie piensa en los p&eacute;rfidos jud&iacute;os, que blasfeman de tu nombre&quot;</i> (They entered your flock, oh Lord!, as greedy <!--del_lnk--> wolves. Nobody thinks about the perfidious Jews, who <!--del_lnk--> blaspheme in your name).<p>By contrast, there were <!--del_lnk--> influential Spaniards who decried these attitudes&mdash;at least toward <i>converted</i> Jews (some of them being converts themselves) &mdash;such as D&iacute;az de Toledo, Alonso de Cartagena, Lope Barrientos and <!--del_lnk--> Juan de Torquemada (the uncle of the inquisitor). Benzion Netanyahu, a noted writer on 15th century Spanish affairs, affirms that when the converted Spaniards were <!--del_lnk--> persecuted, they were &quot;<i>determined to fight fire with fire, the Marranos enlisted in their support men of courage and brilliance, such as Lope de Barrientos...</i>&quot;.<p>In fact, Barrientos wrote a number of <!--del_lnk--> tracts defending Jews; in one he recognized that it is &quot;<i>posible es que aya algunos, pero puesto que ansy sea, injusta e inhumana cosa ser&iacute;a todo el linaje dellos manzellar nin diffamar</i>&quot; (possible that there are some deserving of <!--del_lnk--> condemnation, but even if that is the case, it would be unjust and cruel to debase and defame all people of Jewish heritage). Thanks to his position as inquisitor and the influence that title conferred upon him, he was able to contact <!--del_lnk--> Pope Nicholas V regarding the issue. In <!--del_lnk--> 1449 he obtained a favorable response; according to Barrientos, the <!--del_lnk--> Pontiff &quot;<i>hab&iacute;a mandado que no se hiciera ninguna discriminaci&oacute;n entre los nuevos convertidos a la fe y los cristianos viejos en la recepci&oacute;n y tenencia de honores, dignidades y oficios, tanto eclesi&aacute;sticos como seculares</i>&quot; (ordered him not to discriminate between new converts to the faith and old Christians in the reception and tenancy of honours, dignities and offices, both <!--del_lnk--> ecclesiastical and <!--del_lnk--> secular).<p>Lope de Barrientos, went so far as to make sure that he was descended from converted Jews. However, the research&#39;s aim was to establish himself as an old <!--del_lnk--> Christian, with the goal of using this evidence to strengthen his <!--del_lnk--> ideological position: to defend converted Jews, but to attack unconverted Jews.<p>Despite his laudable defense of converted Jews, Barrientos and, in general, the Dominican Order, supported the prohibition of <a href="../../wp/j/Judaism.htm" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> in Castile. His stance was that the Judeo-Spaniards had to convert or leave, and they defended that ideology until <!--del_lnk--> Tom&aacute;s de Torquemada, the grand inquisitor, convinced <!--del_lnk--> Isabella of Castile and <!--del_lnk--> Ferdinand II of Aragon to act. In 1492 the <!--del_lnk--> Alhambra Decree issued, which mandated the expulsion of all Jews from Spain and its territories and possessions by <!--del_lnk--> July 31, <!--del_lnk--> 1492.<div class="thumb tright">

      </div>
      <p>Another campaign Barrientos took up with the king was the prosecution of <!--del_lnk--> Enrique de Villena, whom he charge with witchcraft and necromancy. Villena was a man of letters who wrote on diverse topics, was a translator (most notably of <a href="../../wp/v/Virgil.htm" title="Virgil">Virgil</a>&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Aeneid</i>), a surgeon, and it is possible that he collected books in <a href="../../wp/h/Hebrew_language.htm" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>; such pursuits automatically turned him into a suspected <!--del_lnk--> heretic. Although John II was himself a man of innovative ideas and one of the more cultured people of his age, like many of the era, he distrusted <!--del_lnk--> intellectuals, and, in response to Barrientos&#39; suit, condemned Enrique de Villena to <!--del_lnk--> prison. These events are well attested in unpublished works authored by Barrientos, which still exist in Salamanca such as his <i>Tratado de caso e fortuna</i> (Treatise on Prophesies).<p>After Villena died in jail in 1434, king John&nbsp;II entrusted his library to Barrientos for investigation. Barrientos ordered the majority of the manuscripts burned, but preserved a few.<p>The poet, <!--del_lnk--> Juan de Mena (<!--del_lnk--> 1411-<!--del_lnk--> 1456), a chronicler of King John II&#39;s life, skewered Barrientos for these deeds in his <i>Laberinto de fortuna</i> (&quot;Labyrinth of Fortune&quot;), a 300 <!--del_lnk--> octave poem which explicitly mirrors the form of <a href="../../wp/d/Dante_Alighieri.htm" title="Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri&#39;s</a> <!--del_lnk--> Divine Comedy: <p>

      <p>Some accused Barrientos of being a <!--del_lnk--> savage and of plundering the most valuable books in Villena&#39;s collection in order to <!--del_lnk--> plagiarize them.

      <p>It is difficult to determine if Bishop Barrientos was or was not a supporter of Constable <!--del_lnk--> &Aacute;lvaro de Luna, since, in the words of the <!--del_lnk--> historian, Jos&eacute; Luis Mart&iacute;n: &quot;<i>...entre 1435 y 1440 el sistema de alianzas cambia continuamente. No es posible en una obra de esta naturaleza referirnos a todas ellas ni mencionar los nombres de quienes apoyan a unos u otro en cada momento</i>&quot; (...between <!--del_lnk--> 1435 and <!--del_lnk--> 1440 the system of alliances changed continuously. It is not possible in a work of this nature to refer to all of them nor to even mention the names of those who supported one <!--del_lnk--> faction or another at any given moment). Or as put by historian Paulino Iradiel: &quot;<i>Las luchas civiles se desarrollan de manera contradictoria e intermitente hasta el final del reinado (de Juan II), con alianzas, t&aacute;cticas circunstanciales y cambios de bando que hacen dif&iacute;cil su explicaci&oacute;n&quot;</i> (until the end of the reign of John II, the civil struggles developed in a contradictory and intermittent way, with alliances, circumstantial tactics and changes of <!--del_lnk--> edict that confound explanation).<div class="floatleft"><span><a class="image" href="../../images/198/19832.jpg.htm" title=""><img alt="" height="285" longdesc="/wiki/Image:Obispo-Libro_de_Horas-Juana_I.jpg" src="../../images/198/19832.jpg" width="180" /></a></span></div>
      <p>Nevertheless, given Barrientos&#39; close relationship with the Princes of Arag&oacute;n, it is reasonable to conclude that, at least at first, he was a supporter of the opposition camp. Nevertheless, he was a skillful <!--del_lnk--> politician who knew how to maneuver when political winds shifted in favour of John II, to save himself from misfortune.<p>When <!--del_lnk--> John II of Arag&oacute;n (one of the Princes of Arag&oacute;n) broke the <i>Truce of Majano</i> (1430) and invaded Castile, King <!--del_lnk--> John II of Castile, along with loyal followers including Bishop Barrientos, was forced to take shelter in <!--del_lnk--> Medina del Campo. Although Medina collected tolls from <!--del_lnk--> wayfarers, other than an extensive <!--del_lnk--> moat, it had few military <!--del_lnk--> fortifications, and was consequently not easily defended. Bishop Barrientos offered to act as a mediator with the invading forces and apparently obtained beneficial treatment for both sides. Nevertheless, everything points to the fact that he betrayed his monarch; when John II was celebrating, trusted that he was secure in the heart of Medina del Campo, troops of the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Navarre burst into the villa where he was sheltering and took him prisoner. Although he was soon released, his detention made of him a laughingstock and dishonored the <!--del_lnk--> prestige of the crown. It is possible to read into these events, that Barrientos was one of the instigators of the exile of &Aacute;lvaro de Luna in 1439, preparing the way for the victory of the Princes of Arag&oacute;n.<p>The passage of five years brought a dramatic change of events. Although John II of Aragon had continued to occupy the region, consolidating his annexation, the death of his wife, <!--del_lnk--> Blanca de Navarra, forced him to leave the Castilian campaign and beat a hasty retreat home, since his own crown was in danger from the pretensions of his stepson, <!--del_lnk--> Charles of Viana. The power of the Princes of Arag&oacute;n was sundered, and Barrientos had to react rapidly to the shifting political climate.<p>Barrientos&#39; allegiance dilemma was solved when &Aacute;lvaro de Luna returned from abroad, bringing with him the support of the diocese of <!--del_lnk--> Toledo, which had practically unlimited resources, and which had granted him their patronage at the behest of his half brother, Juan de Cerezuela. Greatly aided by their financial backing and political cachet, he was able to mobilize royalist supporters of the crown to fight for the king. While the two sides geared up for war (ultimately taking place in <!--del_lnk--> Olmedo), Barrientos, his course now clear, traveled to the town of <i>Madrigal de las Altas Torres</i> (northern &Aacute;vila) to convince the heir, prince Henry, to forbear from taking up arms against his own father.<p>In 1445 the Battle of Olmedo took place. The defeat of the Princes of Arag&oacute;n was overwhelming. <!--del_lnk--> Juan de Mena chronicles the moments leading up to the engagement in his well-known poem <i>Coplas de la Panadera</i> (&quot;Songs of the Baker&quot;), in which he describes the warlike ardor of the bishop:<p>

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>After the battle, &Aacute;lvaro de Luna immediately initiated contact with <!--del_lnk--> Charles of Viana, to lend him aid in the civil war then brewing in Navarre between Charles and his stepfather, the king of Aragon. John II of Aragon ultimately defeated his stepson, and, in retaliation for de Luna&#39;s aid, in 1449 he again invaded Castilian territory, this time laying siege to <!--del_lnk--> Cuenca with the help of a the city&#39;s chief warder, the <!--del_lnk--> traitor Diego de Mendoza. Barrientos was by this time the bishop of Cuenca, and fully faithful to John II of Castile. Accordingly, he personally organized the defense of the city. With the help of the locals, they held back the enemy long enough for Constable de Luna to arrive with reinforcements. The invaders were eventually repelled.<p>The demands placed on surrounding cities to support the liberation of Cuenca led to some discord. Some citizens of the city of <!--del_lnk--> Toledo, for instance, were supporters of John II of Aragon and the citizenry in general resented &Aacute;lvaro de Luna&#39;s call for additional <!--del_lnk--> tax collection to support the liberation effort. In a fit of pique, led by the City&#39;s chief warder, Pedro Sarmiento, who had for years sought to expel Toledo&#39;s converted Jews, several high ranking tax collectors of Jewish extraction were executed. After the Navarrese were routed from Cuenca, so too fled the hopes of Toledo&#39;s malcontents, who were left with no options left but to deliver the city to the Constable. Pedro Sarmiento, however, had other plans, leading a mob in <!--del_lnk--> sacking and setting fire to the city&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Jewish quarter. Soon thereafter, in conciliation to &Aacute;lvaro de Luna, Pedro Sarmiento was put on trial by the city for the murders and pillaging committed at his instigation.<p>Lope de Barrientos political star kept on rising. Upon the death of &Aacute;lvaro de Luna in 1453, he was appointed Chancellor of Castile, thus becoming the preeminent political figure of the region under the King. Just a year later, however, John II of Castile died and was succeeded by <!--del_lnk--> Henry IV. Barrientos did not fare well opposite the new king, whom he considered ineffectual and lacking in character. Henry IV was known as <i>the impotent</i> for his unconsummated marriage to <!--del_lnk--> Blanca of Navarre. Barrientos scoffed at Henry for his failure to act in the face of rumors impugning his character, such as the <!--del_lnk--> infidelity of the queen with one of his <!--del_lnk--> confidants, and talk of his homosexuality.<p>Frustrated with the King, and then in his 70s, Barrientos decided to retire from politics and to concentrate on the management of his <!--del_lnk--> diocese in Cuenca; a path he followed until the day of his death in 1469.<p><a id="Writings" name="Writings"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Writings</span></h2>
      <p>Because the majority of Lope de Barrientos&#39; writings are of a theological bent and addressed to issues of his era, they are more the province of scholarly study today, than of general interest. The major portion of his work is addressed to the ideological modernization of the Hispanic Church. He penned a number of treatises on the <!--del_lnk--> Sacraments (all in <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a>), a compendium of moral theology and a Book of laws with which he hoped to contribute to the enrichment of <!--del_lnk--> canonical law.<div class="thumb tright">

       <li><i>Tractado de la divinan&ccedil;a</i> (&quot;Treatise on divination&quot;): Thought to be a manipulated summary of a book from the library of <!--del_lnk--> Enrique de Villena, but nonetheless considered Barrientos&#39; most important work, it is a <!--del_lnk--> didactic sermon with philosophical pretensions that explores theories of philosophy which deny the possibility of divination, contrasting them with the religious sphere where many have been directly affected by divine intervention, as well as by the influence of evil spirits. In order to demonstrate that malignant spirits can influence the lives of men, he explores the <!--del_lnk--> Genesis story of <!--del_lnk--> Eve and the <!--del_lnk--> serpent in the <!--del_lnk--> Garden of Eden. He arrives at the conclusion that the &quot;Artes M&aacute;gicas&quot; (Magical Arts) were birthed by <!--del_lnk--> Cain, who wrote a manuscript he denominates the &quot;Libro <!--del_lnk--> Raziel&quot; (Book of Raziel), from which all magicians and their powers are derived. Although in general Barrientos thought that <i>&quot;casi siempre fr&iacute;volas y de ninguna eficacia&quot;</i> (they are almost always frivolous and ineffectual), he nevertheless concludes that their eradication is necessary.</ul>
      <p><a id="Foundations_and_legacies" name="Foundations_and_legacies"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Foundations and legacies</span></h2>
      <p>John II of Castile bestowed on Barrientos the dominions of <i>Pascualcobo</i> and <i>Serranos de la Torre</i> in <!--del_lnk--> &Aacute;vila, on which he built a number of estates in diverse towns. In 1451 he ordered construction of the castle of <i>Serranos de la Torre</i>, presently known as the <i>Torrej&oacute;n de los Serranos</i>. Like other prominent clergyman, he devoted himself to all manner of benefactions, scholarships and other forms of charitable legacies. Some fringe historians have proposed that Lope de Barrientos founded the University Hospital of Salamanca, but there is little evidence to support this hypothesis. Among his charitable works stand out:<ul>
       <li>The <i>Hospital de la Piedad</i> in Medina del Campo; where Barrientos was born and where he was laid to rest in its <!--del_lnk--> funeral chapel. He <!--del_lnk--> bequeathed funds to the hospital to support its continuing charitable work in aiding the indigent and needy and for support of several doctors and clergymen friendly to his diocese. Also in Medina del Campo, Barrientos directed construction of three <!--del_lnk--> shrines and funded the enlargement of the <i>convento dominico de San Andr&eacute;s</i> (Dominican convent of <!--del_lnk--> San Andr&eacute;s).</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>Outside of his hometown, he emphasizes the construction of the <i>Hospital de San Sebasti&aacute;n</i>, in <!--del_lnk--> Cuenca, and a <!--del_lnk--> hermitage in Salamanca also consecrated to <!--del_lnk--> Saint Sebastian, in the convent of <i>Pe&ntilde;a de Francia</i>. Neither of these foundations survive today.</ul>
