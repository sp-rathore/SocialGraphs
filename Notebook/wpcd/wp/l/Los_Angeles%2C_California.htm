      <p>The Los Angeles coastal area was inhabited by the <!--del_lnk--> Tongva (or Gabriele&ntilde;os), <!--del_lnk--> Chumash, and earlier <!--del_lnk--> Native American nations for thousands of years. The <!--del_lnk--> Spanish arrived in <!--del_lnk--> 1542, when <!--del_lnk--> Juan Cabrillo visited the area. In 1769, <!--del_lnk--> Gaspar de Portol&agrave; led an expedition across southern California with <!--del_lnk--> Franciscan Padres <!--del_lnk--> Jun&iacute;pero Serra and <!--del_lnk--> Juan Crespi.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1771, Father Serra had the <!--del_lnk--> Mission San Gabriel Arc&aacute;ngel built near <!--del_lnk--> Whittier Narrows in today&#39;s nearby <!--del_lnk--> San Gabriel Valley. On <!--del_lnk--> September 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1781, a group of 46 Spanish and Mexican settlers from <!--del_lnk--> Sonora set out from the San Gabriel mission to establish a settlement along the banks of the <!--del_lnk--> Porci&uacute;ncula River (now Los Angeles River). These settlers were of African, Indian, Filipino, and Spanish ancestry, of whom two-thirds were <!--del_lnk--> mulatto. They created a &quot;sub-mission&quot; known as the <!--del_lnk--> Mission Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora Reina de los Angeles.<p>The new <!--del_lnk--> governor of California, Felipe de Neve, recommended to the <!--del_lnk--> viceroy in Mexico that the site be developed into a <i>pueblo</i> (town). The area was duly named &quot;<i>El Pueblo de <!--del_lnk--> Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora la Reina de los Angeles del R&iacute;o de Porci&uacute;ncula</i>,&quot; (&quot;The Town of <!--del_lnk--> Our Lady the Queen of the Angels on the River Porci&uacute;ncula&quot;). It remained a small ranch town for decades, but by 1820 the population had increased to about 650 residents, making it the largest civilian community in Spanish California. Today the outline of the Pueblo is preserved in a historic monument familiarly called <!--del_lnk--> Olvera Street, formerly Wine Street, which was named after <!--del_lnk--> Agustin Olvera.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Mexico&#39;s independence from Spain was achieved in 1821, and the <i>pueblo</i> continued as a part of Mexico. Mexican rule ended during the <!--del_lnk--> Mexican-American War, when Americans took control of the fledgling city after the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Rio San Gabriel in 1847. The <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Cahuenga, signed a few days after the battle, ended hostilities in California, and in the later <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848), Mexico formally ceded <!--del_lnk--> Alta California and other territories to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. Americans solidified control over the city after they flooded into <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a> during the <!--del_lnk--> California Gold Rush and secured the subsequent admission of <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a> into the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. Los Angeles was incorporated as a city in 1850.<p><a href="../../wp/r/Rail_transport.htm" title="Rail transport">Railroads</a> arrived when the <!--del_lnk--> Southern Pacific completed its line to Los Angeles in 1876. <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">Oil</a> was discovered in 1892, and by 1923 Los Angeles was supplying one-quarter of the world&#39;s petroleum. Even more important to the city&#39;s growth was <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a>. In 1913, <!--del_lnk--> William Mulholland completed the <!--del_lnk--> aqueduct that assured the city&#39;s growth. In 1915, the City of Los Angeles began <!--del_lnk--> annexation of dozens of neighboring communities without water supplies of their own. A largely fictionalized account of the <!--del_lnk--> Owens Valley Water War can be found in the 1974 motion picture <i><!--del_lnk--> Chinatown</i>.<p>In the 1920s the <a href="../../wp/c/Cinema_of_the_United_States.htm" title="Cinema of the United States">motion picture</a> and <!--del_lnk--> aviation industries both flocked to Los Angeles and helped to further develop it. Los Angeles is also known to be the home of the <!--del_lnk--> Ross-Loos Medical Group, founded in 1929, which is considered to be the first <!--del_lnk--> Health Maintenance Organization in the United States. The city was the proud host of the <!--del_lnk--> 1932 Summer Olympics and along with it the development of <!--del_lnk--> Baldwin Hills, the original <!--del_lnk--> Olympic Village. This period also saw the arrival of the exiles from the increasing <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">pre-war</a> tension in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>, including such notables as <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Mann, <!--del_lnk--> Fritz Lang, <!--del_lnk--> Bertolt Brecht, <!--del_lnk--> Arnold Schoenberg, and <!--del_lnk--> Lion Feuchtwanger. <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> brought new growth and prosperity to the city, although many of its <!--del_lnk--> Japanese-American residents were transported to <!--del_lnk--> internment camps for the duration of the war. The postwar years saw an even greater boom as <!--del_lnk--> urban sprawl expanded into the <!--del_lnk--> San Fernando Valley.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Watts riots in 1965 showed the nation the deep racial divisions that the city faced. In 1969, Los Angeles was one of two &quot;birthplaces&quot; of the <a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">Internet</a>, as the first ARPANET transmission (the <a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">Internet</a>&#39;s ancestor) was sent from <!--del_lnk--> UCLA to <!--del_lnk--> SRI in <!--del_lnk--> Menlo Park. The <!--del_lnk--> XXIII Olympiad was successfully hosted in Los Angeles in 1984. The city was once again tested by the <!--del_lnk--> 1992 Los Angeles riots and the <!--del_lnk--> 1994 Northridge earthquake and by a city-wide vote on <!--del_lnk--> San Fernando Valley and <!--del_lnk--> Hollywood secession that was defeated in 2002. Now, urban redevelopment and gentrification have been taking place at a furious pace in various parts of the city, most notably <!--del_lnk--> Downtown, which is poised to be the home of many more cultural and entertainment institutions than ever before.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>According to the <!--del_lnk--> United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 498.3 <!--del_lnk--> square miles (1,290.6&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km&sup2;)&mdash;469.1&nbsp;square miles (1,214.9&nbsp;km&sup2;) of it is land and 29.2 square miles (75.7&nbsp;km&sup2;) of it is water. The total area is 5.86% water.<p>The extreme north-south distance is 44 <!--del_lnk--> miles (71&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km), the extreme east-west distance is 29 miles (47&nbsp;km), and the length of the city boundary is 342 miles (550&nbsp;km). The land area is the 9th largest among cities in the Continental United States.<p>The highest point in Los Angeles is Sister Elsie Peak (5,080&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> feet) at the far reaches of the northeastern San Fernando Valley, part of Mt. Lukens. The <!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles River is a largely seasonal river flowing through the city, with headwaters in the San Fernando Valley. Its length is almost entirely lined in <!--del_lnk--> concrete.<p>The Los Angeles area is remarkably rich in native plant species. With its beaches, dunes, wetlands, hills, mountains, and rivers, the area contains a number of important biological communities. The largest area is coastal sage scrub, which covers the hillsides in combustible <!--del_lnk--> chaparral. Native plants include: <!--del_lnk--> California poppy, <!--del_lnk--> matilija poppy, <!--del_lnk--> toyon, <!--del_lnk--> coast live oak, giant wild rye grass, and hundreds of others. Unfortunately, many native species are so rare as to be endangered, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles sunflower.<p>There are many exotic <a href="../../wp/f/Flower.htm" title="Flower">flowers</a> and flowering <a href="../../wp/t/Tree.htm" title="Tree">trees</a> that are blooming year-round, with subtle colors, including the <!--del_lnk--> jacaranda, <!--del_lnk--> hibiscus, <!--del_lnk--> phlox, <!--del_lnk--> bougainvillea, <!--del_lnk--> coral tree blossoms and <!--del_lnk--> bird of paradise. If there were no city here, flower-growing could still flourish as an industry, as it does in <!--del_lnk--> Lompoc. <!--del_lnk--> Wisteria has been known to grow to house-lot size, and in <!--del_lnk--> Descanso Gardens there are forests of <!--del_lnk--> camellia trees. <!--del_lnk--> Orchids require special attention in this <!--del_lnk--> Mediterranean climate.<p><a id="Geology" name="Geology"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Geology</span></h3>
      <p>Like most areas of coastal California, Los Angeles is subject to <a href="../../wp/e/Earthquake.htm" title="Earthquake">earthquakes</a>, due to its proximity to the <!--del_lnk--> San Andreas Fault, as well as to the smaller San Jacinto and Banning faults. The most recent major earthquake was the <!--del_lnk--> 1994 Northridge earthquake, which was centered in the northern San Fernando Valley. Coming less than two years after the <!--del_lnk--> 1992 riots, the Northridge earthquake was an emotional shock to Southern Californians, and caused physical damage totalling billions of dollars. Other major earthquakes in the Los Angeles area include the <!--del_lnk--> 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, the <!--del_lnk--> 1971 Sylmar earthquake, and the <!--del_lnk--> 1933 Long Beach earthquake. Nevertheless, most earthquakes are relatively minor. Many areas in Los Angeles witness one or two minor earthquakes per year, usually inflicting little or no damage. Imperceptible quakes are detected by <!--del_lnk--> seismometers on a daily basis.<p><a id="Cityscape" name="Cityscape"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cityscape</span></h3>

      <p>The city is divided into many neighborhoods, many of which were towns that were annexed by the growing city. There are also several independent cities in and around Los Angeles, but they are popularly grouped with the city of Los Angeles, either due to being completely engulfed as enclaves by Los Angeles, or lying within its immediate vicinity.<p>Generally, the city is divided into the following areas: <!--del_lnk--> Downtown L.A., <!--del_lnk--> East L.A., <!--del_lnk--> South Los Angeles, the <!--del_lnk--> Harbour Area, <!--del_lnk--> Hollywood, <!--del_lnk--> Wilshire, the <!--del_lnk--> Westside (which includes <!--del_lnk--> Westwood, <!--del_lnk--> Brentwood, <!--del_lnk--> West Los Angeles, and <!--del_lnk--> Venice as well as the cities of <!--del_lnk--> Santa Monica, and parts of <!--del_lnk--> West Hollywood and <!--del_lnk--> Beverly Hills), and the <!--del_lnk--> San Fernando and <!--del_lnk--> Crescenta valleys. In the last ten years, <!--del_lnk--> &quot;Eastside&quot; has appeared as a new designation to contrast with the more traditional &quot;Westside&quot; description (though many Angelenos reject the term as a trendy East Coast import).<p>Some well-known communities of Los Angeles include <!--del_lnk--> Venice Beach, the <!--del_lnk--> Downtown Financial District, <!--del_lnk--> Los Feliz, <!--del_lnk--> Silver Lake, <!--del_lnk--> Hollywood, <!--del_lnk--> Hancock Park, <!--del_lnk--> Koreatown, and the extremely affluent areas of <!--del_lnk--> Bel-Air, <!--del_lnk--> Hollywood Hills, <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Palisades, <!--del_lnk--> Holmby Hills, and <!--del_lnk--> Brentwood to name a few.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>
      <p>The city is situated in a <!--del_lnk--> Mediterranean climate or <!--del_lnk--> subtropical zone, experiencing mild, reasonably wet <a href="../../wp/w/Winter.htm" title="Winter">winters</a> and warm to hot, mildly humid <a href="../../wp/s/Summer.htm" title="Summer">summers</a>. Generally the weather is dry in all seasons, but can be relatively cold in the <a href="../../wp/w/Winter.htm" title="Winter">winter</a>. Breezes from the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> tend to keep the beach communities of the Los Angeles area cooler in summer and warmer in winter than those further inland, and summer temperatures can sometimes vary by as much as 25 &deg;F warmer in the inland communities compared to that of the coastal communities. The coastal communities of Los Angeles are commonly affected by a phenomenon known as a &#39;marine layer&#39;, a dense cloud cover caused by the proximity of the ocean, that helps keep the temperatures cooler throughout the year. Temperatures in the summer can get well over 90&nbsp;&deg;F (32&nbsp;&deg;C), but average summer daytime highs are 85&nbsp;&deg;F (29&nbsp;&deg;C), with overnight lows of 66&nbsp;&deg;F (18&nbsp;&deg;C). Winter daytime high temperatures will get up to around 65&nbsp;&deg;F (21&nbsp;&deg;C), on average, with overnight lows of 45&nbsp;&deg;F (8&nbsp;&deg;C) and during this season rain is common. The median temperature in January is 58.3&nbsp;&deg;F (14.6&nbsp;&deg;C) and 74.3&nbsp;&deg;F (23.5&nbsp;&deg;C) in July. The highest temperature recorded within city borders was 119.0&nbsp;&deg;F (48.33&nbsp;&deg;C) in <!--del_lnk--> Woodland Hills on <!--del_lnk--> July 22, <!--del_lnk--> 2006; the lowest temperature recorded was 18.0&nbsp;&deg;F (&minus;7.8&nbsp;&deg;C) in 1989, in <!--del_lnk--> Canoga Park. The highest temperature ever recorded for Downtown Los Angeles was 112.0&nbsp;&deg;F (44.4&nbsp;&deg;C) on <!--del_lnk--> June 26, <!--del_lnk--> 1990, and the lowest temperature ever recorded was 28.0&nbsp;&deg;F (&minus;2.2&nbsp;&deg;C) on <!--del_lnk--> January 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1949. Rain occurs mainly in the winter and spring months (February being the wettest month) with great variations in storm severity year by year. Los Angeles averages 15 <!--del_lnk--> inches (381&nbsp;mm) of precipitation per year. It rarely <a href="../../wp/s/Snow.htm" title="Snow">snows</a> in the city basin, but the mountains slopes within city limits typically receive snow every year. With weather permitting, it is possible to snow ski and surf on the same day in the Los Angeles area.<table class="wikitable">

      <p>Due to the city&#39;s geography making it susceptible to <!--del_lnk--> atmospheric inversion as well as the population&#39;s heavy reliance on <a href="../../wp/a/Automobile.htm" title="Automobile">automobiles</a> as a major form of transportation, the city suffers from <!--del_lnk--> air pollution in the form of <a href="../../wp/s/Smog.htm" title="Smog">smog</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley hold in the fumes from automobiles, <!--del_lnk--> diesel <!--del_lnk--> trucks, <!--del_lnk--> shipping, and <!--del_lnk--> locomotive engines, as well as manufacturing and other sources. In addition, the <!--del_lnk--> groundwater is increasingly threatened by <!--del_lnk--> MTBE from <!--del_lnk--> gas stations and <!--del_lnk--> perchlorate from <!--del_lnk--> rocket fuel. Some consider <!--del_lnk--> urban sprawl to be a result of the city&#39;s transportation system. Unlike other large cities that rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles only gets 15 inches (380&nbsp;mm) of rain each year, so the smog is able to accumulate over multiple consecutive days. This has brought much attention from the state of California to the need for low emissions vehicles. As a result, pollution levels have dropped markedly in recent decades. The number of Stage 1 smog alerts has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium. Despite this remarkable success, the 2004 annual report of the <!--del_lnk--> American Lung Association ranks the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution, year-round particle pollution, and ozone pollution. Smog from the basin is pushed towards the mountains, where the pollutants harm trees. However, even more aggressive steps are now being taken to improve the air quality in the years to come. <a id="Government" name="Government"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Government</span></h2>

      <p>The city is governed by a <!--del_lnk--> mayor-council system. The current <!--del_lnk--> mayor is <!--del_lnk--> Antonio Villaraigosa. There are 15 <!--del_lnk--> city council districts. Other elected city officials include the City Attorney, <!--del_lnk--> Rocky Delgadillo, and the City Controller, <!--del_lnk--> Laura Chick. The city attorney prosecutes misdemeanors within the city limits. The district attorney, elected by county voters, prosecutes misdemeanors in unincorporated areas and in 78 of the 88 cities in the county, as well as felonies throughout the county.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) polices the city of Los Angeles, but the city also maintains three specialized police agencies; The Office of Public Safety, within the General Services Department (which is responsible for security and law enforcement services at city facilities throughout the city, including City Hall, city parks and libraries, the Los Angeles Zoo, and the Convention Center), the Port Police, within the Harbour Department (which is responsible for land, air and sea law enforcement services at the Port of Los Angeles), and the Airport Police, within the Los Angeles World Airports Department (which is responsible for law enforcement services at all four city-owned airports, including <!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), <!--del_lnk--> Ontario International Airport (ONT), <!--del_lnk--> Palmdale Regional Airport (PMD), and <!--del_lnk--> Van Nuys Airport (VNY), the largest general aviation airport in the country).<p>The LAPL, <!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles Public Library System and <!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) are among the largest such organizations in the country. The LAUSD is the second largest school district in the United States; only the <!--del_lnk--> New York City Department of Education is larger. The <!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles Department of Water and Power provides service to city residents and <a href="../../wp/b/Business.htm" title="Business">businesses</a>.<p>The city government has been perceived as inefficient and ineffective by residents of some areas, which led to an unsuccessful secession movement by the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood in 2002. The campaign to defeat secession was led by then Mayor <!--del_lnk--> James Hahn. The most often raised complaint is that city administration in Downtown gives priority to high-density neighborhoods like Mid-City and Downtown at the expense of its far-flung suburban neighborhoods.<p><a id="Neighborhood_councils" name="Neighborhood_councils"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Neighbourhood councils</span></h3>
      <p>To promote public participation in government and make government more responsive to local needs, voters created <!--del_lnk--> neighbourhood councils in the Charter Reform of 1999. The councils were first proposed by City Council member <!--del_lnk--> Joel Wachs in 1996 and were hotly contested for a number of years. Indeed, they are still hotly contested ten years later.<p>The councils cover districts which are not necessarily identical to the traditional neighborhoods of Los Angeles, the borders of which often reflect those of cities that were annexed to Los Angeles.<p>86 neighbourhood councils are currently certified and all &quot;<!--del_lnk--> stakeholders&quot; &ndash; meaning anyone who lives, works or owns property in a neighbourhood &ndash; may vote for council members. Participation in NC elections has, for the most part, been proportionally as narrow as in city, state and federal elections.<p>Though the councils are strictly advisory, and have little actual power, they are still official government bodies and so must abide by California&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Brown Act, which strictly governs the meetings of deliberative assemblies. These and other regulatory requirements have proven frustrating for some activists unaccustomed to bureaucratic procedures. For those with organizing experience, or the administrative ability to overcome regulatory hurdles, the councils have been effective advocates for community interests.<p>The first notable achievement of the neighbourhood councils, collectively, was their organized opposition in March 2004 to an 18% increase in water rates by the Department of Water and Power (a municipal monopoly), which led the City Council to approve only a limited increase pending independent review. More recently, the councils petitioned the City Council in summer, 2006 to allow them to independently introduce ideas for legislative action, but the City Council voted to give the idea further study (this, despite 18 months of committee hearings).<p>As Mayor, <!--del_lnk--> James Hahn provided each council with $50,000 for any project of their choice and an additional $100,000 for street improvements in their neighbourhood. These financial commitments have been maintained by current Mayor <!--del_lnk--> Antonio Villaraigosa.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>

For example, Los Angeles charges a gross receipts tax based on a percentage of business revenue, while most neighboring cities charge only small flat fees. The companies below clearly benefit from their proximity to Los Angeles, while at the same time avoiding the city&#39;s taxes (and other problems). Some of the major companies headquartered in the cities of Los Angeles county are <!--del_lnk--> Shakey&#39;s Pizza (<!--del_lnk--> Alhambra), <!--del_lnk--> Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (<!--del_lnk--> Beverly Hills), <!--del_lnk--> City National Bank (Beverly Hills), <!--del_lnk--> Hilton Hotels (Beverly Hills), <!--del_lnk--> DiC Entertainment (<!--del_lnk--> Burbank), <!--del_lnk--> The Walt Disney Company (<!--del_lnk--> Fortune 500 &ndash; Burbank), <!--del_lnk--> Warner Bros.

The L.A. area is also home to the U.S. headquarters of all but two of the major Asian automobile manufacturers (<!--del_lnk--> Nissan North America is in the process of relocating its headquarters from <!--del_lnk--> Gardena to the <a href="../../wp/n/Nashville%252C_Tennessee.htm" title="Nashville, Tennessee">Nashville</a> area, and <!--del_lnk--> Subaru&#39;s U.S. operations are based in <!--del_lnk--> Cherry Hill, New Jersey). Further, virtually all the world&#39;s automakers have design and/or tech centers in the L.A. region.<p>There are many other well-known companies with headquarters located in the County of Los Angeles or the greater Los Angeles area, but they are far beyond the City of Los Angeles (and the scope of this article).<p>Downtown Los Angeles is also the home of the Los Angeles Convention Centre which hosts many popular events including the annual LA Auto Show in January.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

The <!--del_lnk--> average household size was 2.83 and the average family size 3.56.<p>The age distribution was: 26.6% under 18, 11.1% from 18 to 24, 34.1% from 25 to 44, 18.6% from 45 to 64, and 9.7% who were 65 or older. The median age was 32. For every 100 females there were 99.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 97.5 males.<p>The median income for a household was $36,687, and for a family was $39,942. Males had a median income of $31,880, females $30,197. The <!--del_lnk--> per capita income was $20,671. 22.1% of the population and 18.3% of families were below the <!--del_lnk--> poverty line. 30.3% of those under the age of 18 and 12.6% of those aged 65 or older were below the poverty line.<p>The city&#39;s gross <!--del_lnk--> population density statistic is deceptively low, because of the sparsely-inhabited <!--del_lnk--> Santa Monica Mountains which separate the <!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles Basin from the <!--del_lnk--> San Fernando Valley. South of the <!--del_lnk--> Santa Monica Mountains, the population density throughout most of the city is much greater than 7,876.8 people per square mile (3,041.3/km&sup2;). Los Angeles has some of the most densely-populated urban land in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Hollywood Boulevard, <!--del_lnk--> Fairfax Avenue and Vernon Avenue provides a good example. The land area, 50 square miles (130&nbsp;km&sup2;), is only slightly larger than <a href="../../wp/s/San_Francisco%252C_California.htm" title="San Francisco, California">San Francisco</a> but, according to U.S. Census Bureau data, this region housed about 30% more people in 2000 (more than 1,000,000).<p>It is also of interest to note that the post-1950 population increase did not occur exclusively in <!--del_lnk--> suburban or peripheral locations. The increase in the central area population&mdash;while many other American cities have experienced central area population declines&mdash;is due in part to Los Angeles&#39; large <!--del_lnk--> immigrant population.<p>In the period from 1920 to 1960, <!--del_lnk--> African Americans from the <!--del_lnk--> Southeast U.S. arrived in Los Angeles and its population grew 15 times. Since 1990, the African American population dropped in half as its <!--del_lnk--> middle class relocated to the suburbs, notably the <!--del_lnk--> Antelope Valley and <!--del_lnk--> Inland Empire and Latinos have moved into the once predominantly African American district of <!--del_lnk--> South Los Angeles. African Americans still remain predominant in some portions of the city, including <!--del_lnk--> Crenshaw District, <!--del_lnk--> Leimert Park, and <!--del_lnk--> Baldwin Hills (as well as neighboring <!--del_lnk--> View Park-Windsor Hills and <!--del_lnk--> Ladera Heights) which is considered to be one of the wealthiest majority-black neighborhoods in the United States. Los Angeles still has the largest African-American community of any city in western United States. Also many other websites say that African Americans make up about 25% of L.A.<p><a id="National_origins" name="National_origins"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">National origins</span></h3>

      <p>Los Angeles has one of the largest freeway systems in the world, with 27 intertwining freeways handling millions of commuters as they journey a daily collective migration of about 100 million miles (160 million km). Los Angeles is the most car-populated metropolis in the world with 1.8 registered automobiles per licensed driver.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and other agencies operate an extensive system of <!--del_lnk--> bus lines, as well as <!--del_lnk--> subway and <!--del_lnk--> light rail lines. True to reputation, Los Angeles&#39; rail system does not have high ridership, averaging 276,900 trips a day, 0.4% of the 65 million taken daily. This compares with ridership of 699,599 trips for Washington <a href="../../wp/w/Washington_Metro.htm" title="Washington Metro">Metrorail</a>&#39;s subway, 664,700 trips for Boston&#39;s subway <!--del_lnk--> T, the city of Chicago&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> L with 644,200, and New York City&#39;s 6.0 million average daily weekday trips taken. Adding in trips taken by bus raises this number to about 1.7 million. The rail system includes the <!--del_lnk--> Red Line subway, the <!--del_lnk--> Gold, <!--del_lnk--> Blue, and <!--del_lnk--> Green light rail lines, and the <!--del_lnk--> Orange Line, a <!--del_lnk--> bus rapid transit line. The special red <!--del_lnk--> Metro Rapid buses have also been highly touted as a prime example of a successful bus transit program since these buses operate like a rail line and run through the best-known parts of the city. However, during rush hour, they are apt to get mired in gridlock along with other vehicles, and the traffic signal holding or changing capability is of little help. Currently under construction is an eastside extension of the Gold Line. In the works is a new rail line called the <!--del_lnk--> Expo Line. Momentum is slowly building to extend the subway under Wilshire Boulevard all the way to the ocean in Santa Monica, extending the city&#39;s public transportation system further. <!--del_lnk--> Rail passenger service is provided by <a href="../../wp/a/Amtrak.htm" title="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Metrolink from historic <!--del_lnk--> Union Station. Rail shipping is handled by <!--del_lnk--> Union Pacific Railroad and <!--del_lnk--> BNSF Railway.<p>The Los Angeles metropolitan area is served by more airports than any major city in the world, with 5 major commercial airports, and many more general-aviation airports. The main Los Angeles airport is <!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles International Airport (<!--del_lnk--> IATA: <b>LAX</b>,&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ICAO: <b>KLAX</b>), the fifth busiest commercial airport in the world. <!--del_lnk--> LAX handled 55 million passengers and 2 million tons of cargo in 2003. Other major commercial airports include <!--del_lnk--> Ontario International Airport (<!--del_lnk--> IATA: <b>ONT</b>,&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ICAO: <b>KONT</b>), <!--del_lnk--> Bob Hope Airport (<!--del_lnk--> IATA: <b>BUR</b>,&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ICAO: <b>KBUR</b>), formerly known as <i>Burbank Airport</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Long Beach Municipal Airport (<!--del_lnk--> IATA: <b>LGB</b>,&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ICAO: <b>KLGB</b>), and <!--del_lnk--> John Wayne Airport (<!--del_lnk--> IATA: <b>SNA</b>,&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ICAO: <b>KSNA</b>) of Orange County. Los Angeles also has the world&#39;s busiest general-aviation airport, <!--del_lnk--> Van Nuys Airport (<!--del_lnk--> IATA: <b>VNY</b>,&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ICAO: <b>KVNY</b>).<p>The sea ports of the <!--del_lnk--> Port of Los Angeles and <!--del_lnk--> Port of Long Beach together make up the <i>Los Angeles &ndash; Long Beach Harbour</i>, the busiest and overall third-largest <!--del_lnk--> container shipping port in the world. There are also smaller, non-industrial harbors along L.A.&#39;s coastline. Most of these contain <!--del_lnk--> sailboats and <!--del_lnk--> yachts, like <!--del_lnk--> Redondo Beach and <!--del_lnk--> Marina del Rey.<p><a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h2>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles Unified School District serves the city of Los Angeles, as well as several surrounding communities. It is the second-largest school district in the United States, with over 700,000 students. After <!--del_lnk--> Proposition 13 in 1978, urban school districts had considerable trouble with funding and LAUSD became known for its underfunded, overcrowded and poorly maintained campuses. Wealthy and upper-middle-class parents placed their children in elite private schools, while middle-class families fled into suburban school districts beyond LAUSD boundaries. Since then, the LAUSD has embarked on an aggressive school construction program to relieve overcrowding.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles Public Library system operates 72 public libraries in the city.<p><a id="Sister_cities" name="Sister_cities"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sister cities</span></h2>
