      <p><b>Literature</b> is literally &quot;acquaintance with letters&quot; as in the first sense given in the <!--del_lnk--> Oxford English Dictionary (from the <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>littera</i> meaning &quot;an individual written character (<!--del_lnk--> letter)&quot;). The term has generally come to identify a collection of <!--del_lnk--> texts or <!--del_lnk--> work of art, which in Western culture are mainly <!--del_lnk--> prose, both <a href="../../wp/f/Fiction.htm" title="Fiction">fiction</a> and <!--del_lnk--> non-fiction, <a href="../../wp/d/Drama.htm" title="Drama">drama</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Poetry.htm" title="Poetry">poetry</a>. In much, if not all of the world, texts can be <!--del_lnk--> oral as well, and include such <!--del_lnk--> genres as <!--del_lnk--> epic, <!--del_lnk--> legend, <a href="../../wp/m/Mythology.htm" title="Mythology">myth</a>, <!--del_lnk--> ballad, other forms of oral poetry, and the <!--del_lnk--> folktale.<p>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Nations can have literatures, as can <a href="../../wp/c/Corporation.htm" title="Corporation">corporations</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosophical schools</a> or <!--del_lnk--> historical periods. Popular belief commonly holds that the literature of a <!--del_lnk--> nation, for example, comprises the collection of texts which make it a whole nation. The <!--del_lnk--> Hebrew Bible, <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Persian</a> <i><!--del_lnk--> Shahnama</i>, the <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">Indian</a> <i><a href="../../wp/m/Mahabharata.htm" title="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a></i>, <i><a href="../../wp/r/Ramayana.htm" title="Ramayana">Ramayana</a></i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Thirukural</i>, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Iliad</i> and the <i><a href="../../wp/o/Odyssey.htm" title="Odyssey">Odyssey</a></i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Beowulf</i>, and the <!--del_lnk--> Constitution of the United States, all fall within this definition of a kind of literature.<p>More generally, one can equate a literature with a collection of stories, poems, and plays that revolve around a particular topic. In this case, the stories, poems and plays may or may not have <a href="../../wp/n/Nationalism.htm" title="Nationalism">nationalistic</a> implications. The <!--del_lnk--> Western Canon forms one such literature.<p>Classifying a specific item as part of a literature (whether as <!--del_lnk--> American literature, advertising literature, <!--del_lnk--> gay and lesbian literature or <!--del_lnk--> Roman literature) can involve severe difficulties. To some people, the term &quot;literature&quot; can apply broadly to any symbolic record which can include images and <a href="../../wp/s/Sculpture.htm" title="Sculpture">sculptures</a>, as well as letters. To others, a literature must only include examples of text composed of letters, or other narrowly defined examples of symbolic written language (<!--del_lnk--> Egyptian hieroglyphs, for example). Even more conservative interpreters of the concept would demand that the text have a physical form, usually on paper or some other portable form, to the exclusion of <!--del_lnk--> inscriptions or <!--del_lnk--> digital media.<p>Furthermore, people may perceive a difference between &quot;literature&quot; and some popular forms of written work. The terms &quot;<!--del_lnk--> literary fiction&quot; and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> literary merit&quot; often serve to distinguish between individual works. For example, almost all literate people perceive the works of <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_Dickens.htm" title="Charles Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> as &quot;literature&quot;, whereas some tend to look down on the works of <!--del_lnk--> Jeffrey Archer as unworthy of inclusion under the general heading of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> English literature&quot;. Critics may exclude works from the classification &quot;literature&quot;, for example, on the grounds of a poor standard of <!--del_lnk--> grammar and <!--del_lnk--> syntax, of an <!--del_lnk--> unbelievable or disjointed <!--del_lnk--> story-line, or of inconsistent or unconvincing <!--del_lnk--> characters. <!--del_lnk--> Genre fiction (for example: romance, crime, or science fiction) may also become excluded from consideration as &quot;literature&quot;.<p>Frequently, the texts that make up literature crossed over these boundaries. <a href="../../wp/d/Drawing.htm" title="Drawing">Illustrated</a> stories, <!--del_lnk--> hypertexts, <!--del_lnk--> cave paintings and inscribed <!--del_lnk--> monuments have all at one time or another pushed the boundaries of &quot;literature&quot;.<p>Different historical periods have emphasized various characteristics of literature. Early works often had an overt or covert religious or didactic purpose. Moralizing or prescriptive literature stems from such sources. The exotic nature of <!--del_lnk--> romance flourished from the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> onwards, whereas the <!--del_lnk--> Age of Reason manufactured nationalistic epics and philosophical <!--del_lnk--> tracts. <a href="../../wp/r/Romanticism.htm" title="Romanticism">Romanticism</a> emphasized the popular folk literature and emotive involvement, but gave way in the 19th-century West to a phase of so-called <!--del_lnk--> realism and <!--del_lnk--> naturalism, investigations into what is real. The 20th century brought demands for <!--del_lnk--> symbolism or <a href="../../wp/p/Psychology.htm" title="Psychology">psychological</a> insight in the delineation and development of character.<p><a id="Forms_of_literature" name="Forms_of_literature"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Forms of literature</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Poetry" name="Poetry"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Poetry</span></h3>
      <p>A <a href="../../wp/p/Poetry.htm" title="Poem">poem</a> is a composition usually written in <!--del_lnk--> verse. Poems rely heavily on <!--del_lnk--> imagery, precise word choice, and <!--del_lnk--> metaphor; they may take the form of measures consisting of patterns of stresses (<!--del_lnk--> metric feet) or of patterns of different-length syllables (as in classical <!--del_lnk--> prosody); and they may or may not utilize <!--del_lnk--> rhyme. One cannot readily characterize <a href="../../wp/p/Poetry.htm" title="Poetry">poetry</a> precisely. Typically though, poetry as a form of literature makes some significant use of the <i>formal</i> properties of the words it uses &mdash; the properties attached to the <a href="../../wp/w/Writing.htm" title="Writing">written</a> or <!--del_lnk--> spoken form of the words, rather than to their meaning. Metre depends on <!--del_lnk--> syllables and on <!--del_lnk--> rhythms of speech; rhyme and <!--del_lnk--> alliteration depend on words that have similar pronunciation. Some recent poets, such as <a href="../../wp/e/E._E._Cummings.htm" title="E. E. Cummings">E. E. Cummings</a>, made extensive use of words&#39; <!--del_lnk--> visual form.<p>Poetry perhaps pre-dates other forms of literature: early known examples include the <!--del_lnk--> Sumerian <i><a href="../../wp/e/Epic_of_Gilgamesh.htm" title="Epic of Gilgamesh">Epic of Gilgamesh</a></i> (dated from around <!--del_lnk--> 2700 B.C.), parts of the <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">Bible</a>, the surviving works of <a href="../../wp/h/Homer.htm" title="Homer">Homer</a> (the <i><!--del_lnk--> Iliad</i> and the <i><a href="../../wp/o/Odyssey.htm" title="Odyssey">Odyssey</a></i>), and the <!--del_lnk--> Indian epics <i><a href="../../wp/r/Ramayana.htm" title="Ramayana">Ramayana</a></i> and <i><a href="../../wp/m/Mahabharata.htm" title="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a></i>. In cultures based primarily on oral traditions the formal characteristics of poetry often have a <!--del_lnk--> mnemonic function, and important texts: legal, <a href="../../wp/g/Genealogy.htm" title="Genealogy">genealogical</a> or moral, for example, may appear first in verse form.<p>Much poetry uses specific forms: the <!--del_lnk--> haiku, the <!--del_lnk--> limerick, or the <!--del_lnk--> sonnet, for example. A haiku must have seventeen syllables, distributed over three lines in groups of five, seven, and five, and should have an image of a season and something to do with <a href="../../wp/n/Nature.htm" title="Nature">nature</a>. A limerick has five lines, with a <!--del_lnk--> rhyme scheme of AABBA, and line lengths of 3,3,2,2,3 stressed syllables. It traditionally has a less reverent attitude towards nature.<p>Language and tradition dictate some poetic norms: Persian poetry always rhymes, Greek poetry rarely rhymes, Italian or French poetry often does, English and German can go either way (although modern non-rhyming poetry often, perhaps unfairly, has a more &quot;serious&quot; aura). Perhaps the most <!--del_lnk--> paradigmatic style of English poetry, blank verse, as exemplified in works by <a href="../../wp/w/William_Shakespeare.htm" title="William Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> and by <a href="../../wp/j/John_Milton.htm" title="John Milton">Milton</a>, consists of unrhymed <!--del_lnk--> iambic pentameters. Some languages prefer longer lines; some shorter ones. Some of these conventions result from the ease of fitting a specific language&#39;s vocabulary and grammar into certain structures, rather than into others; for example, some languages contain more rhyming words than others, or typically have longer words. Other structural conventions come about as the result of historical accidents, where many speakers of a language associate good poetry with a verse form preferred by a particular skilled or popular poet.<p>Works for theatre (see below) traditionally took verse form. This has now become rare outside <a href="../../wp/o/Opera.htm" title="Opera">opera</a> and <!--del_lnk--> musicals, although many would argue that the language of drama remains intrinsically poetic.<p>In recent years, <!--del_lnk--> digital poetry has arisen that takes advantage of the artistic, publishing, and synthetic qualities of digital media.<p><a id="Drama" name="Drama"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Drama</span></h3>
      <p>A <!--del_lnk--> play or <a href="../../wp/d/Drama.htm" title="Drama">drama</a> offers another classical literary form that has continued to evolve over the years. It generally comprises chiefly <!--del_lnk--> dialogue between <!--del_lnk--> characters, and usually aims at dramatic / theatrical <!--del_lnk--> performance (see <a href="../../wp/t/Theatre.htm" title="Theatre">theatre</a>) rather than at reading. During the <a href="../../wp/1/18th_century.htm" title="18th century">eighteenth</a> and <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">nineteenth centuries</a>, <a href="../../wp/o/Opera.htm" title="Opera">opera</a> developed as a combination of poetry, drama, and <a href="../../wp/m/Music.htm" title="Music">music</a>. Nearly all drama took verse form until comparatively recently.<p><!--del_lnk--> Greek drama exemplifies the earliest form of drama of which we have substantial knowledge. <!--del_lnk--> Tragedy, as a dramatic <!--del_lnk--> genre, developed as a performance associated with <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religious</a> and civic <!--del_lnk--> festivals, typically enacting or developing upon well-known <a href="../../wp/h/History.htm" title="History">historical</a> or <a href="../../wp/m/Mythology.htm" title="Mythology">mythological</a> themes. Tragedies generally presented very serious <!--del_lnk--> Theme.<p>With the advent of newer technologies, scripts written for non-stage media have been added to this form. <!--del_lnk--> War of the Worlds (radio) in 1938 saw the advent of literature written for radio broadcast, and many works of Drama have been adapted for film or television. Conversly, television, film, and radio literature have been adapted to printed or electronic media.<p><a id="Essays" name="Essays"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Essays</span></h3>
      <p>An <!--del_lnk--> essay consists of a discussion of a topic from an author&#39;s personal point of view, exemplified by works by <!--del_lnk--> Francis Bacon or by <!--del_lnk--> Charles Lamb.<p>&#39;Essay&#39; in English derives from the French &#39;essai&#39;, meaning &#39;attempt&#39;. Thus one can find open-ended, provocative and/or inconclusive essays. The term &quot;essays&quot; first applied to the self-reflective musings of <!--del_lnk--> Michel de Montaigne, and even today he has a reputation as the father of this literary form.<p>Genres related to the essay may include:<ul>
       <li>the <!--del_lnk--> memoir, telling the story of an author&#39;s life from the author&#39;s personal point of view<li>the <!--del_lnk--> epistle: usually a formal, didactic, or elegant <!--del_lnk--> letter.<li>the <!--del_lnk--> blog, an informal short rant about a particular topic or topics, usually opinion</ul>
      <p><a id="Prose_fiction" name="Prose_fiction"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Prose fiction</span></h3>
      <p><b><!--del_lnk--> Prose</b> consists of writing that does not adhere to any particular formal structures (other than simple <!--del_lnk--> grammar); &quot;non-poetic writing,&quot; writing, perhaps. The term sometimes appears pejoratively, but prosaic writing simply says something without necessarily trying to say it in a <!--del_lnk--> beautiful way, or using beautiful words. Prose writing can of course take beautiful form; but less by virtue of the formal features of words (rhymes, alliteration, meter) but rather by style, placement, or inclusion of graphics. But one need not mark the distinction precisely, and perhaps cannot do so. Note the classifications:<ul>
       <li>&quot;<!--del_lnk--> prose poetry&quot;, which attempts to convey the aesthetic richness typical of poetry using only prose<li>&quot;<!--del_lnk--> free verse&quot;, or poetry not adhering to any of the structures of one or another formal poetic style</ul>
      <p>Narrative <a href="../../wp/f/Fiction.htm" title="Fiction">fiction</a> (<!--del_lnk--> narrative prose) generally favours prose for the writing of <!--del_lnk--> novels, short stories, graphic novels, and the like. Singular examples of these exist throughout history, but they did not develop into systematic and discrete literary forms until relatively recent centuries. Length often serves to categorize works of prose fiction. Although limits remain somewhat arbitrary, modern <a href="../../wp/p/Publishing.htm" title="Publishing">publishing</a> conventions dictate the following:<ul>
       <li>A <!--del_lnk--> Flash fiction is generally defined as a piece of prose under a thousand words.<li>A <!--del_lnk--> short story comprises prose writing of less than 10,000 to 20,000 words, but typically more than 500 words, which may or may not have a narrative arc.<li>A story containing between 20,000 and 50,000 words falls into the <!--del_lnk--> novella category.<li>A work of fiction containing more than 50,000 words falls squarely into the realm of the <a href="../../wp/n/Novel.htm" title="Novel">novel</a>.</ul>
      <p>A <a href="../../wp/n/Novel.htm" title="Novel">novel</a> consists simply of a long story written in prose, yet the form developed comparatively recently. <!--del_lnk--> Icelandic prose <!--del_lnk--> sagas dating from about the 11th century bridge the gap between traditional national <!--del_lnk--> verse epics and the modern <!--del_lnk--> psychological novel. In mainland Europe, the <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spaniard</a> <a href="../../wp/m/Miguel_de_Cervantes.htm" title="Miguel de Cervantes">Cervantes</a> wrote perhaps the first influential novel: <i><!--del_lnk--> Don Quixote</i>, published in <!--del_lnk--> 1600. Earlier collections of <!--del_lnk--> tales, such as <!--del_lnk--> Boccaccio&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Decameron</i> and <!--del_lnk--> Chaucer&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> The Canterbury Tales</i>, have comparable forms and would classify as novels if written today. Earlier works written in Asia resemble even more strongly the novel as we now think of it &mdash; for example, works such as the <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">Chinese</a> <i><!--del_lnk--> Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i> and the <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japanese</a> <i><!--del_lnk--> Tale of Genji</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Lady Murasaki. Compare too <!--del_lnk--> The Book of One Thousand and One Nights.<p>Early novels in Europe did not, at the time, count as significant literature, perhaps because &quot;mere&quot; prose writing seemed easy and unimportant. It has become clear, however, that prose writing can provide aesthetic pleasure without adhering to poetic forms. Additionally, the freedom authors gain in not having to concern themselves with verse structure translates often into a more complex <!--del_lnk--> plot or into one richer in precise detail than one typically finds even in narrative poetry. This freedom also allows an author to experiment with many different literary and presentation styles &mdash; including poetry&mdash; in the scope of a single novel.<p>See <!--del_lnk--> Ian Watt&#39;s <i>The Rise of the Novel</i>.
