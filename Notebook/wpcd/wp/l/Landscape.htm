      <p>A <b>landscape</b> comprises the visible features of an area of land, including physical elements such as <a href="../../wp/l/Landform.htm" title="Landform">landforms</a>, living elements of flora and fauna, abstract elements such as lighting and weather conditions, and human elements, for instance human activity or the <!--del_lnk--> built environment. Landscape can also mean the objects around you in a building. Example; &quot;I went to the mall, because I heard that the landscape there is wonderful&quot; or &quot;I love the landscape of this house&quot;.<p><a id="Etymology" name="Etymology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Etymology</span></h2>
      <p>The word landscape is from the <a href="../../wp/d/Dutch_language.htm" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a> word <i>landschap</i>, from <i>land</i> (land, patch, area) and the suffix <i>-schap</i>, corresponding to the <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> suffix &quot;-ship&quot;. <i>Landscape</i>, first recorded in 1598, was borrowed as a painters&#39; term from Dutch during the 16th century, when Dutch artists were on the verge of becoming masters of the landscape genre. The Dutch word <i>landschap</i> had earlier meant simply &ldquo;region, tract of land&rdquo; but had acquired the artistic sense, which it brought over into English, of &ldquo;a picture depicting scenery on land.&rdquo; 34 years pass after the first recorded use of landscape in English before the word is used of a view or vista of natural scenery. This delay suggests that people were first introduced to landscapes in paintings and then saw landscapes in real life. A landscape is wide space in the world that show what is around in the world.<p><a id="Uses" name="Uses"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Uses</span></h2>
