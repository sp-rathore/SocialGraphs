      <p><b>Las Vegas</b> (often informally abbreviated to &quot;Vegas&quot;) is the most populous city in the state of <!--del_lnk--> Nevada, <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, the seat of <!--del_lnk--> Clark County, and an internationally known <!--del_lnk--> vacation, <!--del_lnk--> shopping, <!--del_lnk--> entertainment, and <!--del_lnk--> gambling destination.

      <p>Las Vegas (English: &quot;The Meadows&quot; or &quot;The Grasslands&quot;) was given its name by <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spaniards</a> in the <!--del_lnk--> Antonio Armijo party, who used the water in the area while heading north and west along the <!--del_lnk--> Old Spanish Trail from <!--del_lnk--> Texas. In the <!--del_lnk--> 1800s, areas of the Las Vegas <!--del_lnk--> Valley contained <!--del_lnk--> artesian wells that supported extensive green areas or <i><!--del_lnk--> Meadows</i> (Vega in <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_language.htm" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>), hence the name <i>Las Vegas</i>. <!--del_lnk--> John C. Fr&eacute;mont traveled into the Las Vegas Valley on <!--del_lnk--> May 3, <!--del_lnk--> 1844, while it was still part of <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. He was a leader of a group of <!--del_lnk--> scientists, <!--del_lnk--> scouts and observers for the <!--del_lnk--> United States Army Corps of Engineers. On <!--del_lnk--> May 10, <!--del_lnk--> 1855, following <!--del_lnk--> annexation by the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Brigham Young assigned 30 <a href="../../wp/m/Mormon.htm" title="Mormon">Mormon</a> <!--del_lnk--> missionaries led by <!--del_lnk--> William Bringhurst to the area to convert the <!--del_lnk--> Paiute <!--del_lnk--> Indian population. A <!--del_lnk--> fort was built near the current downtown area, serving as a stopover for travelers along the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Mormon Corridor&quot; between <a href="../../wp/s/Salt_Lake_City%252C_Utah.htm" title="Salt Lake City, Utah">Salt Lake</a> and the briefly thriving Mormon colony at <!--del_lnk--> San Bernardino, California. Las Vegas was established as a railroad town on <!--del_lnk--> May 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1905, when 110 acres (44.5 ha) owned by <!--del_lnk--> Montana <!--del_lnk--> Senator William A. Clark&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake City Railroad, was auctioned off in what is now downtown Las Vegas. Las Vegas was part of <!--del_lnk--> Lincoln County until 1909 when it became part of the newly established <!--del_lnk--> Clark County. Las Vegas became an incorporated city on <!--del_lnk--> March 16, <!--del_lnk--> 1911 when it adopted its first charter.<p><a id="Major_events" name="Major_events"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Major events</span></h3>
      <p>Las Vegas is one of the most dynamic cities in the world, &quot;reinventing&quot; itself as a gambling mecca, family destination, capital of <!--del_lnk--> hedonism (&quot;What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas&quot;), or hotspot for dining and shopping over the years.

      <p>Las Vegas started as a stopover on the pioneer trails to the west and became a popular <!--del_lnk--> railroad town in the early <!--del_lnk--> 1900s. It was a staging point for all the mines in the surrounding area, especially those around the town of Bullfrog, that shipped their goods out to the rest of the country. With the growth of the railroads, Las Vegas became less important, but the completion of the nearby <a href="../../wp/h/Hoover_Dam.htm" title="Hoover Dam">Hoover Dam</a> resulted in substantial growth in tourism, which, along with the legalization of gambling, led to the advent of the casino-hotels for which Las Vegas is famous.<p>The constant stream of tourist dollars from the hotels and casinos was augmented by a new source of federal money. This money came from the establishment of what is now <!--del_lnk--> Nellis Air Force Base. The influx of military personnel and casino job-hunters helped start a land building boom which still goes on today..<p><a id="Law_and_government" name="Law_and_government"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Law and government</span></h2>

According to the <!--del_lnk--> United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 340.0 <!--del_lnk--> km&sup2; (131.3 <!--del_lnk--> mi&sup2;). 339.8 km&sup2; (131.2 mi&sup2;) of it is land and 0.16 km&sup2; (0.1 mi&sup2;) of it (0.04%) is water.<p>The city is located in an arid <!--del_lnk--> basin surrounded by mountains varying in colour from pink to rust to gray. The <!--del_lnk--> Spring Mountains lie to the west. As befits a desert, much of the landscape is rocky and dusty. Within the city, however, there are a great deal of lawns, trees, and other greenery. Due to water resource issues, there is now a movement to encourage <!--del_lnk--> xeriscaping instead of lawns. Another part of the water conservation efforts include scheduled watering groups for watering residential landscaping.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>
      <p>Las Vegas&#39; climate is typical of the <!--del_lnk--> Mojave Desert, in which it is located, marked with hot summers, mild winters, abundant sunshine year-round, and very little rainfall. High temperatures in the <!--del_lnk--> 90s &deg;F are common in the months of May, June, and September and temperatures normally exceed 100&nbsp;&deg;F (38&nbsp;&deg;C) most days in the months of July and August, with very low humidity, frequently under 10%. The hottest temperature ever recorded is 117&nbsp;&deg;F (47&nbsp;&deg;C) set twice, on <!--del_lnk--> July 19, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, at <!--del_lnk--> McCarran International Airport and <!--del_lnk--> July 24, <!--del_lnk--> 1942, at present-day <!--del_lnk--> Nellis Air Force Base. Winters are cool and windy, with the majority of Las Vegas&#39; annual 4.49&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> in (114&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mm) of rainfall coming from January to March. Winter daytime highs are normally around 60&nbsp;&deg;F (16&nbsp;&deg;C) and winter nighttime lows are usually around 40&nbsp;&deg;F (4&nbsp;&deg;C). The coldest temperature ever recorded is 8 &deg;F (-13&nbsp;&deg;C) set on <!--del_lnk--> January 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1937, at present-day Nellis Air Force Base. Showers occur less frequently in the <a href="../../wp/s/Spring_%2528season%2529.htm" title="Spring (season)">Spring</a> or <a href="../../wp/a/Autumn.htm" title="Autumn">Autumn</a>. July through September, the Mexican <!--del_lnk--> Monsoon often brings enough moisture from the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf of California across Mexico and into the southwest to cause afternoon and evening <a href="../../wp/t/Thunderstorm.htm" title="Thunderstorm">thunderstorms</a>. Although winter <a href="../../wp/s/Snow.htm" title="Snow">snow</a> is usually visible from December to May on the mountains surrounding Las Vegas, it rarely snows in the city itself.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>Las Vegas has been the <!--del_lnk--> county seat of <!--del_lnk--> Clark County since the formation of the county in 1909. The Census Bureau&#39;s official population estimate as of 2005 was 545,147. The city&rsquo;s Planning and Development Department reported an increase of 41,126 in 2005, for a total population of 575,973. <!--del_lnk--> . Recent figures place the population for the <!--del_lnk--> Las Vegas metropolitan area, which includes all of Clark County, at over 1.6 million people (<!--del_lnk--> 2004 <!--del_lnk--> ), and the region is one of the fastest growing in the United States. Las Vegas was ranked as the 29th largest city in the United States in 2000, but recent estimates suggest that the city&#39;s population has since surpassed that of <a href="../../wp/a/Atlanta%252C_Georgia.htm" title="Atlanta, Georgia">Atlanta</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/Nashville%252C_Tennessee.htm" title="Nashville, Tennessee">Nashville</a>, <a href="../../wp/w/Washington%252C_D.C..htm" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Louisville%252C_Kentucky.htm" title="Louisville, Kentucky">Louisville</a>, <a href="../../wp/d/Denver%252C_Colorado.htm" title="Denver, Colorado">Denver</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Boston%252C_Massachusetts.htm" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston</a> to place it 22nd in rank. It is likely to surpass <!--del_lnk--> Milwaukee and possibly a few other cities to reach the top 20 by the time of the 2010 Census.<p>As of the <!--del_lnk--> census<sup id="fn_GR2_back"><!--del_lnk--> GR2</sup> of 2000, there were 478,434 people, 176,750 households, and 117,538 families residing in the city. The <!--del_lnk--> population density was 1,630.3/km&sup2; (4,222.5/mi&sup2;). There are 190,724 housing units at an average density of 649.9/km&sup2; (1,683.3/mi&sup2;). The racial makeup of the city was 69.86% <!--del_lnk--> White, 10.36% <!--del_lnk--> African American, 0.75% <!--del_lnk--> Native American, 4.78% <!--del_lnk--> Asian, 0.45% <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Islander, 9.75% from <!--del_lnk--> other races, and 4.05% from two or more races. 23.61% of the population is <!--del_lnk--> Hispanic or <!--del_lnk--> Latino of any race.<p>There were 176,750 households out of which 31.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 48.3% were <!--del_lnk--> married couples living together, 12.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 33.5% were non-families. 25.0% of all households were made up of individuals and 7.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.66 and the average family size was 3.20.<p>In the city the population was spread out with 25.9% under the age of 18, 8.8% from 18 to 24, 32.0% from 25 to 44, 21.7% from 45 to 64, and 11.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females there were 103.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 102.5 males.<p>The median income for a household in the city was $44,069, and the median income for a family was $50,465. Males had a median income of $35,511 versus $27,554 for females. The <!--del_lnk--> per capita income for the city was $22,060. About 8.6% of families and 11.9% of the population were below the <!--del_lnk--> poverty line, including 15.4% of those under age 18 and 8.3% of those age 65 or over.<p>As of the 2004 census estimate, the <!--del_lnk--> Las Vegas metropolitan area contained over 1.6 million residents, and contains the largest ethnic Hawaiian community outside of <!--del_lnk--> Hawaii.<p><a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h2>
      <p>Primary public education is provided by the <!--del_lnk--> Clark County School District (CCSD), which is the fifth largest school district in the nation.<p>Las Vegas does not have any independent four-year university within its city limits. The <!--del_lnk--> University of Nevada, Las Vegas is located in Paradise, three miles south of the city limits. The <!--del_lnk--> University of Nevada Medical School has a campus near downtown Las Vegas. Several national colleges, including the <!--del_lnk--> University of Phoenix, have campuses in the Las Vegas area. <!--del_lnk--> Nevada State College and <!--del_lnk--> Touro University Nevada are both located in nearby <!--del_lnk--> Henderson. The <!--del_lnk--> Community College of Southern Nevada has campuses in Las Vegas, <!--del_lnk--> North Las Vegas and Henderson<p><a id="Environmental_features" name="Environmental_features"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Environmental features</span></h2>
      <p>Las Vegas is situated on the arid floor within Clark County. Correspondingly the environment is dominated by <a href="../../wp/d/Desert.htm" title="Desert">desert</a> <a href="../../wp/v/Vegetation.htm" title="Vegetation">vegetation</a> and <!--del_lnk--> wildlife; however, the setting is also subject to torrential <!--del_lnk--> flash floods which the infrastructure of storm sewers has not been able to contain. The rapid pace of urban development beginning in the 1980s has produced more <!--del_lnk--> impervious surface and exacerbated the inherent flooding issue. Enabling the rapid population expansion was a major addition to the city&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> sewage treatment capacity, an event removing a major constraint to population growth in the 1970s. The Sewage treatment expansion resulted from a <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Environmental Protection Agency grant funded 208 program to analyse and forecast growth and <!--del_lnk--> environmental impacts through the year 2010.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>

      <p>The primary drivers of the Las Vegas economy have been the confluence of <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">tourism</a>, <!--del_lnk--> gaming, and <!--del_lnk--> conventions which in turn feed the <!--del_lnk--> retail and <!--del_lnk--> dining industries. Several companies involved in the manufacture of electronic gaming machines, such as slot machines, are located in the Las Vegas area. In the <!--del_lnk--> 2000s retail and dining have become attractions of their own.<p>Tourism marketing and promotion are handled by the <!--del_lnk--> Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, a county wide agency. Its annual Visitors Survey provides detailed information on visitor numbers, spending patterns and resulting revenues <!--del_lnk--> .<p>Las Vegas as the county seat and home to the <!--del_lnk--> Lloyd D. George Federal District Courthouse, draws numerous legal service industries providing <!--del_lnk--> bail, <!--del_lnk--> marriage, <!--del_lnk--> divorce, <!--del_lnk--> tax, <!--del_lnk--> incorporation and other legal services.<p>The redevelopment listed below shows how the city is trying to diversify the local economy and revitalize the downtown area.

      <p>When <!--del_lnk--> The Mirage, the first Megaresort, opened in 1989, it started a movement of people and construction away from downtown Las Vegas to the <!--del_lnk--> Las Vegas Strip. This resulted in a drop in tourism from which the downtown area is still trying to recover.<p>A concerted effort has been made by city officials to diversify the Las Vegas <a href="../../wp/e/Economics.htm" title="Economics">economy</a> from <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">tourism</a> by attracting light <a href="../../wp/m/Manufacturing.htm" title="Manufacturing">manufacturing</a>, <!--del_lnk--> banking, and other commercial interests. The lack of any state individual or corporate <!--del_lnk--> income tax and very simple <!--del_lnk--> incorporation requirements have fostered the success of this effort.<p>Having been late to develop an urban core of any substantial size, Las Vegas has retained very affordable real estate prices in comparison to nearby urban centers. Consequently, the city has recently enjoyed an enormous boom both in population and in tourism. However, as a <i><!--del_lnk--> New York Times</i> series on the city reported in 2004, the median price of housing in the Las Vegas Valley is now at or above the nationwide median. The urban area has grown outward so quickly that it is beginning to run into <!--del_lnk--> Bureau of Land Management holdings along its edges, increasing land values enough that medium- and high-density development is beginning to occur closer to the core.<p>As a reflection of the city&#39;s rapid growing population, the new <!--del_lnk--> Chinatown of Las Vegas was constructed in the early 1990s on Spring Mountain Road. Chinatown initially consisted of only one large shopping centre complex, but the area was recently expanded for new shopping centers that contain various Asian businesses.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>With the Strip expansion in the 1990s, downtown Las Vegas began to suffer. The <!--del_lnk--> Fremont Street Experience (FSE) was built in an effort to draw tourists downtown. While greatly slowing the decline, it did not stop the decline in tourism and revenue. The multi-level <!--del_lnk--> Neonopolis, complete with 11 theaters (managed by Galaxy Theaters, Inc.), was built to offer more retail and services downtown. While there have been changes in ownership and management, Neonopolis has not been able to lease all the space available. As of May 2006, the property has been sold and is under new management. Renovations are under-way to revitalize Neonopolis. Look for new restaurants to open in the late summer to early fall of 2006.<p>In the early 2000s, some promising signs emerged for downtown Las Vegas. The city successfully lured the <!--del_lnk--> Internal Revenue Service to move operations from the far west of the city to a new building downtown that opened in April 2005. The IRS is expected to create a demand for additional businesses in the area, epecially in the daytime hours.<p>The city purchased 61&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> acres (247,000 m&sup2;) of property from <!--del_lnk--> Union Pacific Railroad in 1995 with the goal of creating something that would draw tourists and locals to the downtown area. In 2004 Las Vegas Mayor <!--del_lnk--> Oscar Goodman announced plans for the <!--del_lnk--> Union Park Development which will include residential and office high-rises, The <!--del_lnk--> Lou Ruvo Brain Institute, an academic medical centre, <!--del_lnk--> The Smith Centre for the Performing Arts, and a new City Hall. After failed negotiations with <!--del_lnk--> The Related Co. on the development of Union Park in October of 2005, <!--del_lnk--> San Diego-based Newland Communities was chosen by the city as the new development firm. The Newland contract calls for <!--del_lnk--> Dan Van Epp, Newland&#39;s regional vice president and former president of the <!--del_lnk--> Howard Hughes Corp., to oversee his company&#39;s work on <!--del_lnk--> Union Park. The <!--del_lnk--> Lou Ruvo Brain Institute is expected to be completed in 2007.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Along with the Union Park Development, other promising residential and office developments have begun construction around downtown Las Vegas. New <!--del_lnk--> condominium and hotel high rise projects have changed the entire Las Vegas skyline dramatically in recent years. Many large high-rise projects are planned for downtown Las Vegas as well as the <!--del_lnk--> Las Vegas Strip. It is expected that high-rise condominium development will transform the downtown area into a vibrant <!--del_lnk--> urban centre.<p>The city council of Las Vegas has agreed on zoning changes on Fremont Street, which allows bars to be closer together duplicating efforts of similar cities, like the <!--del_lnk--> Gaslamp Quarter of <!--del_lnk--> San Diego.

      <p>In 2005, on a lot adjacent to the city&#39;s 61&nbsp;ac (247,000 m&sup2;), the <!--del_lnk--> World Market Centre opened. It is intended to be the nation&#39;s and possibly the world&#39;s preeminent <!--del_lnk--> furniture <!--del_lnk--> wholesale <!--del_lnk--> showroom and marketplace, and is meant to compete with the current furniture market capital of <!--del_lnk--> High Point, North Carolina.<p>In 2004, the city partnered with <!--del_lnk--> Cheetah Wireless Technologies and <!--del_lnk--> MeshNetwork to pilot a wide area mobile broadband system. The pilot system is installed downtown, around the Fremont Street Experience.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> October 23, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, plans were unveiled to build a World Jewelry Center in Downtown&#39;s Union Park. Similar to the World Market Centre, the WJC will be a one stop shop for jewelry trade shows from around the world.
