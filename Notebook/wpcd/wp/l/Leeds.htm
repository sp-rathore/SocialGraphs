      <p>The name &quot;Leeds&quot; came from &quot;Leodis&quot;, which was a name recorded in <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon sources for a <!--del_lnk--> Celtic kingdom that survived in the area for a while after the Anglo-Saxon invasion.<p>Leeds has been known since being mentioned in the <!--del_lnk--> Domesday book of 1086. Leeds was an agricultural market town in the Middle Ages, and received its first charter in 1207. In the <!--del_lnk--> Tudor period Leeds was mainly a merchant town, manufacturing woollen cloths and trading with Europe via the <!--del_lnk--> Humber <!--del_lnk--> estuary and the population grew from 10,000 at the end of the seventeenth century to 30,000 at the end of the eighteenth. At one point nearly half of England&#39;s total export passed through Leeds. The <!--del_lnk--> industrial revolution had resulted in the radical growth of Leeds whose population had risen to over 150,000 by 1840. The city&#39;s industrial growth was catalysed by the introduction of the <!--del_lnk--> Aire &amp; Calder Navigation in 1699, <!--del_lnk--> Leeds and Liverpool Canal in 1816 and the railway in 1848. In 1893 Leeds had been granted city status. These industries that developed in the industrial revolution had included making machinery for spinning, machine tools, steam engines and gears as well as other industries based on textiles, chemicals and leather and pottery. Coal was extracted on a large scale and the still functioning <!--del_lnk--> Middleton Railway, the first commercial railway in the world, transported coal into the centre of Leeds.<p>By the 20th century this social and economic had started to change with the creation of academic institutions such the academic institutions that are known today as the <!--del_lnk--> University of Leeds, <!--del_lnk--> Leeds Metropolitan University and <!--del_lnk--> Leeds Trinity &amp; All Saints. This period had also witnessed expansion in medical provision particularly <!--del_lnk--> Leeds General Infirmary and <!--del_lnk--> St James&#39;s Hospital. Following <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> there was a decline in secondary industries that had thrived in the 19th century. In 1951, half the workforce was still in manufacturing; by 1971 the figure was a third. Leeds lost a third of its manufacturing jobs 1971-81 (Champion &amp; Townsend, 1990, p.82). In 1991, 64,000 were employed in manufacturing. In 2003, 2,103 firms employed 44,500 (10% of workforce) - see Leeds Economy Handbook. But there are still some large engineering firms. The largest make turbine blades, components, alloys, valves and pipelines for the oil industry, switchgear, printers&#39; supplies, copper alloys, surgical and hospital equipment, pumps, motors, radiators.<p>In the 1980s, the Conservative government designated Urban Development Corporations on a number of UK cities: some declining areas were taken out of local authority control and government funding was provided with the aim of speeding up and concentrating private sector investment in the most run-down areas. Leeds Development Corporation ran from 1988-95 and helped to focus attention on two decayed industrial areas (lower Kirkstall Valley and the riverside area to the south east of the city centre). Achievements of LDC included refurbishment of many riverside properties, the opening up of Granary Wharf and the Royal Armouries development.<p>Today Leeds is known as one of eight <!--del_lnk--> core cities that act as a focus of their respective regions and Leeds is generally regarded as the dominant city of the <!--del_lnk--> ceremonial county of <!--del_lnk--> West Yorkshire. <p><a id="Industry_and_economy" name="Industry_and_economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Industry and economy</span></h2>

      <p>Leeds was recently voted Britain&#39;s Best City for Business by Omis Research. It is also regarded as the fastest growing city in the UKand has a diverse economy with the service sector now dominating over the city&#39;s manufacturing industries. Leeds is the largest financial centre outside the capital. New tertiary industries such as <!--del_lnk--> retail, <!--del_lnk--> call centres, <!--del_lnk--> offices and <!--del_lnk--> media have contributed to a high rate of economic growth since the early 1990s. Nearly 100,000 people work in financial and business services - about a quarter of the workforce. The strength of the economy is also indicated by the low unemployment rate.<p>Leeds has one of the largest Live and Work <!--del_lnk--> Credit Unions in the UK. Membership is open to anyone who works or lives in Leeds. Employing over 40 people with offices in the centre and surrounding areas it brings financial services to everyone in Leeds. <!--del_lnk--> Leeds City Credit Union is a membership owned co-operative that provides financial services to the less well off as well as those with what is normally considered sufficient means. Regulated by the <!--del_lnk--> FSA it offers an <!--del_lnk--> ethical investment opportunity for anyone who wishes to see their <!--del_lnk--> savings aid the wider community.<p>Growth sectors in financial &amp; business services: banking, labour recruitment*, commercial cleaning, legal services, insurance, pension funds, computing*, architecture and civil engineering, real estate, investigation &amp; security, accountancy, equipment leasing, consultancy &amp; market research*, advertising, R&amp;D* Some of the faster growing sub-sectors during the 1990s marked *<p><a id="Transport" name="Transport"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transport</span></h2>
      <p>The <b>rail</b> network is still of great importance. From <!--del_lnk--> Leeds station (the 6th busiest in the UK- the busiest outside of London <!--del_lnk--> ) <!--del_lnk--> MetroTrains operated by <!--del_lnk--> Northern Rail operate to all parts of West Yorkshire and surrounding local and commuter locations and other operators including <!--del_lnk--> GNER, <!--del_lnk--> Virgin Cross Country, <!--del_lnk--> Midland Mainline and <!--del_lnk--> First Transpennine Express operate services to the rest of the country.<p>Leeds has two railway lines offering direct services to London. The priciple route is along the <!--del_lnk--> East Coast Main Line although Midland Mainline offers an alternative route via <a href="../../wp/l/Leicester.htm" title="Leicester">Leicester</a> along the <!--del_lnk--> Midland Main Line to <!--del_lnk--> London St Pancras soon to be the home of <!--del_lnk--> Eurostar international services.<p>The city had plans for a <b><!--del_lnk--> tram</b> network. However the government axed the scheme due to an unwillingness to pay for any costs over budget, and the <!--del_lnk--> Department for Transport&#39;s general dislike of trams and attachment to <!--del_lnk--> buses. The <!--del_lnk--> Merseyside transport authority <!--del_lnk--> Merseytravel is preparing a legal case against the Government to restore the tram system plans. Leeds remains the largest city in the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> without a <!--del_lnk--> mass transit system.<p>Leeds was chosen as the focus of the <!--del_lnk--> A58, <!--del_lnk--> A61, <!--del_lnk--> A62, <!--del_lnk--> A63, <!--del_lnk--> A64 and <!--del_lnk--> A65 <b>roads</b>. Nowadays, with the <!--del_lnk--> M1 and <!--del_lnk--> M62 intersecting just to its south and the <!--del_lnk--> A1(M) passing just to its east, it is one of the principal hubs of the northern motorway network. The city centre is pedestrianised, and is encircled by the clockwise-only &#39;loop road&#39;.<p><!--del_lnk--> Leeds Bradford International Airport is located to the north-west of the city and has scheduled <b>flights</b> to destinations within <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>.<p><a id="Development" name="Development"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Development</span></h2>
      <p>In recent times Leeds has seen many new developments. Some large schemes that are proposed or under construction include:<ul>

      <p>High rise schemes are making a much bigger mark on Leeds&#39; skyline. Sixteen skyscrapers are under construction or proposed, all of them taller than West Riding House - Leeds&#39; tallest building since it was built in the 1970s.

      <p>Prior to the <!--del_lnk--> 1974 reorganisation of government, the City of Leeds was defined as including the former parishes of Armley, Beeston, Bramley, Chapel Allerton, Farnley, Headingley/Burley, Holbeck, Hunslet, Leeds, Osmondthorpe, Potter Newton, Seacroft, Temple Newsam, Wortley<!--del_lnk--> . Since then, many modern definitions also include areas such as Garforth, Middleton and Rothwell. Seeing as all government functions are done by the wider Leeds district, official definitions of the boundaries are no longer considered important by the council.<p><a id="Tourism" name="Tourism"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Tourism</span></h2>

They won two league titles and an FA Cup before Revie left for the England team job in 1974. Their only major trophy since then was the 1992 league title. Between 1982 and 1990 Leeds were in the second tier of the English league, and returned to this level in 2004 following a financial crisis which almost resulted in bankruptcy. They narrowly missed out on a return to the Premiership in 2006, when losing the Championship playoff final 3-0 to Watford.<p><!--del_lnk--> Leeds Rhinos were crowned <!--del_lnk--> Super League champions on <!--del_lnk--> 16 October <!--del_lnk--> 2004 after defeating arch rivals <!--del_lnk--> Bradford Bulls 16-8 at <!--del_lnk--> Old Trafford.

Since the turn of the millennium the team has never been out of the top 4 in the National Cross Country Championships, winning in 2003 and 2006. In 2006 the team achieved the &#39;Grand Slam&#39; of wins - Yorkshire, North of England and English National Champions.<p>Leeds has a wealth of sports facilities including the 40,000 capacity <!--del_lnk--> Elland Road football stadium, a host stadium during the <!--del_lnk--> 1996 European Football Championship, 22,000 capacity Carnegie <!--del_lnk--> Headingley Stadium, world famous for both <a href="../../wp/c/Cricket.htm" title="Cricket">cricket</a> and <!--del_lnk--> rugby league, Leeds International Pool (50m), <!--del_lnk--> South Leeds Stadium used for athletics, bowls, football and tennis.

It features some of the biggest names in rock and indie music. The city is home to the <!--del_lnk--> Leeds International Piano Competition, held every three years since 1963, which has launched the careers of many major concert pianists.
