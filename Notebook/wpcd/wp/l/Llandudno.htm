      <p><b>Llandudno</b> (pronounced <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/&#x26C;an.&#39;d&#x26A;d.n&#x254;/</span>) is a <!--del_lnk--> seaside resort and town on the <!--del_lnk--> North Wales coast between <!--del_lnk--> Conwy and <!--del_lnk--> Colwyn Bay, and at the 2001 <!--del_lnk--> census had a population of 20,090 including that of <!--del_lnk--> Penrhyn Bay and Penrhynside, which are within the Llandudno <!--del_lnk--> Community. The town is just off the <!--del_lnk--> North Wales Coast railway line which was opened as the <!--del_lnk--> Chester and Holyhead Railway in 1848, became part of the <!--del_lnk--> London and North Western Railway in 1859, and part of the <!--del_lnk--> London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923. Llandudno was specifically built as a mid-<!--del_lnk--> Victorian era holiday destination and is served by a branch railway line opened in 1858 from <!--del_lnk--> Llandudno Junction with stations at <!--del_lnk--> Deganwy and <!--del_lnk--> Llandudno.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p>Llandudno, <b>Queen of the Welsh Resorts</b>, a title first implied as early as 1864 is now the largest <!--del_lnk--> seaside resort in Wales, and lies on a flat land between the Welsh mainland and the <!--del_lnk--> Great Orme peninsula. Llandudno takes its name from the ancient <!--del_lnk--> parish of Saint Tudno but also encompasses several neighbouring townships and districts including <!--del_lnk--> Craig-y-Don, <!--del_lnk--> Llanrhos, and <!--del_lnk--> Penrhyn Bay. Also nearby is the small town and marina of <!--del_lnk--> Deganwy, though this is part of the town of Conwy.<p><a id="Llandudno_Bay_and_the_North_Shore" name="Llandudno_Bay_and_the_North_Shore"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Llandudno Bay and the North Shore</span></h3>
      <p>This wide sweep of sand and shingle extends two miles in a graceful curve between the headlands of the Great Orme and the <!--del_lnk--> Little Orme. For most of the distance on Llandudno&#39;s North Shore there is a wide curving Victorian promenade separated from the roadway by a strip of garden. The road, collectively known as The Parade, has a different name for each block and it is on these parades and crescents that many of Llandudno&#39;s hotels are built. Near the centre of the bay is the North Wales Theatre and next to it The North Wales Conference Centre. The Llandudno <!--del_lnk--> Yacht Club and a roundabout mark the end of this section of The Parade and beyond are more hotels and guest houses but they are in the township of Craig-y-Don. At Nant-y-Gamar road, The Parade becomes Colwyn Road with the fields of Bodafon Hall Farm on the landward side but with the promenade continuing until it ends in a large <!--del_lnk--> paddling pool for children and finally the Craigside residential development on the lower slopes of the Little Orme.<p><a id="Llandudno_Pier" name="Llandudno_Pier"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Llandudno Pier</span></h3>

      <p>The town&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> award winning <!--del_lnk--> pier is on the North Shore; it was built in 1878, and is 1,234 feet in length and a Grade II <!--del_lnk--> listed building. Looking back towards the town from the end of the pier, on a clear day one can see the mountains of <a href="../../wp/s/Snowdonia.htm" title="Snowdonia">Snowdonia</a> rising over the town. A curious major extension of the pier in 1884 was in a landwards direction along the side of the Grand Hotel to provide a new entrance with a <!--del_lnk--> pier pavilion theatre at the North Parade end of the promenade, thus increasing the pier&#39;s length to 2,295 feet. In the summer, Professor Codman&#39;s Punch and Judy show (established in 1860) can be found on the promenade near the entrance to the Pier.<p><a id="Great_Orme" name="Great_Orme"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Great Orme</span></h3>
      <p>This great limestone headland has many attractions for the tourist including the <!--del_lnk--> Great Orme Tramway that takes tourists effortlessly to the summit. Two features of the Great Orme should be mentioned here because the both start at the end of the promenade where North Parade becomes for a short distance Happy Valley Road, which in its turn becomes the Marine Drive.<p><a id="Happy_Valley" name="Happy_Valley"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Happy Valley</span></h3>
      <p>The Happy Valley, a former quarry, was the gift of Lord Mostyn to the town in celebration of the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Jubilee of <a href="../../wp/v/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a> in 1887. The area was landscaped and developed as gardens, two miniature golf courses, a putting green, a popular open air theatre and extensive lawns. The ceremonies connected with the <!--del_lnk--> Welsh National Eisteddfod were held there in 1896 and again in 1963. In June 1969, The Great Orme <!--del_lnk--> Cabin Lift, a modern alternative to the tramway, was opened with its base station adjacent to the open air theatre. The distance to the summit is just over one mile and the four-seater cabins travel at six m.p.h. on a continuous steel cable over two miles long. It is the longest single stage cabin lift in Britain and the longest span between pylons is over 1,000 feet. The popularity of open air theatre having declined, the theatre closed in the 1980s and likewise the two miniature golf courses closed and were converted in 1987 to create a 280 metre <!--del_lnk--> artificial ski slope and <!--del_lnk--> toboggan run. The gardens were extensively restored as part of the resort&#39;s millennium celebrations and remain a major attraction.<p><a id="Marine_Drive" name="Marine_Drive"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Marine Drive</span></h3>
      <p>The first route round the perimeter of the Great Orme was a <!--del_lnk--> footpath constructed in 1858 by Reginald Cust a Trustee of the Mostyn Estate. In 1872 the Great Ormes Head Marine Drive Co. Ltd. was formed to turn the path into a carriage road. Following bankruptcy, a second company completed the road in 1878. The contractors for the scheme were Mssrs Hughes, Morris, Davies, a consortium led by Richard Hughes of Llandudno. The road was bought by Llandudno Urban District Council in 1897. The four mile drive (it is one way only) starts at the foot of the Happy Valley and is a pleasant drive or an excellent walk. After about one and a half miles, a side road leads to St. Tudno&#39;s Church, the Great Orme <a href="../../wp/b/Bronze_Age.htm" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a> <!--del_lnk--> Copper Mine, and the Summit of the Great Orme. But, continuing on the Marine Drive one passes the Great Orme <!--del_lnk--> Lighthouse (no longer operational) and at the half way point the &#39;Rest and be thankful&#39; Caf&eacute; is very popular with both walkers and motorists. This is almost the highest point on the drive and it is down hill for two miles to the West Shore.<p><a id="West_Shore" name="West_Shore"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">West Shore</span></h3>
      <p>The West Shore is the quiet beach on the estuary of the River Conwy. It was here at Pen Morfa that <!--del_lnk--> Alice Liddell (of <i><!--del_lnk--> Alice in Wonderland</i> fame) spent the long summer holidays of her childhood from 1862 to 1871. There are few hotels and a few quiet residential streets. The West Shore is linked to the North Shore by Gloddaeth Avenue, a wide dual carriageway.<p><a id="Mostyn_Street" name="Mostyn_Street"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Mostyn Street</span></h3>
      <p>Running behind the promenade is Mostyn Street leading to Mostyn Broadway and then Mostyn Avenue. These are the main shopping streets of Llandudno and Craig-y-Don. Mostyn Street accommodates the high street shops, the major banks and building societies, two churches, amusement arcades and the town <!--del_lnk--> public library.

      <p>Every year in May <!--del_lnk--> Bank Holiday weekend, Llandudno has a great three-day <!--del_lnk--> Victorian Carnival and Mostyn Street becomes a <!--del_lnk--> fairground. Madoc Street and Gloddaeth Street and the Promenade become part of the route each day of a mid-day <!--del_lnk--> carnival parade. The Bodafon Farm fields become the location of a <!--del_lnk--> Festival of Transport for the weekend.<p><a id="Alice_in_Wonderland" name="Alice_in_Wonderland"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Alice in Wonderland</span></h3>
      <p>Llandudno has a link with <!--del_lnk--> Lewis Carroll; because the family of the &quot;real Alice&quot; regularly spent holidays at their holiday-home <i>Penmorfa</i>, later the Gogarth Abbey Hotel and recently the Penmorfa Hotel on the West Shore of Llandudno. Contrary to local myth, <!--del_lnk--> Alice Liddell did not meet Carroll in the town, and was not told the <a href="../../wp/a/Alice%2527s_Adventures_in_Wonderland.htm" title="Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland">Alice stories</a> in the town. It is, however, just possible that she may have first read the Alice books in print while on holiday in the town. There is no evidence that Carroll ever visited <i>Penmorfa</i>, and he probably would have been unwelcome if he had. Indeed, there is contrary evidence; a letter exists, written by one of Alice Liddell&#39;s sisters when grown-up, saying she had no memory of Carroll ever visiting the girls in Llandudno.<p><a id="Venue_Cymru" name="Venue_Cymru"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Venue Cymru</span></h3>
      <p>The <i>North Wales Theatre, Arena and Conference Centre</i>, built in 1995, extended in 2006 and renamed &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Venue Cymru&quot; is located near the centre of the promenade on Penrhyn Crescent.

      <p>Llandudno is unique within the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> in that its <!--del_lnk--> lifeboat station is located inland, allowing it to launch with equal facility from either the West Shore or the North Shore as needed. Llandudno&#39;s active volunteer crews are called out more than ever with the rapidly increasing numbers of small pleasure craft sailing in coastal waters. The <!--del_lnk--> Llandudno Lifeboat is normally on display on the promenade every Sunday and Bank Holiday Monday from May until October.<p><a id="Early_History_of_Llandudno" name="Early_History_of_Llandudno"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Early History of Llandudno</span></h2>
      <p>The town of Llandudno developed from <a href="../../wp/s/Stone_Age.htm" title="Stone age">stone age</a>, <!--del_lnk--> bronze age and <a href="../../wp/i/Iron_Age.htm" title="Iron Age">iron age</a> settlements over many hundreds of years on the slopes of the limestone headland, known to seafarers as the <!--del_lnk--> Great Orme and to landsmen as the Creuddyn peninsular. The origins in recorded history are with the Manor of Gogarth conveyed by <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_I_of_England.htm" title="Edward I of England">King Edward I</a> to Annan, <!--del_lnk--> Bishop of Bangor in 1284. The manor comprised three townships, <i>Y Gogarth</i> in the south-west, <i>Y Cyngreawdr</i> in the north (with the parish church of St. Tudno) and <i>Yn Wyddfid</i> in the south-east. By 1847 the town had grown to a thousand persons served by the new church of St. George, built in 1840, the great majority of the men working in the copper mines with others employed in fishing and subsistence agriculture.<p>In 1848, Owen Williams, an <!--del_lnk--> architect and <!--del_lnk--> surveyor from <a href="../../wp/l/Liverpool.htm" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, presented Lord Mostyn with plans to develop the marsh lands behind Llandudno Bay as a holiday resort. These were enthusiastically pursued by Lord Mostyn. The influence of the <!--del_lnk--> Mostyn Estate and its agents over the years was to become paramount in the development of Llandudno and especially after the appointment of George Felton as surveyor and architect in 1857. During the years 1857 to 1877 much of central Llandudno was developed under Felton&#39;s supervision. George Felton also undertook architectural design work including the design and execution of Holy Trinity Church in Mostyn Street.<p><a id="Churches" name="Churches"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Churches</span></h2>
      <p>The ancient <!--del_lnk--> parish church dedicated to Saint Tudno stands in a hollow near the northern point of the Great Orme and two miles from the present town. It was established as an <!--del_lnk--> oratory by Tudno, a sixth century monk, but the present church dates from the 12th century and it is still used on summer Sunday mornings. It was the Anglican parish church of Llandudno until that status was transferred first to St George&rsquo;s (now closed) and later to Holy Trinity Church in Mostyn Street.<p>The principal <!--del_lnk--> Christian Churches of Llandudno are members of <!--del_lnk--> Cyt&ucirc;n (churches together) and include the <!--del_lnk--> Church in Wales (Holy Trinity and also Saint Paul&#39;s at Craig-y-Don), the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> of Our Lady Star of the Sea, Saint John&rsquo;s <!--del_lnk--> Methodist Church, Gloddaeth United Church (<!--del_lnk--> Presbyterian), Assemblies of God (<!--del_lnk--> Pentecostal), Llandudno <!--del_lnk--> Baptist Church, St. David&#39;s Methodist Church at Craig-y-Don, the <!--del_lnk--> Coptic Orthodox Church of Saint Mary and Saint Abasikhiron, and Eglwys Unedig Gymraeg Llandudno (the United Welsh Church of Llandudno). These churches all have fine buildings.<p>A high profile member of the local Methodist community is <!--del_lnk--> The Revd Roger Roberts, now Lord Roberts of Llandudno, <a href="../../wp/l/Liberal_Democrats.htm" title="Liberal Democrats">Liberal Democrat</a> Spokesman for <!--del_lnk--> International Development in the <a href="../../wp/h/House_of_Lords.htm" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a>.<p><a id="Area_features" name="Area_features"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Area features</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Bodysgallen Hall is a <!--del_lnk--> manor house nearby to the south near the village of <!--del_lnk--> Llanrhos.

Bodysgallen was constructed as a <!--del_lnk--> tower house in the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> to serve as defensive support for nearby <!--del_lnk--> Conwy Castle.<p><a id="Links_with_Wormhout_and_Mametz" name="Links_with_Wormhout_and_Mametz"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Links with Wormhout and Mametz</span></h2>
      <p>Llandudno is <!--del_lnk--> twinned with the <!--del_lnk--> Flemish town of Wormhout ten miles from <!--del_lnk--> Dunkirk. It was there that many members of the Llandudno-based 69th <!--del_lnk--> Territorial <!--del_lnk--> Regiment were ambushed and taken prisoner. Later, at nearby Esquelbecq on <!--del_lnk--> 28 May <!--del_lnk--> 1940, the prisoners were shot.<p>During the 1914&ndash;18 war the Llandudno Brigade (<!--del_lnk--> Royal Welch Fusiliers) a major part of the 38th Welsh Division took part in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Somme and the Llandudno Brigade was ordered to take Mametz Wood. Two days of fighting brought about the total destruction of <!--del_lnk--> Mametz village by shelling. After the war, the people of Llandudno (including returning survivors from the 38th Welsh Division) contributed generously to the fund for the reconstruction of the village of Mametz.<p><a id="Cultural_connections" name="Cultural_connections"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Cultural connections</span></h2>
