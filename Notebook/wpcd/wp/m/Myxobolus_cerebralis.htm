      <p><i><b>Myxobolus cerebralis</b></i> is a <!--del_lnk--> myxosporean <!--del_lnk--> parasite of <!--del_lnk--> salmonids (<!--del_lnk--> salmon, <a href="../../wp/t/Trout.htm" title="Trout">trout</a>, and their allies) that causes <b>whirling disease</b> in <!--del_lnk--> farmed salmon and trout and also in <!--del_lnk--> wild fish populations. It was first described from <!--del_lnk--> rainbow trout in <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> a century ago, but its range has spread and it has appeared in most of <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> (including <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>), the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a><span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_BRRange"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> and other countries. In the 1980s, it was discovered that <i>M. cerebralis</i> needs to infect a <!--del_lnk--> tubificid <!--del_lnk--> oligochaete (a kind of <!--del_lnk--> segmented worm) to complete its life-cycle.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_MarkiwWorm"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The parasite infects its hosts with its cells after piercing them with <!--del_lnk--> polar filaments ejected from <!--del_lnk--> nematocyst-like capsules.<p>Whirling disease afflicts juvenile fish (fingerlings and fry) and causes <!--del_lnk--> skeletal deformation and <!--del_lnk--> neurological damage. Fish &quot;whirl&quot; rather than swim forward, find feeding difficult, and are more vulnerable to <!--del_lnk--> predators. The mortality rate is high for fingerlings, up to 90% of infected populations, and those that do survive are deformed by the parasite residing in their <!--del_lnk--> cartilage and <!--del_lnk--> bone. They act as a reservoir for the parasite, which is released into water following the fish&#39;s death. <i>M. cerebralis</i> is one of the most economically important myxozoans in fish as well as one of the most pathogenic.

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> taxonomy and naming of both <i>M. cerebralis</i> and of myxozoans in general have complicated histories. It was originally thought that this parasite infected fish brains (hence the <!--del_lnk--> specific epithet <i>cerebralis</i>), however it quickly became apparent that while it can be found in the <!--del_lnk--> nervous system, it primarily infects <!--del_lnk--> cartilage and <!--del_lnk--> skeletal tissue.

      <p>The stages that infect fish, called <!--del_lnk--> triactinomyxon spores, are made of a single style that is about 150 <!--del_lnk--> micrometers (&micro;m) long and three processes or &quot;tails&quot; that are each about 200 micrometers long. A <!--del_lnk--> sporoplasm packet at the end of the style contains 64 germ cells surrounded by a cellular envelope.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_HEMMorpho"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> There are also three <!--del_lnk--> polar capsules, each of which contains a coiled <!--del_lnk--> polar filament between 170 and 180 &micro;m long.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_MarkiwSize"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Polar filaments in both this stage and in the <!--del_lnk--> myxospore stage (see picture above) rapidly shoot into the body of the host, creating an opening through which the sporoplasm can enter.<p><a id="Sporoplasm_stage" name="Sporoplasm_stage"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Sporoplasm stage</span></h3>
      <p>Upon contact with fish hosts and firing of the polar capsules, the sporoplasm contained within the central style of the triactinomyxon migrates into the epithelium or gut lining.

      <p><i>Myxobolus cerebralis</i> has a two-host life-cycle involving a salmonid fish and a tubificid oligochaete. So far, the only worm known to be susceptible to <i>M. cerebralis</i> infection is <i><!--del_lnk--> Tubifex tubifex</i>,<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_MarkiwOnly"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> though what scientists currently call <i>T. tubifex</i> may in fact be more than one species.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_GGSpecies"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> First, myxospores are ingested by tubificid worms. In the <!--del_lnk--> gut <!--del_lnk--> lumen of the worm, the spores extrude their <!--del_lnk--> polar capsules and attach to the gut <!--del_lnk--> epithelium by <!--del_lnk--> polar filaments. The shell valves then open along the suture line and the binucleate germ cell penetrates between the intestinal epithelial cells of the worm. This cell multiplies, producing many <!--del_lnk--> amoeboid cells by an asexual cell <!--del_lnk--> fission process called <!--del_lnk--> merogony. As a result of the multiplication process, the intercellular space of the epithelial cells in more than 10 neighbouring worm segments may become infected.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_EMHSegments"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p>Around 60&ndash;90 days post-infection, sexual cell stages of the parasite undergo <!--del_lnk--> sporogenesis, and develop into <!--del_lnk--> pansporocysts, each of which contains eight triactinomyxon-stage spores. These spores are released from the oligochaete anus into the water.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_HEMAnus"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Alternatively, a fish can become infected by eating an infected oligochaete.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_MarkiwEat"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Infected tubificids can release triactinomyxons for at least 1 year.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_EMHYear"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The triactinomyxon spores swim through the water to infect a salmonid through the skin. Penetration of the fish by these spores takes only a few seconds. Within five minutes, a sac of germ cells called a <!--del_lnk--> sporoplasm has entered the fish <!--del_lnk--> epidermis, and within a few hours, the sporoplasm splits into individual cells that will spread through the fish.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_HEMMinutes"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p>Within the fish, there are both intracellular and extracellular stages that reproduce in its cartilage by asexual <!--del_lnk--> endogeny, meaning that new cells grow from within old cells. The final stage within fish is the myxospore, which is formed by <!--del_lnk--> sporogony. They are released into the environment when the fish decomposes or is eaten.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_HEMRot"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Some recent research indicates that some fish may expel viable myxospores while still alive.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_NehringLive"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p>Myxospores are extremely tough: &quot;it was shown that <i>Myxobolus cerebralis</i> spores can tolerate freezing at &shy;-20&deg;C for at least 3 months, aging in mud at 13&deg;C for at least 5 months, and passage through the guts of <!--del_lnk--> northern pike <i>Esox lucius</i> or <a href="../../wp/m/Mallard.htm" title="Mallard">mallards</a> <i>Anas platyrhynchos</i> without loss of infectivity&quot; to worms.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_EMHDucks"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Triactinomyxons are much shorter lived, surviving 34 days or less, depending on temperature.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_MarkiwADays"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p><a id="Pathology" name="Pathology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Pathology</span></h2>

      <p>Moderate or heavy clinical infection of fish with whirling disease can be presumptively diagnosed on the basis of changes in behaviour and appearance about 35 to 80 days after initial infection, though &quot;injury or deficiency in dietary <!--del_lnk--> tryptophan and <!--del_lnk--> ascorbic acid can evoke similar signs,&quot; so conclusive diagnosis may require finding myxospores in the fish&#39;s cartilage.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_MarkiwAcid"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> In heavy infections, examining cartilage microscopically may be all that is needed to find spores.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_MarkiwMicro"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> In less severe infections the most common test involves digestion of the cranial cartilage with the <!--del_lnk--> proteases <!--del_lnk--> pepsin and <!--del_lnk--> trypsin (the pepsin-trypsin digest&mdash;PTD) before looking for spores.

      <p>Although originally a mild pathogen of <a href="../../wp/b/Brown_trout.htm" title="Brown trout"><i>Salmo trutta</i></a> in central Europe and other salmonids in north east Asia, the spread of the <!--del_lnk--> Rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) has greatly increased the impact of this parasite. Having no innate immunity to <i>M. cerebralis</i>, rainbow trout are particularly susceptible, and can release so many spores that even more resistant species in the same area, like <i>S. trutta</i>, can become overloaded with parasites and incur 80%&ndash;90% mortalities. Where <i>M. cerebralis</i> has become well-established, it has caused decline or even elimination of whole cohorts of fish.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_NehringWipeout"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_VincentWipeout"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p><a id="Impact_in_Europe" name="Impact_in_Europe"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Impact in Europe</span></h3>
      <p>The impact of <i>M. cerebralis</i> in Europe is somewhat lessened by the fact that the species is endemic to this region, giving native <!--del_lnk--> fish stocks a degree of <!--del_lnk--> immunity. <!--del_lnk--> Rainbow trout, the most susceptible species to this parasite, are not native to Europe; successfully reproducing <!--del_lnk--> feral populations are rare, so there are few wild rainbow trout that are young enough to be susceptible to infection. On the other hand, they are widely reared for restocking <!--del_lnk--> sport-fishing waters and for <!--del_lnk--> aquaculture, where this parasite has its greatest impact. Hatching and rearing methods designed to prevent infection of Rainbow trout fry have proved successful in Europe. These techniques include hatching eggs in spore-free water and rearing fry to the &quot;ossification&quot; stage in tanks or raceways. These methods give particular attention to the quality of water sources in order to guard against spore introduction during water exchanges.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_GhittMethod"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Fry are moved to earthen ponds only when they are considered to be clinically resistant to the parasite, after skeletal ossification occurs.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_HallidayBones"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p><a id="Impact_in_New_Zealand" name="Impact_in_New_Zealand"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Impact in New Zealand</span></h3>

      <p><i>M. cerebralis</i> was first recorded in North America in 1956 in <!--del_lnk--> Pennsylvania, having been introduced via infected trout imported from Europe, and has spread steadily south and westwards.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_BergSouth"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Until the 1990s, whirling disease was considered a manageable problem affecting rainbow trout in hatcheries. However, it has recently become established in natural waters of the Rocky Mountain states (<!--del_lnk--> Colorado, <!--del_lnk--> Wyoming, <!--del_lnk--> Utah, <!--del_lnk--> Montana, <!--del_lnk--> Idaho, <!--del_lnk--> New Mexico) where it is causing heavy mortalities in several sportfishing rivers. Some streams in the western United States have lost 90% of their trout.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_TennysonRivers"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> In addition, whirling disease threatens recreational fishing, which is important for the tourism industry, a key component of the economies of some U.S. western states.
