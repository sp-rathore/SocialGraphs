<h2>SOS Children in Malawi</h2>
<img src="../../wp/j/Jwp_map_malawi_en.gif" width="208" height="500" alt="SOS Children Sponsorship Sites in Malawi" class="left" /><p>Malawi, in south-east Africa, is bordered by Mozambique in the south and east, Tanzania to the north and Zambia to the west. Malawi's economy is based on agriculture, employing nearly 90 per cent of the workforce </p><p>It is one of the ten poorest countries in the world; more than half the population are illiterate and life expectancy is around 46 years, with a high rate of infant mortality. With the increased incidence of HIV/AIDS, it is estimated that over half a million children are orphans as a result. </p><p>The charity opened its first community in Malawi in 1994 on the outskirts of the capital Lilongwe.  There are 12 family homes which are home for 144 children.  Education for these children together with children from the local community is provided in three SOS schools. The SOS Nursery School has classes 180 children, the SOS Primary School has 670 pupils in 20 classes and the SOS Secondary School has 420 pupils in 13 classes.  There is also a Vocational Training Centre for 140 young people.   </p><p>At the beginning of 2002, SOS Malawi responded to the growing AIDS epidemic with a community outreach programme, which is co-ordinated by the SOS Social Centre in Lilongwe. Through this, 2000 local families and children that are directly or indirectly affected by HIV/AIDS are supported within their familiar environments through the provision or improvement of housing, food and medical aid, the payment of school fees and general psychosocial support. </p><p>In October 2002 when food shortages and famine were threatening the country, SOS Malawi also started an emergency relief programme which provided needy families with food as well as maize seed and fertilizer. </p><p>Malawi's second SOS community opened in Mzuzu in 2002. In northern Malawi, on a high plateau surrounded by mountains, Mzuzu is one of the largest towns in an area where there are no facilities or care provisions for destitute children. The village has fifteen family houses which are home to 180 children.  There is also a SOS Nursery School for 75 children.   In 2005, an SOS Primary School was opened in Mzuzu and is giving education to 320 children in the local community as well as from the SOS Children's Village.</p><p>At the beginning of 2002, SOS Malawi responded to the growing AIDS epidemic with a community outreach programme, which is co-ordinated by the SOS Social Centre in Mzuzu. Through this, 1500 local families and children that are directly or indirectly affected by HIV/AIDS are supported within their familiar environments through the provision or improvement of housing, food and medical aid, the payment of school fees and general psychosocial support. </p><p>A third SOS Children's Village project is currently being built in Blantyre and will have 15 family houses, a nursery school, a primary school, a secondary school, a social centre and a medical centre.</p><h3>Local Contacts</h3>
