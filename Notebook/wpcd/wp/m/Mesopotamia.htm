Mesopotamia was coined in the <!--del_lnk--> Hellenistic period without any definite <!--del_lnk--> boundaries, to refer to a broad <!--del_lnk--> geographical area and probably used by the <!--del_lnk--> Seleucids. The area became a short-lived province of the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> at the time of <!--del_lnk--> Trajan, with the name <i>Provincia Mesopotamia</i>. Scholars have suggested that the <!--del_lnk--> Akkadian term <i>biritum/birit narim</i> corresponded to a similar geographical concept and coined at the time of the <!--del_lnk--> Aramaicization of the region. It is however widely accepted that early Mesopotamian societies simply referred to the entire <!--del_lnk--> alluvium as <b>kalam</b> in Sumerian (lit. &quot;land&quot;). More recently terms like &quot;Greater Mesopotamia&quot; or &quot;Syro-Mesopotamia&quot; have been adopted to refer to wider geographies corresponding to the Near East or Middle East. The later euphemisms are Euro-centric terms attributed to the region in the midst of various 19th century Western encroachments.<p>

      <p>Mesopotamian history extends from the emergence of urban socities in Southern Iraq in the 4th millennium BC to the arrival of Alexander the Great in the 4th century BC (which is seen as the hallmark of the Hellenization of the Near East, therefore supposedly marking the &quot;end&quot; of Mesopotamia). A cultural continuity and spatial homogeneity for this entire historical geography(&quot;the Great Tradition&quot;) is popularly assumed, though the assumption is problematic. Mesopotamia housed some of the world&#39;s most ancient states with highly developed social complexity. The region was as one of the famous four riverine civilizations where writing was first invented, along with the Nile valley in <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, the Indus Valley in the <!--del_lnk--> Indian Subcontinent and Yellow River valley in <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>.<p>Mesopotamia housed historically important cities such as <!--del_lnk--> Uruk, <!--del_lnk--> Nippur, <!--del_lnk--> Nineveh, and <!--del_lnk--> Babylon as well as major territorial states such as the <!--del_lnk--> Akkadian kingdom, <!--del_lnk--> Third Dynasty of Ur, and <!--del_lnk--> Assyrian empire. Some of the important historical Mesopotamian leaders were <!--del_lnk--> Ur-Nammu (king of Ur), <!--del_lnk--> Sargon (who established the Akkadian Kingdom), <a href="../../wp/h/Hammurabi.htm" title="Hammurabi">Hammurabi</a> (who established the Old Babylonian state), <!--del_lnk--> Tiglath-Pileser I (who established the Assyrian Empire), and <!--del_lnk--> Tigranes the Great (who established the <a href="../../wp/a/Armenia.htm" title="Armenia">Armenian</a> Empire).<p>&quot;Ancient Mesopotamia&quot; includes the period from the late <!--del_lnk--> 4th millennium BC until the rise of the <!--del_lnk--> Achaemenids in the <!--del_lnk--> 6th century BC. This long period may be divided as follows:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Hassuna, <!--del_lnk--> Samarra and <!--del_lnk--> Halaf &quot;cultures&quot; (Late Neolithic)<li><!--del_lnk--> Ubaid period (ca 5900 BC - 4000 BC)<li><!--del_lnk--> Uruk period (ca 4000 BC - 3100 BC)<li>Jemdet Nasr Period (ca 3100 BC - 2900 BC)<li>Early Dynastic city states (ca 2900-2350 BC)<li><a href="../../wp/a/Akkadian_Empire.htm" title="Akkadian Empire">Akkadian Empire</a> (ca 2350 BC - 2193 BC).<li><!--del_lnk--> Third dynasty of Ur (&quot;Sumerian Renaissance&quot; or &quot;Neo-Sumerian Period&quot;) (ca 2119 BC - 2204 BC)<li><!--del_lnk--> Early Assyrian kingdom 20th to 18th c.<li><!--del_lnk--> First Babylonian Dynasty 18th to 17th c.<li><!--del_lnk--> Kassite dynasty, <!--del_lnk--> Middle Assyrian period 16th to 12th c.<li>Dark Age 12th to 10th c.<li><!--del_lnk--> Neo-Assyrian Empire 10th to 7th c.<li><!--del_lnk--> Neo-Babylonian Empire 7th to 6th c.</ul>
      <p>Dates are approximate for the second and third millennia BC; compare <!--del_lnk--> Chronology of the Ancient Near East.<p><a id="Language_and_writing" name="Language_and_writing"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Language and writing</span></h2>
      <p>The earliest written <a href="../../wp/l/Language.htm" title="Language">language</a> in Mesopotamia was <!--del_lnk--> Sumerian, a <!--del_lnk--> language isolate. Scholars agree that other languages were also spoken in early Mesopotamia along with Sumerian. Later a <!--del_lnk--> Semitic language, <!--del_lnk--> Akkadian, came to be the dominant language, although Sumerian was retained for <!--del_lnk--> administrative, <!--del_lnk--> religious, <!--del_lnk--> literary, and <!--del_lnk--> scientific purposes. Different varieties of Akkadian were used until the end of the Neo-Babalonian period. Then <!--del_lnk--> Aramaic, which had already become common in Mesopotamia, became the official language of the <!--del_lnk--> Achaemenid <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Empire.htm" title="Persian Empire">Persian Empire</a>. Akkadian fell into disuse, but both it and Sumerian were still used in <!--del_lnk--> temples for some centuries.<p>Mesopotamians invented cuneiform. Cuneiform was the first form of writing. It was a collection of symbols and wiggly lines. Most people couldn&#39;t read or write so they had to hire scribes.<p><a id="Science_and_technology" name="Science_and_technology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Science and technology</span></h2>
      <p>Mesopotamian people developed many technologies, among them <!--del_lnk--> metalworking, <a href="../../wp/g/Glass.htm" title="Glass">glassmaking</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Textile.htm" title="Textile">textile weaving</a>, food control, and water storage and <a href="../../wp/i/Irrigation.htm" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a>. They were also one of the first <!--del_lnk--> Bronze age people in the world. Early on they used <a href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper">copper</a>, <!--del_lnk--> bronze and <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a>, and later they used <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a>. Palaces were decorated with hundreds of kilograms of these very expensive metals. Also, copper, bronze, and iron were used for <!--del_lnk--> armor as well as for different weapons such as <!--del_lnk--> swords, <!--del_lnk--> daggers, <!--del_lnk--> spears, and <!--del_lnk--> maces.<p><a id="Mathematics" name="Mathematics"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Mathematics</span></h3>

      <p>The Mesopotamians used a <!--del_lnk--> sexagesimal (base 60) <!--del_lnk--> numeral system. This is the source of the current 60-minute <!--del_lnk--> hour and 24-hour <!--del_lnk--> day, as well as the 360 <!--del_lnk--> degree circle. The Sumerian calendar also measured weeks of seven days each. This mathematical knowledge was used in <!--del_lnk--> mapmaking.<p><a id="Astronomy" name="Astronomy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Astronomy</span></h3>
      <p>The Babylonian astronomers were very interested in studying the stars and sky, and most could already predict eclipses and solstices. People thought that everything had some purpose in astronomy. Most of these related to religion and omens. Mesopotamian astronomers worked out a 12 month calender based on the cycles of the moon. They divided the year into two seasons: summer and winter. The origins of <!--del_lnk--> astrology probably date from this time.<p><a id="Religion" name="Religion"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h2>
      <p>Mesopotamian <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religion</a> is the oldest religion recorded. Mesopotamians believed that the world was a flat <!--del_lnk--> disc, surrounded by a huge, holed space, and above that, <!--del_lnk--> heaven. They also believed that water was everywhere, the top, bottom and sides, and that the <a href="../../wp/u/Universe.htm" title="Universe">universe</a> was born from this enormous sea. Mesopotamian religion was highly <!--del_lnk--> polytheistic, that is people believed in many gods.<p>Although the <!--del_lnk--> beliefs described above were held in common among Mesopotamians, there were also regional variations. The Sumerian word for universe is an-ki, which refers to the god An and the goddess Ki. Their son was Enlil, the air god. They believed that Enlil was the most powerful god. He was the chief god of the <!--del_lnk--> Pantheon, as the Greeks had <a href="../../wp/z/Zeus.htm" title="Zeus">Zeus</a> and the Romans had <a href="../../wp/j/Jupiter.htm" title="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>. The Sumerians also posed <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosophical</a> questions, such as: Who are we?, Where are we?, How did we get here?. They attributed answers to these questions to explanations provided by their gods.<p>If someone was sick they <!--del_lnk--> prayed to the gods so that person would recover. As mentioned above, the Mesopotamian doctors were not medically advanced, so instead people asked help from the gods.<p><a id="Primary_gods_and_goddesses" name="Primary_gods_and_goddesses"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Primary gods and goddesses</span></h3>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> An was the Sumerian god of the sky. He was married to Ki, but in some other Mesopotamian religions he has a wife called Ura&scaron;.<li><!--del_lnk--> Marduk was the principal god of <!--del_lnk--> Babylon. The people glorified him, so he would allow <!--del_lnk--> Babylon to rise into a great empire from a small state.<li><!--del_lnk--> Gula,*<!--del_lnk--> Utu (also called <!--del_lnk--> &Scaron;ama&scaron; or <!--del_lnk--> Sahamash) was the sun god.<li><!--del_lnk--> Ishtar was the goddess of <a href="../../wp/l/Love.htm" title="Love">love</a> and of <!--del_lnk--> sex.<li><!--del_lnk--> Enlil was the most powerful god in Mesopotamian religion. His wife was <!--del_lnk--> Ninlil, and his children were <!--del_lnk--> Inanna, <!--del_lnk--> I&scaron;kur, <!--del_lnk--> Nanna-Suen, <!--del_lnk--> Nergal, <!--del_lnk--> Ninurta, <!--del_lnk--> Pabilsag, <!--del_lnk--> Nushu, <!--del_lnk--> Utu, <!--del_lnk--> Ura&scaron; Zababa and <!--del_lnk--> Ennugi.<li><!--del_lnk--> Nabu was the Mesopotamian god of writing. He was very wise, and was praised for his writing ability. In some places he was believed to be in control of heaven and earth.<li><!--del_lnk--> I&scaron;kur (or <!--del_lnk--> Adad) was the god of storms.<li><!--del_lnk--> Ninurta was the Sumerian god of war. He was also the god of heroes.<li><!--del_lnk--> Inanna, the Sumerian goddess of love and war, was also the wife of <!--del_lnk--> Ninurta.<li><!--del_lnk--> Pazuzu, also known as <!--del_lnk--> Zu, was an evil god, who stole the tablets of <!--del_lnk--> Enlil&rsquo;s destiny, and is killed because of this. He also brought diseases which had no known cure.</ul>
      <p><a id="Burials" name="Burials"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Burials</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Archeologists found hundreds of <!--del_lnk--> graves in some parts of Mesopotamia. These graves tell us many things about Mesopotamian <!--del_lnk--> burial habits. In the city of <!--del_lnk--> Ur, most people were buried in family graves under their houses. Children were put in big jars and were taken to the family <!--del_lnk--> chapel. Other people were just buried into common city <!--del_lnk--> graveyards. A few people were wrapped in mats and <!--del_lnk--> carpets. In most graves some belongings of the people were with them, and there were 17 graves with very precious objects in them so it is assumed that these were royal graves.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Music_and_songs" name="Music_and_songs"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Music and songs</span></h3>
      <p>Some were written for the gods but many were written to describe important events. Although music and songs amused <!--del_lnk--> kings and <!--del_lnk--> rulers, they were also enjoyed by ordinary people who liked to sing and dance in their homes or in the <!--del_lnk--> marketplaces. Songs were sung to children who passed them on to their children. Thus songs were passed on through many <!--del_lnk--> generations until someone wrote them down. These songs provided a means of passing on through the <!--del_lnk--> centuries highly important <a href="../../wp/i/Information.htm" title="Information">information</a> about <a href="../../wp/h/History.htm" title="History">historical events</a> that were eventually passed on to us.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Oud (Arabic:&#x627;&#x644;&#x639;&#x648;&#x62F;) is a small, stringed musical instrument. The oldest pictorial record of the Oud dates back to the <!--del_lnk--> Uruk period in Southern Mesopotamia over 5000 years ago. It is on a cylinder seal currently housed at the British Museum and acquired by Dr. Dominique Collon. The <!--del_lnk--> image depicts a female crouching with her instruments upon a <a href="../../wp/b/Boat.htm" title="Boat">boat</a>, playing <!--del_lnk--> right-handed. This instrument appears hundreds of times throughout Mesopotamian history and again in ancient <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> from the 18th <!--del_lnk--> dynasty onwards in long- and short-neck varieties.<p>The oud is regarded as a <!--del_lnk--> precursor to the <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="European">European</a> <!--del_lnk--> lute. Its name is derived from the Arabic word &#x627;&#x644;&#x639;&#x648;&#x62F; al-&lsquo;&#x16B;d &#39;the wood&#39;, which is probably the name of the tree from which the oud was made. (The Arabic name, with the definite article, is the source of the word &#39;lute&#39;.)<p><a id="Games" name="Games"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Games</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Hunting was popular among Assyrian kings. <!--del_lnk--> Boxing and <a href="../../wp/w/Wrestling.htm" title="Wrestling">wrestling</a> feature frequently in art, and <!--del_lnk--> polo was probably popular, although with men sitting on the shoulders of other men rather than on horses. . They also had the first board game simalar to one we have now.<p><a id="Family_life" name="Family_life"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Family life</span></h3>
      <p>Infant mortality was between 75 to 95 percent. As for schooling, only royal offspring and sons of the rich and professionals such as scribes, physicians, temple administrators, and so on, went to school. Most boys were taught their father&#39;s trade or were apprenticed out to learn a trade. Girls had to stay home with their mothers to learn <!--del_lnk--> housekeeping and <!--del_lnk--> cooking, and to look after the younger children. Unusual for that time in history, women had <!--del_lnk--> rights. They could own <a href="../../wp/p/Property.htm" title="Property">property</a> and, if they had good reason, get a <!--del_lnk--> divorce.<p><a id="Agriculture" name="Agriculture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Agriculture</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Food supply in Mesopotamia was quite rich due to the location of the two rivers from which its name is derived, <a href="../../wp/t/Tigris.htm" title="Tigris">Tigris</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Euphrates.htm" title="Euphrates">Euphrates</a>. Although land nearer to the rivers was <!--del_lnk--> fertile and good for <!--del_lnk--> crops, portions of land further from the water were dry and largely uninhabitable. This is why the development of <a href="../../wp/i/Irrigation.htm" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a> was very important for <!--del_lnk--> settlers of Mesopotamia. Other Mesopotamian <!--del_lnk--> innovations include the control of water by <!--del_lnk--> dams and the use of <!--del_lnk--> aqueducts. Early settlers of fertile land in Mesopotamia used <a href="../../wp/w/Wood.htm" title="Wood">wooden</a> <!--del_lnk--> plows to soften the <a href="../../wp/s/Soil.htm" title="Soil">soil</a> before planting crops such as <a href="../../wp/b/Barley.htm" title="Barley">barley</a>, <!--del_lnk--> onions, <!--del_lnk--> grapes, <!--del_lnk--> turnips, and <a href="../../wp/a/Apple.htm" title="Apples">apples</a>. Mesopotamian settlers were some of the first people to make <a href="../../wp/b/Beer.htm" title="Beer">beer</a> and <a href="../../wp/w/Wine.htm" title="Wine">wine</a>. The unpredictable Mesopotamian weather was often hard on farmers; crops were often ruined so backup sources of food such as cows and lambs were also kept. As a result of the skill involved in farming in the Mesopotamian, farmers did not depend on <!--del_lnk--> slaves to complete farm work for them, with some exceptions. There were too many risks involved to make slavery practical (i.e. the escape/mutiny of the <!--del_lnk--> slave).<p><a id="Government" name="Government"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Government</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Kings" name="Kings"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Kings</span></h3>
      <p>The Mesopotamians believed their kings and queens were descended from the city <a href="../../wp/g/God.htm" title="God">gods</a>, but, unlike the <!--del_lnk--> ancient Egyptians, they never believed their kings were actually gods. Most kings named themselves &ldquo;king of the universe&rdquo; or &ldquo;great king&rdquo;. Another common name was &ldquo;<!--del_lnk--> shepherd&rdquo;, as kings had to look after their people.<p><!--del_lnk--> Nebuchadnezzar was the most powerful king in <a href="../../wp/b/Babylonia.htm" title="Babylonia">Babylonia</a>. He was thought to be the son of the god Nabu. He married the daughter of Cyaxeres, so the Median and the <a href="../../wp/b/Babylonia.htm" title="Babylonia">Babylonian</a> <!--del_lnk--> dynasties had a familial connection. Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s name means: Nabo, protect the crown! Belshedezzar was the last king of Babylonia. He was the son of Nabonidus whose wife was Nictoris, the daughter of <!--del_lnk--> Nebuchadnezzar.<p>The first king of the first dynasty of Ur (around 2560) was Mesanepada. He made Ur Sumer&rsquo;s main city.<p><b>First Dynasty of Ur c. 2563&ndash;2387 B.C.</b><ul>

      <p>When <a href="../../wp/a/Assyria.htm" title="Assyria">Assyria</a> grew into an <!--del_lnk--> empire, it was divided into smaller parts, called <!--del_lnk--> provinces. Each of these were named after their main cities, like Nineveh, <!--del_lnk--> Samaria, <a href="../../wp/d/Damascus.htm" title="Damascus">Damascus</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Arpad. They all had their own <!--del_lnk--> governor who had to make sure everyone paid their taxes; he had to call up <!--del_lnk--> soldiers to <a href="../../wp/w/War.htm" title="War">war</a>, and supply <!--del_lnk--> workers when a <!--del_lnk--> temple was built. He was also responsible for the laws being enforced. In this way it was easier to keep control of an empire like Assyria. Although Babylon was quite a small <!--del_lnk--> state in the Sumerian, it grew tremendously throughout the time of <a href="../../wp/h/Hammurabi.htm" title="Hammurabi">Hammurabi</a>&#39;s rule. He was known as &ldquo;the law maker&rdquo;, and soon <!--del_lnk--> Babylon became one of the main cities in Mesopotamia. It was later called Babylonia, which meant &quot;the gateway of the gods.&quot; It also became one of history&#39;s greatest centers of learning.<p><a id="Warfare" name="Warfare"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Warfare</span></h3>
      <p>As <!--del_lnk--> city-states began to grow, their spheres of influence overlapped, creating arguments between other city-states, especially over <!--del_lnk--> land and canals. These arguments were recorded in tablets several hundreds of years before any major war - the first recording of a war occurred around 3200BC but was not common until about 2500BC. At this point warfare was incorporated into the Mesopotamian political system, where a neutral city may act as an arbitrator for the two rival cities. This helped to form unions between cities, leading to regional states. When <!--del_lnk--> empires were created, they went to war more with foreign countries. King Sargon, for example conquered all the cities of <a href="../../wp/s/Sumer.htm" title="Sumer">Sumer</a>, some cities in Mari, and then went to war with northern <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a>. Many Babylonian <!--del_lnk--> palace walls were decorated with the pictures of the successful fights and the <!--del_lnk--> enemy, whether desperately escaping, or hiding amongst reeds. A king in Sumer, Gilgamesh, was thought two-thirds god and only one third human. There were legendary stories and poems about him, which were passed on for many generations, because he had many adventures that were believed very important, and won many wars and battles.<p><a id="Laws" name="Laws"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Laws</span></h3>
      <p><a href="../../wp/h/Hammurabi.htm" title="Hammurabi">King Hammurabi</a>, as mentioned above, was famous for his set of laws, <a href="../../wp/c/Code_of_Hammurabi.htm" title="Code of Hammurabi">The Code of Hammurabi</a> (created ca. 1780 BC), which is one of the earliest sets of laws found and one of the best preserved examples of this type of document from ancient Mesopotamia. <i>For more information, see <a href="../../wp/h/Hammurabi.htm" title="Hammurabi">Hammurabi</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Code_of_Hammurabi.htm" title="Code of Hammurabi">Code of Hammurabi</a>.</i> There was 282 brutal laws in Hammurabi&#39;s code. They were so brutal so the people would follow the law.<p><a id="Architecture" name="Architecture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Architecture</span></h2>
      <p>The study of ancient Mesopotamian architecture is based available <!--del_lnk--> archaeological evidence, pictorial representation of buildings and texts on building practices. Scholarly literature usually concentrates on temples, palaces, city walls and gates and other monumental buildings, but occasionally one finds works on residential architecture as well. Archaeological surface surveys also allowed for the study of urban form in early Mesopotamian cities. Most notably known architectural remains from early Mesopotamia are the temple complexes at <!--del_lnk--> Uruk from the 4th millennium BC, temples and palaces from the <!--del_lnk--> Early Dynastic period sites in the <!--del_lnk--> Diyala River valley such as Khafajah and Tell Asmar, the <!--del_lnk--> Third Dynasty of Ur remains at <!--del_lnk--> Nippur (Sanctuary of <!--del_lnk--> Enlil) and <!--del_lnk--> Ur (Sanctuary of <!--del_lnk--> Nanna), Middle <a href="../../wp/b/Bronze_Age.htm" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a> remains at Syrian-Turkish sites of <!--del_lnk--> Ebla, <!--del_lnk--> Mari, <!--del_lnk--> Alalakh, <!--del_lnk--> Aleppo and <!--del_lnk--> Kultepe, Late Bronze Age palaces at <!--del_lnk--> Bogazkoy (Hattusha), <!--del_lnk--> Ugarit, <!--del_lnk--> Ashur and <!--del_lnk--> Nuzi, Iron age palaces and temples at <!--del_lnk--> Assyrian (<!--del_lnk--> Kalhu/Nimrud, <!--del_lnk--> Khorsabad, <!--del_lnk--> Nineveh), <!--del_lnk--> Babylonian (<!--del_lnk--> Babylon), <!--del_lnk--> Urartian (<!--del_lnk--> Tushpa/Van Kalesi, <!--del_lnk--> Cavustepe, <!--del_lnk--> Ayanis, <!--del_lnk--> Armavir, <!--del_lnk--> Erebuni, <!--del_lnk--> Bastam) and <!--del_lnk--> Neo-Hittite sites (<!--del_lnk--> Karkamis, <!--del_lnk--> Tell Halaf, <!--del_lnk--> Karatepe). Houses are mostly known from Old Babylonian remains at Nippur and Ur. Among the textual sources on building construction and associated rituals, Gudea&#39;s cylinders from the late 3rd millennium are notable, as well as the Assyrian and Babylonian royal inscriptions from the <a href="../../wp/i/Iron_Age.htm" title="Iron Age">Iron Age</a>.<p><a id="Houses" name="Houses"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Houses</span></h3>
      <p>The materials used to build a Mesopotamian house were the same as those used today: mud brick, mud plaster and wooden doors, which were all naturally available round the city, although wood could not be naturally made very well during the particular time period described. Most houses had a square centre room with other rooms attached to it, but a great variation in the size and materials used to build the houses suggest they were built by the inhabitants themselves <!--del_lnk--> . The smallest rooms may not have coincided with the poorest people; in fact it could be that the poorest people built houses out of perishable materials such as reeds on the outside of the city, but there is very little direct evidence for this.<p><a id="The_Palace" name="The_Palace"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Palace</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> palaces of the early Mesopotamian elites were large scale complexes, and were often lavishly decorated. Earliest examples are known from the <!--del_lnk--> Diyala River valley sites such as Khafajah and Tell Asmar. These third millennium BC palaces functioned as a large scale socio-economic institutions, therefore, along with residential and private function, they housed craftsmen workshops, food storehouses, ceremonial courtyards, and often associated with shrines. For instance, the so-called &quot;giparu&quot; (or Gig-Par-Ku in Sumerian) at Ur where the Moon god <!--del_lnk--> Nanna&#39;s priestesses resided was a major complex with multiple courtyards, a number of sanctuaries, burial chambers for dead priestesses, a ceremonial banquet hall, etc. A similarly complex example of a Mesopotamian palace was excavated at <!--del_lnk--> Mari in <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a>, dating from the <!--del_lnk--> Old Babylonian period.<p>Assyrian palaces of the Iron Age, especially at Kalhu/<!--del_lnk--> Nimrud, Dur Sharrukin/<!--del_lnk--> Khorsabad and Ninuwa/<!--del_lnk--> Nineveh, have become famous due to the pictorial and textual narrative programs on their walls, all carved on stone slabs known as orthostats. These pictorial programs either incorporated cultic scenes or the narrative accounts of the kings&#39; military and civic accomplishments. Gates and important passageways were flanked with massive stone sculpture of apotropaic mythological figures. The architectural arrangement of these Iron age palaces were also organized around large and small courtyards. Usually the king&#39;s throneroom opened to a massive ceremonial courtyard where important state councils met, state ceremonies performed.<p>Massive amounts of ivory furniture pieces were found in many <!--del_lnk--> Assyrian palaces pointing out an intense trade relationship with North Syrian <!--del_lnk--> Neo-Hittite states at the time. There is also good evidence that bronze repousse bands decorated the wooden gates.<p><a id="Ziggurats" name="Ziggurats"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Ziggurats</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Ziggurats (Akkadian <i>ziqquratu</i> from the verb zaq&#x101;ru) were massive stepped cult platforms found in certain Mesopotamian sanctuaries. The idea seems to have originated in early Mesopotamian temples which were built successively, one building over another on the same site over centuries, creating a massive mound that raised the new temples over the rest of the city. A good example of such structure was the temple dedicated to Ea at <!--del_lnk--> Eridu (Tell Abu Shahrain) excavated by Fuad Safar and Seton Lloyd in 1940s, or the &quot;White&quot; Temple dedicated to <!--del_lnk--> Anu at <!--del_lnk--> Uruk in the Late Uruk period. <!--del_lnk--> Ur-Nammu&#39;s ziggurat, built at the height the <!--del_lnk--> Third Dynasty of Ur, at the site of <!--del_lnk--> Ur (Tell al Mugayyar) in the sanctuary of the Moon God <!--del_lnk--> Nanna, is also believed to be encasing earlier temples of the <!--del_lnk--> Early Dynastic Period. Ur-Nammu&#39;s ziggurat is considered one of the earliest of all planned ziggurats. After that time <!--del_lnk--> Kassites and <!--del_lnk--> Elamites of the <!--del_lnk--> Late Bronze Age, and <!--del_lnk--> Assyrians and <!--del_lnk--> Babylonians of the <a href="../../wp/i/Iron_Age.htm" title="Iron age">Iron age</a> continued to build artificially erected ziggurats. Examples of such structures were found in Dur Kurigalzu (Aqar Quf), Dur-Untash (Tschoga Zanbil), Kalhu (Nimrud), Dur-Sharrukin (Khorsabad) and Babylon among others.<p>It has been suggested that ziggurats were built to resemble mountains, but there is little textual or archaeological evidence to support that hypothesis.<p>Ur-Nammu&#39;s ziggurat at Ur was designed as a three-stage construction, today only two of these survive. This entire mudbrick core structure was originally given a facing of baked brick envelope set in bitumen, circa 2.5 m on the first lowest stage, and 1.15 m on the second. Each of these baked bricks were stamped with the name of the king. The sloping walls of the stages were buttressed. The access to the top was by means of a triple monumental staircase, which all converges at a portal that opened on a landing between the first and second stages. The height of the first stage was about 11 m while the second stage rose some 5.7 m. Usually a third stage is reconstructed by the excavator of the ziqqurat (<!--del_lnk--> Leonard Woolley), and crowned by a temple. At the Tschoga Zanbil ziggurat archaeologists have found massive reed ropes that ran across the core of the ziggurat structure and tied together the mudbrick mass.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>
