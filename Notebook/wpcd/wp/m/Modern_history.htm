      <p><b>Early Modern,</b> historically speaking, refers to <!--del_lnk--> Western European history from the end of the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> (ca. 1450) to the beginning of <!--del_lnk--> Modern Times (ca. 1750). The Early Modern period includes the <!--del_lnk--> European Renaissance, the <!--del_lnk--> Protestant Reformation, and the beginning of the <a href="../../wp/a/Age_of_Enlightenment.htm" title="Age of Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a>. In the broadest sense, this period is characterized by the rise of <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">science</a> and <!--del_lnk--> technological progress, the <!--del_lnk--> secularization of <a href="../../wp/p/Politics.htm" title="Politics">politics</a>, and the diminution of the absolute authority of the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>.<p>The role of nobles in the <!--del_lnk--> Feudal System had yielded to the notion of the <!--del_lnk--> Divine Right of Kings during the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> (in fact, this consolidation of power from the land-owning nobles to the titular monarchs was one of the most prominent themes of the Middle Ages). Among the most notable political changes included the abolition of <!--del_lnk--> serfdom and the crystallization of kingdoms into nation-states. Perhaps even more significantly, with the advent of the <!--del_lnk--> Reformation, the notion of a <!--del_lnk--> Christendom as a unified political entity was destroyed. Many kings and rulers used this radical shift in the understanding of the world to further consolidate their sovereignty over their territories. For instance, many of the Germanic states (as well as <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English Reformation</a>) converted to <!--del_lnk--> Protestantism in an attempt to slip out of the grasp of the <a href="../../wp/p/Pope.htm" title="Pope">Pope</a>.<p>The intellectual developments of the period included the creation of the economic theory of <a href="../../wp/m/Mercantilism.htm" title="Mercantilism">mercantilism</a> and the publication of enduringly influential works of political and social <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>, such as <!--del_lnk--> Machiavelli&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> The Prince</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1513) and <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_More.htm" title="Thomas More">Thomas More</a>&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Utopia</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1515).<p><a id="Elizabethan_period_.28United_Kingdom.2C_1558.E2.80.931603.29" name="Elizabethan_period_.28United_Kingdom.2C_1558.E2.80.931603.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Elizabethan period (United Kingdom, 1558&ndash;1603)</span></h3>

      <p>The <b>Elizabethan Era</b> is the period associated with the reign of <a href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_I_of_England.htm" title="Elizabeth I of England">Queen Elizabeth I</a> (<!--del_lnk--> 1558&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 1603) and is often considered to be a <!--del_lnk--> golden age in <!--del_lnk--> English history. It was the height of the <!--del_lnk--> English Renaissance, and saw the flowering of <!--del_lnk--> English literature and <a href="../../wp/e/English_poetry.htm" title="English poetry">poetry</a>. This was also the time during which <!--del_lnk--> Elizabethan theatre grew. <a href="../../wp/w/William_Shakespeare.htm" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>, among others, composed plays that broke away from England&#39;s past style of plays. It was an age of expansion and exploration abroad. At home the <!--del_lnk--> Protestant Reformation was established and it was successfully defended against the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic</a> powers of <!--del_lnk--> the Continent.<p><a id="The_Reformation_.28Europe.2C_16th_century.29" name="The_Reformation_.28Europe.2C_16th_century.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Reformation (Europe, 16th century)</span></h3>
      <p>The <b><!--del_lnk--> Protestant Reformation</b> was a movement in the 16th century to reform the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a> in <!--del_lnk--> Western Europe. The Reformation was started by <a href="../../wp/m/Martin_Luther.htm" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a> with his <!--del_lnk--> 95 Theses on the practice of indulgences. In late October of <!--del_lnk--> 1517 he posted these theses to the door of the Castle Church in <!--del_lnk--> Wittenberg, commonly used to post notices to the University community. In November he mailed them to various religious authorities of the day. The reformation ended in division and the establishment of new institutions. The four most important traditions to emerge directly from the reformation were the <!--del_lnk--> Lutheran tradition, the <!--del_lnk--> Reformed (<!--del_lnk--> Calvinist, <!--del_lnk--> Presbyterian) tradition, the <!--del_lnk--> Anabaptist tradition, and the <!--del_lnk--> Anglican tradition. Subsequent protestant traditions generally trace their roots back to these initial four schools of the reformation. It also led to the <!--del_lnk--> Catholic or Counter Reformation within the Roman Catholic Church through a variety of new spiritual movements, reforms of religious communities, the founding of seminaries, the clarification of Catholic theology as well as structural changes in the institution of the Church.<p><a id="The_Age_of_Enlightenment_.28Europe.2C_18th_century.29" name="The_Age_of_Enlightenment_.28Europe.2C_18th_century.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Age of Enlightenment (Europe, 18th century)</span></h3>
      <p>The <b>Age of Enlightenment</b> refers to the <a href="../../wp/1/18th_century.htm" title="18th century">18th century</a> in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European philosophy</a>, and is often thought of as part of a period which includes the Age of Reason. The term also more specifically refers to a historical intellectual movement, <i>The Enlightenment</i>. This movement advocated <!--del_lnk--> rationality as a means to establish an authoritative system of <a href="../../wp/a/Aesthetics.htm" title="Aesthetics">aesthetics</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Ethics.htm" title="Ethics">ethics</a>, and <a href="../../wp/l/Logic.htm" title="Logic">logic</a>. The intellectual leaders of this movement regarded themselves as a courageous elite, and regarded their purpose as one of leading the world toward progress and out of a long period of doubtful <!--del_lnk--> tradition, full of irrationality, superstition, and tyranny, which they believed began during a historical period they called the <i><a href="../../wp/d/Dark_Ages.htm" title="Dark Ages">Dark Ages</a></i>. This movement also provided a framework for the <!--del_lnk--> American and <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French Revolutions</a>, the Latin American independence movement, and the <a href="../../wp/p/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth.htm" title="Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth">Polish</a> <!--del_lnk--> Constitution of May 3, and also led to the rise of <a href="../../wp/l/Liberalism.htm" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a> and the birth of <a href="../../wp/s/Socialism.htm" title="Socialism">socialism</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">communism</a>. It is matched by the high <a href="../../wp/b/Baroque.htm" title="Baroque">baroque</a> and classical eras in music, and the <!--del_lnk--> neo-classical period in the arts, and receives contemporary application in the unity of science movement which includes <!--del_lnk--> logical positivism.

      <p>The <b>Industrial Revolution</b> was the major <a href="../../wp/t/Technology.htm" title="Technology">technological</a>, <!--del_lnk--> socioeconomic and <a href="../../wp/c/Culture.htm" title="Culture">cultural</a> change in late <a href="../../wp/1/18th_century.htm" title="18th century">18th</a> and early <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a> that began in <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">Britain</a> and spread throughout the world. During that time, an <!--del_lnk--> economy based on <!--del_lnk--> manual labour was replaced by one dominated by industry and the <a href="../../wp/m/Manufacturing.htm" title="Manufacturing">manufacture</a> of <!--del_lnk--> machinery. It began with the mechanisation of the <a href="../../wp/t/Textile.htm" title="Textile">textile</a> industries and the development of <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a>-making techniques, and trade expansion was enabled by the introduction of <a href="../../wp/c/Canal.htm" title="Canal">canals</a>, improved <!--del_lnk--> roads and then <a href="../../wp/r/Rail_transport.htm" title="Rail transport">railways</a>. The introduction of <a href="../../wp/s/Steam_engine.htm" title="Steam engine">steam power</a> (fuelled primarily by <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a>) and powered machinery (mainly in <!--del_lnk--> textile manufacturing) underpinned the dramatic increases in production capacity. The development of all-metal <!--del_lnk--> machine tools in the first two decades of the 19th century facilitated the manufacture of more production machines for manufacturing in other industries.<p>The date of the Industrial Revolution is not exact. <!--del_lnk--> Eric Hobsbawm held that it &#39;broke out&#39; in the 1780s and wasn&#39;t fully felt until the 1830s or 1840s, while <!--del_lnk--> T.S. Ashton held that it occurred roughly between 1760 and 1830 (in effect the reigns of <a href="../../wp/g/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="George III of the United Kingdom">George III</a>, The <!--del_lnk--> Regency, and <a href="../../wp/g/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="George IV of the United Kingdom">George IV</a>).<p>The effects spread throughout <!--del_lnk--> Western Europe and <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a> during the 19th century, eventually affecting the majority of the world. The impact of this change on <a href="../../wp/s/Society.htm" title="Society">society</a> was enormous and is often compared to the <!--del_lnk--> Neolithic revolution, when mankind developed <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a> and gave up its <!--del_lnk--> nomadic lifestyle.<p>The first Industrial Revolution merged into the <!--del_lnk--> Second Industrial Revolution around 1850, when technological and economic progress gained momentum with the development of steam-powered <a href="../../wp/s/Ship.htm" title="Ship">ships</a> and railways, and later in the nineteenth century with the <!--del_lnk--> internal combustion engine and <!--del_lnk--> electric power generation.<p>It has been argued that <!--del_lnk--> GDP per capita was much more stable and progressed at a much slower rate until the industrial revolution and the emergence of the modern <!--del_lnk--> capitalist economy, and that it has since increased rapidly in capitalist countries.<p><a id="Napoleonic_Era" name="Napoleonic_Era"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Napoleonic Era</span></h2>
      <p>The <b>Napoleonic Era</b> is a period in the <!--del_lnk--> History of France and Europe. It is generally classified as the fourth stage of the <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>, the first being the <!--del_lnk--> National Assembly, the second being the <!--del_lnk--> Legislative Assembly, and the third being the <!--del_lnk--> Directory. The Napoleonic Era begins roughly with Napoleon&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> coup d&#39;&eacute;tat, overthrowing the Directory and ends at the <!--del_lnk--> Hundred Days and his defeat at <!--del_lnk--> Waterloo (<!--del_lnk--> November 9, <!--del_lnk--> 1799 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> June 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1815). The congress of vienna soon set out to restore Europe to pre-french revolution days.<p><a name="19th_century"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">19th century</span></h2>
      <p>The <b>19th century</b> lasted from <!--del_lnk--> 1801 to <!--del_lnk--> 1900 in the <!--del_lnk--> Gregorian calendar.<p>Historians sometimes define a &quot;Nineteenth Century&quot; <!--del_lnk--> historical era stretching from <!--del_lnk--> 1815 (the <!--del_lnk--> Congress of Vienna) to <!--del_lnk--> 1914 (the outbreak of the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">First World War</a>); alternatively, <!--del_lnk--> Eric Hobsbawm defined the <!--del_lnk--> &quot;Long Nineteenth Century&quot; as spanning the years <!--del_lnk--> 1789 to <!--del_lnk--> 1914.<p>During this century, the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish, <!--del_lnk--> Portuguese, and <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman</a> empires began to crumble and the <a href="../../wp/h/Holy_Roman_Empire.htm" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Mughal empires ceased.<p>Following the <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleonic_Wars.htm" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> became the world&#39;s leading power, controlling one quarter of the World&#39;s population and one third of the land area. It enforced a <!--del_lnk--> Pax Britannica, encouraged trade, and battled rampant piracy.<p><a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">Slavery</a> was greatly reduced around the world. Following a successful <!--del_lnk--> slave revolt in Haiti, Britain forced the <!--del_lnk--> Barbary pirates to halt their practice of kidnapping and enslaving Europeans, <!--del_lnk--> banned slavery throughout its domain, and charged its navy with ending the global slave trade. Slavery was then abolished in <!--del_lnk--> Russia, <!--del_lnk--> America, and <!--del_lnk--> Brazil (see <!--del_lnk--> Abolitionism).<p>Electricity, steel, and petroleum fueled a <!--del_lnk--> Second Industrial Revolution which enabled <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>, and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> to become <!--del_lnk--> Great Powers that <!--del_lnk--> raced to create empires of their own. However, <!--del_lnk--> Russia and <a href="../../wp/q/Qing_Dynasty.htm" title="Qing Dynasty">Qing Dynasty</a> China failed to keep pace with the other world powers which led to massive social unrest in both empires.<p><a name="20th_century"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">20th century</span></h2>
      <p>Above all, the <b><a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a></b> is distinguished from most of human history in that its most significant changes were directly or indirectly economic and technological in nature.<p>Economic development was the force behind vast changes in everyday life, to a degree which was unprecedented in human history. The great changes of centuries before the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th</a> were more connected with ideas, religion or military conquest, and technological advance had only made small changes in the material wealth of ordinary people. Over the course of the 20th century, the world&rsquo;s per-capita <!--del_lnk--> gross domestic product grew by a factor of five<!--del_lnk--> , much more than all earlier centuries combined (including the 19th with its <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>). Many economists make the case that this understates the magnitude of growth, as many of the goods and services consumed at the end of the century, such as improved medicine (causing world life expectancy to increase by more than two decades) and communications technologies, were not available at any price at its beginning. However, the gulf between the world&rsquo;s rich and poor grew much wider than it had ever been in the past, and the majority of the global population remained in the poor side of the divide.<p>Still, advancing technology and medicine has had a great impact even in the <!--del_lnk--> Global South. Large-scale industry and more centralized <a href="../../wp/m/Mass_media.htm" title="Mass media">media</a> made brutal dictatorships possible on an unprecedented scale in the middle of the century, leading to wars on unprecedented scales, but the increased communications also contributed to <!--del_lnk--> democratization.<p>Technological developments included the development of <!--del_lnk--> airplanes and <a href="../../wp/s/Space_exploration.htm" title="Space exploration">space exploration</a>, <!--del_lnk--> nuclear technology, advancement in <a href="../../wp/g/Genetics.htm" title="Genetics">genetics</a>, and the dawning of the <!--del_lnk--> Information Age.<p>Major political developments included the <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israeli</a>&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> Palestinian conflict, two world wars, and the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>.<p><a id="World_War_I" name="World_War_I"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">World War I</span></h3>
      <p>The <b>First World War</b>, also known as the <b>Great War</b>, <b>The War to End All Wars</b>, and <b>World War I</b> (abbreviated <b>WWI</b>) after 1939, was a <!--del_lnk--> world conflict, raging from July 1914 to the final <!--del_lnk--> Armistice on <!--del_lnk--> 1918-<!--del_lnk--> 11-11. The <!--del_lnk--> Allied Powers, led by the <!--del_lnk--> British Empire, <!--del_lnk--> France, <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> until March <!--del_lnk--> 1918, and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> after 1917, defeated the <!--del_lnk--> Central Powers, led by the <!--del_lnk--> German Empire, <!--del_lnk--> Austro-Hungarian Empire and the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. The war caused the disintegration of four empires &mdash; the Austro-Hungarian, German, Ottoman, and Russian ones &mdash; as well as radical change in the European and Middle Eastern maps. The Allied powers before 1917 are sometimes referred to as the <!--del_lnk--> Triple Entente, and the Central Powers are sometimes referred to as the <!--del_lnk--> Triple Alliance.<p>Much of the fighting in World War I took place along the <a href="../../wp/w/Western_Front_%2528World_War_I%2529.htm" title="Western Front (World War I)">Western Front</a>, within a system of opposing manned trenches and fortifications (separated by a &ldquo;<!--del_lnk--> No man&#39;s land&rdquo;) running from the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea.htm" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> to the border of <a href="../../wp/s/Switzerland.htm" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. On the <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Front, the vast eastern plains and limited rail network prevented a trench warfare stalemate from developing, although the scale of the conflict was just as large. Hostilities also occurred on and under the sea and &mdash; for the first time &mdash; from the air. More than 9 million soldiers died on the various battlefields, and nearly that many more in the participating countries&#39; home fronts on account of food shortages and <!--del_lnk--> genocide committed under the cover of various civil wars and internal conflicts. Notably, more people died of the worldwide <!--del_lnk--> influenza outbreak at the end of the war and shortly after than died in the hostilities. The unsanitary conditions engendered by the war, severe overcrowding in barracks, wartime propaganda interfering with public health warnings, and migration of so many soldiers around the world helped the outbreak become a <!--del_lnk--> pandemic.<p>Ultimately, World War I created a decisive break with the old <!--del_lnk--> world order that had emerged after the <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleonic_Wars.htm" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, which was modified by the mid-19th century&rsquo;s nationalistic revolutions. The results of World War I would be important factors in the development of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> approximately 20 years later.<p><a id="World_War_II" name="World_War_II"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">World War II</span></h3>
      <p><b>World War II</b>, also <b>WWII</b>, or the <b>Second World War</b>, was a <!--del_lnk--> global <a href="../../wp/w/War.htm" title="War">military conflict</a> that took place in <!--del_lnk--> 1939&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 1945. It was the largest and deadliest war in history, culminating in the <a href="../../wp/t/The_Holocaust.htm" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> and ending with the dropping of the <!--del_lnk--> atom bomb.<p>Even though <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> had been fighting in <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> since <!--del_lnk--> 1937, the conventional view is that the war began on <!--del_lnk--> September 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1939, when <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> invaded <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Poland</a>. Within two days the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> declared war on Germany, even though the fighting was confined to Poland. Pursuant to a then-secret provision of its non-aggression <!--del_lnk--> Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> joined with Germany on <!--del_lnk--> September 17, <!--del_lnk--> 1939, to conquer Poland and to divide Eastern Europe.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Allies were initially made up of <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Poland</a>, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, as well as <!--del_lnk--> British Commonwealth countries which were controlled directly by the UK, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Indian Empire. All of these countries declared war on Germany in September 1939.<p>Following the lull in fighting, known as the &quot;Phony War&quot;, Germany invaded western Europe in May 1940. Six weeks later, France, in the mean time attacked by <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> as well, surrendered to Germany, which then tried unsuccessfully to conquer Britain. On <!--del_lnk--> September 27, Germany, Italy, and Japan signed a mutual defense agreement, the <!--del_lnk--> Tripartite Pact, and were known as the <!--del_lnk--> Axis Powers.<p>Nine months later, on <!--del_lnk--> June 22, <!--del_lnk--> 1941, Germany launched a massive invasion of the Soviet Union, which promptly joined the Allies. Germany was now engaged in fighting a war on two fronts. This proved to be a mistake by Germany - many historians believe that if Germany had successfully carried out the invasion of Britain and put forth their best effort, the war may have turned in favour of the Axis.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> December 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1941, <a href="../../wp/a/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor.htm" title="Attack on Pearl Harbor">Japan attacked the United States at Pearl Harbour</a>, bringing it too into the war on the Allied side. China also joined the Allies, as eventually did most of the rest of the world. China was in turmoil at the time, and attacked Japanese armies through guerrilla-type warfare. By the beginning of 1942, the major combatants were aligned as follows: the British Commonwealth, the United States, and the Soviet Union were fighting Germany and Italy; and the British Commonwealth, China, and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> were fighting Japan. From then through August 1945, battles raged across all of Europe, in the <!--del_lnk--> North Atlantic Ocean, across <a href="../../wp/n/North_Africa.htm" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>, throughout <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asia, throughout China, across the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> and in the air over Japan.<p>Italy surrendered in September 1943 and split in a northern Germany-occupied <!--del_lnk--> puppet state and in a Allies-friendly state in the South; Germany surrendered in May 1945. Following the <!--del_lnk--> atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, <!--del_lnk--> Japan surrendered, marking the end of the war on <!--del_lnk--> September 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1945.<p>It is possible that around 62 million people <!--del_lnk--> died in the war; estimates vary greatly. About 60% of all casualties were civilians, who died as a result of disease, starvation, <!--del_lnk--> genocide (in particular, the <a href="../../wp/t/The_Holocaust.htm" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>), and aerial bombing. The former Soviet Union and China suffered the most casualties. Estimates place deaths in the Soviet Union at around 23 million, while China suffered about 10 million. No country lost a greater portion of its population than Poland: approximately 5.6 million, or 16%, of its pre-war population of 34.8 million died.<p>The Holocaust (which roughly means &quot;burnt whole&quot;) was the deliberate, systematic, and horrific murder of millions of Jews during World War II by the Nazi regime in Germany. Several differing views exist regarding whether it was intended to occur from the war&#39;s beginning, or if the plans for it came about later. Regardless, persecution of Jews extended well before the war even started, such as in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Kristallnacht</i> (Night of Broken Glass). The Nazis used propaganda to great effect to stir up anti-Semitic feelings within ordinary Germans.<p>After World War II, <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> was informally split into Western and Soviet <!--del_lnk--> spheres of influence. <!--del_lnk--> Western Europe later aligned as <a href="../../wp/n/NATO.htm" title="NATO">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> (NATO) and <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Europe as the <!--del_lnk--> Warsaw Pact. There was a shift in power from Western Europe and the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> to the two new superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union. These two rivals would later face off in the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>. In Asia, the defeat of Japan led to its <!--del_lnk--> democratization. <!--del_lnk--> China&#39;s civil war continued through and after the war, resulting eventually in the establishment of the <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">People&#39;s Republic of China</a>. The former colonies of the European powers began their road to independence.<p><a id="The_World_at_the_End_of_the_Twentieth_century" name="The_World_at_the_End_of_the_Twentieth_century"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The World at the End of the Twentieth century</span></h3>
      <p>At the end of the twentieth century, the world was at a major crossroads. Throughout the century, more technological advances had been made than in all of preceding history. Computers, the Internet, and other technology radically altered daily lives. However, several problems faced the world.<p>First of all, the gap between rich and poor nations continued to widen. Some said that this problem could not be fixed, that there were a set amount of wealth and it could only be shared by so many. Others said that the powerful nations with large economies were not doing enough to help improve the rapidly evolving economies of the <!--del_lnk--> Third World. However, developing countries faced many challenges, including the scale of the task to be surmounted, rapidly growing populations, and the need to protect the environment, and the cost that goes along with it.<p>Secondly, disease threatened to destabilize many regions of the world. New viruses such as <!--del_lnk--> SARS, <!--del_lnk--> West Nile, and <!--del_lnk--> Bird Flu continued to spread quickly and easily. In poor nations, <a href="../../wp/m/Malaria.htm" title="Malaria">malaria</a> and other diseases affected the majority of the population. Millions were infected with <a href="../../wp/h/HIV.htm" title="HIV">HIV</a>, the virus which causes <a href="../../wp/a/AIDS.htm" title="AIDS">AIDS</a>. The virus was becoming an <!--del_lnk--> epidemic in southern Africa.<p>Increased <a href="../../wp/g/Globalization.htm" title="Globalization">globalization</a>, specifically <!--del_lnk--> Americanization, was also occurring. While not necessarily a threat, it was causing anti-Western and <!--del_lnk--> anti-American feelings in parts of the world, especially the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>. English was quickly becoming the global language, with people who did not speak it becoming increasingly disadvantaged.<p><a href="../../wp/t/Terrorism.htm" title="Terrorism">Terrorism</a>, <!--del_lnk--> dictatorship, and the spread of nuclear weapons were also issues requiring immediate attention. Wars were spreading, though as the era of <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil_fuel.htm" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuels</a> nears its end, this is only to be expected. Dictators such as <!--del_lnk--> Kim Jong-il in <a href="../../wp/n/North_Korea.htm" title="North Korea">North Korea</a> continued to lead their nations toward the development of nuclear weapons. The fear existed that not only are terrorists already attempting to get nuclear weapons, but that they have already obtained them.<p><a name="2000s"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">2000s</span></h2>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> The 2000s <i><!--del_lnk--> decade</i> refers to the years from <!--del_lnk--> 2000 to <!--del_lnk--> 2009, inclusive. Technically, however, the millennium began in 2001 because there is no such thing as the &quot;year zero&quot;, but in informal and non technical settings the millennium usually began in 2000. Many individuals do have their own beliefs of when the 2000s decade began. Informally, it can also include a few years at the end of the <!--del_lnk--> preceding decade or the beginning of the <!--del_lnk--> following decade. Others believe it pop culturally began right on target in <!--del_lnk--> 2000 or around <!--del_lnk--> 2002. Some also state that the symbolic beginning of the decade (and the <!--del_lnk--> 21st Century) was the <a href="../../wp/s/September_11%252C_2001_attacks.htm" title="9/11">9/11</a> attacks, although others find this view pessimistic.<p>So far, the 2000s has been marked generally with an escalation of the social issues of the <!--del_lnk--> 1990s, which included the rise of <a href="../../wp/t/Terrorism.htm" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a>, <!--del_lnk--> stress, the rapid, exponential expansion of economic globalization on an unprecedented scale , the rapid expansion of <a href="../../wp/c/Communication.htm" title="Communication">communications</a> and <!--del_lnk--> telecommunications with <!--del_lnk--> mobile phones and the <a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">Internet</a> and international pop culture.<p>In North America and the Middle East, most major political developments in the 2000s revolved around the <!--del_lnk--> War on Terrorism and the <!--del_lnk--> conflict in Iraq. Elsewhere, the major theme has been the rapid development of Asia&#39;s economic and political potential, with <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, experiencing immense economic growth, moving toward the status of a regional power and billion-consumer market. <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, along with many other developing countries, is also growing rapidly, and began integrating itself into the world economy.<p>Major events relating to the War on Terrorism include the <!--del_lnk--> September 11, 2001 Attacks, the <!--del_lnk--> Moscow Theatre Siege, the <!--del_lnk--> Madrid train bombings, the <!--del_lnk--> Beslan school hostage crisis, the <!--del_lnk--> 2005 London bombings, and the <!--del_lnk--> October 2005 New Delhi bombings. In the news almost daily, the terrorism and Iraq conflicts dominate headlines with controversy regarding their consequences and justifications.<p>A trend connecting economic and political events in North America, Asia and the Middle East is the rapidly increasing demand for fossil fuels, which, along with fewer new petroleum finds, greater extraction costs (see <!--del_lnk--> peak oil), and political turmoil, saw the price of gas and oil soar ~500% between <!--del_lnk--> 2000 and <!--del_lnk--> 2005. In some places, especially in Europe could see $5 a gallon, depending on their currency.<p>Also see <!--del_lnk--> Year 2000 problem, also known as Y2K.<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:885795-0!1!0!default!!en!2 and timestamp 20061207154927 -->
