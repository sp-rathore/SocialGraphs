The city&#39;s population of 10.4 million permanent inhabitants within the city boundaries  constitutes about 7% of the total Russian population. Likewise, it is the <!--del_lnk--> most populous city in Europe. Historically, its position was central in the Russian homeland. It was the capital of the former <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Muscovite Russia, the pre-Imperial Russian state. It is the site of the famous <!--del_lnk--> Kremlin, which now serves as the ceremonial residence of the <!--del_lnk--> President.<p>Moscow&#39;s architecture and performing arts culture are world-renowned.

The <!--del_lnk--> Patriarch of Moscow, whose residence is the <!--del_lnk--> Danilov Monastery, serves as the head of the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Orthodox Church. Moscow also remains a major economic centre and is home to a large number of <!--del_lnk--> billionaires; it is perennially considered <!--del_lnk--> one of the most expensive cities for expatriate employees in the world. It is home to many scientific and educational institutions, as well as numerous sport facilities. It possesses a complex transport system that includes the world&#39;s busiest <!--del_lnk--> metro system, which is famous for its architecture. Moscow also became the host of the <!--del_lnk--> 1980 Summer Olympics.<p>

      <p>The first reference to Moscow dates from 1147 when <!--del_lnk--> Yuri Dolgoruki called upon the prince of the <!--del_lnk--> Novgorod Republic to &quot;come to me, brother, to Moscow.&quot; Nine years later, in 1156, Prince <!--del_lnk--> Yuriy Dolgorukiy of <a href="../../wp/k/Kiev.htm" title="Kiev">Kiev</a> ordered the construction of a wooden wall, which had to be rebuilt multiple times, to surround the emerging Moscow. After the sacking of 1237-1238, when the <!--del_lnk--> Mongol-<!--del_lnk--> Tatars burned the city to the ground and killed its inhabitants, Moscow recovered and became the capital of an independent <a href="../../wp/p/Principality.htm" title="Principality">principality</a> in 1327. Its favorable position on the headwaters of the <!--del_lnk--> Volga river contributed to steady expansion. Moscow developed into a stable and prosperous principality for many years and attracted a large number of refugees from across Russia.<p>Under <!--del_lnk--> Ivan I the city replaced <!--del_lnk--> Tver as capital of <!--del_lnk--> Vladimir-Suzdal and became the sole collector of taxes for the <!--del_lnk--> Mongol-<!--del_lnk--> Tatar rulers. By paying high tribute, Ivan won an important concession from the <!--del_lnk--> Khan. Unlike other principalities, Moscow was not divided among his sons but was passed intact to his eldest. In 1380, prince <!--del_lnk--> Dmitry Donskoy of Moscow led a united Russian army to an important victory over the <!--del_lnk--> Tatars in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Kulikovo. After that, Moscow took the leading role in liberating <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> from <!--del_lnk--> Tatar domination. In 1480, <!--del_lnk--> Ivan III had <!--del_lnk--> finally broken the Russians free from <!--del_lnk--> Tatar control, allowing Moscow to become the centre of power in <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>. The Russian capital, which had wandered from Kiev to Vladimir, came to rest in this city by the end of his reign, and Moscow became the capital of an empire that would eventually encompass all of present-day Russia and parts of other lands.<p>The 17th century was rich in popular risings, such as the <!--del_lnk--> liberation of Moscow from the Polish-Lithuanian invaders (1612), the <!--del_lnk--> Salt Riot (1648), the <!--del_lnk--> Copper Riot (1662), and the <!--del_lnk--> Moscow Uprising of 1682. The city ceased to be Russia&#39;s capital in 1712, after the founding of <a href="../../wp/s/Saint_Petersburg.htm" title="Saint Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a> by <a href="../../wp/p/Peter_I_of_Russia.htm" title="Peter I of Russia">Peter the Great</a> on the <a href="../../wp/b/Baltic_Sea.htm" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic coast</a> in 1703. When <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleon_I_of_France.htm" title="Napoleon I of France">Napoleon</a> invaded in 1812, the Muscovites burned the city and evacuated, as Napoleon&#39;s forces were approaching on <!--del_lnk--> September 14. Napoleon&#39;s army, plagued by hunger, cold, and poor supply lines, was forced to retreat. In January 1905, the institution of the City Governor, or <!--del_lnk--> Mayor, was officially introduced in Moscow, and <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Adrianov became Moscow&#39;s first official mayor. Following the success of the <a href="../../wp/r/Russian_Revolution_of_1917.htm" title="Russian Revolution of 1917">Russian Revolution of 1917</a>, on <!--del_lnk--> March 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1918, Moscow became the capital of the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> less than five years later.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>During the <!--del_lnk--> Great Patriotic War, the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> State Committee of Defence and the General Staff of the <!--del_lnk--> Red Army was located in Moscow. In 1941, sixteen divisions of the national volunteers (more than 160,000 people), twenty-five battalions (18,500 people) and four engineering regiments were formed among the Muscovites. In November 1941, German <!--del_lnk--> Army Group Centre was stopped at the outskirts of the city and then driven off in the course of the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Moscow.htm" title="Battle of Moscow">Battle of Moscow</a>. Many factories were evacuated, together with much of the government, and from <!--del_lnk--> October 20 the city was declared to be under <a href="../../wp/s/Siege.htm" title="Siege">siege</a>. Its remaining inhabitants built and manned antitank defenses, while the city was bombarded from the air. It is of some note that Stalin refused to leave the city, meaning the general staff and the council of people&#39;s commissars remained in the city as well. Despite the siege and the bombings, the construction of <!--del_lnk--> Moscow&#39;s metro system, which began in the early 1930s, continued through the war and by the end of the war several new metro lines were opened. On <!--del_lnk--> May 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1944 a medal <i>For the defence of Moscow</i> and in 1947 another medal <i>In memory of the 800th anniversary of Moscow</i> were instituted. On <!--del_lnk--> May 8, <!--del_lnk--> 1965 in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the victory in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Moscow was one of twelve Soviet cities awarded the title of the <!--del_lnk--> Hero City. In 1980, it hosted the <!--del_lnk--> Summer Olympic Games.<p>In 1991 Moscow was the scene of a coup attempt by the government members opposed to the reforms of <a href="../../wp/m/Mikhail_Gorbachev.htm" title="Mikhail Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>. When the <!--del_lnk--> USSR was dissolved in the same year, Moscow continued to be the capital of <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>. Since then, the emergence of a <!--del_lnk--> market economy in Moscow has produced an explosion of Western-style retailing, services, <a href="../../wp/a/Architecture.htm" title="Architecture">architecture</a>, and lifestyles.<p><a id="Government" name="Government"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Government</span></h2>

      </div>
      <p>Moscow is the seat of power for the Russian Federation. At the centre of the city, in the <!--del_lnk--> Central Administrative Okrug, is the <!--del_lnk--> Moscow Kremlin, which houses the home of the <!--del_lnk--> President of Russia as well as many of the facilities for the national government. This includes numerous <!--del_lnk--> military headquarters and the headquarters of the <!--del_lnk--> Moscow Military District. Moscow, like with any national <a href="../../wp/c/Capital.htm" title="Capital">capital</a>, is also the host of all the foreign <!--del_lnk--> embassies and diplomats representing a multitude of nations in Russia. On a slightly smaller scale, Moscow is located within the <!--del_lnk--> Central Federal District, one of the seven <!--del_lnk--> federal districts of Russia. As result, it falls under the administration of a representative appointed by the <!--del_lnk--> President of Russia to head the district. Moscow is also designated as one of only two federal cities - <a href="../../wp/s/Saint_Petersburg.htm" title="Saint Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> being the other - within Russia. Since all <!--del_lnk--> Russian subjects - republics, provinces, cities, and territories - have two representatives within the <!--del_lnk--> Federation Council of Russia, the over 10 million Muscovites are represented by just two people - 1.1% of the Council - despite the fact that they account for 7.3% of the total population of Russia. Lastly, Moscow is located within the <!--del_lnk--> central economic region, one of <!--del_lnk--> twelve regions within Russia with similar economic goals.<p>The entire city of Moscow is headed by one <!--del_lnk--> mayor (currently <!--del_lnk--> Yuriy Luzhkov). It is divided into 10 administrative (<!--del_lnk--> okrugs) and 123 municipal districts. Administrative districts: Zelenogradskiy Administrative Okrug (City of <!--del_lnk--> Zelenograd in the federal classification), Northern Administrative Okrug, North-Eastern Administrative Okrug, North-Western Administrative Okrug, <!--del_lnk--> Central Administrative Okrug, Eastern Administrative Okrug, Southern Administrative Okrug, South-Eastern Administrative Okrug, South-Western Administrative Okrug, and Western Administrative Okrug. Nine of the ten administrative districts, except of Zelenogradskiy, are located within City of Moscow main boundaries.<p>Each administrative district consists of several municipal districts (<!--del_lnk--> raions). Each municipal and administrative district has its own <!--del_lnk--> coat of arms, flag, and elected head official. Additionally, most raions have their own cable television, computer network, and official newspaper. Along with municipal districts are Territorial Unities with Special Status or territories. These usually include areas with small or no permanent populations, such as the case with the <!--del_lnk--> All-Russia Exhibition Centre, the <!--del_lnk--> Botanical Garden, large parks, and industrial zones. In recent years, some territories have been merged with different raions. There are no ethnic-specific raions in Moscow in the manner <!--del_lnk--> Chinatowns exist in some <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North American</a> and <!--del_lnk--> East Asian cities. And although raions are not designated by income, as with most cities, those areas that are closer to the city centre, <!--del_lnk--> metro stations or green zones are considered more prestigious.<p>In addition to being the capital of Russia, Moscow is the capital of the <!--del_lnk--> Moscow Oblast. Since Moscow is a <!--del_lnk--> Federal City, it is not actually within the oblast. (See <!--del_lnk--> List of capitals outside of the territories they serve.)<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h2>

      <p>Moscow is exposed to cold winters, warm and mild summers, and very brief spring and autumn seasons. Typical high temperatures in the warm months of July and August are around 23<!--del_lnk--> &deg;C (68<!--del_lnk--> &deg;F); in the winter, temperatures normally drop to approximately -12<!--del_lnk--> &deg;C (10<!--del_lnk--> &deg;F). Monthly rainfall totals vary minimally throughout the year, although the <!--del_lnk--> precipitation levels tend to be higher during the summer than during the winter. Due to the significant variation in temperature between the winter and summer months as well as the limited fluctuation in precipitation levels during the summer, Moscow is considered to be within a <!--del_lnk--> continental climate zone.<p><a id="City_layout" name="City_layout"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">City layout</span></h2>

From there, the roads in general radiate out to intersect with a sequence of circular roads or &quot;rings&quot; focused at the Kremlin.<p>The first and innermost major ring, Bulvarnoye Koltso (<!--del_lnk--> Boulevard Ring), was built at the former location of the <a href="../../wp/1/16th_century.htm" title="16th century">sixteenth century</a> city wall around what used to be called <!--del_lnk--> Bely Gorod (White Town). The Bulvarnoye Koltso is technically not a ring; it does not form a complete circle, but instead a <!--del_lnk--> horseshoe-like arc that goes from the <!--del_lnk--> Cathedral of Christ the Saviour to the <!--del_lnk--> Yauza River. In addition, the Boulevard Ring changes street names numerous times throughout its journey across the city.<p>The second primary ring, located outside the Boulevard Ring, is the Sadovoye Koltso (<!--del_lnk--> Garden Ring). Like the Boulevard Ring, the Garden Ring follows the path of a sixteenth century wall that used to encompass part of the city. The third ring, the Third Transport Ring, was completed in 2003 as a high-speed <!--del_lnk--> freeway. The Fourth Transport Ring, another freeway, is currently under construction to further reduce traffic congestion. The outermost ring within Moscow is the <!--del_lnk--> Moscow Automobile Ring Road (often called the <i>MKAD</i> from the Russian <i>&#x41C;&#x43E;&#x441;&#x43A;&#x43E;&#x432;&#x441;&#x43A;&#x430;&#x44F; &#x41A;&#x43E;&#x43B;&#x44C;&#x446;&#x435;&#x432;&#x430;&#x44F; &#x410;&#x432;&#x442;&#x43E;&#x43C;&#x43E;&#x431;&#x438;&#x43B;&#x44C;&#x43D;&#x430;&#x44F; &#x414;&#x43E;&#x440;&#x43E;&#x433;&#x430;</i>), which forms the approximate boundary of the city.<p>Outside the city, some of the roads encompassing the city continue to follow this circular pattern seen inside city limits.<p><a id="Architecture" name="Architecture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Architecture</span></h2>

      <p>For a long time the view of the city was dominated by numerous orthodox churches. The look of the city changed drastically during Soviet times, mostly due to <a href="../../wp/j/Joseph_Stalin.htm" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>, who oversaw a large-scale effort to modernize the city. He introduced broad avenues and roadways, some of them over ten lanes wide, but he also destroyed a great number of historically significant architectural works. The <!--del_lnk--> Sukharev Tower, as well as numerous mansions and stores lining the major streets, and various works of religious architecture, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Kazan Cathedral and the <!--del_lnk--> Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, were all destroyed during Stalin&#39;s rule. During the 1990s, however, both the latter were rebuilt.<p>Architect <!--del_lnk--> Vladimir Shukhov was responsible for building several of Moscow&#39;s landmarks during early Soviet Russia. The <!--del_lnk--> Shukhov Tower, just one of many <!--del_lnk--> hyperboloid towers designed by Shukhov, was built between 1919 and 1922 as a transmission tower for a <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russian</a> broadcasting company. Shukhov also left a lasting legacy to the <a href="../../wp/c/Constructivism_%2528art%2529.htm" title="Constructivism (art)">Constructivist</a> architecture of early Soviet Russia. He designed spacious elongated shop galleries, most notably the <!--del_lnk--> Upper Trade Rows (GUM) on <!--del_lnk--> Red Square, bridged with innovative metal-and-glass vaults.<p>Stalin, however, is also credited with building the <!--del_lnk--> The Seven Sisters, comprising seven, cathedral-like structures. A defining feature of Moscow&#39;s skyline, their imposing form was allegedly inspired by the Municipal Building in <!--del_lnk--> New York, and their style - with intricate exteriors and a large central spire - has been described as <i><!--del_lnk--> Stalinist gothic architecture</i>. All seven towers can be seen from most elevations in the city; they are among the tallest constructions in central Moscow apart from the <!--del_lnk--> Ostankino Tower which, when it was completed in 1967, was the tallest free-standing land structure in the world and today remains the world&#39;s second-tallest. The Soviet policy of providing mandatory housing for every citizen or their family, and the rapid growth of the Muscovite population in Soviet times, also led to the construction of large, monotonous housing blocks, which can often be differentiated by age, sturdiness of construction, or &#39;style&#39; according to the neighbourhood and the materials used. Most of these date from the post-Stalin era and the styles are often named after the leader then in power - Brezhnev, Khrushchev, etc - and they are usually ill-maintained. The Stalinist-era constructions, usually in the central city, are massive and usually ornamented with <!--del_lnk--> Socialist realism motifs that imitate <!--del_lnk--> classical themes. However, small churches - almost always <a href="../../wp/e/Eastern_Orthodox_Church.htm" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Eastern Orthodox</a> - that hint on the city&#39;s past still dot various parts of the city. The Old <!--del_lnk--> Arbat, a popular tourist street that was once the heart of a bohemian area, preserves most of its buildings from prior to the <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">twentieth century</a>. Many buildings found off the main streets of the inner city (behind the Stalinist <!--del_lnk--> fa&ccedil;ades of <!--del_lnk--> Tverskaya Street, for example) are also examples of the <!--del_lnk--> bourgeois decadence in <!--del_lnk--> Tsarist times. <!--del_lnk--> Ostankino, <!--del_lnk--> Kuskovo, <!--del_lnk--> Uzkoye and other large estates just outside Moscow originally belong to nobles from the Tsarist era, and some <!--del_lnk--> convents and monasteries, both inside and outside the city, are open to Muscovites and tourists.<p>Attempts are being made to restore many of the city&#39;s best-kept examples of pre-Soviet architecture. These revamped structures are easily spotted by their bright new colours and spotless facades. There are a few examples of notable, early Soviet <!--del_lnk--> avant-garde work too, such as the house of the architect <!--del_lnk--> Konstantin Melnikov in the <!--del_lnk--> Arbat area. Later examples of interesting Soviet architecture are usually marked by their impressive size and the semi-<!--del_lnk--> Modernist styles employed, such as with the <!--del_lnk--> Novy Arbat project, familiarly known as &quot;false teeth of Moscow&quot; and notorious for the wide-scale disruption of a historic area in the Moscow downtown involved in the project.<p>Like in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, but on a broader scale, plaques on the house exteriors will inform passers-by that a well-known personality once lived there. Frequently the plaques are dedicated to Soviet celebrities not well-known to the outside world. There are also many &#39;house-museums&#39; of famous Russian writers, composers, and artists in the city.<p><a id="Views_of_Moscow" name="Views_of_Moscow"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Views of Moscow</span></h3>

      <p>Many of Moscow&#39;s museums and galleries have <!--del_lnk--> collections that can be compared to those of the best museums of <!--del_lnk--> Western Europe and <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>. Frequent art exhibitions thrive on both the new and the classic, as they once did in pre-<!--del_lnk--> Revolutionary times, and are derived from diverse branches of the arts - <a href="../../wp/p/Painting.htm" title="Painting">painting</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Photography.htm" title="Photography">photography</a>, and <a href="../../wp/s/Sculpture.htm" title="Sculpture">sculpture</a>.<p>One of the most notable art museums in Moscow is the <!--del_lnk--> Tretyakov Gallery, which was founded by <!--del_lnk--> Pavel Tretyakov, a wealthy patron of the arts who donated a large private collection to the city. Currently the Tretyakov Gallery is split into two buildings. The Old Tretyakov, the original gallery in the <!--del_lnk--> Tretyakovskaya area on the south bank of the <!--del_lnk--> Moskva River, houses the works of the classic Russian tradition. The works of famous pre-<!--del_lnk--> Revolutionary painters, such as <!--del_lnk--> Ilya Repin, as well as the works of early Russian <!--del_lnk--> icon painters can be found in the Old Tretyakov Gallery. Visitors can even see rare originals by early-<a href="../../wp/1/15th_century.htm" title="15th century">fifteenth century</a> <!--del_lnk--> iconographer <!--del_lnk--> Andrei Rublev. The New Tretyakov, created in Soviet times, mainly contains the works of Soviet artists, as well as of a few contemporary artists, but there is some overlap with the Old Tretyakov Gallery for early twentieth century art. The new gallery includes a small reconstruction of <!--del_lnk--> Vladimir Tatlin&#39;s famous <i><!--del_lnk--> Monument to the Third International</i> and a mixture of other <!--del_lnk--> avant-garde works by artists like <!--del_lnk--> Kazimir Malevich and <!--del_lnk--> Wassily Kandinsky. <!--del_lnk--> Socialist realism features can also be find within the halls of the New Tretyakov Gallery.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Another art museum in the city of Moscow is the <!--del_lnk--> Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, which was founded by, among others, <!--del_lnk--> Marina Tsvetaeva&#39;s father. The Pushkin Museum is similar to the <!--del_lnk--> British Museum in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> in that its halls are a cross-section of world civilizations, with many plaster casts of ancient sculptures. However, it also hosts famous paintings from every major Western era of art; works by <a href="../../wp/c/Claude_Monet.htm" title="Claude Monet">Claude Monet</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Paul_C%25C3%25A9zanne.htm" title="Paul C&eacute;zanne">Paul C&eacute;zanne</a>, and <a href="../../wp/p/Pablo_Picasso.htm" title="Pablo Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a> are all sampled there.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> State Historical Museum of Russia (&#x413;&#x43E;&#x441;&#x443;&#x434;&#x430;&#x440;&#x441;&#x442;&#x432;&#x435;&#x43D;&#x43D;&#x44B;&#x439; &#x418;&#x441;&#x442;&#x43E;&#x440;&#x438;&#x447;&#x435;&#x441;&#x43A;&#x438;&#x439; &#x43C;&#x443;&#x437;&#x435;&#x439;) is a museum of Russian history wedged between <!--del_lnk--> Red Square and <!--del_lnk--> Manege Square in Moscow. Its exhibitions range from relics of the prehistoric tribes inhabiting present-day Russia, through priceless artworks acquired by members of the Romanov dynasty. The total number of objects in the museum&#39;s collection numbers in the millions. The <!--del_lnk--> Polytechnical Museum, founded in 1872 is the largest technical museum in Russia, offering a wide array of historical inventions and technological achievements, including humanoid automata of the 18th century and the first Soviet computers. Its collection contains more than 160,000 items. The <!--del_lnk--> Borodino Panorama museum located on Kutuzov Avenue provides an opportunity for visitors to experience being on a battlefield with a 360&deg; <!--del_lnk--> diorama. It is a part of the large historical memorial commemorating the victory in the Patriotic War of 1812 over Napoleon&#39;s army, that includes also the Triumphal arch erected in 1827.<p><a id="Theatres_and_other_performing_arts" name="Theatres_and_other_performing_arts"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Theatres and other performing arts</span></h3>

      <p>During <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> times apartments were lent to people by the government according to the square meters-per-person norm (some groups, including people&#39;s artists, heroes and prominent scientists had bonuses according to their honours). <!--del_lnk--> Private ownership of apartments was limited until 1990, when people were permitted to secure property rights to the places they inhabited. Since the Soviet era, estate owners have had to pay the service charge for their residences, a fixed amount based on persons per living area. Due to the current economic situation, the price of <!--del_lnk--> real estate in Moscow continues to rise. Today, one could expect to pay $3800 in average per square meter in the outskirts of the city or $6000-$7000 per square meter in a prestigious district. The price sometimes may exceed $40000 per square meter in a flat.  A typical one-bedroom apartment is about thirty square meters, a typical two-bedroom apartment is forty-five square meters, and a typical three-bedroom apartment is seventy square meters. Many cannot move out of their apartments, especially if a family lives in a two-room apartment originally granted by the state during the Soviet era. Some city residents have attempted to cope with the cost of living by renting their apartments while staying in <!--del_lnk--> dachas (country house) outside the city.<p><a id="Employment" name="Employment"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Employment</span></h3>
      <p>As of 2006, there are 8.47 million Muscovites able to work. 1.73 million are employed by the state, 4.42 million are employed by private companies, and 1.99 million are employed by small businesses. There are 74,400 officially registered unemployed working age adults, of which 34,400 are eligible for unemployment benefits.<p><a id="Future_development" name="Future_development"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Future development</span></h2>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Moscow-City or <i>Moscow International Business Centre</i> is a projected part of central Moscow. Geographically situated in <!--del_lnk--> Presnya, located at the <!--del_lnk--> Third Ring, the Moscow-City area is currently under intense development.<p>The goal of MIBC &quot;Moscow-City&quot; is to create the first in Russia, and in all of Eastern Europe, a zone that will combine business activity, living space and entertainment. It will be a city within a city. The project was conceived by the Moscow government in 1992.<p>The construction of MIBC &quot;Moscow-City&quot; takes place on the Krasnopresnenskaya embankment. The whole project takes up 1 square kilometre. This territory is the only spot in downtown Moscow that can accommodate a project of this magnitude. Today, most of the buildings there are old factories and industrial complexes.<p>At its final stage it will incorporate the highest building in the world, the <!--del_lnk--> Russia Tower, an aquapark and other recreational facilities, trade and entertainment complexes, numerous prestigeous office and residential buildings, <!--del_lnk--> Wedding Palace, the transport node and the <!--del_lnk--> new site of the Moscow government. A construction of four new metro stations in the territory already completed, of which two opened and two other reserved for future metro lines crossing MIBC, and besides these, some other stations were planned. A rail shuttle service, directly connecting MIBC with <!--del_lnk--> Sheremetyevo Airport is also planned.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Federation Tower, now being built is to be the completed by 2007, will become the tallest building in Europe when completed.<p><a id="Other_projects" name="Other_projects"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other projects</span></h3>

      <p>The population of Russia has been declining by about 700,000 persons per year since the fall of the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> in 1991 due to low birth rates and increase in mortality, and Moscow is not entirely immune to these effects. In 2003, the number of deaths within the city exceeded the number of births by approximately 49,400. Birth rates at the onset of the twenty-first century were on the rise, but the average age of the Moscow&#39;s population has continued to increase. In 2004, there were more than twice as many Muscovites over 55 years old than there were Muscovites under 14 years old. However, large migration numbers still enable the city to overcome the effects of this system. These new Muscovites are attracted by the local economic growth, which contrasts to the stagnation or even decline in most of Russia as a result of sharp polarization of the country in recent years. In order to help regulate the population size within the city, Moscow has an <!--del_lnk--> internal passport system that prohibits non-city residents from staying in the capital for more than ninety days without registration.<p>The city is home to small numbers of people of many racial and cultural groups, from African students to Irish business people. In 2002, Moscow&#39;s ethnic composition was 84.8% <!--del_lnk--> Russian, 2.4% <!--del_lnk--> Ukrainian, 1.6% <!--del_lnk--> Tatar, 1.2% <!--del_lnk--> Armenian, 0.9% <!--del_lnk--> Azerbaijani 0.8% <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jew">Jewish</a>, 0.6% <!--del_lnk--> Belarusian, 0.5% <!--del_lnk--> Georgian, and 7.2% other ethnicities.<p><a id="Real_Estate_and_Neighbourhoods" name="Real_Estate_and_Neighbourhoods"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Real Estate and Neighbourhoods</span></h3>
      <p>The Moscow <!--del_lnk--> real estate has been increasing a lot the latest years. Following are some of the most expensive neighbourhoods in order:<br /><!--del_lnk--> Patriarch&rsquo;s Ponds is the most expensive and luxurious neighbourhood within the <!--del_lnk--> Garden Ring. The neighbourhood is located in the centre of Moscow, between the <!--del_lnk--> Boulevard Ring and the Garden Ring, but is still pretty quiet. It is also home to a number of embassies that gives the neighbourhood a higher security status.<br /> Another prestigious neighbourhood is <!--del_lnk--> Arbat named after <!--del_lnk--> Arbat Street, one of the oldest streets in Moscow and a major tourist attraction with souvenirs, restaurants, art shops and musicians. Arbat is also home to a number of embassies.<br /><!--del_lnk--> Kropotkinskaya is a prestigious neighbourhood located along the Prechistenka Street and the Moskva River. The neighbourhood is home to the most of the embassies in Moscow. It is also home to the <!--del_lnk--> Pushkin Art Museum and the <!--del_lnk--> Cathedral of Christ the Saviour.<br /><!--del_lnk--> Tverskaya Street and its surrounding streets like <!--del_lnk--> Tretyakov Drive, <!--del_lnk--> Stoleshnikov Lane, <!--del_lnk--> Tverskoy Boulevard and the <!--del_lnk--> Theatre Square are home to luxury hotels and expensive boutiques. Tverskaya Street is located next to the Red Square and Kremlin and is the busiest shopping street in Moscow. It is called the main street and has existed since the 12th century. The street is named after <!--del_lnk--> Tver, as it&rsquo;s heading to that direction.<br /><!--del_lnk--> Clean Ponds is located along the <!--del_lnk--> Clean Ponds Boulevard on the Boulevard Ring. The prestigious neighbourhood is home to many pre-revolutionary buildings, medieval churches, and embassies.<br /><!--del_lnk--> Zamoskvorechye means beyond the Moskva River. The area is very popular among the <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French community</a> as the neighbourhood is home to the French embassy. The neighbourhood is also home to the famous <!--del_lnk--> Tretyakov Gallery.<br /><!--del_lnk--> Krasnaya Presnya is one of the more modern neighbourhoods in Moscow, as it was reconstructed in the 1990s. It is now a more fashionable area than it was before and home to embassies and the <!--del_lnk--> Moscow Zoo.<p><a id="Crime" name="Crime"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Crime</span></h2>
      <p>Sports team fan violence has become a serious problem when international teams play in Moscow. In 2002, a dozen <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Irish</a> fans in Moscow for a Russia-Ireland game were attacked by <!--del_lnk--> neo-Nazi groups. One later died of his injuries. That same year, when a Russia-<a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> World Cup match, played in Japan but broadcast live to the crowds in <!--del_lnk--> Pushkin Square, went badly for the Russians, the crowd turned violent and wrought havoc in the centre of the city, breaking windows, smashing and burning cars and looting several shops. Four Japanese students were beaten and more than one hundred people were injured in the violence following the game.<p>As with many cities in the world, international terrorism is a threat in Moscow. On <!--del_lnk--> February 6, <!--del_lnk--> 2004 a bomb explosion in a subway car near the <!--del_lnk--> Avtozavodskaya <!--del_lnk--> metro station killed at least 40 and injured many. Other prominent acts of terror include the destruction of two apartment buildings in September 1999 (see <!--del_lnk--> Russian Apartment Bombings), an explosion in the pedestrian subway under the Pushkinskaya square in August 2000, and the <!--del_lnk--> capture of the theatre at Dubrovka in October 2002.<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sister cities</span></h2>
