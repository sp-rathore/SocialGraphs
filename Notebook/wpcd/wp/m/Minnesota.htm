It is the 12<sup>th</sup> largest state in the U.S., and the 21<sup>st</sup> most populous, with over five million residents. Minnesota was carved out of the eastern half of the <!--del_lnk--> Minnesota Territory and admitted to the Union as the 32<sup>nd</sup> state in 1858. While the state&#39;s residents have been primarily <!--del_lnk--> white, <!--del_lnk--> Northern European, and <!--del_lnk--> Lutheran, substantial influxes of <!--del_lnk--> African, <!--del_lnk--> Asian, and <!--del_lnk--> Hispanic immigrants have joined the descendants of <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European</a> immigrants and <!--del_lnk--> Native American descendants of its original inhabitants.<p>Nearly three out of five Minnesota residents live in the <!--del_lnk--> Twin Cities <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan area, which is the centre of transportation, business, and industry, and home to an internationally known arts community. The remainder of the state, often referred to as <!--del_lnk--> Greater Minnesota, consists of western <!--del_lnk--> prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; eastern <!--del_lnk--> deciduous forests, also heavily farmed and settled; and the less-populated northern <!--del_lnk--> boreal forest. The state is known as the &quot;Land of 10,000 Lakes&quot;, and those lakes and the other waters for which the state is named, together with state and national forests and parks, offer residents and tourists a vigorous outdoor lifestyle.<p>The extremes of the climate contrast with the moderation of Minnesota&rsquo;s people. The state is known for its moderate-to-progressive politics and social policies, its civic involvement, and high voter turnout. It ranks among the healthiest states by a number of measures, and has one of the most highly educated and literate populations.<p>

      <p>The word <i>Minnesota</i> comes from the <!--del_lnk--> Dakota name for the <!--del_lnk--> Minnesota River, <i>mnisota</i>. <i>Mni</i> (sometimes <i>mini</i>, or <i>minne</i>) can be translated as &quot;water&quot;. <i>Mnisota</i> is then translated as <i>sky-tinted water</i> or <i>somewhat clouded water</i>. Native Americans demonstrated the name to early settlers by dropping milk into water and calling it <i>mnisota</i>. The names of many locations in the state contain the Dakota word for water, such as <!--del_lnk--> Minnehaha Falls (&quot;waterfall&quot;, not &quot;laughing waters&quot; as is commonly thought), <!--del_lnk--> Minneiska (&quot;white water&quot;), <!--del_lnk--> Minnetonka (&quot;big water&quot;), <!--del_lnk--> Minnetrista (&quot;crooked water&quot;), and <!--del_lnk--> Minneapolis, which is a combination of <i>mni</i> and <i>polis</i>, the Greek word for &quot;city&quot;.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>Minnesota is the northernmost state except for <!--del_lnk--> Alaska; its <!--del_lnk--> Northwest Angle is the only part of the 48 <!--del_lnk--> contiguous states lying north of the <!--del_lnk--> 49<sup>th</sup> Parallel. Minnesota is in the U.S. region known as the <!--del_lnk--> Upper Midwest. The state shares a <a href="../../wp/l/Lake_Superior.htm" title="Lake Superior">Lake Superior</a> water border with <!--del_lnk--> Michigan on the northeast; the remainder of the eastern border is with <!--del_lnk--> Wisconsin. <!--del_lnk--> Iowa is to the south, <!--del_lnk--> North Dakota and <!--del_lnk--> South Dakota are west, and the <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canadian</a> <!--del_lnk--> provinces of <!--del_lnk--> Ontario and <!--del_lnk--> Manitoba are north. With 87,014&nbsp;square miles (225,365&nbsp;km&sup2;), or approximately 2.25% of the United States, Minnesota is the 12<sup>th</sup> largest state, and is the second-largest of the Midwestern states.<p><a id="Geology_and_terrain" name="Geology_and_terrain"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Geology and terrain</span></h3>

      <p>2.7 billion years ago, the first pieces of <a href="../../wp/v/Volcano.htm" title="Volcano">volcanic</a> rock that would form the land of Minnesota began to rise out of an ancient <a href="../../wp/o/Ocean.htm" title="Ocean">ocean</a>. Today, this rock forms the <!--del_lnk--> Canadian Shield. Following a period of <!--del_lnk--> volcanism 1.1 billion years ago, Minnesota&#39;s geological activity has been relatively quiet. During this quiet period there has been no volcanism, no new mountains have formed, and there has been little earthquake activity. In the intervening millennia <a href="../../wp/p/Precambrian.htm" title="Precambrian">Precambrian</a> seas and recent periods of <!--del_lnk--> glaciation have taken once mountainous Minnesota and flattened it out. The roots of these mountains with the action of the seas formed the <!--del_lnk--> Iron Range of northern Minnesota. Massive glaciers at least 1,000 meters thick have ravaged the landscape beginning 600,000 years ago. The last of the four major glaciations, the <!--del_lnk--> Wisconsin glaciation left Minnesota 12,000 years ago. The extent of these glaciers reached all of Minnesota except the far southeast and southwest portions. The southeastern area is known as the <!--del_lnk--> Driftless Zone. It is characterized by low rolling hills and streams that cut into the bedrock. The glaciers left their remains across the whole state with most areas having 15 meters or more of <!--del_lnk--> glacial till. As the last glaciers retreated, gigantic <!--del_lnk--> Lake Agassiz formed in northwest Minnesota; its outflow carved the valley of the <!--del_lnk--> Minnesota River and its lake-bottom created the fertile lands of the <!--del_lnk--> Red River valley.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The action of a billion years of glaciations and erosion have left Minnesota a relatively flat state. The state&#39;s high point is <!--del_lnk--> Eagle Mountain at 2,301&nbsp;ft (701&nbsp;m), only 13 miles from the low of 602&nbsp;ft (183&nbsp;m) at the shore of Lake Superior. Two <!--del_lnk--> continental divides meet in the northeastern part of Minnesota, creating three watersheds. Rain falling in the state can follow the Mississippi River south to the <a href="../../wp/g/Gulf_of_Mexico.htm" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, the <a href="../../wp/s/Saint_Lawrence_Seaway.htm" title="Saint Lawrence Seaway">St. Lawrence Seaway</a> east to the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, or the <!--del_lnk--> Hudson Bay watershed to the <a href="../../wp/a/Arctic_Ocean.htm" title="Arctic Ocean">Arctic Ocean</a>.<p>The state&#39;s nickname, <i>The Land of 10,000 Lakes,</i> is no exaggeration, as there are 11,842 lakes over 10&nbsp;acres in size. The Minnesota portion of <a href="../../wp/l/Lake_Superior.htm" title="Lake Superior">Lake Superior</a> is the largest (962,700&nbsp;acres) and deepest (1,290&nbsp;feet) body of water in the state. Minnesota has 6,564 natural rivers and streams that traverse a total of 69,000&nbsp;miles. The <a href="../../wp/m/Mississippi_River.htm" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</a> begins a 680&nbsp;mile journey through Minnesota from its headwaters at <!--del_lnk--> Lake Itasca. It is joined at <!--del_lnk--> Fort Snelling by the <!--del_lnk--> Minnesota River, and in the southeast by many trout streams. The <!--del_lnk--> Red River, in the bed of glacial Lake Agassiz, drains the northwest part of the state northward toward Canada&#39;s <a href="../../wp/h/Hudson_Bay.htm" title="Hudson Bay">Hudson Bay</a>.<p><a id="Flora_and_fauna" name="Flora_and_fauna"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Flora and fauna</span></h3>

      <p>Three of the <!--del_lnk--> biomes of <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a> converge in Minnesota: the <!--del_lnk--> Great Plains of the west, the <!--del_lnk--> Big Woods <!--del_lnk--> deciduous forest of the southeast, and the Northern <!--del_lnk--> Boreal forest of the Canadian Shield. The northern coniferous forests are a vast wilderness of pine and spruce forests mixed with patchy stands of birch and poplar. Much of Minnesota&#39;s northern forest was logged, leaving only a few patches of <!--del_lnk--> old growth forest today such as in the <!--del_lnk--> Chippewa National Forest and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, but regrowth keeps about one third of the state forested, though logging continues. While loss of habitat has created troubles for native animals such as the <!--del_lnk--> pine marten, <!--del_lnk--> elk, <!--del_lnk--> buffalo, <!--del_lnk--> cougar, <!--del_lnk--> woodland caribou, and <a href="../../wp/b/Bobcat.htm" title="Bobcat">bobcat</a>, the state contains the nation&#39;s largest population of <!--del_lnk--> timber wolves outside Alaska and supports healthy populations of <!--del_lnk--> black bear, <!--del_lnk--> moose and <!--del_lnk--> whitetail deer. Located on the <!--del_lnk--> Mississippi Flyway, the state hosts migratory waterfowl such as <!--del_lnk--> geese and <!--del_lnk--> ducks, as well as game birds such as <!--del_lnk--> grouse, <!--del_lnk--> pheasants, and <!--del_lnk--> turkeys. The state also has <a href="../../wp/b/Bird_of_prey.htm" title="Bird of prey">bird of prey</a> species including the <!--del_lnk--> bald eagle, <!--del_lnk--> red-tailed hawk, and <!--del_lnk--> snowy owl.

      <p>Minnesota is home to a wide variety of public open space and park lands. Minnesota&#39;s first state park, <!--del_lnk--> Itasca State Park, which is the official <!--del_lnk--> source of the Mississippi River, was established in 1891. Today Minnesota has <!--del_lnk--> 71 State Parks. The state has two national forests, the <!--del_lnk--> Chippewa National Forest and the <!--del_lnk--> Superior National Forest. Inside of the Superior National Forest on the northeastern border of the state, lies the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, which encompasses over a million acres and 1000 lakes. The state also has <!--del_lnk--> 53 state forests and numerous other wildlife preserves and regional parks. The <!--del_lnk--> Minnesota Department of Natural Resources is in charge of managing state parks and forests.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>Before European settlement, Minnesota was populated by the <!--del_lnk--> Anishinaabe, the <!--del_lnk--> Sioux, and other <!--del_lnk--> Native Americans. <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European</a> presence began with the arrival of <!--del_lnk--> French <!--del_lnk--> fur traders in the 1600s. During this century, the <!--del_lnk--> Ojibwe Indians migrated westward to Minnesota, and this caused tensions with the Sioux. Explorers such as <!--del_lnk--> Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut, Father <!--del_lnk--> Louis Hennepin, <!--del_lnk--> Jonathan Carver, <!--del_lnk--> Henry Schoolcraft, and <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Nicollet, among others, mapped out the state.<p>In 1805, <!--del_lnk--> Zebulon Pike acquired land at the <!--del_lnk--> confluence of the <!--del_lnk--> Minnesota and <a href="../../wp/m/Mississippi_River.htm" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi</a> rivers. This was followed by the construction of <!--del_lnk--> Fort Snelling between 1819 and 1825.<p>The soldiers built a <!--del_lnk--> grist mill and a <!--del_lnk--> sawmill at <!--del_lnk--> Saint Anthony Falls, and as industry later sprung up around the falls, the city of <a href="../../wp/m/Minneapolis%252C_Minnesota.htm" title="Minneapolis, Minnesota">Minneapolis</a> grew up around it. Meanwhile, squatters, government officials, and tourists had settled in the vicinity of the fort. In 1839, the Army forced them to move downriver, and they settled in an area that became <!--del_lnk--> St. Paul. <!--del_lnk--> Minnesota Territory was formed on <!--del_lnk--> March 3, <!--del_lnk--> 1849. By 1858, thousands of people had come to build <!--del_lnk--> farms and cut <!--del_lnk--> timber, and Minnesota became <a href="../../wp/l/List_of_U.S._states_by_date_of_statehood.htm" title="List of U.S. states by date of statehood">the 32nd U.S. state</a> on <!--del_lnk--> May 11, <!--del_lnk--> 1858.<p>Treaties with the Sioux and Ojibwe gradually forced them off their land and onto smaller reservations. As conditions became less favorable for the Sioux, tensions rose, and the <!--del_lnk--> Sioux Uprising of 1862 resulted. The result of the six-week war was the execution of 38 Indians, the largest mass execution in United States history, and the exile of most of the rest of the Sioux to the <!--del_lnk--> Crow Creek Reservation in <!--del_lnk--> Nebraska.<br clear="left" />

      <p>The early economy of Minnesota was based on logging and farming. The sawmills at Saint Anthony Falls, as well as logging centers like <!--del_lnk--> Marine on St. Croix, <!--del_lnk--> Stillwater, and <!--del_lnk--> Winona processed a large amount of lumber. These cities were well-situated on rivers that were ideal for transportation. Later, Saint Anthony Falls was tapped to provide power for <!--del_lnk--> flour mills. Innovations by Minneapolis millers led to the production of Minnesota &quot;patent&quot; flour, widely regarded as the finest bread flour of its time. By 1900, Minnesota mills, led by <!--del_lnk--> Pillsbury and the Washburn-Crosby Company (a forerunner of <!--del_lnk--> General Mills), were grinding 14.1% of the nation&#39;s grain.<p>Minnesota became established as an <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a> mining state with the discovery of iron in the <!--del_lnk--> Vermilion Range and the <!--del_lnk--> Mesabi Range in the 1880s, followed by the discovery of iron in the <!--del_lnk--> Cuyuna Range in the early 1900s. The iron was shipped by rail to <!--del_lnk--> Two Harbors and <!--del_lnk--> Duluth, then loaded onto ships and transported eastward through the <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Lakes.htm" title="Great Lakes">Great Lakes</a>.<p>As a result of industrial development and the rise of manufacturing, the population gradually shifted from rural areas to cities during the early 1900s. Nevertheless, farming remained prevalent throughout the state. During the years of the <!--del_lnk--> Great Depression, the Minnesota economy was hit hard, resulting in lower prices paid to farmers, layoffs among iron miners, and various instances of labor unrest. Compounding the adversity, western Minnesota and the Dakotas were hit by <a href="../../wp/d/Drought.htm" title="Drought">drought</a> from 1931 through 1935. <!--del_lnk--> New Deal programs provided some economic turnaround. The <!--del_lnk--> Civilian Conservation Corps and other programs around the state established jobs for Indians on their own reservations. The <!--del_lnk--> Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 provided a self-government mechanism for the Indian tribes. This had the effect of providing more of a voice within the state and promoting more respect for tribal customs, as religious ceremonies and native languages were no longer suppressed.<p>After <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the pace of industrial development quickened. Technological developments increased productivity on farms, such as automation of <!--del_lnk--> feedlots for hogs and cattle, machine milking at dairy farms, and raising chickens in large buildings. Planting became more specialized with <!--del_lnk--> hybridization of corn and wheat, and mechanical equipment such as <!--del_lnk--> tractors and <!--del_lnk--> combines became the norm. University of Minnesota professor <a href="../../wp/n/Norman_Borlaug.htm" title="Norman Borlaug">Norman Borlaug</a> contributed to this knowledge as part of the <!--del_lnk--> Green Revolution. During this time, <!--del_lnk--> suburban development accelerated as a result of postwar housing demand, convenient transportation, and increased mobility to more specialized jobs.<p>Minnesota became a centre of technology after the war. <!--del_lnk--> Engineering Research Associates was formed in 1946 to develop computers for the <!--del_lnk--> United States Navy. It later merged with <!--del_lnk--> Remington Rand, and then became <!--del_lnk--> Sperry Rand. <!--del_lnk--> William Norris left Sperry in 1957 to form <!--del_lnk--> Control Data Corporation (CDC). <!--del_lnk--> Cray Research was formed when <!--del_lnk--> Seymour Cray left CDC to form his own company. Medical device maker <!--del_lnk--> Medtronic also got its start in the Twin Cities in 1949.<p><a id="Cities_and_towns" name="Cities_and_towns"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Cities and towns</span></h2>

      <p>The state&#39;s economy has transformed in the past 200 years from one based on raw materials to one based on finished products and services. Perhaps the most significant characteristic of the economy is its diversity, which closely matches that of the nation as a whole. The economy of Minnesota produced 234 billion dollars of <!--del_lnk--> gross domestic product in 2005.

      <p>Minnesota&#39;s earliest industries were fur trading and agriculture; the city of Minneapolis was built around the <!--del_lnk--> flour mills clumped around <!--del_lnk--> St. Anthony Falls. <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">Agriculture</a> is still a major part of the economy even though only a small percentage of the population, less than 1%, are employed in the farming industry. The state is still the <!--del_lnk--> U.S.&#39;s largest producer of <!--del_lnk--> sugar beets, <!--del_lnk--> sweet corn, and <!--del_lnk--> green peas for processing, and farm-raised <!--del_lnk--> turkeys. <!--del_lnk--> Forestry, another early industry, remains strong with logging, pulpwood processing, forest products manufacturing, and paper production. Minnesota was famous for its soft-ore iron mines which produced a significant portion of the world&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> iron ore for over a century. Although the high-grade ore is now depleted, <!--del_lnk--> taconite mining remains strong using processes developed locally to save the industry. In 2004 the state produced 75% of the usable iron ore in the country. The port of <!--del_lnk--> Duluth was created by the mining boom and today continues to be an important shipping port for ore, coal, and agricultural products. The manufacturing sector now includes strong technology and biomedical firms in addition to the older food processing, forestry, and heavy industries. The nation&#39;s first indoor <!--del_lnk--> shopping mall was <!--del_lnk--> Edina&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Southdale Centre and its largest, the <!--del_lnk--> Mall of America, is located in <!--del_lnk--> Bloomington. <a id="Energy_use_and_production" name="Energy_use_and_production"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Energy use and production</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Ethanol fuel is produced in the state, and a 10% mix of ethanol (<!--del_lnk--> E10) has been mandated since 1997, making Minnesota the first U.S. state with such a mandate. A 20% ethanol mix (E20) will be mandated in 2013. Minnesota has nearly 300 gas stations supplying <!--del_lnk--> E85 fuel.

      <p>Minnesota has a slightly <!--del_lnk--> progressive income tax structure, with three brackets of state <!--del_lnk--> income tax rates, 5.35%, 7.05% and 7.85%. The <!--del_lnk--> sales tax in Minnesota for most items is 6.5%, however the state does not charge sales tax on <a href="../../wp/c/Clothing.htm" title="Clothing">clothing</a>, <!--del_lnk--> prescription <!--del_lnk--> medications, some <!--del_lnk--> services, or <a href="../../wp/f/Food.htm" title="Food">food</a> items for home consumption. Municipalities may be allowed by the State Legislature to institute local sales taxes and special local taxes, such as the 0.5% additional sales tax in Minneapolis. The cities of St. Paul, Rochester, Duluth and St. Cloud have similar taxes. <!--del_lnk--> Excise taxes are levied on alcohol, tobacco, and motor fuel. The state also imposes a use tax on items purchased elsewhere but used within Minnesota.

Families frequently own or share <!--del_lnk--> cabins on central and northern tracts of land in <a href="../../wp/f/Forest.htm" title="Forest">forests</a> and adjoining lakes, and weekend trips out to these properties are common, particularly in the summer.

      <p>Minnesota is known for a politically active citizenry, with <!--del_lnk--> populism being a longstanding force among the state&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> political parties. Minnesota has consistently high voter turnout; in the <!--del_lnk--> 2004 U.S. presidential election 77.2% of eligible Minnesotans voted, the highest of any U.S. state (with a national average of 60.93%), due in part to its liberal <!--del_lnk--> voter registration laws. Previously unregistered voters can register on <!--del_lnk--> election day, at their <!--del_lnk--> polls, with evidence of residency.<p><!--del_lnk--> Hubert Humphrey brought national attention to the state following his address at the <!--del_lnk--> 1948 Democratic National Convention and <!--del_lnk--> Eugene McCarthy&#39;s anti-war stance and popularity prior to the <!--del_lnk--> 1968 Democratic National Convention likely convinced <!--del_lnk--> Lyndon Johnson to drop out of the <!--del_lnk--> race. Minnesotans have voted for Democratic presidential candidates ever since 1976, longer than any other state, but in the 108<sup>th</sup> and 109<sup>th</sup> congresses, Minnesota&#39;s congressional delegation was split with 4 Democratic and 4 Republican members of congress and the state&#39;s senate seats have also generally been split since the early 1990s. See <!--del_lnk--> United States Congressional Delegations from Minnesota.<p>In the 2006 mid-term election, Democrats were elected to all state offices except for governor and lieutenant governor, where Republicans Tim Pawlenty and Carol Molnau narrowly won reelection. The DFL also posted double-digit gains in both houses of the legislature, elected DFLer <!--del_lnk--> Amy Klobuchar to the U.S. Senate, and increased the Democratic U.S. House caucus by one.<p>The state has had active third party movements. The <!--del_lnk--> Reform Party was able to elect the former mayor of <!--del_lnk--> Brooklyn Park, and former <!--del_lnk--> professional wrestler, <!--del_lnk--> Jesse Ventura to the governorship in <!--del_lnk--> 1998. The state&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Green Party has elected city council members and other local office-holders in Duluth, Minneapolis and Winona, and has made strong runs for state legislature during the past two election cycles. In 2000, Green Party candidate <a href="../../wp/r/Ralph_Nader.htm" title="Ralph Nader">Ralph Nader</a> received just over 5% of the presidential votes cast, gaining Major Party status for the Green Party of Minnesota.

      <p>Minnesota has state symbols that represent its history, love of the outdoors, and diverse landscapes. Minnesota&#39;s best known state symbol is the state bird, the Common Loon. Its distinctive cry can often be heard during the summer months in the northern part of the state and can even on occasion be found as far south as the lakes of Minneapolis.<p>State Symbols:<ul>
