It is the largest city in the <i><!--del_lnk--> mintaqah</i> (<!--del_lnk--> governorate) of Muscat (sometimes referred to as <b>Masqat</b> to differentiate it from the city). The city of Muscat has a <!--del_lnk--> 2005 estimated population of 600,000 <!--del_lnk--> .<p>The greater metropolitan area of Muscat, known locally as the &#39;Capital Area&#39;, currently covers an area of approximately 1500 km&sup2;. Since Oman&#39;s &#39;<a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>&#39; of modernization began in 1970 (see below), Muscat has seen an explosion of infrastructure development and urbanization, and, as has been the case in so many other cities worldwide, towns which were once distinct have been subsumed within the sprawling growth of the city&#39;s expanding metropolitan area. Pockets of dense residential and commercial districts are interspersed with undeveloped land. The major centers of development can be split into three main groups:<ul>
       <li><b>West Muscat:</b> Al-Seeb, Udhaybah, Bawsher, <!--del_lnk--> Al-Ghubbrah and Ghala<li><b>Central Muscat:</b> Al-Khuwair, <!--del_lnk--> Madinat Al Sultan Qaboos, Shati-Al Qurm, Qurm and Ras Al Hamra<li><b>East Muscat:</b> Wuttayah, <!--del_lnk--> Ruwi, <!--del_lnk--> Matrah, Kalbuh, Old Muscat, Sidab and Al-Bustan</ul>
      <p>In general, Muscat presents a relatively homogeneous appearance of low (rarely more than five story), generally white buildings, with residential, government, and commercial architecture frequently recalling, at least by allusion, historic regional styles. For a city at the edge of the Arabian peninsula and in Oman&#39;s sometimes fierce climate, Muscat is remarkably green, with tree-lined main streets linking the various districts, several sizeable public parks, and grass, shrubs, and flowers decorating many traffic circles and other public areas.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> IPA transcription of the city&#39;s Standard Arabic name is /<span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">m&#x28C;sq&#x28C;t<sup>&#x295;</sup></span>/. The pronunciation is sometimes approximated in English as /<span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">&#39;m&#x28C;sk&aelig;t</span>/, /<span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">&#39;m&#x28C;sk&#x25B;t</span>/, or /<span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">&#39;m&#x28C;sk&#x259;t</span>/ (homophonous with &quot;musket&quot;).<script type="text/javascript">

      <p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p>Muscat is one of the oldest cities in the Middle East. It has been known since the <!--del_lnk--> second century <a href="../../wp/a/Anno_Domini.htm" title="Anno Domini">AD</a>. Some 3,000 <!--del_lnk--> pounds (1,400&nbsp;kg) of <!--del_lnk--> frankincense was transported each year by ship from southern <!--del_lnk--> Arabia to <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greece</a>, <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a> and the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>. The centre of this trade was in a place called <i>Khour Rouri</i>, which the <!--del_lnk--> Greeks called &quot;Muscat&quot;. (Note that Khour Rouri is now recognized as an archaeological site in the Dhofar region of the country, more than 500 miles south of present-day Muscat, far closer to the present-day city of <!--del_lnk--> Salalah).<p>The first foreign presence in Muscat was in the form of the <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> explorer <a href="../../wp/v/Vasco_da_Gama.htm" title="Vasco da Gama">Vasco da Gama</a>, who landed in <a href="../../wp/o/Oman.htm" title="Oman">Oman</a> on his way to <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>. The Portuguese returned in <!--del_lnk--> 1507 to sack and capture Muscat. In <!--del_lnk--> 1649, the <!--del_lnk--> Imam Sultan bin Saif defeated the Portuguese under <!--del_lnk--> Andr&eacute; Pereira dos Reis and drove them away east to <a href="../../wp/g/Goa.htm" title="Goa">Goa</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>With the superior, captured warships of the Portuguese navy, the Imam established an empire that spanned from <!--del_lnk--> Zanzibar in the south to <!--del_lnk--> Gwadar in <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> in the east. Slaves were brought in from Zanzibar and <!--del_lnk--> Balochistan to work in Oman and traded elsewhere. This was a period of relative stability and prosperity in Muscat and Oman.<p>The country was torn apart by strife and unrest upon the death of the Imam in <!--del_lnk--> 1679. Muscat was then invaded by the <!--del_lnk--> Persians in 1737, albeit briefly, since Admad bin Said defeated them and was subsequently elected Imam.<p>In 1803, the <!--del_lnk--> Wahabbis of Saudi Arabia attacked Oman, but were repulsed by Sayyid <!--del_lnk--> Said bin Sultan. The sultan then set up a colony in the fertile areas of Zanzibar and essentially ruled Oman from a foreign island. Later, in 1853, the Sultan transferred the title of &quot;capital&quot; of Oman to Zanzibar. Thus began to decline of the fortunes of <b><!--del_lnk--> Muscat and Oman</b>.<p>In 1913, Sultan <!--del_lnk--> Taimur bin Faisal became Sultan and the territory was renamed &quot;Muscat and Oman&quot; with the Sultan ruling Muscat and the Imam ruling Oman. After <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_independence_movement.htm" title="Indian independence movement">Indian independence</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1947, the Sultan, with the help of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a>, defeated the Imam, unified most of Oman taking command of the Buraimi <!--del_lnk--> oasis.<p>The Dhofar War began in <!--del_lnk--> 1964 which was a communist insurrection staged from the Peoples Democratic Republic of Yemen against the Sultan of Oman. The insurrection was opposed by Omani, British and Iranian forces and was successfully put down. Six years later, Prince <!--del_lnk--> Qaboos bin Said, son of Sultan Said bin Taimur staged a palace <!--del_lnk--> coup and claimed the throne. The old Sultan was flown to <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> by the British <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Air_Force.htm" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a>. The coup, staged by Prince Qaboos, with his close friend and confidant Tim Landon at his side, was the beginning of a new consolidated, modern sultanate.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>

      <p>Muscat, like much of Oman, is dominated by trade. The more traditional exports of the city include <!--del_lnk--> dates, <!--del_lnk--> mother of pearl, <!--del_lnk--> frankincense and fish. Many of the <!--del_lnk--> souks of old Muscat and Muttrah sell these items and traditional <!--del_lnk--> Omani artefacts.<p><!--del_lnk--> Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) has been central to Muscat&#39;s economy since at least 1962 and is the country&#39;s second largest employer, after the government. PDO&#39;s major shareholders include <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Dutch_Shell.htm" title="Royal Dutch Shell">Royal Dutch/Shell</a>, Total, and Partex and its production is estimated to be about 720,000 barrels per day.<p>Muscat also has major trading companies such as Suhail and Saud Bahwan, which is a trading partner for corporations such as <!--del_lnk--> Toshiba, <!--del_lnk--> Subaru, <!--del_lnk--> Seiko, <!--del_lnk--> Hewlett Packard, <!--del_lnk--> General Motors; Saud Bahwan Group whose trading partners are <!--del_lnk--> Toyota, <!--del_lnk--> Daihatsu and <!--del_lnk--> Hertz Rent-a-Car; and Zubair Automotive whose trading partners include <!--del_lnk--> Mitsubishi, and <!--del_lnk--> DaimlerChrysler brands such as Dodge.<p>Mina Sultan Qaboos, Muscat&#39;s main trading port, is an important trading hub between the <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Gulf.htm" title="Persian Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Indian subcontinent and the Far East with an annual volume of about 1.6 million tons.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Omanis constitute about 60 percent of the local population.

      <p>Public transportation in Muscat, and Oman in general, leaves much to be desired. There is no rail or metro network in the country. Several forms of public transport are popular in Oman. Most popular are the &quot;Baiza&quot; buses, so named for the lower denomination of the <!--del_lnk--> Omani Rial, the baisa (an adaptation of the <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">Indian</a> lower denomination <!--del_lnk--> paisa). These are relatively inexpensive and service all major roadways, as well as a wide and loose network of smaller byways in the greater Muscat metropolitan area, opportunistically dropping off and picking up passengers at any location. Less popular and slightly more expensive are large public buses, coloured red and green, whose service is limited to major roadways and point-to-point travel routes between Oman&#39;s major cities and towns. Taxis, also colour-coded orange and white, provide semi-personal transportation in the form of both individual hire and the same opportunistic roadway service as Baiza buses.<p>Baiza buses and colour-coded orange-and-white taxis are unmetered, after several government initiatives to introduce meters were rejected. The fare is set by way of <!--del_lnk--> negotiation, although taxi drivers usually adhere to certain unwritten rules for fares within the city. In many countries, one is advised to negotiate a fare with the driver before getting into a taxi. However, in Oman, asking for the fare beforehand often demonstrates a passenger&#39;s newness and unfamiliarity with the area. One should always find out the normally accepted fare for one&#39;s journey from one&#39;s hotel or host before looking for a taxi.<p>Unlike in some other wealthy countries in the Gulf, taxi and bus drivers in Oman are exclusively Omani nationals.<p>Taxis will also generally take passengers to locations out of the city, including <!--del_lnk--> Sohar, Buraimi and Dubai.<p><a id="Administrative_Divisions" name="Administrative_Divisions"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Administrative Divisions</span></h2>
