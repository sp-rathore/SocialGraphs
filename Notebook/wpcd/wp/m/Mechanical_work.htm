      <p>In <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physics</a>, <b>mechanical work</b> is the amount of <a href="../../wp/e/Energy.htm" title="Energy">energy</a> transferred by a <a href="../../wp/f/Force.htm" title="Force">force</a>. Like energy, it is a <!--del_lnk--> scalar quantity, with <!--del_lnk--> SI units of <!--del_lnk--> joules. Heat conduction is not considered to be a form of work, since there is no macroscopically measurable force, only microscopic forces occurring in atomic collisions. In the 1830s, the French mathematician <!--del_lnk--> Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis, coined the term <b>work</b> for the product of force and distance.<p>Positive and negative signs of work indicate whether the object exerting the force is transferring energy to some other object, or receiving it. A baseball pitcher, for example, does positive work on the ball, but the catcher does negative work on it. Work can be zero even when there is a force. The <!--del_lnk--> centripetal force in uniform <!--del_lnk--> circular motion, for example, does zero work because the kinetic energy of the moving object doesn&#39;t change. Likewise, when a book sits on a table, the table does no work on the book, because no energy is transferred into or out of the book.<p>When the force is constant and along the same line as the motion, the work can be calculated by multiplying the force by the distance, <span class="texhtml"><i>W</i> = <i>F</i><i>d</i></span> (letting both F and d have positive or negative signs, according to the coordinate system chosen). When the force does not lie along the same line as the motion, this can be generalized to the <!--del_lnk--> scalar product of <!--del_lnk--> force and displacement vectors.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In the simplest case, that of a body moving in a steady direction, and acted on by a constant force parallel to that direction, the work is given by the formula<dl>
       <dd><img alt="W = F D \,\!" class="tex" src="../../images/426/42620.png" /></dl>
      <p>where<dl>
       <dd><i>F</i> is the force and<dd><i>D</i> is the distance travelled by the object.</dl>
      <p>The work is taken to be negative when the force opposes the motion. More generally, the force and distance are taken to be <!--del_lnk--> vector quantities, and combined using the <!--del_lnk--> dot product:<dl>
       <dd><img alt="W = \vec F \cdot \vec \mathbf{D} = |\mathbf{F}| |\mathbf{D}| \cos\phi \,\!" class="tex" src="../../images/426/42621.png" /></dl>
      <p>where <img alt="\phi \," class="tex" src="../../images/426/42622.png" /> is the angle between the force and the displacement vector. This formula holds true even when the object changes its direction of travel throughout the motion.<p>To further generalize the formula to situations in which the force changes over time, it is necessary to use <!--del_lnk--> differentials to express the infinitesimal work done by the force over an infinitesimal displacement, thus:<dl>
       <dd><img alt="dW = \vec F \cdot d\vec{s} \,\!" class="tex" src="../../images/426/42623.png" /></dl>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> integration of both sides of this equation yields the following <!--del_lnk--> line integral:<dl>
       <dd><img alt="W = \int_{C} \vec F \cdot d\vec{s} \,\!" class="tex" src="../../images/426/42624.png" /></dl>
      <p>where:<dl>
       <dd><i>C</i> is the path or <!--del_lnk--> curve traversed by the object;<dd><img alt="\vec F" class="tex" src="../../images/426/42625.png" /> is the <a href="../../wp/f/Force.htm" title="Force">force</a> vector;<dd><img alt="\vec s" class="tex" src="../../images/426/42626.png" /> is the <!--del_lnk--> position vector.</dl>
      <p>This formula readily explains how a nonzero force can do zero work. The simplest case is where the force is always perpendicular to the direction of motion, making the <!--del_lnk--> integrand always zero (viz. circular motion). However, even if the integrand sometimes takes nonzero values, it can still integrate to zero if it is sometimes negative and sometimes positive.<p>The possibility of a nonzero force doing zero work exemplifies the difference between work and a related quantity: <!--del_lnk--> impulse (the integral of force over time). Impulse measures change in a body&#39;s <a href="../../wp/m/Momentum.htm" title="Momentum">momentum</a>, a vector quantity sensitive to direction, whereas work considers only the magnitude of the velocity. For instance, as an object in uniform circular motion traverses half of a revolution, its centripetal force does no work, but it transfers a nonzero impulse.<p><a id="Units" name="Units"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Units</span></h2>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> SI derived unit of work is the <!--del_lnk--> joule (J), which is defined as the work done by a force of one <!--del_lnk--> newton acting over a distance of one <!--del_lnk--> meter. This definition is based on <!--del_lnk--> Sadi Carnot&#39;s 1824 definition of work as &quot;weight <i>lifted</i> through a height&quot;, which is based on the fact that early steam engines were principally used to lift buckets of water, though a gravitational height, out of flooded ore mines. The dimensionally equivalent <!--del_lnk--> newton-meter (N&middot;m) is sometimes used instead; however, it is also sometimes reserved for <!--del_lnk--> torque to distinguish its units from work or energy.<p>Non-SI units of work include the <!--del_lnk--> erg, the <!--del_lnk--> foot-pound, the <!--del_lnk--> foot-poundal, and the <!--del_lnk--> liter-atmosphere.<p><a id="Types_of_work" name="Types_of_work"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Types of work</span></h2>
      <p>Forms of work that are not evidently mechanical in fact represent special cases of this principle. For instance, in the case of &quot;electrical work&quot;, an <a href="../../wp/e/Electric_field.htm" title="Electric field">electric field</a> does work on <a href="../../wp/e/Electric_charge.htm" title="Electric charge">charged</a> particles as they move through a medium.<p>One mechanism of <!--del_lnk--> heat conduction is collisions between fast-moving <a href="../../wp/a/Atom.htm" title="Atom">atoms</a> in a warm body with slow-moving atoms in a cold body. Although colliding atoms do work on each other, the force averages to nearly zero in bulk, so conduction is not considered to be mechanical work.<p><a id="PV_work" name="PV_work"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">PV work</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Chemical thermodynamics studies <i>PV work</i>, which occurs when the volume of a fluid changes. PV work is represented by the following <a href="../../wp/d/Differential_equation.htm" title="Differential equation">differential equation</a>:<dl>
       <dd><img alt="dW = -P dV \," class="tex" src="../../images/426/42627.png" /></dl>
      <p>where:<ul>
       <li><i>W</i> = work done on the system<li><i>P</i> = external pressure<li><i>V</i> = volume</ul>
      <p>Therefore, we have:<dl>
       <dd><img alt="W=-\int_{V_i}^{V_f} P\,dV" class="tex" src="../../images/426/42628.png" /></dl>
      <p>Like all work functions, PV work is <!--del_lnk--> path-dependent. (The path in question is a curve in the <!--del_lnk--> Euclidean space specified by the fluid&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> pressure and <!--del_lnk--> volume, and infinitely many such curves are possible.) From a thermodynamic perspective, this fact implies that <i>PV</i> work is not a <!--del_lnk--> state function. This means that the differential <span class="texhtml"><i>d</i><i>W</i></span> is an <!--del_lnk--> inexact differential; to be more rigorous, it should be written &#x111;W (with a line through the d).<p>From a mathematical point of view, that is to say, <span class="texhtml"><i>d</i><i>W</i></span> is not an <!--del_lnk--> exact <!--del_lnk--> one-form. This line through is merely a flag to warn us there is actually no function (<!--del_lnk--> 0-form) <span class="texhtml"><i>W</i></span> which is the <!--del_lnk--> potential of <span class="texhtml"><i>d</i><i>W</i></span>. If there were, indeed, this function <span class="texhtml"><i>W</i></span>, we should be able to just use <!--del_lnk--> Stokes Theorem, and evaluate this putative function, the potential of <span class="texhtml"><i>d</i><i>W</i></span>, at the <!--del_lnk--> boundary of the path, that is, the initial and final points, and therefore the work would be a state function. This impossibility is consistent with the fact that it does not make sense to refer to <i>the work on a point</i>; work presupposes a path.<p>PV work is often measured in the (non-SI) units of litre-atmospheres, where 1 L&middot;atm = 101.3 J.<p><a id="Mechanical_energy" name="Mechanical_energy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Mechanical energy</span></h2>

      <p>The <i>mechanical energy</i> of a body is that part of its total <a href="../../wp/e/Energy.htm" title="Energy">energy</a> which is subject to change by mechanical work. It includes <!--del_lnk--> kinetic energy and <!--del_lnk--> potential energy. Some notable forms of energy that it does not include are <!--del_lnk--> thermal energy (which can be increased by <!--del_lnk--> frictional work, but not easily decreased) and <!--del_lnk--> rest energy (which is constant so long as the <!--del_lnk--> rest mass remains the same).<p><a id="The_relation_between_work_and_kinetic_energy" name="The_relation_between_work_and_kinetic_energy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The relation between work and kinetic energy</span></h3>
      <p>If an external work <i>W</i> acts upon a body, causing its <!--del_lnk--> kinetic energy to change from <i>E<sub>k1</sub></i> to <i>E<sub>k2</sub></i>, then:<dl>
       <dd><img alt="W = \Delta E_k = E_{k2} - E_{k1}\," class="tex" src="../../images/426/42629.png" /></dl>
      <p>Also, if we substitute the equation for kinetic energy that states <span class="texhtml"><i>E</i><sub><i>k</i></sub> = 1 / 2<i>m</i><i>v</i><sup>2</sup></span>, we then get:<dl>
       <dd><img alt="W = \Delta (1/2  mv^2) = 1/2  mv_2 ^2 - 1/2  mv_1 ^2" class="tex" src="../../images/426/42630.png" /></dl>

      <p><a id="Conservation_of_mechanical_energy" name="Conservation_of_mechanical_energy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Conservation of mechanical energy</span></h3>
      <p>The principle of <i>conservation of mechanical energy</i> states that, if a system is subject only to <!--del_lnk--> conservative forces (e.g. only to a <!--del_lnk--> gravitational force), its mechanical energy remains constant.<p>For instance, if an object with constant mass is in free fall, the total energy of position 1 will equal that of position 2.<dl>
       <dd><img alt="(E_k + E_p)_1 = (E_k + E_p)_2 \,\!" class="tex" src="../../images/426/42631.png" /></dl>

      <p>The external work will usually be done by the friction force between the system on the motion or the internal-non conservative force in the system or loss of energy due to heat transfer.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_work&quot;</div>
