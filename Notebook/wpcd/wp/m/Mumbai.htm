The city has a deep natural <!--del_lnk--> harbour and the port handles over half of India&#39;s passenger traffic and a significant amount of cargo.<p>Mumbai is the commercial and entertainment capital of India, and houses important financial institutions, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the <!--del_lnk--> Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), the <!--del_lnk--> National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) and the corporate <!--del_lnk--> headquarters of many <!--del_lnk--> Indian companies. Mumbai has attracted migrants from all over India because of the immense business opportunities, and the relatively high <!--del_lnk--> standard of living, making the city a <!--del_lnk--> potpourri of various communities and <!--del_lnk--> cultures. The city is home to India&#39;s <a href="../../wp/h/Hindi.htm" title="Hindi">Hindi</a> <!--del_lnk--> film and television industry, known as <!--del_lnk--> Bollywood.

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> appellation Mumbai is an <!--del_lnk--> eponym, <!--del_lnk--> etymologically derived from <i>Mumba</i> or <i>Maha-Amba</i>&mdash; the name of the <!--del_lnk--> Hindu goddess <!--del_lnk--> Mumbadevi, and <i>Aai</i> &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> mother in <!--del_lnk--> Marathi. In the 16th century, the <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> named the area <i>Bom Bahia</i> (Good Bay), later corrupted to <i>Boma&iacute;m</i> or <i>Bombaim</i>, by which it is still known in Portuguese. After the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British</a> gained possession, it was <!--del_lnk--> anglicised to <i>Bombay</i>, although it was known as <i>Mumbai</i> or <i>Mambai</i> to Marathi and Gujarati-speakers, and as <i>Bambai</i> in Hindi, Urdu, and Persian. The name was officially changed to <i>Mumbai</i> in 1995, but the former name is still used by many of the city&#39;s inhabitants and famous institutions.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>Present-day Mumbai was originally an <!--del_lnk--> archipelago of <!--del_lnk--> seven islands Artefacts found near <!--del_lnk--> Kandivali, in northern Mumbai indicate that these islands had been inhabited since the <a href="../../wp/s/Stone_Age.htm" title="Stone Age">Stone Age</a>. Documented evidence of human habitation dates back to 250 BC, when it was known as <i>Heptanesia</i> (<a href="../../wp/p/Ptolemy.htm" title="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>) (<!--del_lnk--> Ancient Greek: <i>A Cluster of Seven Islands</i>). In the 3rd century BCE, the islands formed part of the <!--del_lnk--> Maurya Empire, ruled by the <!--del_lnk--> Buddhist emperor, <!--del_lnk--> A&#x15F;oka. The Hindu rulers of the <!--del_lnk--> Silhara Dynasty later governed the islands until 1343, when the kingdom of <!--del_lnk--> Gujarat annexed them. Some of the oldest edifices of the archipelago &ndash; the <!--del_lnk--> Elephanta Caves and the <!--del_lnk--> Walkeshwar temple complex date from this era.<p>In 1534, the Portuguese appropriated the islands from <!--del_lnk--> Bahadur Shah of Gujarat, naming them <i>Bom Baia</i>, Portuguese for &quot;good bay&quot;. They were ceded to <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_II_of_England.htm" title="Charles II of England">Charles II of England</a> in 1661, as <!--del_lnk--> dowry for <!--del_lnk--> Catherine de Braganza. These islands, were in turn leased to the <a href="../../wp/b/British_East_India_Company.htm" title="British East India Company">British East India Company</a> in 1668 for a sum of <a href="../../wp/p/Pound_sterling.htm" title="Pound sterling">&pound;</a>10 <!--del_lnk--> per annum. The company found the deep harbour on the east coast of the islands to be ideal for setting up their first port in the sub-continent. The population quickly rose from 10,000 in 1661, to 60,000 in 1675; In 1687, the British East India Company transferred its headquarters from <!--del_lnk--> Surat to Bombay. The city eventually became the headquarters of the <!--del_lnk--> Bombay Presidency.<p>From 1817 onwards, the city was reshaped with large <!--del_lnk--> civil engineering projects aimed at merging all the islands in the archipelago into a single amalgamated mass. This project, known as the <!--del_lnk--> Hornby Vellard, was completed by 1845, and resulted in the total area swelling to 438 <!--del_lnk--> km&sup2;.In 1853, India&#39;s first passenger <!--del_lnk--> railway line was established, connecting Bombay to the town of <!--del_lnk--> Thane. During the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> (1861-1865), the city became the world&#39;s chief <a href="../../wp/c/Cotton.htm" title="Cotton">cotton</a> trading market, resulting in a boom in the economy and subsequently enhancing the city&#39;s stature. The opening of the <a href="../../wp/s/Suez_Canal.htm" title="Suez Canal">Suez Canal</a> in 1869 transformed Bombay into one of the largest seaports on the <!--del_lnk--> Arabian Sea.<p>Over the next thirty years, the city grew into a major urban centre, spurred by an improvement in infrastructure and the construction of many of the city&#39;s institutions. The population of the city swelled to one million by 1906, making it the second largest in India after <!--del_lnk--> Calcutta. As capital of the <!--del_lnk--> Bombay Presidency, it was a major base for the <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_independence_movement.htm" title="Indian independence movement">Indian independence movement</a>, with the <!--del_lnk--> Quit India Movement called by <a href="../../wp/m/Mahatma_Gandhi.htm" title="Mahatma Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a> in 1942 being its most rubric event. After India&#39;s independence in 1947, it became the capital of <!--del_lnk--> Bombay State. In the 1950 the city expanded to its present limits by incorporating parts of Salsette island which lay to the north.<p>After 1955, when the <!--del_lnk--> State of Bombay was being reorganised along linguistic lines into the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat, there was a demand that the city be constituted as an autonomous city-state. However, the <!--del_lnk--> Samyukta Maharashtra movement opposed this, and insisted that Mumbai be declared the capital of Maharashtra. Following a successful protests in which 105 people were killed by police firing, Maharashtra state was formed with Mumbai as its capital on <!--del_lnk--> May 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1960<p>The late 1970s witnessed a construction boom and a significant influx of migrants, which saw Bombay overtake <!--del_lnk--> Calcutta as India&rsquo;s most populous city. This has being giving rise to unrest in Marathi speaking people in Mumbai and consequently <!--del_lnk--> Shiv Sena,a political outfit safeguarding the rights of &#39;sons of soil&#39; was formed in 1966.The city&#39;s secular fabric was torn apart in 1992, after large scale sectarian violence caused extensive loss of life and property. A few months later, on <!--del_lnk--> March 12, <!--del_lnk--> simultaneous bombings at several city landmarks by the <!--del_lnk--> Mumbai underworld killed around three hundred people. In 1995, the city was renamed <i>Mumbai</i> by the <!--del_lnk--> Shiv Sena party government of Maharashtra, in keeping with their policy of renaming colonial institutions after historic local appellations. In <!--del_lnk--> 2006, Mumbai was also the site of a <!--del_lnk--> major terrorist incident in which over two hundred people were killed by Islamic terrorists when several <!--del_lnk--> bombs exploded almost simultaneously on the <!--del_lnk--> Mumbai Suburban Railway.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>Mumbai is located on <!--del_lnk--> Salsette Island, which lies at the mouth of <!--del_lnk--> Ulhas River off the western coast of India, in the coastal region known as the <!--del_lnk--> Konkan. Much of Mumbai is at <!--del_lnk--> sea level, and the average elevation ranges from 10 to 15 <!--del_lnk--> metres. The northern part of Mumbai is hilly, and the highest point of the city is at 450 metres (1,450 <!--del_lnk--> feet). Mumbai spans a total area of 468 <!--del_lnk--> km&sup2; (169&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mi&sup2;).<p>Three lakes are located within the metropolitan limits &mdash; the <!--del_lnk--> Tulsi Lake, <!--del_lnk--> Vihar Lake and <!--del_lnk--> Powai Lake. The first two are located within the <!--del_lnk--> Borivali National Park, and supply part of the city&#39;s drinking water. Mumbai also has three small rivers within the city limits originating in the National Park. The coastline of the city is indented with numerous <!--del_lnk--> creeks and <!--del_lnk--> bays. The eastern seaboard of Salsette Island is covered with large <!--del_lnk--> mangrove <!--del_lnk--> swamps, rich in <a href="../../wp/b/Biodiversity.htm" title="Biodiversity">biodiversity</a>.<p>Soil cover in the city region is predominantly <a href="../../wp/s/Sand.htm" title="Sand">sandy</a> due to its proximity to the sea. In the suburbs, the soil cover is largely <!--del_lnk--> alluvial and <!--del_lnk--> loamy. The underlying rock of the region is composed of black <!--del_lnk--> Deccan <!--del_lnk--> basalt flows, and their <!--del_lnk--> acid and <!--del_lnk--> basic variants dating back to the late <a href="../../wp/c/Cretaceous.htm" title="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> and early <a href="../../wp/e/Eocene.htm" title="Eocene">Eocene</a> <!--del_lnk--> eras. Mumbai sits on a seismically active zone owing to the presence of three fault lines in the vicinity. The area is classified as a Zone III region, which means an earthquake of up to magnitude 6.5 on the <!--del_lnk--> Richter scale may be expected.<p>Mumbai is classified as a metropolis of India, under the jurisdiction of the <!--del_lnk--> BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation. It consists of two distinct regions &mdash; the city and the suburbs, which also form two separate districts of Maharashtra. The city region is also commonly referred to as the <b>Island City</b>.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h2>

      <p>The climate of the city, being in the <!--del_lnk--> tropical zone, and near the <!--del_lnk--> Arabian Sea, may be broadly classified into two main seasons &mdash; the <!--del_lnk--> humid season, and the dry season. The humid season, between March and October, is characterised by high humidity and temperatures of over 30&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> &deg;C (86&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> &deg;F). The <!--del_lnk--> monsoon rains lash the city between June to September, and supply most of the city&#39;s annual <a href="../../wp/r/Rain.htm" title="Rainfall">rainfall</a> of 2,200&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mm (85&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> in). The maximum annual rainfall ever recorded was 3,452&nbsp;mm (135.89 in) in 1954. The <!--del_lnk--> highest rainfall recorded in a single day was 944&nbsp;mm (37.16&nbsp;in) on <!--del_lnk--> 2005-<!--del_lnk--> 07-26.<p>The dry season, between November and February, is characterised by moderate levels of humidity and warm to cool weather. Cold northerly winds are responsible for a mild chill during January and February. Annual temperatures range from a high of 38&nbsp;&deg;C (100&nbsp;&deg;F) to a low of 11&nbsp;&deg;C (52&nbsp;&deg;F). The record high is 43&nbsp;&deg;C (108&nbsp;&deg;F) and record low is 7.4&nbsp;&deg;C (45&nbsp;&deg;F) on <!--del_lnk--> 1962-<!--del_lnk--> 01-22.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>

      <p>Mumbai contributes 10% of all factory employment, 40% of all <!--del_lnk--> income tax collections, 60% of all <!--del_lnk--> customs duty collections, 20% of all central <!--del_lnk--> excise tax collections, 40% of India&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> foreign trade and <!--del_lnk--> Rupees 40 <!--del_lnk--> billion (<!--del_lnk--> US$ 9 billion) in <!--del_lnk--> corporate taxes. A number of Indian financial institutions have headquarters in <!--del_lnk--> downtown Mumbai, including the <!--del_lnk--> Bombay Stock Exchange, the <!--del_lnk--> Reserve Bank of India, the <!--del_lnk--> National Stock Exchange of India, the <!--del_lnk--> Mint, and numerous conglomerates (the <!--del_lnk--> Tata Group, <!--del_lnk--> Godrej and <!--del_lnk--> Reliance etc). Many foreign banks and financial institutions also have branches in this area.<p>Up until the 1980s, Mumbai owed its prosperity largely to <a href="../../wp/t/Textile.htm" title="Textile">textile</a> mills and the seaport, but the local economy has since been diversified to include <a href="../../wp/e/Engineering.htm" title="Engineering">engineering</a>, <a href="../../wp/d/Diamond.htm" title="Diamond">diamond</a> polishing, <!--del_lnk--> healthcare and <!--del_lnk--> information technology. Mumbai&rsquo;s status as the state capital means that state and federal government employees make up a large percentage of the city&#39;s workforce. Mumbai also has a large unskilled and semi-skilled labour population, who primarily earn their livelihood as hawkers, taxi drivers, mechanics and other such <!--del_lnk--> blue collar professions. The port and shipping industry too employs many residents, directly or indirectly.<p>The entertainment industry is the other major employer in Mumbai. Most of India&#39;s major television and satellite networks are headquartered in Mumbai, as well as its major <a href="../../wp/p/Publishing.htm" title="Publishing">publishing</a> houses. The centre of the Hindi movie industry, <!--del_lnk--> Bollywood, is also located in Mumbai, along with its largest <!--del_lnk--> studios and movie production houses.<p><a id="Civic_administration" name="Civic_administration"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Civic administration</span></h2>

      <p>The city is administered by the <!--del_lnk--> Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) (formerly the Bombay Municipal Corporation), with executive power vested in the <!--del_lnk--> Municipal Commissioner, who is an <!--del_lnk--> IAS officer appointed by the <!--del_lnk--> state government. The Corporation comprises 227 directly elected Councillors representing the twenty four <!--del_lnk--> municipal wards , five nominated Councillors, and a titular <!--del_lnk--> Mayor. The BMC is in charge of the civic and infrastructure needs of the metropolis. An Assistant Municipal Commissioner oversees each ward for administrative purposes. Almost all the <!--del_lnk--> state political parties field candidates in the elections for Councillors.<p>The metropolitan area forms two <!--del_lnk--> districts of Maharashtra, with each district under the jurisdiction of a <!--del_lnk--> District Collector. The Collectors are in charge of property records and revenue collection for the <!--del_lnk--> Federal Government, and oversee the <!--del_lnk--> national elections held in the city.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Mumbai Police is headed by a <!--del_lnk--> Police Commissioner, who is an <!--del_lnk--> IPS officer. The Mumbai Police comes under the state Home Ministry. The city is divided into seven police zones and seventeen traffic police zones, each headed by a Deputy Commissioner of Police.

      <p>Most of Mumbai&#39;s inhabitants rely on <!--del_lnk--> public transport to travel to and from their workplace due to the lack of car parking spaces, traffic bottlenecks, and generally poor road conditions. The city is the headquarters of two <!--del_lnk--> rail divisions &ndash; the Central Railway (CR) (headquartered at <!--del_lnk--> Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus (formerly known as Victoria Terminus)), and the Western Railway (WR) (headquartered near <!--del_lnk--> Churchgate). The backbone of the city&#39;s transport, the <!--del_lnk--> Mumbai Suburban Railway, is composed of three separate networks running the length of the city, in a north-south direction. The <!--del_lnk--> Western Railway runs along the western region of the city, while the <!--del_lnk--> Central Railway covers most of the central and northeast parts of the metropolis. Both lines extend into the exurbs, each covering a total one-way length of around 125&nbsp;km. The <!--del_lnk--> Harbour Line is a sub-division of the <!--del_lnk--> Central Railway, covering a distance of 54&nbsp;km along the south-eastern section of the city, near the docks, and extending into <!--del_lnk--> Navi Mumbai (New Bombay). Mumbai is well connected by the <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Railways.htm" title="Indian Railways">Indian Railways</a> to most parts of <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>.<p>Public buses run by the <!--del_lnk--> BEST (an autonomous body under the BMC) cover almost all parts of the metropolis, as well as parts of Navi Mumbai and <!--del_lnk--> Thane. Buses are used for commuting short to medium distances, while train fares are more economical for long distance commutes. The BEST fleet consists of single-decker, double-decker and air-conditioned.(Reminds people slightly of <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>)<p>Black and yellow-metered taxis, accommodating up to four passengers, cover most of the metropolis. <!--del_lnk--> Auto rickshaws, allowed to operate only in the suburban areas, are the main form of hired transport here. These three-wheeled vehicles can accommodate up to three passengers.<p>Mumbai&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Chatrapati Shivaji International Airport (formerly, Sahar International Airport) is the busiest airport in India, and caters to cargo and international flights while <!--del_lnk--> Santacruz Airport caters to domestic flights. The nearby <!--del_lnk--> Juhu aerodrome was India&#39;s first airport, and now hosts a <!--del_lnk--> flying club and a <!--del_lnk--> heliport.<p>With its unique topography, Mumbai has one of the best natural harbours in the world, handling 50% of the country&#39;s passenger traffic, and much of India&#39;s cargo. It is also an important base for the <!--del_lnk--> Indian Navy.<p><a id="Utility_services" name="Utility_services"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Utility services</span></h2>

      <p>The BMC supplies <!--del_lnk--> potable water to the city, most of which come from the Tulsi and Vihar lakes, as well as a few lakes further north. The water is filtered at <!--del_lnk--> Bhandup, which is also Asia&#39;s largest water filtration plant. The BMC is also responsible for the road maintenance and garbage collection in the city. Almost all of Mumbai&#39;s daily refuse of 7,800&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> metric tonnes is transported to dumping grounds in <!--del_lnk--> Gorai in the northwest, <!--del_lnk--> Mulund in the northeast,and <!--del_lnk--> Deonar in the east. <!--del_lnk--> Sewage treatment is carried out in <!--del_lnk--> Worli and <!--del_lnk--> Bandra.<p><a href="../../wp/e/Electricity.htm" title="Electricity">Electricity</a> is provided by the BEST in the city, and by <!--del_lnk--> Reliance Energy and <!--del_lnk--> Mahavitaran (Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co.

The largest <a href="../../wp/t/Telephone.htm" title="Telephone">telephone</a> service provider is the state-owned <!--del_lnk--> MTNL, which held a <!--del_lnk--> monopoly over fixed line and cellular services up until 2000, and provides fixed line as well as mobile <!--del_lnk--> WLL services. <!--del_lnk--> Cell phone coverage is extensive, and the main service providers are <!--del_lnk--> Hutch, <!--del_lnk--> Airtel, <!--del_lnk--> BPL group, <!--del_lnk--> Reliance Infocomm and <!--del_lnk--> Tata Indicom. Both <!--del_lnk--> GSM and <!--del_lnk--> CDMA services are available in the city. <!--del_lnk--> Broadband internet penetration is increasing in the city, with MTNL and <!--del_lnk--> Tata being the leading service providers.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

       <br /> The population of Mumbai is about 18 million, with a density of about 29,000 persons per <!--del_lnk--> square kilometre. There are 811 females to every 1,000 males &ndash; which is lower than the national average, because many working males come from rural areas, where they leave behind their families. The overall <a href="../../wp/l/Literacy.htm" title="Literacy">literacy</a> rate of the city is above 86%, which is higher than the national average. The religions represented in Mumbai include <!--del_lnk--> Hindus (68% of the population), <!--del_lnk--> Muslims (17% of the population), and <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christians</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Buddhist (4% each).

Mumbai recorded 27,577 incidents of crime in 2004, which is down 11% from 30,991 in 2001. The city&#39;s main <!--del_lnk--> jail is the <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Road Jail.<p>Mumbai has a large <!--del_lnk--> polyglot population and <!--del_lnk--> Marathi is widely spoken, but the most common language spoken on the city streets is a colloquial form of <a href="../../wp/h/Hindi.htm" title="Hindi">Hindi</a>, known as <i><!--del_lnk--> Bambaiya</i> &ndash; a blend of Hindi, <!--del_lnk--> Marathi, <!--del_lnk--> Indian English and some invented colloquial words.

      <p>A resident of Mumbai is called a <i><!--del_lnk--> Mumbaikar</i>, or <i>Bombayite</i>. Many residents prefer to stay close to major railway stations for easy access to their workplaces, as a significant amount of time is spent on daily commuting. Thus, many live a fast-paced life, with very little time for social activities. Bombay residents celebrate <!--del_lnk--> Indian and Western festivals with great fanfare.<p>The metropolis has its own local roadside <!--del_lnk--> fast food flavour, comprising <!--del_lnk--> vada pav (leavened wheat bread split in half, with fried dumplings as filling), <!--del_lnk--> panipuri (deep fried cr&ecirc;pe with tamarind and lentil sauce), pav bhaji (leavened wheat bread accompanied with fried vegetables) and <!--del_lnk--> bhelpuri (puffed rice mixture), while <!--del_lnk--> South Indian and <!--del_lnk--> Chinese food are also very popular. The cosmopolitan residents have unique tastes in cuisine, <!--del_lnk--> music, film and literature, both Indian and international. In 2004, Mumbai received three <!--del_lnk--> heritage conservation awards from the <!--del_lnk--> UNESCO.<p>Mumbai is the birthplace of <!--del_lnk--> Indian cinema, with the oldest film broadcast here in the early 20th century. Mumbai also boasts of large number of cinemas, including <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a>&#39;s largest <!--del_lnk--> IMAX dome theatre, which feature mainstream <!--del_lnk--> Bollywood and <!--del_lnk--> Hollywood films. Many film festivals are avidly attended throughout the year. Besides catering to cinephiles, the city has a thriving theatrical tradition both in the regional languages and in English. Contemporary art is well represented in both government funded art spaces and private commercial galleries. The government funded <!--del_lnk--> art galleries include The <!--del_lnk--> Jehangir Art Gallery and The <!--del_lnk--> National Gallery of Modern Art. Built in 1833, the <!--del_lnk--> Asiatic Society of Bombay is the oldest <!--del_lnk--> public library in the city. The city also contains most of India&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> tallest buildings.<p>Mumbai has six <!--del_lnk--> sister cities (the maximum permitted by the Indian government). They are: <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin.htm" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Los_Angeles%252C_California.htm" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Saint_Petersburg.htm" title="Saint Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Stuttgart.htm" title="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Yokohama.<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h2>
      <p>Schools in Mumbai are either &quot;municipal schools&quot; (run by the BMC) or private schools (run by trusts and individuals). A majority of residents prefer private schools because of better infrastructure and the use of English as a medium of instruction. All private schools are affiliated either to the Maharashtra State <!--del_lnk--> SSC board, or the all-India <!--del_lnk--> Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) and <!--del_lnk--> Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE) boards. Demand is especially high for ICSE and CBSE affiliated schools, and those run by <!--del_lnk--> convents or the <!--del_lnk--> Jesuits. The government run public schools lack many facilities, but are the only option for poorer residents who cannot afford the more expensive private schools.<p>Under the <!--del_lnk--> 10+2+3 plan, students complete ten years of schooling, and then enroll for two years in <!--del_lnk--> Junior College, where they choose from one of three streams: <!--del_lnk--> Arts, <!--del_lnk--> Commerce or <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">Science</a>. This is followed by either a general degree course in a chosen field of study, or a professional degree course, such as <a href="../../wp/l/Law.htm" title="Law">law</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Engineering.htm" title="Engineering">engineering</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Medicine.htm" title="Medicine">medicine</a> etc. Most professional colleges in Mumbai are affiliated to the <!--del_lnk--> University of Mumbai, one of the largest <a href="../../wp/u/University.htm" title="University">universities</a> in the world in terms of graduation rate. The <!--del_lnk--> Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, one of India&#39;s premier <a href="../../wp/e/Engineering.htm" title="Engineering">engineering</a> schools, and the <!--del_lnk--> SNDT Women&#39;s University are the other universities in Mumbai.<p><a id="Sports_and_recreation" name="Sports_and_recreation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sports and recreation</span></h2>

India&#39;s national sport, <!--del_lnk--> field hockey, has gone into a sharp decline in the recent years, losing out in terms of popularity to cricket, though many Mumbai players play in the national team.<p>Other sports are mostly played in the numerous clubs and <!--del_lnk--> gymkhanas, and include <!--del_lnk--> tennis, <a href="../../wp/s/Squash_%2528sport%2529.htm" title="Squash (sport)">squash</a>, <!--del_lnk--> billiards, <a href="../../wp/b/Badminton.htm" title="Badminton">badminton</a>, <!--del_lnk--> table tennis and <!--del_lnk--> golf.

The event sees many of the city&#39;s glitterati attending, arrayed in the latest fashions. In recent times <!--del_lnk--> Formula 1 racing has also caught the public&#39;s attention.
