<h2>Mozambique explosions damage SOS homes</h2><p><strong>23/03/2007</strong></p>
<p>Explosions at a Mozambican weapons depot on Thursday evening have killed a reported 72 people and injured many more. One family home at the SOS Children's Village Maputo, just 2km from the depot, was completely destroyed and damage was caused to other houses in the village and administration facilities. No-one at the village was injured as a result of the blasts.</p><p>The explosions, which were reportedly caused by intense heat, occurred at a military ammunition storage facility in Laulane, a suburb of Maputo, just before 5 p.m. local time on Thursday. The Mozambican Armed Forces (FADM) armoury stored more than 20 tonnes of old military equipment.</p><img src="../../wp/c/Child_Mozambique.jpg" width="360" height="240" alt="Child at the SOS Children's Village Maputo, Mozambique" class="right" /><p>The children and co-workers from the children's village were evacuated to Maputo town centre as the initial explosions intensified, causing further detonations. Children received assistance from the German embassy in trying to locate accommodation, but were able to return safely to the SOS Children's Village at approximately 2:30 a.m. on Friday morning. Upon his return to the children's village, Jaime Alves, National Director for Mozambique, found a piece of metal approximately 60 centimetres in length and weighing over 10kg in the village, which had apparently damaged one of the houses as it landed.</p><p>Tiago Nhangumele, Deputy National Director, said, &quot;We are extremely relieved that there were no injuries or casualties among the children or staff as a result of the explosions in Maputo. However, among the general population, there is still fear, shock and in some cases panic.&quot;</p><p>At least 72 people have been confirmed dead and more than 200 were injured by the blasts, according to media reports. The explosions sent mortar bombs and rockets into the nearby Malhazine residential district, where many houses were destroyed. A similar explosion occurred at the same military facility on 28 January 2007.</p><p>The Mozambique Minister of Education, Mr Aires Aly, today visited the children's village. The Office of the First Lady of Mozambique also sent a delegation to view the damage, and has donated foodstuffs and as well as offered the services of a psychologist to assist any children who have been traumatized. </p><p>The SOS Children's Village Maputo comprises fifteen family houses, an administrative building and other facilities.</p><p><strong>Relevant Countries:</strong> <a href="../../wp/m/Mozambique_A.htm">Mozambique</a>.</p>
