      <p><b>Magnetic levitation transport</b>, or <b>maglev</b>, is a form of transportation that suspends, guides and propels vehicles via <!--del_lnk--> electromagnetic force. This method can be faster and more comfortable than <!--del_lnk--> wheeled <!--del_lnk--> mass transit systems. Maglevs could potentially reach velocities comparable to <!--del_lnk--> turboprop and <!--del_lnk--> jet aircraft (500 to 580&nbsp;km/h). Since much of a Maglev&#39;s propulsion system is in the track rather than the vehicle, Maglev trains are lighter and can ascend steeper slopes than conventional trains. They can be supported on lightweight elevated tracks. Maglevs have operated commercially since 1984. However, scientific and economic limitations have hindered the proliferation of the technology.<p>Maglev technology has minimal <!--del_lnk--> overlap with wheeled <a href="../../wp/t/Train.htm" title="Train">train</a> technology and is not compatible with conventional <!--del_lnk--> railroad tracks. Because they cannot share existing infrastructure, maglevs must be designed as complete transportation systems. The term &quot;maglev&quot; refers not only to the vehicles, but to the vehicle/guideway interaction; each being a unique design element specifically tailored to the other to create and precisely control magnetic levitation and propulsion.<p>The world&#39;s first <!--del_lnk--> commercial application of a high-speed maglev line is the IOS (initial operating segment) <!--del_lnk--> demonstration line in <a href="../../wp/s/Shanghai.htm" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a> that transports people 30 km (18.6 miles) to the airport in just 7 minutes 20 seconds (top speed of 431&nbsp;km/h or 268&nbsp;mph, average speed 250&nbsp;km/h or 150&nbsp;mph). Other maglev projects worldwide are being studied for feasibility.<p>

      <p>There are two primary types of maglev technology:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> electromagnetic suspension (EMS) uses the attractive magnetic force of a magnet beneath a rail to lift the train up.<li><!--del_lnk--> electrodynamic suspension (EDS) uses a repulsive force between two magnetic fields to push the train away from the rail.</ul>
      <p><a id="Electromagnetic_suspension" name="Electromagnetic_suspension"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Electromagnetic suspension</span></h4>
      <p>In current EMS systems, the train levitates above a steel rail while <!--del_lnk--> electromagnets, attached to the train, are oriented toward the rail from below. The <!--del_lnk--> electromagnets use feedback control to maintain a train at a constant distance from a track.<p><a id="Electrodynamic_suspension" name="Electrodynamic_suspension"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Electrodynamic suspension</span></h4>
      <p>In Electrodynamic suspension (EDS), both the rail and the train exert a magnetic field, and the train is levitated by the repusive force between these magnetic fields. The magnetic field in the train is produced by either superconducting electromagnets (as in <!--del_lnk--> JR-Maglev) or by an array of permanent magnets (as in <!--del_lnk--> Inductrack). The repulsive force in the track is created by an <!--del_lnk--> induced magnetic field in wires or other conducting strips in the track.<p>At slow speeds, the current induced in these coils and the resultant magnetic flux is not large enough to support the weight of the train. For this reason the train must have wheels or some other form of landing gear to support the train until it reaches a speed that can sustain levitation.<p>Propulsion coils on the guideway are used to exert a force on the magnets in the train and make the train move forwards. The propulsion coils that exert a force on the train are effectively a <!--del_lnk--> linear motor: An alternating current flowing through the coils generates a continuously varying magnetic field that moves forward along the track. The magnets on the train line up with this field, and the train moves.<p><a id="Pros_and_cons_of_different_technologies" name="Pros_and_cons_of_different_technologies"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Pros and cons of different technologies</span></h3>
      <p>Each implementation of the magnetic levitation principle for train-type travel involves advantages and disadvantages. Time will tell as to which principle, and whose implementation, wins out commercially.<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">

         <p>Neither Inductrack nor the Superconducting EDS are able to levitate vehicles at a standstill, although Inductrack provides levitation down to a much lower speed. Wheels are required for both systems. EMS systems are <!--del_lnk--> wheel-less.<p>The German Transrapid, Japanese HSST (Linimo), and Korean Rotem maglevs levitate at a standstill, with electricity extracted from guideway using power rails for the latter two, and wirelessly for Transrapid. If guideway power is lost on the move, the Transrapid is still able to generate levitation down to 10 km/h speed, using the power from onboard batteries. This is not the case with the HSST and Rotem systems.<a id="Propulsion" name="Propulsion"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Propulsion</span></h4>
         <p>An EMS system can provide both <!--del_lnk--> levitation and <!--del_lnk--> propulsion using an onboard linear motor. EDS systems can only levitate the train using the magnets onboard, not propel it forward. As such, vehicles need some other technology for <!--del_lnk--> propulsion. A linear motor (propulsion coils) mounted in the track is one solution. Over long distances where the cost of propulsion coils could be prohibitive, a <!--del_lnk--> propeller or <a href="../../wp/j/Jet_engine.htm" title="Jet engine">jet engine</a> could be used.<a id="Stability" name="Stability"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Stability</span></h4>
         <p>Static magnetic bearings using only electromagnets and permagnets are unstable, as explained by <!--del_lnk--> Earnshaw&#39;s theorem. As all EDS systems are moving systems, Earnshaw&#39;s theorem does not apply to them. EMS systems rely on active electronic <!--del_lnk--> stabilization. Such systems constantly measure the bearing distance and adjust the electromagnet current accordingly.<a id="Pros_and_cons_of_maglev_vs._conventional_trains" name="Pros_and_cons_of_maglev_vs._conventional_trains"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Pros and cons of maglev vs. conventional trains</span></h2>
         <p>Due to the lack of physical contact between the track and the vehicle, the only <!--del_lnk--> friction experienced by a maglev train is due to air resistance (although maglev trains also experience electromagnetic drag, this is relatively small at high speeds). The power consumption per passenger-km of the Transrapid Maglev train at 200 km/h is 24% less than the ICE at 200 km/h (22 Wh per seat-km, compared to 29 Wh per seat-km).<!--del_lnk--> <p>Because maglev trains do not run on rails, their speed is not limited by the tolerances of track designs. Systems have been proposed that operate at up to 650 km/h (404 mph), which is far faster than is practical with conventional <a href="../../wp/r/Rail_transport.htm" title="Rail transport">rail transport</a>. The very high maximum speed potential of maglevs make them potential competitors to airline routes of 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) or less.<p>The weight of the large <!--del_lnk--> electromagnets in EMS and EDS designs are a major design issue. A very strong magnetic field is required to levitate a massive <a href="../../wp/t/Train.htm" title="Train">train</a>. For this reason one research path is using superconductors to improve the efficiency of the electromagnets.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> April 2004, a peer-reviewed article in the Journal of the <!--del_lnk--> Acoustical Society of America stated that the noise from high-speed maglev trains is considerably more disturbing than standard steel on steel intercity train noise and is approximately as disturbing as road traffic. The difference between equal disturbance levels of maglev and traditional trains was 5dB (about 78% noisier).<!--del_lnk-->  Maglev is characterized by high noise levels and brief duration, which may startle those underneath the track. The type of noise a maglev emits is similar to a jet aircraft, due to the speed and shape of the maglev train.<!--del_lnk--> <a id="Economics" name="Economics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economics</span></h2>
         <p>High-speed maglevs can be expensive to build, but are comparable to the capital costs of building a traditional high-speed rail system from scratch, a highway system or a system of airports. More importantly, maglevs are significantly less expensive to operate and maintain than traditional high-speed trains, planes or intercity buses. The data coming out of the Shanghai maglev demonstration project indicates that operation and maintenance costs are quite low, and are indeed covered by the current relatively low volume of 7,000 passengers per day. Passenger volumes on this Pudong International Airport line is expected to rise dramatically once the line is extended from Longyang Road metro station all the way to Shanghai&#39;s downtown train depot.<p>The Shanghai maglev cost US$1.2 billion to build. At US$6 per passenger and 20,000 passengers per day, it would take over 27 years just to repay the capital costs (including cost of financing), not accounting for track maintenance, salaries and <a href="../../wp/e/Electricity.htm" title="Electricity">electricity</a> (see <!--del_lnk--> solar power).This computes to US$60 million per mile. The total $1.2 billion includes infrastructure capital costs such as manufacturing and construction facilities, and operational training, as part of the calculated per-mile cost of the short track. It is predicted that the per-mile costs of the extension to Hangzhou will be significantly lower.<p>The proposed <!--del_lnk--> Ch&#x16B;&#x14D; Shinkansen line is estimated to cost approximately US$<!--del_lnk--> 82 billion to build.<p>However, when one considers the cost of airport construction (e.g., <!--del_lnk--> Hong Kong Airport cost US$20 billion to build in 1998) and eight-lane <!--del_lnk--> Interstate <!--del_lnk--> highway systems that cost around US$50 million per mile, it becomes immediately apparent that maglev&#39;s costs are competitive, especially considering that they can handle much higher volumes of passengers per hour than airports or eight-lane highways and do it without introducing any <!--del_lnk--> air pollution along the <!--del_lnk--> right of way.<p>The only low-speed maglev (100 km/h) currently operational, the Japanese <!--del_lnk--> Linimo HSST, cost approximately US$100 million/km to build. Besides offering improved O&amp;M costs over other transit systems, these low-speed maglevs provide ultra-high levels of operational reliability and introduce little noise and zero air pollution into <!--del_lnk--> dense urban settings.<p>As maglev systems are deployed around the world, experts expect construction costs to drop as new construction methods are perfected.<a id="Existing_maglev_systems" name="Existing_maglev_systems"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Existing maglev systems</span></h2>

         <p>On <!--del_lnk--> December 31, <!--del_lnk--> 2000, the first crewed high-temperature superconducting maglev was tested successfully at Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China. This system is based on the principle that bulk high-temperature superconductors can be levitated or suspended stably above or below a permanent magnet. The load was over 530 kg and the levitation gap over 20 mm. The system uses <!--del_lnk--> liquid nitrogen, which is very cheap, to cool the superconductor.<a id="The_first.2C_the_German_patent_.281941.29" name="The_first.2C_the_German_patent_.281941.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The first, the German patent (1941)</span></h3>
         <p>The first patent for a magnetic levitation train propelled by linear motors was German Patent 707032, issued in June 1941. The US patent 12700 date 1st October 1907 was for a linear motor propelled train in which the motor, below the steel track, carried some but not all of the weight of the train ( inventor Alfred Zehden of Frankfurt-am-Main )<a id="Under_construction" name="Under_construction"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Under construction</span></h2><a id="Old_Dominion_University" name="Old_Dominion_University"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Old Dominion University</span></h3>
         <p>A track of less than a mile in length has been constructed at <!--del_lnk--> Old Dominion University in <!--del_lnk--> Norfolk, Virginia. The system is not <!--del_lnk--> operational, but research is currently ongoing to resolve some stability issues with the system. This system uses a &quot;smart train, dumb track&quot; that involves most of the sensors, magnets, and computation occurring on the train rather than the track. This system will cost less to build per mile than existing systems.

         <p>The <!--del_lnk--> history of High Speed Rail in Florida started in 1976 with feasibility study for service between <!--del_lnk--> Daytona Beach and <!--del_lnk--> St. Petersburg. In November of 2000, the Florida voters approved an amendment to the State constitution mandating the construction of a High Speed Transportation system to link the five largest urban areas in Florida. Construction was mandated to begin by November 1, 2003.<p>In October 2002, the Authority issued a Request for Proposal to Design, Build, Operate, Maintain and Finance (DBOM&amp;F) the first phase of the project from <!--del_lnk--> Tampa to <!--del_lnk--> Orlando. Based on Fluor Bombardier (FB) proposal first and the Global Rail Consortium (GRC) proposal, the cost of initial phase is approximately $2.4 billion.<p>In early 2004, Governor <!--del_lnk--> Jeb Bush endorsed an effort to repeal the 2000 amendment that mandated the construction of the High Speed Rail System which was approved by the voters, resulting in removal of the constitutional mandate.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Florida High Speed Rail Authority Act is still remains in effect pending any action from the Florida Legislature. In fiscal year 2004/05, no State funds were appropriated, and the Authority has operated on surplus funds from previous years.<a id="Honolulu" name="Honolulu"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Honolulu</span></h4>

The initial phase of the project would link Tacoma to Seattle, mirroring the old <!--del_lnk--> interurban line between those two cities. The same idea has re-surfaced with a conventional high-speed rail proposal, although its extension into British Columbia has been largely blocked by opposition on the part of the City of <!--del_lnk--> White Rock, British Columbia, which would sit astride the line.<a id="Vactrain" name="Vactrain"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Vactrain</span></h3>

         <p>More exotic proposals include maglev lines through vacuum-filled tunnels (see <!--del_lnk--> Vactrain), where the absence of air resistance would allow extremely high speeds, up to 6000-8000 km/h (4000-5000 mph) according to some sources. Theoretically, these tunnels could be built deep enough to pass under oceans or to use gravity to assist the trains&#39; acceleration. This would likely be prohibitively costly without major advances in <!--del_lnk--> tunnelling technology. Alternatives such as elevated concrete tubes with partial vacuums have been proposed to reduce these costs. If the trains topped out at around 8000 km/h (5000 mph), the 5567km trip between <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> and <!--del_lnk--> New York would take a short 54 minutes, effectively supplanting <a href="../../wp/a/Aircraft.htm" title="Aircraft">aircraft</a> as the world&#39;s fastest mode of public transportation.<a id="UniModal" name="UniModal"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">UniModal</span></h3>
