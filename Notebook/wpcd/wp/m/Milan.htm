      <p><b>Milan</b> (<!--del_lnk--> Italian: <i>Milano</i>; <!--del_lnk--> Milanese: <i>Mil&aacute;n</i> <!--del_lnk--> (listen)) is the main city of <!--del_lnk--> northern Italy, located in the plains of <!--del_lnk--> Lombardy. The city proper (<i>Comune di Milano</i>) has about 1,308,500 inhabitants (2004). The population of the <!--del_lnk--> urban area (<!--del_lnk--> Greater Milan <i>La Grande Milano</i>), comprising the core of <!--del_lnk--> Lombardy, is estimated, as of 2006, to be about 4,280,820 people.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>In European terms, Milan&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan area is a part of the so called Padan <!--del_lnk--> Megalopolis. By population, Milan is <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>&#39;s largest city and the 3rd Metro Area of the EU. Municipal borders wrap a relatively small area&mdash;about one-eighth that of <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a>&mdash;because of the historical high density of population centers in agriculturally rich <!--del_lnk--> Lombardy. The heavily urbanized area centered in Milan includes some <a href="../../wp/s/Switzerland.htm" title="Switzerland">Swiss</a> territories in southern <!--del_lnk--> Canton Ticino: this does not imply any kind of administrative unity, though. Milan is an <a href="../../wp/g/Global_city.htm" title="Global city">alpha world full service city</a> in GaWc inventory.<p>Milan&#39;s province (due to be dissolved sooner or later into the Metropolitan City, a new administrative unit not yet implemented) lies in the western part of <!--del_lnk--> Lombardy; it covers an area of 1,981 square kilometers and has a population of 3,839,216 (2005); in 1991, the population was 3,738,685. The province comprises 188 communes, ranging in population (2001) from Milan (1,308,311) to Nosate (638); between 1991 to 2001, the city of Milan has lost 113,084 inhabitants (8.3 percent) mostly due to suburban sprawl and expulsion of population from the inner city centre, which is now almost fully dedicated to offices and commerce. On November 2006 for the first time was certificated the official population of Milan Metro Area, in an area of more than 9,000 square kilometers, live 7,4 Millions.<p>The city is one of the world&#39;s major commercial and financial centers, and one of the wealthiest cities in the European Union. Milan is one of the world capitals of <a href="../../wp/f/Fashion.htm" title="Fashion">fashion</a> &mdash; along with <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Tokyo.htm" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>&mdash; and <!--del_lnk--> design. Indeed the English word <i><!--del_lnk--> milliner</i> is derived from the name of the city. The Lombard metropolis is famous for <a href="../../wp/f/Fashion.htm" title="Fashion">fashion</a> firms and shops (<!--del_lnk--> via Montenapoleone) and the <!--del_lnk--> Galleria Vittorio Emanuele in the Piazza Duomo, reputed to be the world&#39;s oldest shopping mall. Another famed Milanese product is the traditional <!--del_lnk--> Christmas sweet <!--del_lnk--> cake, called <!--del_lnk--> Panettone. Milan is also famous for the <!--del_lnk--> Alfa Romeo motorcar and for its <!--del_lnk--> silk production; but on the whole relies on its directional functions for the whole of Lombardy, its once proud and strong industrial base having been externalized throughout the region in the 60s-70s of the last century. The city hosted among other events the World Exposition in 1906, the football World Cup in 1934 and 1990, the football Euro Cup in 1980, and plans to host the World Expo of 2015.<p>Inhabitants of Milan are referred to as &quot;Milanese&quot; (Italian: <i>Milanesi</i> or informally <i>Meneghini</i> or <i>Ambrosiani</i>).<p>

      <p>Milan&#39;s name comes from the <!--del_lnk--> Celtic <i>Medelhan</i>, meaning &quot;in the middle of the plain&quot;, due either to its location in a plain close to the confluence of two small rivers, the Olona and the Seveso, or perhaps to its being close to, and roughly equidistant from, two major rivers, the Ticino and the Adda. Its Latin name, <i><!--del_lnk--> Mediolanum</i>, roughly meaning &quot;wool in the middle&quot;, also built on <!--del_lnk--> Celtic lore: Celts saw the boar as a mythical animal and according to a prophecy the site for the settlement would have been indicated to a Celtic king by the appearance of a wild pig or boar with a ridge of hair along its back, as reported by <!--del_lnk--> Cardano around <!--del_lnk--> 1626:<dl>
       <dd><i>Nel fabricar de le superbe mura</i><dd><i>De la prima Citt&agrave; ch&#39;abbian gl&#39;Insubri</i><dd><i>Usc&igrave; da i fondamenti un gran Cinghiale,</i><dd><i>Mezzo di pel setoso, e mezzo ignudo,</i><dd><i>Onde MILAN chiamossi</i><dd><i>Da gli Hedui, o Borgognoni, o pur da i Franchi,</i><dd><i>Da cui l&#39;origine hebbe,</i><dd><i>Che altri di MEZZA LANA dir potrebbe</i></dl>
      <p>Translated:<dl>
       <dd><i>While building the majestic wall</i><dd><i>Of the first Town of <!--del_lnk--> Insubres</i><dd><i>From the foundation a big boar came</i><dd><i>Half with silk hair, and half bare</i><dd><i>Therefore MILAN was called</i><dd><i>From <!--del_lnk--> Hedui, or <!--del_lnk--> Burgundians or even from <a href="../../wp/f/Franks.htm" title="Franks">Franks</a></i><dd><i>From which the origin came</i><dd><i>That other could call of half wool</i></dl>
      <p>Today the boar is still sometimes used as a symbol of the city. According to another explanation, <i>Mediolanum</i> comes from a corruption of <i>In medio lanorum</i> meaning <i>between the rivers</i> - actually Milan still includes the two small Olona and Seveso rivers.<p>The German name for the city is <i>Mailand</i>, while in the local <!--del_lnk--> Western Lombard dialect, the city&#39;s name is Mil&aacute;n, pronounced quite as in French.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>It is presumed Milan was originally founded by the <!--del_lnk--> Celts of Northern <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> around <!--del_lnk--> 600 BC and was conquered around <!--del_lnk--> 222 BC by the <!--del_lnk--> Romans, who gave it the name of <i>Mediolanum</i>. In the <a href="../../wp/4/4th_century.htm" title="4th century">4th century</a>, at the time of the bishop Saint <!--del_lnk--> Ambrose and Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Theodosius I, the city was briefly the capital of the <a href="../../wp/w/Western_Roman_Empire.htm" title="Western Roman Empire">Western Roman Empire</a>. At that time Milan was the second largest city in Europe, with more than 300,000 inhabitants. St Ambrose is now the Patron Saint of the city. With the <!--del_lnk--> Visigoth menace mounting, Milan lost its capital role to <!--del_lnk--> Ravenna in 402. <a href="../../wp/a/Attila_the_Hun.htm" title="Attila">Attila</a> plundered the city in 452 during his invasion of <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>, then the <!--del_lnk--> Ostrogoths of <!--del_lnk--> Uraia ravaged it in 541, during the disastrous <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Gothic war. The ghost of a city was then taken by the <!--del_lnk--> Lombards in 569; the main Byzantine officials, both civilian and religious, fled to <a href="../../wp/g/Genoa.htm" title="Genoa">Genoa</a> for safety. The Lombards made Milan capital of one of their main duchies, and the city slowly but surely recovered a role, if overshadowed by neighbouring <!--del_lnk--> Pavia and <!--del_lnk--> Monza.<p><a name="11th_century"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">11th century</span></h3>
      <p>In the eleventh century the city regained its importance and began to impose its power. Milan became a prosperous, if seldom quiet, <i><!--del_lnk--> comune</i>. The eleventh century saw the birth and growth of several papal and church reform movements, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Peace and Truce of God and the <!--del_lnk--> Gregorian reforms. Milan itself, the powerful but corrupt church was put under siege by the reformers of the so-called <i><!--del_lnk--> pataria</i>, a local movement led by both religious and secular figures. In the latter half of the century, Milan and its province suffered ecclesiastical schism and confusion as well as violence and war as the <i>patarini</i> struggled to reform the clergy. With peace and order attained in the early 1090s, Milan enterred the wider struggle between the power of the popes and the emperors. In the twelfth century, she led the other Italian cities in gaining semi-independence from the <a href="../../wp/h/Holy_Roman_Empire.htm" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> in the wars of the <!--del_lnk--> Lombard League against <!--del_lnk--> Frederick Barbarossa, culminating in the glorious <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Legnano (<!--del_lnk--> 1176). Thus, during the Middle Ages Milan became one of the most rich and powerful cities of Europe (due to its commerce and industries) conquering and influencing at times great part of northern Italy.<p>At the beginning of the 11th Century, Milan experienced several civil outbreaks. The main conflicts were between the Nobles and <!--del_lnk--> Plebeians. Therefore, a tripartite polity was formed, creating a compromise between the great nobles, lesser nobles, and plebeians, led by a <!--del_lnk--> podest&agrave;. There was also fighting between the <!--del_lnk--> Guelphs and Ghibellines, who supported the pope and emperor respectively. The ruling family of Milan, the Viscontis, supported the Ghibellines, and the emperor acknowledged Ottone Visconti as the Archbishop. The <!--del_lnk--> Visconti House went on to peacefully conquer <!--del_lnk--> Pavia, <!--del_lnk--> Piacenza, <!--del_lnk--> Bergamo, <!--del_lnk--> Brescia, and <!--del_lnk--> Parma. They gained support from their citizens by treating them charitably. In 1354, power fell into the hands of brothers Galeazzo and Bernab Visconti. Originally they split the city in two to share the power, but rejoined in 1359 to defeat Pavia. Pavia then became Galeazzo&#39;s city, where be built a university. When he died in 1387, he left his land to his son, <!--del_lnk--> Gian Galeazzo Visconti. However, Bernab was a different child. He ruled under strict laws, was threatened with excommunication, and became greedy after his brother&#39;s death. In 1385, when he attempted to take all the land back under one rule, Gian imprisoned him. Gian went on to be a powerful ruler, who expanded his empire arcoss northern Italy, gathering land as he went. The only northern city-state to avoid his conquest was Venice.

      <p>It is estimated that at the start of 14th century the city may have touched the number of 200,000 inhabitants. During the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Death.htm" title="Black Death">Plague</a> of <!--del_lnk--> 1349 Milan was one of the few places in Europe that was spared by the epidemic, but it was deeply affected by the plagues of 1402 (50,000 deaths), 1542 (80,000), 1576 (17,000) and 1629 (also known as <!--del_lnk--> Great Plague of Milan, 70,000 deaths). In the meantime its power was checked by <!--del_lnk--> Florence and <!--del_lnk--> Venice; thus last city conquered eastern Lombardy after the <!--del_lnk--> battle of Maclodio and kept it for centuries. During the <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> Milan was ruled by dukes of the <!--del_lnk--> Visconti (1272-1447) and later <!--del_lnk--> Sforza (1449-1499, 1512-1515, 1521-1535) families, who had great artists like <a href="../../wp/l/Leonardo_da_Vinci.htm" title="Leonardo da Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Bramante at their service. After trying to conquer the rest of northern Italy in the late 14th and 15th century, Milan was conquered by <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, and then later on by emperor <!--del_lnk--> Charles V, who took it in 1535 as a dependency of his Spanish possessions. The Spanish domination (up to 1700) is remembered as an epoch of bad rule and decline, but this is debatable, since the economy still flourished and textile industry kept growing in the countryside around the city.<p><a name="18th_century"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">18th century</span></h3>
      <p>In the 18th century <a href="../../wp/a/Austria.htm" title="Austria">Austria</a> replaced Spain as Milan&#39;s overlord, because the Spanish line of Habsburgs had died out: the Austrians provided a sound administration who did much to help the city. But the <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a> and the <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleonic_Wars.htm" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> saw the city annexed into the French satellite states of the <!--del_lnk--> Cisalpine Republic, which later became the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Italy. After this period, Milan was part of the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia under <!--del_lnk--> Austrian rule. By this time <a href="../../wp/n/Nationalism.htm" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a> and <a href="../../wp/l/Liberalism.htm" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a> were on the rise, and the Austrians were no more welcome.

The newly formed <!--del_lnk--> Savoy monarchy encouraged the use of the Neo-Renaissance style as a way to express patriotism, an excellent example of which is the Bagatti Valsecchi Museum in via Ges&ugrave;, 5, <!--del_lnk--> .

The city was bombed even after <!--del_lnk--> Pietro Badoglio surrendered to the allied forces in 1943 - Milan was part of <!--del_lnk--> Mussolini&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Italian Social Republic puppet state, and an important command centre of the German Army stationed in Italy. When war in Italy was finally over, <!--del_lnk--> April 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1945, Milan had been heavily damaged and entire <!--del_lnk--> neighborhoods such as Precotto and Turro were destroyed. After the war, the city was reconstructed and has again become an important financial and industrial centre of Italy. More than the 30% of the buildings were completely destroyed and another 30% were so heavily damaged that they were demolished in the first years after the war. Most of those buildings are located in the city centre.
