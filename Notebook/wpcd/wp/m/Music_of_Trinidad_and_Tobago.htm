      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Caribbean state of <a href="../../wp/t/Trinidad_and_Tobago.htm" title="Trinidad and Tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a> is best known as the homeland of <!--del_lnk--> calypso music, including <!--del_lnk--> 1950s stars <!--del_lnk--> Lord Kitchener and <!--del_lnk--> Mighty Sparrow. Other forms of music include Carnival songs like <!--del_lnk--> lavway and <!--del_lnk--> leggos, as well as <!--del_lnk--> bongo music (which originated at <!--del_lnk--> wakes). <!--del_lnk--> Yoruban <!--del_lnk--> shango and <!--del_lnk--> Dahomean <!--del_lnk--> rada are also popular among the descendants of <!--del_lnk--> indentured servants in <!--del_lnk--> Port of Spain.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Calypso was developed on the island of <!--del_lnk--> Trinidad, and has since become one of the major musical ancestors of diverse styles, including <a href="../../wp/r/Reggae.htm" title="Reggae">reggae</a>, <!--del_lnk--> soca and <!--del_lnk--> rapso. The <!--del_lnk--> musical genre began when <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">African</a> slaves were brought to the area to work <!--del_lnk--> plantations owned by <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europeans</a>, and the slaves were forbidden to talk to each other (in any case, they spoken dozens of different languages, so communication was inherently difficult). A <!--del_lnk--> creole culture was formed, combining elements of hundreds of African ethnic groups, native inhabitants of the islands, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a>, <!--del_lnk--> British and <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spanish</a> colonizers. The Spanish originally moved into the island in <!--del_lnk--> 1532, bringing African slaves. In <!--del_lnk--> 1783, the French began to immigrate in large numbers due to a Spanish rule encouraging <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholics to relocate to the islands. With <!--del_lnk--> St. Lucia and <a href="../../wp/d/Dominica.htm" title="Dominica">Dominica</a> taken by the British from the French one year later, in <!--del_lnk--> 1784, French immigrants came to dominate the island. In <!--del_lnk--> 1802, however, the French and African/Spanish creole population of the islands became a British colony, further muddying the cultural development of Trinidadians and Tobagans. <!--del_lnk--> Carnival had arrived with the French, and the slaves, who could not take part in Carnival, formed their own, parallel celebration called <!--del_lnk--> canboulay, where <!--del_lnk--> calypso music began its existence. In <!--del_lnk--> 1834, these two celebrations began a merger because the slaves were emancipated, while the islands&#39; ethnic mix further diversified by the mass migration of <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">Indians</a> beginning in <!--del_lnk--> 1845. Most were <!--del_lnk--> indentured servants and brought their own folk music, primarily from <!--del_lnk--> Uttar Pradesh and <!--del_lnk--> Bihar, to the native mix, resulting in <!--del_lnk--> chutney music.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Stick-fighting and African percussion music were banned in <!--del_lnk--> 1880, in response to the <!--del_lnk--> Canboulay Riots. They were replaced by bamboo sticks beaten together, but these too were eventually banned. In <!--del_lnk--> 1937, however, they reappeared, transformed as an orchestra of frying pans, dustbin lids and oil drums. These <!--del_lnk--> steel pans are now a major part of the Trinidadian music scene and are a popular section of the Canboulay music contests. In <!--del_lnk--> 1941, the <!--del_lnk--> United States Navy arrived on Trinidad, and the <i>panmen</i>, who were associated with lawlessness and violence, helped to popularize steel pan music among soldiers, which began its international popularization.<p>

      <dl>

      <p>Calypso, probably derived from a similar West African musical style called <!--del_lnk--> kaiso, arose as a means of communication among the slaves; <i>kaiso</i> is still used today as a synonym for <i>calypso</i> in Trinidad and some other islands, often by traditionalists, and is also used as a cry of encouragement for a performer, similar to <i>bravo</i> or <i>ol&eacute;</i>. Highly rhythmic and harmonic vocals characterized the music, which was most often sung in a <!--del_lnk--> French creole and led by a <!--del_lnk--> griot. As calypso developed, the role of the griot (originally a similar traveling musician in West Africa) became known as a <i>chantuelle</i> and eventually, <i><!--del_lnk--> calypsonian</i>. Calypso was popularized after the abolition of slavery and the ensuing growth of the <!--del_lnk--> Carnival festivals in the <!--del_lnk--> 1830s.<p><a id="Early_performers" name="Early_performers"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early performers</span></h3>
      <p>Early <i>chantwells</i> like <!--del_lnk--> Hannibal, <!--del_lnk--> Norman Le Blanc, <!--del_lnk--> Mighty Panther and <!--del_lnk--> Boadicea made names for themselves by criticizing the colonial government. In <!--del_lnk--> 1914 (see <!--del_lnk--> 1914 in music), calypso was recorded for the first time and the following decade saw the arrival of <!--del_lnk--> calypso tents, where calypsonians practiced and, eventually, new musics for Carnival were exhibited (including <!--del_lnk--> lavway and <!--del_lnk--> leggos). During Carnival, calypsonians competed for awards like the <!--del_lnk--> Road March, <!--del_lnk--> National Calypso Monarch, <!--del_lnk--> Queen Calypso, <!--del_lnk--> Junior Monarch and <!--del_lnk--> Extempo Monarch in contests called <!--del_lnk--> picong, when two performers trade bawdy and irreverent jibes at each other and the day&#39;s events. Soon, stars like <!--del_lnk--> Lord Invader and <!--del_lnk--> The Roaring Lion grew in stature (the <!--del_lnk--> 1930s <!--del_lnk--> Golden Age of Calypso) and became more closely aligned with the independence movement. Some songs were banned or censored by the British colonial government, and calypso became a method of underground communication and spreading anti-British information. The style thus developed was called <!--del_lnk--> oratorical calypso.<p>
       <br /> These early popular performers led the way for calypso&#39;s mainstreaming with artists like <!--del_lnk--> Lord Kitchener, <!--del_lnk--> Harry Belafonte and <!--del_lnk--> Mighty Sparrow. Belafonte, a <a href="../../wp/j/Jamaica.htm" title="Jamaica">Jamaican</a>-American singing in <a href="../../wp/a/American_English.htm" title="American English">American English</a>, was by far the most popular internationally during this wave (his <i><!--del_lnk--> Calypso</i> album, Belafonte was the first artist to sell a million copies), but his music was also extensively criticized for watering down the sound of calypso.<p><!--del_lnk--> 1947 saw Lord Kitchener and <!--del_lnk--> Killer forming the renegade <!--del_lnk--> calypso tent <!--del_lnk--> Young Brigade. The term <i>Young Brigade</i> soon came to refer to a specific group of calypsonians that used fictional narratives and humor with new, more dance-able rhythms. Kitchener was by far the most popular of the Young Brigade calypsonians, and he helped popularize calypso in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and elsewhere. <!--del_lnk--> Mighty Sparrow&#39;s first hit was <i><!--del_lnk--> Jean and Dinah</i>, celebrating the departure of American military forces from Trinidad; the song launched a new generation of politically active calypso music, which soon became associated with the <!--del_lnk--> People&#39;s National Movement. <!--del_lnk--> Roaring Lion was also a major part of this vanguard in calypso music, and he became known for a traditionalist style that he maintained throughout his career.<p>During the <!--del_lnk--> 1970s, calypso&#39;s popularity waned throughout the world, including the Caribbean. Derivatives include an uptempo version mixed with musical styles from the large <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">Indian</a> minority in Trinidad and Tobago and American <!--del_lnk--> soul, called <!--del_lnk--> soca, and a <a href="../../wp/h/Hip_hop_music.htm" title="Hip hop music">hip hop</a> and <!--del_lnk--> dub-influenced style called <!--del_lnk--> rapso both became popular in Trinidad and other islands. Soca was by the most influential in terms of international sales, since rapso&#39;s crossover appeal to mainstream tastes has been extremely limited. Old-time calypsonians and purists, however, preferred rapso&#39;s continuation of the lyrical ambidexterity that helped make calypso the world-famous, innovative art form it has become; many criticized soca&#39;s perceived watering-down of calypso, including veteran calypsonians like <!--del_lnk--> Chalkdust, who asked &quot;Are we to put water in the brandy, singing just two or three words [that mainstream audiences] can understand and dance to?&quot; <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Trinidadians began popularising <!--del_lnk--> chutney music during the same time period. In the mid-1970s, artists like <!--del_lnk--> Sundar Popo made the music mainstream.<p><a id="Soca" name="Soca"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Soca</span></h2>
      <dl>
       <dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Soca is said to have been invented in <!--del_lnk--> 1963 (see <!--del_lnk--> 1963 in music) by <!--del_lnk--> Lord Shorty&#39;s &quot;Clock and Dagger&quot;. Shorty added Indian instruments, including the <!--del_lnk--> dholak, <!--del_lnk--> tabla and <!--del_lnk--> dhantal and soon rivaled <a href="../../wp/r/Reggae.htm" title="Reggae">reggae</a> as the most popular form of Caribbean music. Soca reached its modern form by the early 1970s under the influence of American soul, <!--del_lnk--> disco and <!--del_lnk--> funk music, which reached Trinidadian artists when they began recording in <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a>; by this time, most of the Indian-derived elements had been removed from the genre. Shorty&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> 1974 <i><!--del_lnk--> Endless Vibrations</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Soul of Calypso</i> brought soca to its peak of international fame. Less lyrically revolutionary than traditional calypso, soca has remained mostly focused on good times throughout its history, though artists like <!--del_lnk--> Gypsy (whose <!--del_lnk--> 1986 &quot;The Sinking Ship&quot; helped remove the <!--del_lnk--> People&#39;s National Movement from the Trinidadian government) continued calypso&#39;s socially-aware traditions. Soca&#39;s popularity grew through the 70s and early <!--del_lnk--> 1980s, finally becoming an international chart-topper after &quot;Hot! Hot! Hot!&quot;, a <!--del_lnk--> 1983 release by <!--del_lnk--> Arrow, who hailed from <a href="../../wp/m/Montserrat.htm" title="Montserrat">Montserrat</a> and not Trinidad. Arrow soon proved himself to be one of the most innovative soca artists of the 80s, incorporating <!--del_lnk--> zouk and other influences into a series of best-selling singles. Other artists of the 80s put new islands on the soca map, especially <!--del_lnk--> Shadow and <!--del_lnk--> Tobago, as well as <a href="../../wp/a/Anguilla.htm" title="Anguilla">Anguilla</a> (<!--del_lnk--> Swallow) and <a href="../../wp/b/Barbados.htm" title="Barbados">Barbados</a> (<!--del_lnk--> Square One), and added influences from African <!--del_lnk--> spirituals (<!--del_lnk--> Superblue), <!--del_lnk--> gospel (Lord Shorty, under his new name <i>Ras Shorty I</i>), <a href="../../wp/r/Reggae.htm" title="Reggae">reggae</a> (<!--del_lnk--> Byron Lee), <!--del_lnk--> Indian music (<!--del_lnk--> Mungal Patasar) and funk (<!--del_lnk--> Lord Nelson). The most important fusion was <!--del_lnk--> ragga-soca, which combined Jamaican <!--del_lnk--> ragga with soca. <!--del_lnk--> Bunji Garlin, <!--del_lnk--> KMC, <!--del_lnk--> Magadan and <!--del_lnk--> Machel Montano &amp; Xtatic were the most popular of the ragga-soca bands of the <!--del_lnk--> 1990s.<p><a id="Rapso" name="Rapso"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Rapso</span></h2>
      <dl>
       <dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Rapso has become the most influential of these two main descendants of calypso; it arose as <!--del_lnk--> Black Power and <!--del_lnk--> Pan-Africanist thought spread in Trinidad. <!--del_lnk--> Lancelot Layne is said to have invented the genre with his <!--del_lnk--> 1971 hit &quot;Blow Away&quot;, while <!--del_lnk--> Cheryl Byron brought rapso to calypso tents in <!--del_lnk--> 1976. The term <i>rapso</i> first appeared in <!--del_lnk--> 1980 on <i><!--del_lnk--> Busting Out</i>, an album by <!--del_lnk--> Brother Resistance and his <!--del_lnk--> Network Riddum Band. Rapso has currently become one of the most prevalent expressions of music on Trinidad itself, but is largely absorbed into calypso during Carnival celebrations and contests. The 1990s saw a more politically and spiritually-conscious form of rapso, which has been infused with soul and reggae music, as well as native <!--del_lnk--> J&#39;ouvert, an early introduction to Carnival which consists of percussionists using makeshift materials to hammer out a beat.<p><a id="Extempo" name="Extempo"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Extempo</span></h2>
      <dl>

      <p>Extempo, or extempo calypso, or calypso war, is a lyrically improvised form of calypso. An annual competition takes place at the <!--del_lnk--> Trinidad Carnival for the title of <!--del_lnk--> Extempo Monarch.<p><a id="Brass_bands" name="Brass_bands"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Brass bands</span></h2>
      <p>Since <!--del_lnk--> 1986 saw the rise of <!--del_lnk--> David Rudder, <a href="../../wp/b/Brass_instrument.htm" title="Brass instrument">brass</a> bands have begun to dominate the Carnival competitions. Brass bands had long been a part of Trinidad&#39;s cultural heritage, but Rudder popularized the genre and helped inspire the founding of the <!--del_lnk--> Caribbean Brass Festival in <!--del_lnk--> 1991.<p><a id="Chutney_music" name="Chutney_music"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Chutney music</span></h2>
      <dl>

      <p>At the same time, <!--del_lnk--> chutney became a massive force in Trinidadian music, arising from the island&#39;s <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">Indian</a> population. It has now become mainstream across the islands and elsewhere in the Caribbean, and has spawned its own subgenres, including <!--del_lnk--> ragga chutney, <!--del_lnk--> chutney-hip hop, <!--del_lnk--> soca-bhangra, <!--del_lnk--> bhangra-wine and <!--del_lnk--> chutney-bhangra.<p><a id="Steelband_and_Parang" name="Steelband_and_Parang"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Steelband and Parang</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Steelband and <!--del_lnk--> pan music have achieved great popularity in Trinidad. <!--del_lnk--> Latin American-derived seasonal <!--del_lnk--> Christmas music called <!--del_lnk--> parang traditionally involves serenaders moving throughout homes or districts playing staple instruments, such as the cuatro (a four-stringed guitar), the <!--del_lnk--> maracas (indigenously known as chac-chacs), and the guitar. <!--del_lnk--> Chutney-soca and <!--del_lnk--> chut-kai-pang (chutney, parang and calypso, mixed with <a href="../../wp/v/Venezuela.htm" title="Venezuela">Venezuelan</a>-derived rhythms) have also achieved some popularity.<p><a id="Rock_music" name="Rock_music"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Rock music</span></h2>
      <p>Trinidad and Tobago has an underground <!--del_lnk--> rock and <!--del_lnk--> heavy metal scene with many small shows being held throughout the year. The largest of such shows is the annual Pop Music Awards held at the <i>Tsunami nightclub</i> in <!--del_lnk--> Chaguaramas and the Samaan Tree Rock Festival <!--del_lnk-->  in Aranguez.<p>The band that has had the most international success thus far is probably <!--del_lnk--> The Orange Sky, led by <!--del_lnk--> Nigel Rojas they have sold over 10,000 records in the caribbean alone. <!--del_lnk--> jointpop, led by <!--del_lnk--> Gary Hector, has a strong local following and has won significant acclaim from Trinidadian critics.
