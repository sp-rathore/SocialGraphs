      <p><b>McFly</b> are an <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a> <!--del_lnk--> pop rock band who were successfully launched into the music scene in early <!--del_lnk--> 2004 with their number one single, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> 5 Colours in Her Hair&quot;. The band was founded by <!--del_lnk--> Tom Fletcher (born <!--del_lnk--> July 17, <!--del_lnk--> 1985) and also consists of <!--del_lnk--> Danny Jones (born <!--del_lnk--> March 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1986), <!--del_lnk--> Dougie Poynter (born <!--del_lnk--> November 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1987) and <!--del_lnk--> Harry Judd (born <!--del_lnk--> December 23, <!--del_lnk--> 1985). They are signed to the <!--del_lnk--> Island Records label and are managed by <!--del_lnk--> Prestige Management.<p>As of <!--del_lnk--> December 2006, McFly have had eleven <!--del_lnk--> top ten singles, six of which reached number one in the <!--del_lnk--> UK Singles Chart and two number one albums, their debut being <i><!--del_lnk--> Room on the 3rd Floor</i> followed by <i><!--del_lnk--> Wonderland</i>. Their third album, <i><!--del_lnk--> Motion in the Ocean</i>, was released on <!--del_lnk--> November 6, <!--del_lnk--> 2006 and charted at number six. An announcement was made on their <!--del_lnk--> MySpace page in <!--del_lnk--> April 2007 that the band would be releasing a Greatest Hits so Far compilation in <!--del_lnk--> November 2007, and a fourth studio album in March 2008.<p>

      <p>McFly&#39;s name was chosen by Fletcher, the band&#39;s founding member, based on his love for the American science-fiction comedy <!--del_lnk--> Back to the Future, films and <!--del_lnk--> Michael J. Fox&#39;s character <!--del_lnk--> Marty McFly. Fletcher had originally auditioned for <!--del_lnk--> Busted, but was rejected. He then started writing songs with Busted member <!--del_lnk--> James Bourne and was asked to come along to film auditions for a new band, V. Jones came along to the audition mistaking it for an audition for a Busted-like band. Fletcher spoke to Jones afterwards and Jones and Fletcher moved into the intercontinental hotel in london for 2 months, and the two began writing songs along with Bourne. To complete the band, they held auditions at London&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Covent Garden for a drummer and a bass player. Coincidentally, Poynter and Judd both auditioned on the same day. Thus, McFly was formed.<p><a id="Room_on_the_3rd_Floor" name="Room_on_the_3rd_Floor"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline"><i>Room on the 3rd Floor</i></span></h3>
      <p>McFly&#39;s early sound was a mixture of pop and punk. Their debut single, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> 5 Colours in Her Hair&quot;, released March 29, 2004, entered the <!--del_lnk--> UK Singles Chart at <!--del_lnk--> number one in April 2004 and stayed there for two weeks. In July 2004 their second single, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Obviously&quot;, also topped the charts. This was followed by the album <i><!--del_lnk--> Room on the 3rd Floor</i> debuting at number one in the <!--del_lnk--> UK Albums Chart. The album broke records, as McFly were the youngest band to have a debut album enter the charts in the top position, beating <a href="../../wp/t/The_Beatles.htm" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>. The third single, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> That Girl&quot;, was released on <!--del_lnk--> September 6, <!--del_lnk--> 2004 and lost the battle for the top spot to <!--del_lnk--> Brian McFadden&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Real To Me&quot;. It went to number three, despite topping midweek sales charts. The fourth single, <!--del_lnk--> Room on the 3rd Floor (the album&#39;s title track), was released on <!--del_lnk--> November 15, <!--del_lnk--> 2004 and made number five. The idea for the album name <i>&quot;Room on the Third Floor&quot;</i> came from where Danny and Tom wrote most of the songs for the album. They wrote them while staying in a room on the third floor. This also gave them the idea for the song &quot;Room on the Third Floor&quot;<p><a id="Wonderland" name="Wonderland"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline"><i>Wonderland</i></span></h3>
      <p>In March 2005, McFly released &quot;<!--del_lnk--> All About You/You&#39;ve Got a Friend&quot;, a <!--del_lnk--> double A-side of their sixth and seventh singles and the first release from their second album, <i><!--del_lnk--> Wonderland</i>, which features a 60-piece orchestra. The single reached number one for a week on <!--del_lnk--> March 13, <!--del_lnk--> 2005 and the profits from the single were donated to <!--del_lnk--> Comic Relief. The video for &quot;You&#39;ve Got a Friend&quot; was shot in <a href="../../wp/u/Uganda.htm" title="Uganda">Uganda</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>, which McFly visited for the charity appeal. They completed their first arena tour in October 2005. The second single from <i>Wonderland</i>, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> I&#39;ll Be OK&quot;, was released in the UK on the <!--del_lnk--> 15 August <!--del_lnk--> 2005 and scored them their fourth UK number one. The album itself was released on <!--del_lnk--> 29 August <!--del_lnk--> 2005 entering at number one. The third single from <i>Wonderland</i>, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> I Wanna Hold You&quot;, was released <!--del_lnk--> October 17, giving them their sixth top three single, missing out on number one to the <a href="../../wp/a/Arctic_Monkeys.htm" title="Arctic Monkeys">Arctic Monkeys</a>. Their fourth single, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Ultraviolet/The Ballad of Paul K&quot; was released on <!--del_lnk--> 12 December <!--del_lnk--> 2005 and reached number nine.<p><a id="Motion_in_the_Ocean" name="Motion_in_the_Ocean"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline"><i>Motion in the Ocean</i></span></h3>
      <p>The first single from <!--del_lnk--> Motion in the Ocean was named, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Please, Please&quot;, released in the UK as a double A-side with the <a href="../../wp/q/Queen_%2528band%2529.htm" title="Queen (band)">Queen</a> hit &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Don&#39;t Stop Me Now&quot; on <!--del_lnk--> July 17, <!--del_lnk--> 2006 as the official song for <!--del_lnk--> Sport Relief 2006. The double A-side reached number one in the UK charts on <!--del_lnk--> July 23, <!--del_lnk--> 2006 making it the band&#39;s fifth number one single of their career. After losing a bet to the owner of <!--del_lnk--> G-A-Y, McFly had to appear naked on stage as they did in their &quot;Please, Please&quot; video. On <!--del_lnk--> 14 September <!--del_lnk--> 2006, it was confirmed via an email newsletter from McFly&#39;s official website, that the third album would be called <i>Motion in the Ocean</i>. The album was released on <!--del_lnk--> November 6, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, and reached number 6. The second release from the album, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Star Girl&quot; was released on <!--del_lnk--> October 23, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, to promote the album. &quot;Star Girl&quot; reached number one in its first week with 54,802 copies sold. The third release from the album, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Sorry&#39;s Not Good Enough/Friday Night&quot;, was released on <!--del_lnk--> December 18, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, and reached number three in the UK singles charts. &quot;Friday Night&quot; is featured in the movie <i><!--del_lnk--> Night at the Museum</i>, which was released on <!--del_lnk--> December 22, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, in Canada and the US and <!--del_lnk--> December 26, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, in the UK.. Their next single, <!--del_lnk--> Baby&#39;s Coming Back/Transylvania, was released on the <!--del_lnk--> 7th May <!--del_lnk--> 2007. The original single release date was due to be February 26th, but the band took up the offer to return at that time to the town of Kamwokya in <a href="../../wp/u/Uganda.htm" title="Uganda">Uganda</a>, which they previously visited for <!--del_lnk--> Comic Relief 2005.<p>

You&#39;ve got a friend<p><a id="Musical_style" name="Musical_style"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Musical style</span></h2>
      <p>McFly&#39;s style has been dubbed by themselves and others in the music business as &quot;Nu-Pop&quot; but is possibly more commonly considered <!--del_lnk--> pop or <!--del_lnk--> pop rock. Despite the band&#39;s pop image and reputation, there are musical differences from other contemporary <!--del_lnk--> boybands. Influence is apparent from bands such as <!--del_lnk--> The Raspberries (particularly <!--del_lnk--> Eric Carmen-penned material), <!--del_lnk--> The Beach Boys, and <a href="../../wp/t/The_Beatles.htm" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> (particularly <a href="../../wp/p/Paul_McCartney.htm" title="Paul McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>-penned material). Lyrically, however, their style is closer, though not quite similar, to other contemporary guitar pop bands such as <!--del_lnk--> Busted . McFly are often considered similar in style to the now defunct Busted, with whom they shared a record label and were generally considered to be friends. Indeed, <!--del_lnk--> James Bourne of Busted and Son of Dork, has had a hand in writing several of McFly&#39;s biggest hits, and Tom Fletcher had also written tracks for bands James Bourne has been involved with including Busted&#39;s hit single &#39;Crashed the Wedding&#39;. However, though similar, Busted evidence greater influence from <!--del_lnk--> pop punk bands such as <!--del_lnk--> Blink 182 and <!--del_lnk--> Sum 41 than 1960s <!--del_lnk--> rock, in addition to their clear pop overtones.<p><a id="Cover_songs" name="Cover_songs"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Cover songs</span></h2>
      <p>McFly have recorded and performed a variety of officially released and unreleased <!--del_lnk--> cover versions of well-known songs.<p><a name="2004"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">2004</span></h4>
      <p>McFly collaborated with <!--del_lnk--> Busted for a cover of <!--del_lnk--> the Kinks&#39; song &quot;Lola&quot; (which was a B-side on the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> 5 Colours in Her Hair&quot; single) and a version of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Build Me Up Buttercup&quot; by <!--del_lnk--> The Foundations from Busted&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Crashed The Wedding&quot; single. Their cover of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Help!&quot;, originally by <a href="../../wp/t/The_Beatles.htm" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>, was featured on the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Obviously&quot; single while &quot;<!--del_lnk--> She Loves You&quot;, also by The Beatles, was featured on the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> That Girl&quot; single. &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot;, originally by <a href="../../wp/q/Queen_%2528band%2529.htm" title="Queen (band)">Queen</a>, was featured on the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Room on the Third Floor&quot; single.<p><a name="2005"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">2005</span></h4>

McFly also recorded the 2004 hit &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Mr Brightside&quot;, originally by <!--del_lnk--> The Killers, which is featured on the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> I Wanna Hold You&quot; single, and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> I Predict a Riot&quot;, originally by the <!--del_lnk--> Kaiser Chiefs, which they performed at <!--del_lnk--> BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge session and is also featured on the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Ultraviolet&quot; single.

They also released covers of songs as singles such as <!--del_lnk--> The Who&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Pinball Wizard&quot;, which they performed on <!--del_lnk--> Movie Music Mania on <!--del_lnk--> November 12, <!--del_lnk--> 2005.

When performing this cover on their <!--del_lnk--> Motion In The Ocean tour 2006, they were joined onstage by Queen guitarist <!--del_lnk--> Brian May at <!--del_lnk--> Wembley Arena, who also performed the opening riff to &quot;<!--del_lnk--> 5 Colours in Her Hair&quot;. <!--del_lnk--> Matt Willis also performed &quot;Don&#39;t Stop Me Now&quot; with the band at Wembley Arena and <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Evening News Arena. Also on the tour, they performed &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Fight for Your Right (To Party)&quot;, originally by the <!--del_lnk--> Beastie Boys and the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Ghostbusters&quot; theme tune, originally by <!--del_lnk--> Ray Parker Jr. A few weeks later, they opened <!--del_lnk--> Children in Need 2006 with &quot;<!--del_lnk--> I Wanna Hold Your Hand&quot; by The Beatles. The song &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Rockin&#39; Robin&quot;, originally by <!--del_lnk--> Bobby Day, was featured on the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Sorry&#39;s Not Good Enough/Friday Night&quot; single, and the band also performed it at the <!--del_lnk--> Top Of The Pops Christmas Special.<p><a name="2007"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">2007</span></h4>
