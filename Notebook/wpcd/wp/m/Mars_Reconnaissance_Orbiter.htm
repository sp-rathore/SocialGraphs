      <p><!--del_lnk--> NASA&#39;s <b>Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</b> (<b>MRO</b>) is a multipurpose <!--del_lnk--> spacecraft designed to conduct <!--del_lnk--> reconnaissance and exploration of <a href="../../wp/m/Mars.htm" title="Mars">Mars</a> from orbit. The $720 million <!--del_lnk--> USD spacecraft was built by <!--del_lnk--> Lockheed Martin under the supervision of the <!--del_lnk--> Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It was launched <!--del_lnk--> August 12, <!--del_lnk--> 2005 and attained Martian orbit on <!--del_lnk--> March 10, <!--del_lnk--> 2006. It has recently finished <!--del_lnk--> aerobraking, and entered its final science orbit. It is expected to begin its primary science phase in November 2006.<p><i>MRO</i> contains a host of scientific instruments such as <!--del_lnk--> cameras, <!--del_lnk--> spectrometers, and <!--del_lnk--> RADAR, which will be used to analyze the <!--del_lnk--> landforms, <!--del_lnk--> stratigraphy, <a href="../../wp/m/Mineral.htm" title="Mineral">minerals</a>, and <a href="../../wp/i/Ice.htm" title="Ice">ice</a> of Mars. It will pave the way for future spacecraft by monitoring daily weather and surface conditions, studying potential landing sites, and testing a new telecommunications system. <i>MRO&#39;</i>s telecommunications system will <!--del_lnk--> transfer more data back to Earth than all previous interplanetary missions combined, and <i>MRO</i> will serve as a highly capable relay satellite for future missions.<p><i>MRO</i> joins four other spacecraft currently studying Mars: <i><!--del_lnk--> Mars Express</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Mars Odyssey</i>, and two <i><a href="../../wp/m/Mars_Exploration_Rover.htm" title="Mars Exploration Rover">Mars Exploration Rovers</a></i>.

      <p><i>Mars Surveyor Orbiter</i>, an orbiting satellite whose hallmark was a high-resolution camera, was first proposed to NASA in 1999. It was one of two missions being considered for the 2003 <!--del_lnk--> launch opportunity; however, during the proposal process the orbiter competed and lost against what became known as the <!--del_lnk--> Mars Exploration Rovers. The orbiter mission was rescheduled for launch in 2005, and <!--del_lnk--> NASA announced its final name, <i>Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</i>, on <!--del_lnk--> October 26, <!--del_lnk--> 2000..<p><i>MRO</i> was modeled after NASA&#39;s highly successful <!--del_lnk--> Mars Global Surveyor to conduct surveillance of Mars from orbit. Early specifications of the satellite included a large camera to take high resolution pictures of Mars. In this regard, Jim Garvin, the Mars exploration program scientist for NASA, proclaimed that <i>MRO</i> would be a &quot;microscope in orbit&quot;. The satellite was also to include a visible-near-infrared spectrograph.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> October 3, <!--del_lnk--> 2001, NASA chose <!--del_lnk--> Lockheed Martin as the primary contractor for the spacecraft&#39;s fabrication. By the end of 2001 all of the mission&#39;s instruments were selected. There were no major setbacks during <i>MRO&#39;</i>s construction, and the spacecraft was moved to <!--del_lnk--> John F. Kennedy Space Centre on <!--del_lnk--> May 1, <!--del_lnk--> 2005 to prepare it for launch.<p><a id="Launch_and_orbital_insertion" name="Launch_and_orbital_insertion"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Launch and orbital insertion</span></h2>

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> August 12, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, <i>MRO</i> was launched aboard an <!--del_lnk--> Atlas V-401 rocket from Space Launch Complex 41 at <!--del_lnk--> Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The <!--del_lnk--> Centaur upper stage of the rocket completed its burns over a fifty-six minute period and placed <i>MRO</i> in <!--del_lnk--> interplanetary transfer orbit towards Mars.<p><i>MRO</i> cruised through interplanetary space for 7.5 months before reaching Mars, and most of the scientific instruments and experiments were tested and calibrated en route. To ensure proper orbital insertion upon reaching Mars, four trajectory correction maneuvers were planned and a fifth emergency maneuver was discussed. However, only three trajectory correction maneuvers were necessary, saving fuel for <i>MRO&#39;</i>s extended mission.<p><i>MRO</i> began orbital insertion by approaching Mars on <!--del_lnk--> March 10, <!--del_lnk--> 2006 and passing above its southern hemisphere at an altitude of 370&ndash;400&nbsp;km (190&nbsp;mi). All six of <i>MRO&#39;</i>s main engines burned for 27 minutes to slow the probe from ~2,900&nbsp;m/s to ~1,900&nbsp;m/s (6,500&nbsp;mph to 4,250&nbsp;mph). The helium pressurization tank was colder than expected, which reduced the pressure in the fuel tank by about 21&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> kPa (3&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> psi). The reduced pressure caused the engine thrust to be diminished by 2%, but <i>MRO</i> automatically compensated by extending the burn time by 33 seconds.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Orbital insertion placed the orbiter in a highly <!--del_lnk--> elliptical polar orbit with a period of approximately 35.5 hours. Shortly after insertion, the <!--del_lnk--> periapsis &mdash; the point in the orbit closest to Mars &mdash; was 3,806&nbsp;km from the planet&#39;s centre (426&nbsp;km from its surface). The <!--del_lnk--> apoapsis &mdash; the point in the orbit farthest from Mars &mdash; was 47,972&nbsp;km from the planet&#39;s centre (44,500&nbsp;km from its surface).<p>On <!--del_lnk--> March 30, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, <i>MRO</i> began the process of <!--del_lnk--> aerobraking, a three-step procedure that cuts in half the fuel needed to achieve a lower, more circular orbit with a shorter period. First, during its first five orbits of the planet (one Earth week), <i>MRO</i> used its thrusters to drop the periapsis of its orbit into aerobraking altitude. This altitude depends on the thickness of the <!--del_lnk--> atmosphere because Martian atmospheric density changes with its <!--del_lnk--> seasons. Second, while using its thrusters to make minor corrections to its periapsis altitude, <i>MRO</i> maintained aerobraking altitude for 445 planetary orbits (about 5 Earth months) to reduce the apoapsis of the orbit to 450&nbsp;km (280&nbsp;mi). This was done in such a way so as to not heat the spacecraft too much, but also dip enough into the atmosphere to slow the spacecraft down. After the process was complete, <i>MRO</i> used its thrusters to move its periapsis out of the edge of the Martian atmosphere, <!--del_lnk--> August 30, <!--del_lnk--> 2006.<p>In September of 2006 <i>MRO</i> fired its thrusters twice more to fine-tune its final, nearly circular orbit approximately 250 to 316&nbsp;km (155 to 196&nbsp;mi) above the Martian surface. The SHARAD dipole antenna were deployed the <!--del_lnk--> September 16. All of the scientific instruments will be tested and most were turned off prior to the <!--del_lnk--> solar conjunction which occurred from <!--del_lnk--> October 7, <!--del_lnk--> 2006 to <!--del_lnk--> November 6, <!--del_lnk--> 2006. The &quot;primary science phase&quot; began after the conjunction ended.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> November 17, <!--del_lnk--> 2006 NASA announced the successful test of the MRO as an orbital communications relay. Using the NASA rover &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Spirit&quot; as the point of origin for the transmission, the MRO acted as a relay for transmitting data back to Earth.<p><a id="Mission_objectives" name="Mission_objectives"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Mission objectives</span></h2>

It will also provide a transmission relay and critical navigation data during their landing.<p><i>MRO</i> will also use its on-board scientific equipment to study the Martian <a href="../../wp/c/Climate.htm" title="Climate">climate</a>, <a href="../../wp/w/Weather.htm" title="Weather">weather</a>, <!--del_lnk--> atmosphere, and <a href="../../wp/g/Geology.htm" title="Geology">geology</a>, and to search for signs of <!--del_lnk--> water in the <!--del_lnk--> polar caps and underground. In addition, <i>MRO</i> will look for the remains of the previously lost <!--del_lnk--> Mars Polar Lander and <!--del_lnk--> Beagle 2 spacecraft, and will serve as the first step in setting up an <!--del_lnk--> internet protocol for the different <!--del_lnk--> planets in our solar system. After its main science operations are completed, the probe&#39;s extended mission will continue using the communication and navigation system for future lander and rover probes.<p><a id="Events_and_discoveries" name="Events_and_discoveries"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Events and discoveries</span></h2>

      <p>The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment camera is a 0.5&nbsp;m <!--del_lnk--> reflecting telescope, the largest ever carried on a <!--del_lnk--> deep space mission, and has a <!--del_lnk--> resolution of 1 <!--del_lnk--> microradian (&mu;rad), or 0.3&nbsp;m from an altitude of 300&nbsp;km. In comparison, <!--del_lnk--> satellite images of Earth are generally available with a resolution of 0.1&nbsp;m, and satellite images on <!--del_lnk--> Google Maps are available to 1&nbsp;m. HiRISE collects images in three colour bands, 400 to 600&nbsp;nm (<!--del_lnk--> blue-<!--del_lnk--> green or B-G), 550 to 850&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> nm (<!--del_lnk--> red) and 800 to 1,000&nbsp;nm (<!--del_lnk--> near infrared or NIR).<p>Red colour images are 20,264 <!--del_lnk--> pixels across (6&nbsp;km wide), and B-G and NIR are 4,048 pixels across (1.2&nbsp;km wide). HiRISE&#39;s on-board computer reads these lines in time with the orbiter&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> ground speed, and images are potentially unlimited in length. Practically however, their length is limited by the computer&#39;s 28 <!--del_lnk--> Gigabit (Gb) memory capacity, and the nominal maximum size is 20,000 &times; 40,000 pixels (800 <!--del_lnk--> megapixels) and 4,000 &times; 40,000 pixels (160 megapixels) for B-G and NIR images. Each 16.4&nbsp;Gb image will be compressed to 5&nbsp;Gb before transmission and released to the general public on the HiRISE website in <!--del_lnk--> JPEG 2000 format. To facilitate the mapping of potential landing sites, HiRISE can produce <!--del_lnk--> stereo pairs of images from which topography can be calculated to an accuracy of 0.25&nbsp;m.

These materials include <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a>, <!--del_lnk--> oxides, <!--del_lnk--> phyllosilicates, and <!--del_lnk--> carbonates, which have characteristic patterns in their visible-infrared energy.<p><a id="MCS" name="MCS"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">MCS</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) is a spectrometer with one visible/near infrared channel (0.3 to 3.0&nbsp;&mu;m) and eight far infrared (12 to 50&nbsp;&mu;m) channels. These channels were selected to measure temperature, pressure, water vapor and dust levels. MCS will observe the atmosphere on the horizon of Mars (as viewed from <i>MRO</i>) by breaking it up into vertical slices and taking measurements within each slice in 5&nbsp;km (3&nbsp;mi) increments. These measurements will be assembled into daily global weather maps to show the basic variables of Martian weather: temperature, pressure, humidity and dust density.<p><a id="SHARAD" name="SHARAD"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">SHARAD</span></h3>

      <p><i>MRO</i>&#39;s Shallow Subsurface Radar (SHARAD) experiment is designed to probe the internal structure of the Martian polar <!--del_lnk--> ice caps. It will also gather planet-wide information about underground layers of <a href="../../wp/i/Ice.htm" title="Ice">ice</a>, <!--del_lnk--> rock and possibly liquid water that might be accessible from the surface. SHARAD uses <!--del_lnk--> HF radio waves between 15 and 25&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> MHz, a range that allows it to resolve layers as thin as 7&nbsp;m to a maximum depth of 1&nbsp;km. It will have a horizontal resolution as high as 0.3 by 3&nbsp;km. SHARAD is designed to operate in conjunction with <i><!--del_lnk--> Mars Express</i>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> MARSIS, which has lower resolution but penetrates to a much greater depth. Both SHARAD and MARSIS were made by the <!--del_lnk--> Italian Space Agency.<p><a id="Engineering_instruments" name="Engineering_instruments"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Engineering instruments</span></h3>
      <p>In addition to its imaging equipment, <i>MRO</i> will carry a variety of engineering instruments. The Gravity Field Investigation Package will measure variations in the Martian gravitational field through variations in the spacecraft&#39;s velocity. Velocity changes are detected by measuring <!--del_lnk--> doppler shifts in <i>MRO</i>&#39;s radio signals received on Earth. The package also includes sensitive on-board accelerometers used to deduce the <i>in situ</i> atmospheric density of Mars during aerobraking.<p>The Electra is a <!--del_lnk--> UHF software defined radio designed to communicate with other spacecraft as they approach, land, and operate on Mars. In addition to protocol controlled inter-spacecraft data links of 1 kbit/s to 2 Mbit/s, Electra also provides Doppler data collection, open loop recording and a highly accurate timing service based on a 5e-13 <!--del_lnk--> USO. Doppler information for approaching vehicles can be used for final descent targeting or descent and landing trajectory recreation. Doppler informaion on landed vehicles will also enable scientists to accurately determine the surface location of Mars landers and rovers. The two <a href="../../wp/m/Mars_Exploration_Rover.htm" title="Mars Exploration Rover">MER</a> spacecraft currently on Mars utilize an earlier generation UHF relay radio providing similar functions through the Mars Odyssey orbiter. The Electra radio may use the MER spacecraft to prove its functionality but it is not scheduled to provide formal relay services until the 2008 arrival of the <a href="../../wp/p/Phoenix_%2528spacecraft%2529.htm" title="Phoenix (spacecraft)">Phoenix Mars lander</a>. Because the Electra radio is software defined down to the modem level, new modulation, coding or protocol functions can be added or updated while the MRO spacecraft is in orbit around Mars. <p>The Optical Navigation Camera images the Martian moons, <!--del_lnk--> Phobos and <!--del_lnk--> Deimos, against background stars to precisely determine <i>MRO</i>&#39;s orbit. Although moon imaging is not mission critical, it was included as a technology test for future orbiting and landing of spacecraft. The Optical Navigation Camera was tested successfully in February and March of 2006.<p><a id="Engineering_data" name="Engineering_data"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Engineering data</span></h2>

      <p><i>MRO</i> gets all of its electrical power from two <!--del_lnk--> solar panels, each of which can move independently around two axes (up-down, or left-right rotation). Each solar panel measures 5.35 &times; 2.53&nbsp;m and has 9.5&nbsp;m&sup2; (102&nbsp;ft&sup2;) covered with 3,744 individual photovoltaic cells. Its high-efficiency <!--del_lnk--> triple junction solar cells are able to convert more than 26% of the sun&#39;s energy directly into electricity and are connected together to produce a total output of 32&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> volts. At Mars, the two panels produce 2,000 <!--del_lnk--> watts of power; in contrast, the panels would generate 6,000 watts in a comparable Earth orbit by being closer to the Sun.<p><i>MRO</i> has two <!--del_lnk--> nickel metal hydride rechargeable batteries used to power the spacecraft when it is not facing the sun. Each battery has an energy storage capacity of 50&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ampere-hours (180&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> kC). The full range of the batteries cannot be used due to voltage constraints on the spacecraft, but it will allow the operators to extend the battery life&mdash;a valuable capability, given that battery drain is one of the most common causes of long-term satellite failure. Planners anticipate that only 40% of the batteries&#39; capacities will be required during the lifetime of the spacecraft.<p><a id="Electronic_systems" name="Electronic_systems"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Electronic systems</span></h3>
      <p><i>MRO</i>&lsquo;s main computer is a 133&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> MHz, 10.4 million <!--del_lnk--> transistor, 32-bit, <!--del_lnk--> RAD750 processor. This processor is a <!--del_lnk--> radiation-hardened version of a <!--del_lnk--> PowerPC 750 or <!--del_lnk--> G3 processor with a specially-built <!--del_lnk--> motherboard. The RAD750 is a successor to the <!--del_lnk--> RAD6000. This processor may seem underpowered in comparison to a modern <!--del_lnk--> PC or <a href="../../wp/m/Macintosh.htm" title="Apple Macintosh">Mac</a> processor, but it is extremely reliable, resilient, and can function in <!--del_lnk--> solar flare-ravaged deep space. The operating system software is <!--del_lnk--> VxWorks and has extensive fault protection protocols and monitoring.<p>Data is stored in a 160&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> Gb (20&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> GB) flash memory module consisting of over 700 memory chips, each with a 256&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> Mbit capacity. This memory capacity is not actually that large considering the amount of data to be acquired; for example, a single image from the HiRISE camera can be as large as 28&nbsp;Gb.<p><a id="Attitude_determination" name="Attitude_determination"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Attitude determination</span></h3>
      <p>In order to determine the spacecraft&#39;s orbit and facilitate maneuvers, sixteen sun sensors &mdash; eight primaries and eight backups &mdash; are placed around the spacecraft to calibrate solar direction relative to the orbiter&#39;s frame. Two star trackers, <!--del_lnk--> digital cameras used to map the position of catalogued <a href="../../wp/s/Star.htm" title="Star">stars</a>, provide NASA with full, three-axis knowledge of the spacecraft orientation and attitude. A primary and backup <!--del_lnk--> Miniature Inertial Measurement Unit (MIMU), provided by <!--del_lnk--> Honeywell, will measure changes to the spacecraft attitude as well as any non-gravitionally induced changes to its linear velocity. Each MIMU is a combination of three <!--del_lnk--> accelerometers and three ring-laser <!--del_lnk--> gyroscopes. These systems are all critically important to MRO, as it must be able to point its camera to a very high precision in order to take the high-quality pictures that the mission requires. It has also been specifically designed to minimize any vibrations on the spacecraft, so as to allow its instruments to take images without any distortions caused by vibrations.<p><a id="Telecommunications_system" name="Telecommunications_system"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Telecommunications system</span></h3>

      <p>The Telecom Subsystem on <i>MRO</i> is the best telecom system sent into deep space so far. It consists of a very large (3&nbsp;meter) antenna, which will be used to transmit data through the <!--del_lnk--> Deep Space Network via <!--del_lnk--> X-band frequencies at 8&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> GHz, and it will demonstrate the use of the <!--del_lnk--> Ka-band at 32&nbsp;GHz for higher data rates. Maximum transmission speed from Mars is projected to be as high as 6&nbsp;Mbit/s, a rate ten times higher than previous Mars orbiters. The spacecraft carries two 100-watt X-band <!--del_lnk--> amplifiers (one of which is a backup), one 35-watt Ka-band amplifier, and two <!--del_lnk--> transponders.<p>Two smaller low-gain antennas are also present for lower-rate communication during emergencies and special events, such as launch and Mars Orbit Insertion. These antennas do not have focusing dishes and can transmit and receive from any direction. They are an important backup system to ensure that <i>MRO</i> can always be reached, even if its main antenna is pointed away from the Earth.<p>The Ka-band subsystem is used for demonstration purposes. Due to lack of spectrum at 8.41 GHz X-band, future high-rate deep space missions will use 32 GHz Ka-band. NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) has implemented Ka-band receiving capabilities at all three of its complexes (Goldstone, Canberra and Madrid) over its 34-m beam-waveguide (BWG) antenna subnet. MRO Ka-band demonstration will demonstrate viability of Ka-band for deep space operations. During the cruise phase, spacecraft Ka-band telemetry was tracked 36 times by these antennas proving DSN Ka-band reception functionality at all the antennas. During the primary science phase, Ka-band demonstration will be assigned two passes a week for Ka-band demonstration purposes. The success of Ka-band during cruise also makes it a viable backup for the X-band subsystem on MRO.<p><a id="Propulsion_and_attitude_control" name="Propulsion_and_attitude_control"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Propulsion and attitude control</span></h3>

Fuel pressure is regulated by adding pressurized helium gas from an external tank. Seventy percent of the fuel will be used for orbital insertion.<p><i>MRO</i> has twenty rocket engine thrusters on board. Six large thrusters each produce 170&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> N (38&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> lbf) of thrust for a total of 1,020&nbsp;N (230&nbsp;lbf) meant mainly for orbital insertion. These thrusters were originally designed for the <!--del_lnk--> Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander. Six medium thrusters each produce 22&nbsp;N (5&nbsp;lbf) of thrust for trajectory correction maneuvers and <!--del_lnk--> attitude control during orbit insertion. Finally, eight small thrusters each produce 0.9&nbsp;N (0.2&nbsp;lbf) of thrust for attitude control during normal operations.<p>Four <!--del_lnk--> reaction wheels are also used for precise attitude control during activities requiring a highly stable platform, such as high-resolution imaging, in which even small motions can cause blurring of the image. Each wheel is used for one axis of motion. The fourth (skewed) wheel is a backup in case one of the other three wheels fails. Each wheel weighs 10&nbsp;kg (22&nbsp;lb) and can be spun as fast as 100&nbsp;Hz or 6,000&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> rpm.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Reconnaissance_Orbiter&quot;</div>
