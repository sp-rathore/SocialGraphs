<h2>SOS Children in Morocco</h2>
<img src="../../wp/j/Jwp_map_morocco_en.gif" width="405" height="371" alt="SOS Children Sponsorship Sites in Morocco" class="left" /><p>Morocco is in the north-western corner of Africa, on the shores of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean. In terms of population, it is one of the youngest countries in the world as approximately half the population is under 15 years old. The Atlantic coastal region is the most densely populated part of the country, where consequent housing shortages and unemployment cause enormous social problems. The illiteracy rate is high and for every 110,000 inhabitants, there is only one doctor. </p><p>The charity began working in Morocco in 1985 when the first village was established at Ait-Ourir, about 40 km from Marrakesh at the foot of the Atlas Mountains. Built in traditional Moroccan style, it has fourteen family houses. The kindergarten, as in all SOS Children's Villages, is also attended by children from the surrounding area. In Marrakesh itself, there are five SOS youth houses that are home to the older children making the transition from family life to independence, under the guidance of a youth leader. A primary school was added in 1999 specialising in children with special learning needs. </p><p>The charity opened a second community at Imzouren in 1988, between the foothills of the Rif Mountains and the Mediterranean coast, about 20 km from Al Hoceima. The ten family houses are built in local traditional style and, like Ait-Ourir, the village has a kindergarten and a primary school (again, specialising in children with special needs). </p><p>Morocco's third SOS Children's community opened in 2000. SOS Children's Village Dar Bouazza is in a suburb of Casablanca, about 15 km south of the city centre, and was built on a site donated to SOS Children by the Moroccan royal family. The village has eleven family houses and a kindergarten and there is a separate youth house in the city centre. In 2001 a social centre was built for handicapped young people, providing them with agricultural training and employment. Dar Bouazza also has a vocational training centre for SOS staff.</p><p>A fourth SOS Children&rsquo;s Village opened at El Jadida in 2006.  There are twelve family homes for orphaned and abandoned children.  A fifth village is planned to open in 2008 in Agadir.</p><h3>Local Contacts</h3>
