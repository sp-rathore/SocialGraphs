      <p><b>M&aacute;el Coluim mac Donnchada</b> (<!--del_lnk--> anglicised <b>Malcolm III</b>) (1030x1038&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 13 November <!--del_lnk--> 1093) was <!--del_lnk--> King of Scots. He was the eldest son of <!--del_lnk--> Donnchad mac Cr&iacute;n&aacute;in. While often known as <b>Malcolm Canmore</b>, the earliest <!--del_lnk--> epithet applied to him is Long-Neck. It appears that the real Malcolm Canmore was this M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s great-grandson <!--del_lnk--> Malcolm IV.<p>M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s long reign, spanning five decades, did not mark the beginning of the <!--del_lnk--> Scoto-Norman age, nor can M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s reign be seen as extending the authority of Alba&#39;s kings over the <!--del_lnk--> Scandinavian, <!--del_lnk--> Norse-Gael and <!--del_lnk--> Gaelic north and west of Scotland. The areas under the control of the Kings of Scots did not advance much beyond the limits set by <a href="../../wp/m/Malcolm_II_of_Scotland.htm" title="Malcolm II of Scotland">M&aacute;el Coluim mac Cin&aacute;eda</a> until the <a href="../../wp/1/12th_century.htm" title="12th century">12th century</a> and <a href="../../wp/1/13th_century.htm" title="13th century">13th century</a>. M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s main achievement is often thought to match that of <!--del_lnk--> Cin&aacute;ed mac Ailp&iacute;n, in continuing a line which would rule <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> for many years, although his role as &quot;founder of a dynasty&quot; has more to do with the propaganda of his youngest son <!--del_lnk--> David, and his descendants, than with any historical reality.<p>

      <p>M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s father Donnchad became king in late 1034, on the death of <a href="../../wp/m/Malcolm_II_of_Scotland.htm" title="Malcolm II of Scotland">M&aacute;el Coluim mac Cin&aacute;eda</a>, Donnchad&#39;s maternal grandfather. Donnchad&#39;s reign was not successful and he was killed by <a href="../../wp/m/Macbeth_of_Scotland.htm" title="Macbeth of Scotland">Mac Bethad mac Findl&aacute;ich</a> on <!--del_lnk--> 15 August <!--del_lnk--> 1040. Although <a href="../../wp/w/William_Shakespeare.htm" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>&#39;s <i><a href="../../wp/m/Macbeth.htm" title="Macbeth">Macbeth</a></i> presents M&aacute;el Coluim as a grown man and his father as an old one, it appears that Donnchad was still young in 1040, and M&aacute;el Coluim and his brother <!--del_lnk--> Domnall B&aacute;n were children. M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s family did attempt to overthrow Mac Bethad in 1045, but M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s grandfather <!--del_lnk--> Cr&iacute;n&aacute;n was killed in the attempt.<p><!--del_lnk--> John of Fordun&#39;s account, which is the original source of part at least of Shakespeare&#39;s version, claims that M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s mother was a niece of <!--del_lnk--> Siward, <!--del_lnk--> Earl of Northumbria, but an earlier king-list gives her the Gaelic name Suthen. Based on Fordun&#39;s account, it was assumed that M&aacute;el Coluim passed most of Mac Bethad&#39;s seventeen year reign in the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of England at the court of <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_the_Confessor.htm" title="Edward the Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a>. If M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s mother took her sons into exile, she is now thought to have gone north, to the court of <!--del_lnk--> Thorfinn Sigurdsson, <!--del_lnk--> Earl of Orkney, an enemy of Mac Bethad&#39;s family, and perhaps Donnchad&#39;s kinsman by marriage.<p>An English invasion in 1054, with Earl Siward in command, had as its goal the installation of <!--del_lnk--> M&aacute;el Coluim, &quot;son of the King of the Cumbrians (i.e. of <!--del_lnk--> Strathclyde)&quot;. This M&aacute;el Coluim, perhaps a son of <!--del_lnk--> E&oacute;gan II of Strathclyde, disappears from history after this brief mention. He has been confused with M&aacute;el Coluim mac Donnchada, but Mac Bethad was not killed by the English in 1054, but in 1057 and by the Scots.<p>M&aacute;el Coluim first appears in the historical record in 1057 when various chroniclers report the death of Mac Bethad at M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s hand, probably on <!--del_lnk--> 15 August <!--del_lnk--> 1057 at Lumphanan, between <!--del_lnk--> Aboyne and <!--del_lnk--> Banchory. Mac Bethad was succeeded by his step-son <!--del_lnk--> Lulach mac Gille Coemg&aacute;in, who was crowned at <!--del_lnk--> Scone, probably on <!--del_lnk--> 8 September <!--del_lnk--> 1057. Lulach was killed by M&aacute;el Coluim, &quot;by treachery&quot;, near <!--del_lnk--> Huntly on <!--del_lnk--> 23 April <!--del_lnk--> 1058. After this, M&aacute;el Coluim became king, perhaps being inaugurated on <!--del_lnk--> 25 April <!--del_lnk--> 1058, although only <!--del_lnk--> Marianus Scotus reports this.<p><a id="M.C3.A1el_Coluim_and_Ingibiorg" name="M.C3.A1el_Coluim_and_Ingibiorg"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">M&aacute;el Coluim and Ingibiorg</span></h2>

      <p>If <!--del_lnk--> Orderic Vitalis is to be relied upon, one of M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s earliest actions as may have been to travel south to the court of Edward the Confessor to arrange a marriage with Edward&#39;s kinswoman <!--del_lnk--> Margaret. If such an agreement was made in 1059, it was not kept, and this may explain the Scots invasion of Northumbria in 1061 when <!--del_lnk--> Lindisfarne was plundered. Equally, M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s raids in Northumbria may have been related to the disputed &quot;Kingdom of the Cumbrians&quot;, reestablished by Earl Siward in 1054, which was under M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s control by 1070.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Orkneyinga saga reports that M&aacute;el Coluim married the widow of Thorfinn Sigurdsson, <!--del_lnk--> Ingibiorg a daughter of <!--del_lnk--> Finn Arnesson. Although Ingibiorg is generally assumed to have died shortly before 1070, it is possible that she died much earlier, around 1058. The <i>Orkneyinga Saga</i> records that M&aacute;el Coluim and Ingibiorg had a son, <!--del_lnk--> Donnchad, who was later king. Some Medieval commentators, following <!--del_lnk--> William of Malmesbury, assumed that Donnchad was illegitimate, which is no more than propaganda reflecting the need of M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s descendants by Margaret to undermine the claims of Donnchad&#39;s descendants, the <!--del_lnk--> Meic Uilleim. M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s son Domnall, whose death is reported in 1085, is not mentioned by the author of the <i>Orkneyinga Saga</i>. He is assumed to have been born to Ingibiorg.<p>M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s marriage to Ingibiorg secured him peace in the north and west. The <i><!--del_lnk--> Heimskringla</i> tells that her father Finn had been an adviser to <!--del_lnk--> Harald Hardraade and, after falling out with Harald, was then made an Earl by <!--del_lnk--> Sweyn Estridsson, <!--del_lnk--> King of Denmark, which may have been another recommendation for the match. M&aacute;el Coluim enjoyed a peaceful relationship with the <!--del_lnk--> Earldom of Orkney, ruled jointly by his step-sons, the <!--del_lnk--> Thorfinnssons Paul and Erlend. The <i>Orkneyinga Saga</i> reports strife with Norway but this is probably misplaced as it names <!--del_lnk--> Magnus Barefoot, who became king of Norway only in 1093, the year of M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s death.<p><a id="M.C3.A1el_Coluim_and_Margaret" name="M.C3.A1el_Coluim_and_Margaret"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">M&aacute;el Coluim and Margaret</span></h2>
      <p>Although he had given sanctuary to Tostig Godwinsson when the Northumbrians drove him out, M&aacute;el Coluim was not directly involved in the ill-fated invasion of England by Harald Hardraade and Tostig in 1066, which ended in defeat and death at <!--del_lnk--> battle of Stamford Bridge. In 1068, he granted asylum to a group of English exiles fleeing from <!--del_lnk--> William of Normandy, among them <!--del_lnk--> Agatha, widow of Edward the Confessor&#39;s nephew <!--del_lnk--> Edward the Exile, and her children: <!--del_lnk--> Edgar &AElig;theling and his sisters Margaret and <!--del_lnk--> Cristina. They were accompanied by <!--del_lnk--> Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria. The exiles were to be disappointed if they had expected immediate assistance from the Scots.<p>In 1069 the exiles returned to England, to join a spreading revolt in the north. Even though Cospatrick and Siward&#39;s son <!--del_lnk--> Waltheof submitted by the end of the year, the arrival of a Danish army under Sweyn Estridsson ensured that William&#39;s position remained weak. M&aacute;el Coluim decided on war, and took his army south into <!--del_lnk--> Cumbria and across the <!--del_lnk--> Pennines, wasting <!--del_lnk--> Teesdale and <!--del_lnk--> Cleveland then marching north, loaded with loot, to <!--del_lnk--> Wearmouth. There M&aacute;el Coluim met Edgar and his family, who were invited to return with him, but did not. As Sweyn had by now been bought off with a large <!--del_lnk--> Danegeld, M&aacute;el Coluim took his army home. In reprisal, William sent Gospatric to raid Scotland through Cumbria. In return, the Scots fleet raided the Northumbrian coast where Gospatric&#39;s possession were concentrated. Late in the year, perhaps shipwrecked on their way to a European exile, Edgar and his family again arrived in Scotland, this time to remain. By the end of 1070, M&aacute;el Coluim had married Edgar&#39;s sister Margaret, the future <!--del_lnk--> Saint Margaret of Scotland.<p>The naming of their children represented a break with the traditional Scots Regal names such as M&aacute;el Coluim, Cin&aacute;ed and &Aacute;ed. The point of naming Margaret&#39;s sons, Edward after her father <!--del_lnk--> Edward the Exile, <!--del_lnk--> Edmund for her grandfather <!--del_lnk--> Edmund Ironside, <!--del_lnk--> Ethelred for her great-grandfather <!--del_lnk--> Ethelred the Unready and <!--del_lnk--> Edgar for her great-great-grandfather <!--del_lnk--> Edgar the Peacable was unlikely to be missed in England, where William of Normandy&#39;s grasp on power was far from secure. Whether the adoption of the classical Alexander for the future <!--del_lnk--> Alexander I of Scotland (either for <!--del_lnk--> Pope Alexander II or for <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>) and the biblical <!--del_lnk--> David for the future <!--del_lnk--> David I of Scotland represented a recognition that William of Normandy would not be easily removed, or was due to the difficulties of excessive repetition of Anglo-Saxon Royal names, (another Edmund had preceded Edgar), is not known. Margaret also gave M&aacute;el Coluim two daughters, <!--del_lnk--> Edith, who married <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_I_of_England.htm" title="Henry I of England">Henry I of England</a>, and Mary, who married <!--del_lnk--> Eustace III of Boulogne.<p>In 1072, with the <!--del_lnk--> Harrying of the North completed and his position again secure, William of Normandy came north with an army and a fleet. M&aacute;el Coluim met William at <!--del_lnk--> Abernethy and, in the words of the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon Chronicle &quot;became his man&quot; and handed over his eldest son Donnchad as a hostage and arranged peace between William and Edgar. Accepting the overlordship of the king of the English was no novelty, previous kings had done so without result. The same was true of M&aacute;el Coluim; his agreement with the English king was followed by further raids into Northumbria, which led to further trouble in the earldom and the killing of Bishop <!--del_lnk--> William Walcher at <!--del_lnk--> Gateshead. In 1080, William sent his son <!--del_lnk--> Robert Curthose north with an army while his brother <!--del_lnk--> Odo punished the Northumbrians. M&aacute;el Coluim again made peace, and this time kept it for over a decade.<p>M&aacute;el Coluim faced little recorded internal opposition, with the exception of Lulach&#39;s son <!--del_lnk--> M&aacute;el Snechtai. In an unusual entry, for the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon Chronicle contains little on Scotland, it says that in 1078:<blockquote>
       <p>Malcholom [M&aacute;el Coluim] seized the mother of M&aelig;lsl&aelig;htan [M&aacute;el Snechtai] ... and all his treasures, and his cattle; and he himself escaped with difficulty.</blockquote>
      <p>Whatever provoked this, M&aacute;el Snechtai survived until 1085.<p><a id="M.C3.A1el_Coluim_and_William_Rufus" name="M.C3.A1el_Coluim_and_William_Rufus"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">M&aacute;el Coluim and William Rufus</span></h2>
      <p>When <!--del_lnk--> William Rufus became king of England after his father&#39;s death, M&aacute;el Coluim did not intervene in the rebellions by supporters of Robert Curthose which followed. In 1091, however, William Rufus confiscated Edgar &AElig;theling&#39;s lands in England, and Edgar fled north to Scotland. In May, M&aacute;el Coluim marched south, not to raid and take slaves and plunder, but to besiege <a href="../../wp/n/Newcastle_upon_Tyne.htm" title="Newcastle upon Tyne">Newcastle</a>, built by Robert Curthose in 1080. This appears to have been an attempt to advance the frontier south from the <!--del_lnk--> River Tweed to the <!--del_lnk--> River Tees. The threat was enough to bring the English king back from <!--del_lnk--> Normandy, were he had been fighting Robert Curthose. In September, learning of William Rufus&#39;s approaching army, M&aacute;el Coluim withdrew north and the English followed. Unlike in 1072, M&aacute;el Coluim was prepared to fight, but a peace was arranged by Edgar &AElig;theling and Robert Curthose whereby M&aacute;el Coluim again acknowledged the overlordship of the English king.<p>In 1092, the peace began to break down. Based on the idea that the Scots controlled much of modern <!--del_lnk--> Cumbria, it had been supposed that William Rufus&#39;s new castle at <!--del_lnk--> Carlisle and his settlement of English peasants in the surrounds was the cause. However, it is unlikely that M&aacute;el Coluim did control Cumbria, and the dispute instead concerned the estates granted to M&aacute;el Coluim by William Rufus&#39;s father in 1072 for his maintenance when visiting England. M&aacute;el Coluim sent messengers to discuss the question and William Rufus agreed to a meeting. M&aacute;el Coluim travelled south to <!--del_lnk--> Gloucester, stopping at <!--del_lnk--> Wilton Abbey to visit his daughter Edith and sister-in-law Cristina. M&aacute;el Coluim arrived there on <!--del_lnk--> 24 August <!--del_lnk--> 1093 to find that William Rufus refused to negotiate, insisting that the dispute be judged by the English barons. This M&aacute;el Coluim refused to accept, and returned immediately to Scotland.<p>It does not appear that William Rufus intended to provoke a war, but, as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reports, war came:<blockquote>
       <p>For this reason therefore they parted with great dissatisfaction, and the King Malcolm returned to Scotland. And soon after he came home, he gathered his army, and came harrowing into England with more hostility than behoved him ...</blockquote>
      <p>M&aacute;el Coluim was accompanied by Edward, his eldest son by Margaret and probable heir-designate (or t&aacute;naiste). Even by the standards of the time, the ravaging of Northumbria by the Scots was seen as harsh. While marching north again, M&aacute;el Coluim was ambushed by <!--del_lnk--> Robert de Mowbray, Earl of Northumbria, whose lands he had devastated, near <!--del_lnk--> Alnwick on <!--del_lnk--> 13 November <!--del_lnk--> 1093. There he was killed by his god-sib Arkil Morel, steward of <!--del_lnk--> Bamburgh Castle. Edward was mortally wounded in the same fight. Margaret, we are told, died soon after receiving the news of their deaths. The Annals of Ulster say:<blockquote>
       <p>Mael Coluim son of Donnchad, over-king of Scotland, and Edward his son, were killed by the French i.e. in Inber Alda in England. His queen, Margaret, moreover, died of sorrow for him within nine days.</blockquote>
      <p>M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s body was taken to <!--del_lnk--> Tynemouth for burial. It may later have been reburied at <!--del_lnk--> Dunfermline Abbey in the reign of his son Alexander or perhaps on <!--del_lnk--> Iona.<p><a id="Depictions_in_fiction" name="Depictions_in_fiction"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Depictions in fiction</span></h2>
