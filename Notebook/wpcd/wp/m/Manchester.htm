      <p><b>Manchester</b> is a major <a href="../../wp/c/City.htm" title="City">city</a> within <!--del_lnk--> Greater Manchester in <!--del_lnk--> North West <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, historically notable for being the world&#39;s first <!--del_lnk--> industrialised city, and its subsequent central role in the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>. The city, heralded as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Capital of the <!--del_lnk--> North&quot;, is a centre of the <!--del_lnk--> arts, the <!--del_lnk--> media, <!--del_lnk--> higher education and <!--del_lnk--> commerce, and is considered by many of its citizens to be England&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> second city. <p>The <b>City of Manchester</b> is a <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan borough with <a href="../../wp/c/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="City status in the United Kingdom">City status</a>. The metropolitan borough has a population of 441,200, while the <!--del_lnk--> Greater Manchester Urban Area is home to <!--del_lnk--> 2,240,230 people, making it England&#39;s third largest conurbation after those of <!--del_lnk--> Greater London and the <!--del_lnk--> West Midlands.<p>Manchester is well known for its <a href="../../wp/s/Sport.htm" title="Sport">sporting</a> connections being associated with two major Premiership League football teams, <!--del_lnk--> Manchester City and <a href="../../wp/m/Manchester_United_F.C..htm" title="Manchester United">Manchester United</a> and for having hosted the <!--del_lnk--> XVII Commonwealth Games in 2002.<p><!--del_lnk--> Manchester city centre is on a &quot;tentative list&quot; of <!--del_lnk--> UNESCO <a href="../../wp/w/World_Heritage_Site.htm" title="World Heritage Site">World Heritage Sites</a>&mdash;mainly based around its network of canals and <!--del_lnk--> mills, which facilitated its development during the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> of the 19th century.<p>Manchester has been occasionally called <b><!--del_lnk--> Cottonopolis</b>, as during the Industrial Revolution, it was a leading international centre of <!--del_lnk--> cotton spinning. More recently the city has been referred to as &#39;<!--del_lnk--> Madchester&#39; due to the city&#39;s prominent music scene of the same name.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Greater Manchester county consists of the City of Manchester and the other metropolitan boroughs which surround it: <!--del_lnk--> Trafford, <!--del_lnk--> Tameside, <!--del_lnk--> Salford, <!--del_lnk--> Wigan, <!--del_lnk--> Bolton, <!--del_lnk--> Bury, <!--del_lnk--> Oldham, <!--del_lnk--> Rochdale and <!--del_lnk--> Stockport. The <!--del_lnk--> Manchester postal area contains parts of all ten boroughs except Stockport - <a href="../../wp/s/Salford.htm" title="Salford">Salford</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Sale form separate <!--del_lnk--> post towns within the area.<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="margin-bottom: 0.5em; float: left; margin-right: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em 1.4em 0.8em 0; background-color: transparent;">

      <p>The Manchester area was settled in or before <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman</a> times. The original fort was constructed by General <!--del_lnk--> Gnaeus Julius Agricola as a staging post between <!--del_lnk--> Chester (<i>Deva</i>) and York (<i>Eboracum</i>). This Roman settlement was named <i>Mamucium</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Celtic for &quot;<!--del_lnk--> breast-shaped hill&quot;) after the hill that it was sited on to be better defensible. The original location of the fort is now in the City of <a href="../../wp/s/Salford.htm" title="Salford">Salford</a>.<p>The fort was abandoned in the <a href="../../wp/d/Dark_Ages.htm" title="Dark Ages">Dark Ages</a>, and at some point in time the focus of settlement shifted from this spot to the confluence of the rivers <!--del_lnk--> Irwell and <!--del_lnk--> Irk.<p>In medieval times, this area included a fortified manor house. Thomas De La Warre, a manorial lord who also happened to be a priest, gave the site to the church for use as a College of Priests around 1422, and commenced the construction of the Collegiate Church. The former is now <!--del_lnk--> Chetham&#39;s School of Music, and the latter <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Cathedral.<p>Manchester became a market town in 1301 when it received its <!--del_lnk--> Charter. In this period Manchester grew heavily due to a influx of <!--del_lnk--> Flemish settlers who founded Manchester&#39;s new cotton industry and sparked the growth of the city to become <!--del_lnk--> Lancashire&#39;s major industrial centre. The <!--del_lnk--> ancient parish of Manchester covered a wider area than today&#39;s metropolitan borough (although not including its full extent), with the various townships and chapelries becoming recognised as separate <!--del_lnk--> civil parishes in 1866.<p>During the <!--del_lnk--> 19th Century Manchester grew to become to the centre of <!--del_lnk--> Lancashire&#39;s cotton industry and was dubbed &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Cottonopolis&quot;. During this period Manchester had its world famous canal system built as well as the famous Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Manchester quickly grew into the most important industrial centre in the world, and, significantly, the first industrial society. The pace of change was fast and frightening. At that time, it seemed a place in which anything could happen &mdash; new industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the so called &#39;Manchester School&#39;, promoting <!--del_lnk--> free trade and <i><!--del_lnk--> laissez-faire</i>), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe. &quot;What Manchester does today,&quot; it was said, &quot;the rest of the world does tomorrow.&quot; Also during this period Manchester saw a rise in its population as Lancastarians, the Irish, Jews and many other people immigrated to the city.<p>As well as being a centre of capitalism the city saw its fair share of rebellion by the working and non-titled classes, with the most famous being the events on St Peter&rsquo;s Field on <!--del_lnk--> 16 August <!--del_lnk--> 1819 which have become known as &#39;<!--del_lnk--> Peterloo&#39;. The first <!--del_lnk--> Trades Union Congress was held in Manchester (at the Mechanics&#39; Institute, David Street), from <!--del_lnk--> 2 to <!--del_lnk--> 6 June 1868. Manchester was the subject of <!--del_lnk--> Freidrich Engels&#39; <i><!--del_lnk--> The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844</i>, Engels himself spending much of his life in and around Manchester. Manchester was also an important cradle of the <!--del_lnk--> Labour Party and the <!--del_lnk--> Suffragette Movement.<p>Manchester&#39;s golden age was perhaps the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Many of the great public buildings (including the Town Hall) date from then. The city&#39;s cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the <!--del_lnk--> Hall&eacute; Orchestra. In 1889, when county councils were created in <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, the municipal borough became a <!--del_lnk--> county borough with even greater autonomy. During this period, the <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Ship Canal was created by the canalisation of the Rivers Irwell and Mersey for 36 miles from Salford to the Mersey estuary at the port of Liverpool. This enabled ocean going ships to sail right into the Port of Manchester Docks (technically in Salford). The docks functioned up until the 1970s, with their closure leading to a large increase in unemployment in the area.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Trafford Park in Stretford was the world&#39;s first industrial estate and still exists today, though with a significant tourist and recreational presence. Manchester suffered greatly from the inter-war depression and the underlying structural changes that began to supplant the old industries, including textile manufacture.<p>During the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Manchester was involved in heavy industrial construction &mdash; it was home to <!--del_lnk--> Avro (now <a href="../../wp/b/BAE_Systems.htm" title="BAE Systems">BAE Systems</a>) which built countless aircraft for the <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Air_Force.htm" title="Royal Air Force">RAF</a>, the most famous being the <a href="../../wp/a/Avro_Lancaster.htm" title="Avro Lancaster">Avro Lancaster</a> bomber. The city was attacked a number of times by the <a href="../../wp/l/Luftwaffe.htm" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>, particularly in the &quot;Christmas Blitz&quot; of 1941, which destroyed a large part of the historic city centre and seriously damaged the Cathedral.<p>In 1974, Manchester was split from the county of <!--del_lnk--> Lancashire, and the Metropolitan Borough of Manchester was created.<p><a id="Recent_history" name="Recent_history"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Recent history</span></h3>

      <p>At 11.20 am on Saturday <!--del_lnk--> 15 June <!--del_lnk--> 1996, the <!--del_lnk--> IRA detonated a large <!--del_lnk--> bomb in the city centre, the largest to be detonated on British soil. Whilst this bomb caused over 200 injuries, it caused no deaths, and the principal damage was to the physical infrastructure of nearby buildings. The consequent reconstruction spurred a massive regeneration of the city centre, with complexes such as <!--del_lnk--> The Printworks and the Triangle creating new city focal points for both shopping and entertainment. The regeneration took over a decade to complete. The latest and final part of the renovated <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Arndale opened in September 2006, allowing the centre to hold the title of Europe&#39;s largest city centre shopping mall. In 2002, the city successfully hosted the <!--del_lnk--> XVII Commonwealth Games, earning praise from many sources. Manchester has twice failed in its bid to host the <a href="../../wp/o/Olympic_Games.htm" title="Olympic Games">Olympic Games</a>, losing to <a href="../../wp/a/Atlanta%252C_Georgia.htm" title="Atlanta, Georgia">Atlanta</a> in 1996 and <a href="../../wp/s/Sydney.htm" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> in 2000.<p>Rapidly developing institutions attract <a href="../../wp/c/Crime.htm" title="Crime">crime</a> and disorder; see main article <!--del_lnk--> crime and policing in Manchester.<p>Since the regeneration after the 1996 IRA bomb, and aided by the <!--del_lnk--> XVII Commonwealth Games, Manchester&#39;s city centre has changed significantly. Large sections of the city dating from the 1960s have been either demolished and re-developed or modernised with the use of glass and steel; a good example of this transformation is the <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Arndale. Many old mills have been converted into apartments, helping to give the city a much more modern, upmarket look and feel. Some areas, like <!--del_lnk--> Hulme, have undergone extensive regeneration programmes and many million-pound lofthouse apartments have since been developed to cater for its growing business community. The 168 metre tall, 47-storey <!--del_lnk--> Beetham Tower, completed in 2006, provides the highest residential accommodation in the United Kingdom - the lower 23 floors form the Hilton Hotel, while the upper 24 floors are apartments. The <!--del_lnk--> Beetham Tower was originally planned to stand 171 metres in height, but this had to be changed due to local wind conditions.<p><a id="Physical_geography" name="Physical_geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Physical geography</span></h2>
      <p>Manchester lies in a bowl-shaped land area bordered to the north and east by the <!--del_lnk--> Pennine hills and to the south by the <!--del_lnk--> Cheshire Plain. The city centre is on the east bank of the <!--del_lnk--> River Irwell, near the confluence of the <!--del_lnk--> River Medlock and the <!--del_lnk--> River Irk and is relatively low-lying, being between 35 and 42 <!--del_lnk--> metres (115 to 138 <!--del_lnk--> ft) above <!--del_lnk--> sea level. The <!--del_lnk--> River Mersey flows through the south of Manchester. Much of the inner city, especially in the south, is flat, offering extensive views of the moors from the top floors of many high buildings. Manchester&#39;s geographic features were highly influential in its early development as the world&#39;s first industrial city. These features are its climate, its proximity to a <!--del_lnk--> seaport at <a href="../../wp/l/Liverpool.htm" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, the availability of water power from its rivers, and its nearby <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a> reserves.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>
      <p>Manchester has a relatively damp climate and a reputation as a rainy city. The average annual rainfall is 809&nbsp;mm, (902&nbsp;mm from some sources)meaning that its reputation is relatively undeserved. For example, this total is less than that of <a href="../../wp/p/Plymouth.htm" title="Plymouth">Plymouth</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Cardiff.htm" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> or <a href="../../wp/g/Glasgow.htm" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>. In international terms, Manchester receives substantially less rain than <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a>, which receives 1200 mm of rain in an average year, and its average annual rainfall total is comparable with that of <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a>. The precipitation is regularly light and prolonged, however, so a small volume of rain may take an hour to fall in Manchester, compared to several minutes of heavy rain experienced in Rome. Manchester also has a relatively high humidity level, which lent itself to the optimised and breakage-free textile manufacturing which took place in the city. Snowfall is rare in the city itself, being low-lying, towards the west coast and an urban landscape.<table class="wikitable">

      <p>Manchester has many office buildings, and its <!--del_lnk--> Central Business District is currently in the centre of the city, adjacent to Piccadilly, focused on Mosley Street, Deansgate, King Street and Piccadilly. However, new office space is appearing rapidly throughout the city, as its reputation as a high quality European Business Centre increases. <!--del_lnk--> Spinningfields is a large new development west of Deansgate; it will be a large, modern business centre, and home to several headquarters, squares, and cafes. The first building on the site was the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Bank of Scotland&#39;s new headquarters on Deansgate. The project is being spear-headed by <!--del_lnk--> Sir Norman Foster. Other buildings include a 110 metre tall office building, a new justice centre and new <!--del_lnk--> Crown Court, to be built over the next few years.<p>Just outside the city centre, a new business district is appearing in <!--del_lnk--> Salford Quays, regenerated ex-shipping docks similar to London&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Docklands, and is home to headquarters and <!--del_lnk--> call centres for many major companies. The announcement in June 2006 that the <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a> hopes to relocate several departments to the Quays from London is sure to further expand the area as Greater Manchester&#39;s second major <!--del_lnk--> Business District.<p><a id="Shopping" name="Shopping"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Shopping</span></h3>

King Street also has many notable buildings preserved in a conservation area. Other hubs in the centre include St Ann&#39;s Square, and <!--del_lnk--> Exchange Square.<p>Former stores, since gone, include <!--del_lnk--> Lewis&#39;s, Henry&#39;s, and Affleck and Brown. The building that housed Affleck and Brown is now known as <!--del_lnk--> Affleck&#39;s Palace. It consists of low-cost stalls for independent traders and creatives.

In the post-war period, it was a direct-grant <!--del_lnk--> grammar school, which charged no fees, but it became an independent school in 1976 after the Labour government removed funding from direct-grant grammar schools. Originally situated in the centre of the city, in a prominent position close to the Cathedral, it has since relocated to Old Hall Lane in Fallowfield, to accommodate the growing student body.

      <p>Manchester has a wide variety of buildings mainly from <!--del_lnk--> Victorian architecture through to modern. Much of the architecture in the city harks back to its former days as a global centre for the <a href="../../wp/c/Cotton.htm" title="Cotton">cotton</a> trade. Many warehouses have now been converted for other uses but the external appearance remains mostly unchanged so the city keeps much of its original character. An interesting facet of the architecture of Manchester and several other cities which underwent a construction boom during the industrial revolution is that inspiration was taken from <!--del_lnk--> Venice. Examples of this architecture can be easily found to the south and east of Albert Square and near the 92nd lock of the <!--del_lnk--> Bridgewater Canal, near Beetham Tower.<p>Manchester also has a number of <!--del_lnk--> skyscrapers. Most were built during the sixties and seventies. However, in the last few years there has been a renewed interest in building <!--del_lnk--> skyscrapers in Manchester. Numerous residential and office blocks are being built or have recently been built in the city centre. <!--del_lnk--> Beetham Tower was completed in the Autumn of 2006 and houses a Hilton hotel along with a restaurant and residential properties. It is currently the tallest building in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">UK</a> outside London. However, this status may be short lived, an even taller building is proposed behind <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Piccadilly station.<p>Other structures of interest in Manchester include:<div style="float:right;">

This winding lane, crossing Fennel Street and leading on to Todd Street (formerly Toad Lane - thought to be a corruption of T&#39;owd Lane - The Old Lane) is now an attractive and peaceful thoroughfare, bounded by gardens.<p>Whitworth Street is a broad <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a> route, stretching from <!--del_lnk--> Deansgate to London Road, running parallel to the <!--del_lnk--> Rochdale Canal for much of its route, and intersecting with Princess Street, Chepstow Street and Albion Street along the way. The street is bounded by impressive brick buildings, formerly warehouses, but now mostly residential developments.<p>Mosley Street runs roughly parallel to Portland Street, Whitworth Street and Deansgate, leading from Piccadilly Gardens to <!--del_lnk--> St Peter&#39;s Square. The street is closed to general traffic, with the <!--del_lnk--> Metrolink running trams along its route.<p>Another <!--del_lnk--> Victorian addition to the city&#39;s street pattern was Corporation Street, which cut through slums to the north of Market Street and provided a direct link from Cross Street (and the newly constructed <!--del_lnk--> Albert Square) to the routes north of the city.<p>To the south of the city centre, <!--del_lnk--> Wilmslow Road is the hub of much student life and is home to Manchester&rsquo;s <!--del_lnk--> curry mile.<p>Other notable places in Manchester include:<ul>

      <p>Manchester is very well served in terms of transport and infrastructure. The roads of Manchester are some of the most extensive in the UK and statistically <!--del_lnk--> Greater Manchester has a higher percentage of the motorway network than any other county in the country.  According to The Guinness Book of World Records, it has the most traffic lanes side by side (17), spread across several parallel carriageways. (<!--del_lnk--> M61 at Linnyshaw Moss, Greater Manchester, close to the <!--del_lnk--> M60 interchange).<p>Mancunians are often adventurous, with high sales of air tickets to international and national destinations with most travelling from <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Airport. The <a href="../../wp/l/Liverpool_and_Manchester_Railway.htm" title="Liverpool and Manchester Railway">Liverpool and Manchester Railway</a> was the first passenger railway in the world.

      <p>Manchester, like <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, has an outer <!--del_lnk--> ring road: the <!--del_lnk--> M60. Unlike London&#39;s <a href="../../wp/m/M25_motorway.htm" title="M25 motorway">M25</a> the M60 actually runs within the Greater Manchester conurbation providing good links, rather than around the conurbation as the M25 does. It has 27 junctions, numbered consecutively clockwise, starting with Junction 1 at <!--del_lnk--> Stockport in the south-east of the conurbation. The second busiest section of road in the UK after a section of the <!--del_lnk--> M25 (Junctions 13 &amp; 14 <!--del_lnk--> Heathrow) is the <!--del_lnk--> M60 north of Manchester between junctions 16 and 17.<p>The city also has an inner ring road. Part of this is the A57/<!--del_lnk--> A57(M) (also known as <i>Mancunian Way</i>), which runs south of the city centre, linking the western <!--del_lnk--> M602 (which spurs from the M60) to the eastern M60 and <!--del_lnk--> M67.<p>The other main motorways serving Manchester are the <!--del_lnk--> M56 (to the <!--del_lnk--> airport, <!--del_lnk--> Chester and the <a href="../../wp/m/M6_motorway.htm" title="M6 motorway">M6</a> southbound to <a href="../../wp/b/Birmingham.htm" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>), the <!--del_lnk--> M61 (to <!--del_lnk--> Bolton, <!--del_lnk--> Preston and the <a href="../../wp/m/M6_motorway.htm" title="M6 motorway">M6</a> northbound to <!--del_lnk--> Lancaster), the <!--del_lnk--> M62 (to <a href="../../wp/l/Liverpool.htm" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Leeds.htm" title="Leeds">Leeds</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Kingston upon Hull), the <!--del_lnk--> M66 (to <!--del_lnk--> Bury) and the M67, which was originally built as a route to <a href="../../wp/s/Sheffield.htm" title="Sheffield">Sheffield</a> but was cancelled long before completion.

      <p>Manchester holds a pivotal position in <!--del_lnk--> railway history as a birthplace of passenger rail travel on the <a href="../../wp/l/Liverpool_and_Manchester_Railway.htm" title="Liverpool and Manchester Railway">Liverpool and Manchester Railway</a>, which opened in 1830 after the famous <a href="../../wp/r/Rainhill_Trials.htm" title="Rainhill Trials">Rainhill Trials</a> chose <!--del_lnk--> Stephenson&#39;s Rocket to pull the trains. In just 50 years the city centre was encircled by stations and termini, including <!--del_lnk--> Manchester London Road Station, (now <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Piccadilly), <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Victoria, <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Central Railway Station, <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Mayfield Station and <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Exchange Station. Following the <!--del_lnk--> Beeching Report in the 1960s, cutbacks followed, with <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Central, <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Mayfield and <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Exchange closing to passengers. All rail services were then directed to <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Victoria and <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Piccadilly. High speed trains to <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> are run from Manchester Piccadilly by <!--del_lnk--> Virgin Trains, journeys typically taking around 2 hr 15 min. There are also several smaller stations remaining around the <!--del_lnk--> City Centre, including <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Oxford Road station, <!--del_lnk--> Deansgate railway station and <!--del_lnk--> Salford Central railway station.<p>Although there is no <!--del_lnk--> Underground Railway system similar to Glasgow&#39;s or London&#39;s, the city has had several failed attempts to create one including the infamous &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Picc-Vic tunnel&quot;, a heavy rail tunnel linking the main stations. Excavation work under the <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Arndale for this project began in the 1970s, but was soon abandoned due to costs and rumours of &#39;subterranean obstacles&#39;. This may well have referred to the &#39;<!--del_lnk--> Guardian&#39; underground nuclear bunker network, originally constructed by as a means of protecting communications in the city in the event of an atom bomb being deployed and now used by <!--del_lnk--> BT. Piccadilly and Victoria are now linked by the city&#39;s Metrolink tram system.<p>The urban and suburban areas are covered by a sizeable network of rail lines, including lines to <!--del_lnk--> Ashton-under-Lyne, <!--del_lnk--> Bolton, <!--del_lnk--> Oldham, <!--del_lnk--> Stockport and <!--del_lnk--> Wilmslow.<p><a id="Metrolink" name="Metrolink"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Metrolink</span></h3>

      <p>Manchester has a <!--del_lnk--> tram system called <!--del_lnk--> Metrolink. Operated by <!--del_lnk--> Serco (which also runs <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Docklands Light Railway&quot;), the Metrolink links the city centre to <!--del_lnk--> Altrincham, <!--del_lnk--> Eccles and <!--del_lnk--> Bury. It is a high-frequency service, with trams running every 6&ndash;12 minutes. It carries nearly 20 million passengers each year.<p>Proposals for a light-rail system in the city grew from a <!--del_lnk--> 1970&#39;s proposal by <!--del_lnk--> SELNEC to build three urban rapid transit lines in the <!--del_lnk--> conurbation.<p>Plans to extend <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Metrolink were reinstated after an election-time <!--del_lnk--> u-turn by the Labour Government which had previously rejected the plans months earlier, despite years of support. The Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive (<!--del_lnk--> GMPTE), responsible for public transport in the area, led the fight to ensure that the extensions are to be built, with significant support from Local Councils and Communities, as well as the main <!--del_lnk--> Manchester City Council. In July 2006 the government announced a major extension to the Metrolink system which is intended to form the first phase of the eventual so-called &#39;big bang&#39; expansion. If the eventual desired system is completed, passenger numbers are predicted to more than double to an estimated 50 million per year.<p>A widely held view of many in Manchester of one of the major failings of the Metrolink is that it has never been extended to reach the <!--del_lnk--> Trafford Centre (approx. 5 miles away in Trafford Park), with a wide possibility of routes for this task. The line from Manchester City Centre to <!--del_lnk--> Eccles Town Centre is also judged by many to be a failure as it takes longer than an equivalent <!--del_lnk--> bus journey following a similar route, but achieves this without the Metrolink&#39;s advantage of using &#39;Metrolink-only&#39; specially dedicated / constructed routes.<p>Since Metrolink&#39;s inception and the initial euphoria at the huge success, by the public / local &amp; national government / environmental groups it has become something of a victim of its own popularity. Many routes are extremely busy, especially at <!--del_lnk--> peak times, and prices have risen at a rate far above that of <!--del_lnk--> inflation.<p><a id="Buses" name="Buses"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Buses</span></h3>
      <p>Manchester and the surrounding area have an extensive bus network, with regular services in and out of the city connecting to all the satellite towns and villages. Maps of bus routes and a public transport journey planner for the Greater Manchester can be found on the <!--del_lnk--> GMPTE website.<p>Bus service in Manchester is very cheap. The cheapest bus fare for a First bus is &pound;0.40p, compared to London&#39;s 80p with an Oyster card. The city&rsquo;s buses are operated by a range of companies including <!--del_lnk--> First, <!--del_lnk--> Stagecoach (incorporating the lower-cost <!--del_lnk--> Magicbus), <!--del_lnk--> Finglands, UK North (also trading as GM Buses), <!--del_lnk--> Arriva and R. Bullock. The major routes, with high passenger volumes, are well provided-for. These include Oxford Road/<!--del_lnk--> Wilmslow Road, one of the busiest bus routes in Europe, bringing large numbers of students &amp; commuters from <!--del_lnk--> Fallowfield / <!--del_lnk--> Withington / <!--del_lnk--> Didsbury to the university buildings that have campuses scattered around the city centre, and the various office buildings, including the <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a>. Other routes that are not as commercially attractive, with smaller passenger volumes, are less well provided for, and the cost of a single journey can be similar to that of a Week Pass for the &quot;South Manchester&quot; journey.<p>First Manchester also operates free <!--del_lnk--> Metroshuttle services which link important areas of the city, such as <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Victoria, <!--del_lnk--> Piccadilly and <!--del_lnk--> Oxford Road stations with Chinatown, Deansgate, <!--del_lnk--> Salford Central, and Albert Square. These services are very successful and therefore often busy. At present, there are three routes, numbered 1, 2 and 3, and coloured orange, green and purple respectively. They run every 5-10 minutes and complement the Metrolink and National Rail services, linking them with the city&rsquo;s car parks, tourist attractions and bus termini.<p>Those arriving at <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Piccadilly Bus Station, and needing to take a <a href="../../wp/t/Train.htm" title="Train">train</a> from <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Piccadilly, can choose either a <!--del_lnk--> Metrolink or the free <!--del_lnk--> Metroshuttle. It should be noted, however, that if one sits waiting on the <!--del_lnk--> Metroshuttle for 10 minutes one could have easily walked the distance to the <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Piccadilly Railway Station, less than half a mile away.<p>High frequency <!--del_lnk--> bendy bus routes include the <!--del_lnk--> Bury-Manchester 135 service and the <!--del_lnk--> Bolton-Manchester 8 service, which operate every ten minutes.<p>Manchester&#39;s principal bus station mainly for services on the south side of the city is at <!--del_lnk--> Piccadilly Gardens, which is also served by <!--del_lnk--> Metrolink and a short walk from the city&#39;s main railway station, <!--del_lnk--> Piccadilly. Shudehill Bus/Metrolink Interchange caters for routes mainly on the north side of the city and is within walking distance of the <!--del_lnk--> Victoria station. Long-distance coaches, operated mainly by National Express, serve the Manchester Central Coach Station at Chorlton Street. This smart, modern station opened in March 2002 and replaced the old Chorlton Street coach station, on exactly the same site. The old station was notorious for crime and prostitution.<p><a id="Water" name="Water"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Water</span></h3>

      <p>One legacy of the industrial revolution is an extensive network of <a href="../../wp/c/Canal.htm" title="Canal">canals</a>: the <!--del_lnk--> Manchester, Bolton &amp; Bury Canal, <!--del_lnk--> Rochdale Canal, <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Ship Canal, which provides access to the sea, <!--del_lnk--> Bridgewater Canal, <!--del_lnk--> Ashton Canal, and the Leigh Branch of the <!--del_lnk--> Leeds &amp; Liverpool Canal. Today, most of these canals are used for recreation.<p>The Manchester area is supplied with water by numerous artificial lakes, built on the former small rivers around the city. In some cases these lakes form long chains, as in <!--del_lnk--> Longdendale. In the past, the city also had a &quot;pressurised water&quot; power supply system, a predecessor of the modern electricity network. Manchester also had Britain&#39;s first sewer network, which still exists today.

      <p>In the 19th Century, Manchester figured in novels that discussed the changes that industrialisation had brought to Britain. These included works such as:-<ul>
       <li><i>Mary Barton: A Tale of Manchester Life</i> (1848) by <!--del_lnk--> Elizabeth Gaskell, <!--del_lnk--> <li><i>The Condition of the English Working Class in 1844</i> written by <!--del_lnk--> Friedrich Engels while living and working in Manchester.</ul>
      <p><a href="../../wp/c/Charles_Dickens.htm" title="Charles Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> is reputed to have set his novel <i>Hard Times</i> in the city, and while it is partly modelled on Preston, it shows the influence of his friend Elizabeth Gaskkell <!--del_lnk--> .<p><!--del_lnk--> Anthony Burgess, the author of <i><!--del_lnk--> A Clockwork Orange</i> was born and educated in Manchester, and his memoirs <i>Little Wilson and Big God</i> provide an account of his early life in mid-century Manchester. <!--del_lnk--> Howard Jacobson, born in the <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> area of <!--del_lnk--> Prestwich, has written about post-war Manchester in <i>The Mighty Walzer</i> (1999) and <i>Kalooki Nights</i> (2006).<p>The Manchester novelist Maurice Procter was an early author of <!--del_lnk--> police procedural novels.

G. Sebald lived in Manchester when he first settled in England, and the city features prominently in his novel <i>The Emigrants.</i><p>The Mancunian <!--del_lnk--> Jeff Noon set his early novels, including <!--del_lnk--> Vurt, in a future dystopian Manchester.<p>Nicholas Blincoe set his first three novels in Manchester, including <i>Acid Casuals</i> (1995), based around the nightclub <!--del_lnk--> The Hacienda and <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Slingback (1998), focussing on the Gay Village of <!--del_lnk--> Canal Street.<p>The crime novelist <!--del_lnk--> Val McDermid lived in the city for many years and set her Lindsay Gordon series in Manchester.<p>Carcanet Press, founded as a poetry magazine, began publishing poetry collections and novels in the early 1970&#39;s under the editorship of Michael Schmidt <!--del_lnk--> .

      <p>Sport and especially football are an important part of Manchester culture.<p>Many first class sporting facilities were built for the 2002 <a href="../../wp/c/Commonwealth_Games.htm" title="Commonwealth Games">Commonwealth Games</a>, including the <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Velodrome, the <!--del_lnk--> City of Manchester Stadium, the <!--del_lnk--> National Squash Centre and the <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Aquatics Centre.<p>Manchester is a successful sporting city with many famous sporting people heralding from the city as well as from the surrounding area of <!--del_lnk--> Greater Manchester. Manchester has competed twice to host the <a href="../../wp/o/Olympic_Games.htm" title="Olympic Games">Olympic Games</a> being beaten by <a href="../../wp/a/Atlanta%252C_Georgia.htm" title="Atlanta">Atlanta</a> in 1996 and <a href="../../wp/s/Sydney.htm" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> in 2000.<p>It was announced in 2005 that various sporting arenas around the city will be used in the <!--del_lnk--> 2012 Olympics.<p><a id="Football" name="Football"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Football</span></h4>
      <p>Two major <a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Football (soccer)">football</a> clubs, <a href="../../wp/m/Manchester_United_F.C..htm" title="Manchester United F.C.">Manchester United</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Manchester City, bear the city&rsquo;s name. Manchester City&#39;s ground is at the <!--del_lnk--> City of Manchester Stadium, while Manchester United&rsquo;s <!--del_lnk--> Old Trafford ground, the largest club football ground in England, is just outside the city in the borough of <!--del_lnk--> Trafford.<p>It is commonly perceived that Manchester City have more local support than Manchester United. However, research by Manchester University a few years ago showed that United had 9,000 season ticket holders within the <!--del_lnk--> M postal area and City had 7,000. The Manchester postal district includes the (strongly United supporting) city of <a href="../../wp/s/Salford.htm" title="Salford">Salford</a> but also <!--del_lnk--> Prestwich and <!--del_lnk--> Whitefield (with one of the largest City supporters clubs) and areas such as <!--del_lnk--> Denton, where United also have strong support. This research was done before City moved to the (larger, 48,000 capacity) <!--del_lnk--> City of Manchester Stadium, and well before the expansion of United&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Old Trafford stadium which will accommodate 76,000 by summer 2006. The truth is that nobody knows for sure which team has the most local support and that the figures are probably too close to call. What is beyond doubt is that United&#39;s nationwide and international support far exceeds that of City, so City have larger local support as a proportion of their fan base.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Manchester has the UK&#39;s largest gay population outside of London, and is renowned for its <!--del_lnk--> Gay Village. Centred around the <!--del_lnk--> Canal Street area the Gay Village is home to numerous gay shops, restaurants, bars and clubs. On the last weekend in August it hosts the Manchester Pride Festival (previously known as <!--del_lnk--> Mardi Gras and Gayfest).<p>The &#39;Canal Street&#39; sign, situated at the top of the walk has also been hightened further up the lamp post on which it is situated many times, due to the fact of prankers painting over the C and S to make it &#39;Anal Treet&#39;.<p>Manchester&rsquo;s gay culture was brought to mainstream attention in 1999 by the acclaimed and controversial <!--del_lnk--> Channel 4 drama series <i><!--del_lnk--> Queer as Folk</i>, which was set in the Village. It is also the birthplace of several gay rights organisations including the <!--del_lnk--> Campaign for Homosexual Equality and the <!--del_lnk--> Queer Youth Alliance.
