      <p><b>Mount Rainier</b> is a <!--del_lnk--> composite volcano in <!--del_lnk--> Pierce County, Washington, located 54 miles (87&nbsp;km) southeast of <a href="../../wp/s/Seattle%252C_Washington.htm" title="Seattle, Washington">Seattle</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Washington, in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. It is the highest peak in the <!--del_lnk--> Cascade Range, with a <!--del_lnk--> topographical summit of 14,411 feet (4,392 m). The mountain and the surrounding area comprise <!--del_lnk--> Mount Rainier National Park. The mountain is mostly covered by <a href="../../wp/s/Snow.htm" title="Snow">snow</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/Glacier.htm" title="Glacier">glaciers</a>, but <a href="../../wp/h/Heat.htm" title="Heat">heat</a> from the <a href="../../wp/v/Volcano.htm" title="Volcano">volcano</a> keeps areas of the <!--del_lnk--> crater rim on its summit cone mostly free of snow and ice. The <!--del_lnk--> geothermal heat has also caused the formation of <!--del_lnk--> glacier caves in the twin summit craters.<p>Mount Rainier was originally known as <b>Talol</b> or <b>Tahoma</b> (not to be confused with Tacoma), from the <!--del_lnk--> Puyallup word <i>t&#x259;q<span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">&#x2B7;</span>&uacute;<span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">&#x294;</span>b&#x259;<span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">&#x294;</span></i> (&quot;mother of waters&quot;). It has a <!--del_lnk--> topographic prominence of 13,211 feet (4,026&nbsp;m), greater than that of <!--del_lnk--> K2. It can be seen prominently to the south from most of the <!--del_lnk--> Seattle Metropolitan Area. On clear days, it can also be seen from as far away as <!--del_lnk--> Portland, Oregon. Because of its scenic dominance, Seattle/Tacoma-area residents often refer to it simply as &quot;the Mountain.&quot; <!--del_lnk--> <p><!--del_lnk--> Mountain climbing on Mount Rainier is difficult. It includes climbing on the largest glaciers in the U.S. south of Alaska and most climbers require two to three days to reach the summit, with weather and conditioning being the most common reasons for failure. Climbing teams require experience in glacier travel, self-rescue, and wilderness travel. About 8,000 - 13,000 people attempt the climb each year <!--del_lnk--> , about 90% via routes from Camp Muir on the southwest flank. Most of the rest ascend <!--del_lnk--> Emmons Glacier via Camp Schurman on the northeast. About half of the attempts are successful. About two to three mountaineering deaths each year occur due to rock and ice fall, avalanche, falls, and hypothermia associated with severe weather.<p><!--del_lnk--> Hiking, <a href="../../wp/p/Photography.htm" title="Photography">photography</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> camping are very popular in the park. There are several <!--del_lnk--> hiking trails, including the <!--del_lnk--> Wonderland Trail, a 93-mile circumnavigation of the peak. Mount Rainier is also popular for <!--del_lnk--> winter sports, including <!--del_lnk--> snowshoeing and <!--del_lnk--> cross-country skiing.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Carbon, <!--del_lnk--> Puyallup, <!--del_lnk--> Nisqually, and <!--del_lnk--> Cowlitz Rivers begin at eponymous glaciers of Mount Rainier. The sources of the <!--del_lnk--> White River are Winthrop, Emmons and Fryingpan Glaciers. The White and Carbon join the Puyallup River which discharges into <!--del_lnk--> Commencement Bay at <!--del_lnk--> Tacoma, the Nisqually empties into <!--del_lnk--> Puget Sound east of <!--del_lnk--> Lacey and the Cowlitz joins the <a href="../../wp/c/Columbia_River.htm" title="Columbia River">Columbia River</a> between <!--del_lnk--> Kelso and <!--del_lnk--> Longview.<p>

      <p>Mount Rainier&#39;s earliest <!--del_lnk--> lavas are over 840,000 years old and are part of the Lily Formation (2.9 million to 840,000 years ago). The early lavas formed a &quot;proto-Rainier&quot; or an ancestral cone prior to the present-day cone. The present cone is over 500,000 years old (Sisson 1995). The volcano is highly eroded, with glaciers on its slopes, and appears to be made mostly of <!--del_lnk--> andesite. Rainier likely once stood even higher than today at 16,000 ft. (4,877 m) before a major debris <a href="../../wp/a/Avalanche.htm" title="Avalanche">avalanche</a> and the resulting Osceola Mudflow 5,000 years ago.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>In the past, Rainier has had large debris avalanches, and has also produced enormous <!--del_lnk--> lahars (<a href="../../wp/v/Volcano.htm" title="Volcano">volcanic</a> <!--del_lnk--> mudflows) due to the large amount of glacial ice present. Its lahars have reached all the way to the <!--del_lnk--> Puget Sound. Around 5,000 years ago, a large chunk of the volcano slid away and that debris avalanche helped to produce the massive Osceola Mudflow, which went all the way to the site of present-day <!--del_lnk--> Tacoma and south Seattle. This massive avalanche of rock and ice took out the top 1,600 ft. (488 m) of Rainier, bringing its height down to around 14,400 ft. (4,389 m). About 530 to 550 years ago, the Electron Mudflow occurred, although this was not as large-scale as the Osceola Mudflow.<p>After the major collapse 5,000 years ago, subsequent eruptions of lava and tephra built up the modern summit cone until about as recently as 1,000 years ago. As many as 11 <!--del_lnk--> Holocene tephra layers have been found.<p>The most recent recorded <a href="../../wp/v/Volcano.htm" title="Volcanic eruption">volcanic eruption</a> was between <!--del_lnk--> 1820 and <!--del_lnk--> 1854, but many eyewitnesses reported eruptive activity in <!--del_lnk--> 1858, <!--del_lnk--> 1870, <!--del_lnk--> 1879, <!--del_lnk--> 1882 and <!--del_lnk--> 1894 as well. As of <!--del_lnk--> 2002, there is no imminent risk of eruption, but geologists expect that the volcano will erupt again.<p>Lahars from Rainier pose the most risk to life and property, as many communities lie atop older lahar deposits. Not only is there much ice atop the volcano, the volcano is also slowly being weakened by hydrothermal activity. According to <!--del_lnk--> Geoff Clayton, a geologist with <!--del_lnk--> RH2, a repeat of the Osceola mudflow would destroy <!--del_lnk--> Enumclaw, <!--del_lnk--> Kent, <!--del_lnk--> Auburn, and most or all of <!--del_lnk--> Renton. Such a mudflow may also reach down the <!--del_lnk--> Duwamish estuary and destroy parts of downtown Seattle, and (speculatively) may cause <a href="../../wp/t/Tsunami.htm" title="Tsunami">tsunamis</a> in <!--del_lnk--> Puget Sound and <!--del_lnk--> Lake Washington.<p>Rainier is also capable of producing <!--del_lnk--> pyroclastic flows as well as lava.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Mount Rainier was first known by the <!--del_lnk--> Native Americans as Tah-ho-ma. At the time of European contact, the river valleys and other areas near the mountain were inhabited by many <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Northwest tribes who hunted and gathered berries in the forests and mountain meadows. These included the <!--del_lnk--> Nisqually, <!--del_lnk--> Cowlitz, <!--del_lnk--> Yakama, <!--del_lnk--> Puyallup, and <!--del_lnk--> Muckleshoot.<p><!--del_lnk--> Captain <!--del_lnk--> George Vancouver reached <!--del_lnk--> Puget Sound in 1792 and became the first European to see the mountain. He named it in honour of his friend, <!--del_lnk--> Rear Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Peter Rainier.<p>In 1833, Dr. <!--del_lnk--> William Tolmie explored the area looking for medicinal plants. He was followed by other explorers seeking challenge. <!--del_lnk--> Hazard Stevens and <!--del_lnk--> P.B. Van Trump received a hero&#39;s welcome in the streets of <!--del_lnk--> Olympia after their successful summit climb in 1870. <!--del_lnk--> John Muir climbed Mount Rainier in 1888, and although he enjoyed the view, he conceded that it was best appreciated from below. Muir was one of many who advocated protecting the mountain. In 1893, the area was set aside as part of the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Forest Reserve in order to protect its physical/economic resources: timber and <!--del_lnk--> watersheds.<p>Citing the need to also protect scenery and provide for public enjoyment, railroads and local businesses urged the creation of a national park in hopes of increased tourism. On <!--del_lnk--> March 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1899, President <a href="../../wp/w/William_McKinley.htm" title="William McKinley">William McKinley</a> established <!--del_lnk--> Mount Rainier National Park as America&#39;s fifth <!--del_lnk--> national park. Congress dedicated the new park &quot;for the benefit and enjoyment of the people; and...for the preservation from injury or spoliation of all timber, <a href="../../wp/m/Mineral.htm" title="Mineral">mineral</a> deposits, natural curiosities, or wonders within said park, and their retention in their natural condition.&quot;<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>In 1998, the <!--del_lnk--> United States Geological Survey began putting together the Mount Rainier Volcano Lahar Warning System to assist in the <!--del_lnk--> emergency evacuation of the <!--del_lnk--> Puyallup River valley in the event of a catastrophic debris flow. It is now run by the <!--del_lnk--> Pierce County Department of Emergency Management. <!--del_lnk--> Tacoma, at the mouth of the Puyallup, is only 37 miles (60&nbsp;km) west of Rainier, and moderately sized towns such as <!--del_lnk--> Puyallup and <!--del_lnk--> Orting are only 27 and 20 miles (44 and 32&nbsp;km) away, respectively.<p><a id="Subsidiary_peaks" name="Subsidiary_peaks"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Subsidiary peaks</span></h2>

      <p>The broad top of Mount Rainier contains three named summits. The highest is called <b>Columbia Crest</b>. The second highest summit is <b>Point Success</b>, 14,158 ft (4,315 m), at the southern edge of the summit plateau, atop the ridge known as Success Cleaver. It has a <!--del_lnk--> topographic prominence of about 138 ft (42 m), so it is not considered a separate mountain. The lowest of the three summits is <b>Liberty Cap</b>, 14,112 ft (4,301 m), at the northwestern edge, which overlooks Liberty Ridge, the Sunset Amphitheater, and the dramatic Willis Wall. Liberty Cap has a prominence of 492 ft (197 m), and so would qualify as a separate mountain under most strictly prominence-based rules. However it is not usually considered a separate mountain, due to the massive size of Mount Rainier, relative to which a 492 foot drop is not very large.<p>High on the eastern flank of Mount Rainier is a peak known as <!--del_lnk--> Little Tahoma, 11,138 ft (3,395 m), a volcanic remnant of an earlier configuration of Mount Rainier. It has a prominence of 858 ft (262 m), and it is almost never climbed in direct conjunction with Columbia Crest, so it is usually considered a separate mountain.<p><a id="Washington_state_quarter" name="Washington_state_quarter"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Washington state quarter</span></h2>
