      <p><b>Melbourne</b> (<!--del_lnk--> pronounced either <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/&#x2C8;mel.b&#x259;n/</span> or <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/&#x2C8;m&aelig;l.b&#x259;n/</span>) is the second most populous city in <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>, with a <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan area population of approximately 3.7 million (2006 estimate). Located in the country&#39;s south-east, Melbourne is the <!--del_lnk--> state capital of <!--del_lnk--> Victoria and is home to over 70% of all Victorians.<p>Founded by free-settlers in <!--del_lnk--> 1835, 47 years after the first <!--del_lnk--> European settlement of Australia, Melbourne was transformed from a small <!--del_lnk--> pastoral settlement into a growing <!--del_lnk--> metropolis by the <!--del_lnk--> Victorian gold rush in the 1850s. By 1865, &quot;Marvellous Melbourne&quot; was Australia&#39;s most populous and important city. It served as the temporary national capital from the <!--del_lnk--> Federation of Australia until the construction of <a href="../../wp/c/Canberra.htm" title="Canberra">Canberra</a> in 1927.<p>Today, Melbourne is a major centre of <!--del_lnk--> commerce, <a href="../../wp/i/Industry.htm" title="Industry">industry</a> and cultural activity. Often referred to as both the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> cultural capital of Australia&quot; and the &quot;<a href="../../wp/s/Sport.htm" title="Sport">sporting</a> capital of Australia&quot;, the city has a rich history and is home to many of Australia&#39;s major annual sporting and cultural events.<p>

      <p>The area of the <!--del_lnk--> Yarra Parks and <!--del_lnk--> Port Phillip that is now Melbourne was first settled by the British in 1835. These settlers came from <!--del_lnk--> Tasmania (then known as <!--del_lnk--> Van Diemen&#39;s Land). The area was already inhabited by the <!--del_lnk--> indigenous <!--del_lnk--> Kulin people. A transaction was negotiated for 600,000 acres of land from eight <!--del_lnk--> Wurundjeri chiefs; this was later <!--del_lnk--> annulled by the <!--del_lnk--> New South Wales government (then governing all of eastern mainland Australia), who compensated the settlers. <p>In 1836, Governor Bourke declared the city the administrative capital of the <!--del_lnk--> Port Phillip District of New South Wales, and commissioned the first plan for the <!--del_lnk--> Hoddle Grid in 1837. The settlement was named Melbourne in the same year after the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <a href="../../wp/p/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> <!--del_lnk--> William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, who resided in the village of <!--del_lnk--> Melbourne in <!--del_lnk--> Derbyshire. Melbourne was declared a city by <!--del_lnk--> Queen Victoria on 25 June 1847.<p>Victoria was established as a separate colony in 1851 with Melbourne as its capital. With the discovery of <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a> in Victoria in the 1850s, leading to the <!--del_lnk--> Victorian gold rush, Melbourne grew rapidly providing the majority of <!--del_lnk--> service industries and serving as the major port for the region. The city became a major finance centre, home to several banks and to Australia&#39;s first <!--del_lnk--> stock exchange (founded in 1861). During the <!--del_lnk--> 1880s, Melbourne was one of the largest cities in the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>. This period saw the construction of many high-rise Victorian buildings, <!--del_lnk--> Coffee Palaces, <!--del_lnk--> terrace housing, grand boulevardes and gardens throughout the city. Examples of this <!--del_lnk--> Victorian architecture still abound in Melbourne. So impressed by the &quot;Paris of the Antipodes&quot; was journalist <!--del_lnk--> George Augustus Henry Sala during his visit in 1885 that he coined the phrase &quot;Marvellous Melbourne&quot; to describe the booming city, a phrase which stuck and is used by its locals and the media to this day.<p>The brash <!--del_lnk--> boosterism which typified Melbourne during this time came to a halt in 1891 when a world <!--del_lnk--> economic depression hit the city&#39;s economy, sending the finance and property industries into chaos. The effects of the depression on the city were profound, although it did continue to grow slowly during the early <!--del_lnk--> 20th Century.<p>At the time of Australia&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Federation on <!--del_lnk--> 1 January <!--del_lnk--> 1901, Melbourne was specified as the temporary <!--del_lnk--> seat of government and remained the <!--del_lnk--> national capital until 1927, when the Federal <!--del_lnk--> parliament was moved to the <!--del_lnk--> planned city of <a href="../../wp/c/Canberra.htm" title="Canberra">Canberra</a>. The first Federal parliament was convened on <!--del_lnk--> 9 May <!--del_lnk--> 1901 in the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Exhibition Building.<p>Melbourne was the Allied Pacific Headquarters from 1942 to 1944 as General <!--del_lnk--> Douglas MacArthur established Australia as a launch base for Pacific operations. During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Melbourne industries thrived on wartime production and the city became Australia&#39;s leading manufacturing centre. After the war, Melbourne expanded rapidly, with its growth boosted by an influx of <!--del_lnk--> immigrants and the prestige of hosting the <!--del_lnk--> Olympic Games. Australia&#39;s mining boom between 1969&ndash;1970 proved beneficial to Melbourne, with the headquarters of many of the major companies (such as <!--del_lnk--> BHP) based in the city. Melbourne remained Australia&#39;s business and finance capital until the late 1970s, when it began to lose this primacy to <a href="../../wp/s/Sydney.htm" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>.<p>Melbourne experienced the worst of Victoria&#39;s economic slump between 1989 to 1992. In 1992, a newly elected Victorian government began a campaign to restore the economy with aggressive development campaign of <!--del_lnk--> public works and major events centred on Melbourne and promotion of the city as a <!--del_lnk--> tourist destination. Major projects included the <!--del_lnk--> Melbourne Museum, <!--del_lnk--> Federation Square, the <!--del_lnk--> Melbourne Exhibition and Convention Centre, <!--del_lnk--> Crown Casino and <!--del_lnk--> CityLink tollway. Other strategies included the privatisation of some of Melbourne&#39;s services including power, education and public transport.<p>Since 1997, Melbourne has maintained significant population and employment growth. There has been substantial international investment in the city&#39;s industries and <!--del_lnk--> property market, and 2006 figures from the <!--del_lnk--> Australian Bureau of Statistics show that since 2000 Melbourne has sustained the highest population and <!--del_lnk--> economic growth rate of any Australian capital city.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>Melbourne is located in the south-eastern corner of <!--del_lnk--> mainland Australia. Geologically it is built on the confluence of <!--del_lnk--> Quaternary <!--del_lnk--> lava flows to the west, <a href="../../wp/s/Silurian.htm" title="Silurian">Silurian</a> <!--del_lnk--> mudstones to the east  and <!--del_lnk--> Holocene sand accumulation to the southeast along <!--del_lnk--> Port Phillip. The city&#39;s suburbs extend along the <!--del_lnk--> Yarra Valley toward the <!--del_lnk--> Yarra and <!--del_lnk--> Dandenong Ranges to the east, down the <!--del_lnk--> Mornington Peninsula to the mouth of the bay to the south-east, along the <!--del_lnk--> Maribyrnong River and its tributaries north to the foothills of the <!--del_lnk--> Macedon Ranges, and along the flat volcanic plain country of <!--del_lnk--> Werribee towards <!--del_lnk--> Geelong to the south-west.<p>The original city (known today as the <!--del_lnk--> central business district or CBD) is laid out in the <!--del_lnk--> mile-by-half-a-mile <!--del_lnk--> Hoddle Grid, its southern edge fronting on to the Yarra.<p>Melbourne is typical of <!--del_lnk--> Australian capital cities in that it was built with the underlying notion of a &quot;quarter acre home and <a href="../../wp/g/Garden.htm" title="Garden">garden</a>&quot; for every family, often referred to locally as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Australian Dream</i>. As such, much of <!--del_lnk--> Metropolitan Melbourne is characterised by low density sprawl. The provision of an extensive <!--del_lnk--> railway and <!--del_lnk--> tram service in the earlier years of development encouraged this low density development, mostly in radial lines along the <a href="../../wp/t/Transport.htm" title="Transport">transport</a> corridors. Since the 1970s, Victorian Government planning blueprints such as <!--del_lnk--> Postcode 3000 and <!--del_lnk--> Melbourne 2030 have aimed to slow the urban sprawl.<p>Melbourne is often referred to as Australia&#39;s garden city, and the state of Victoria is known as &quot;<i>the garden state</i>&quot;. There is an abundance of manmade <!--del_lnk--> parks and gardens in Melbourne, many close to the <!--del_lnk--> CBD with a variety of common and rare plant species amid landscaped vistas, pedestrian pathways and tree lined avenues. There are also many parks in the surrounding suburbs of Melbourne, such as in the cities of <!--del_lnk--> Stonnington, <!--del_lnk--> Boroondara and <!--del_lnk--> Port Phillip, south east of the CBD.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>
      <p>Melbourne has a <!--del_lnk--> temperate climate under the <!--del_lnk--> K&ouml;ppen climate classification system.<p>Melbourne&#39;s climate is notable for its changeable weather conditions. This is due in part to the city&#39;s flat topography, its situation on <!--del_lnk--> Port Phillip Bay, and the presence of the <!--del_lnk--> Dandenongs to the east, a combination that creates weather systems that often circle the bay. The phrase <i>&quot;four seasons in a day&quot;</i> is part of <a href="../../wp/p/Popular_culture.htm" title="Popular culture">popular culture</a> and observed by many visitors to the city.<p>Melbourne is colder than most Australian capital cities in <a href="../../wp/w/Winter.htm" title="Winter">winter</a>. The coldest day on record was a maximum of 4.4 degrees <!--del_lnk--> Celsius&mdash;set on <!--del_lnk--> July 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1901. <a href="../../wp/s/Snow.htm" title="Snow">Snowfalls</a> are extremely rare in the city: The most recent occurrence of sleet in the CBD was <!--del_lnk--> July 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1986 and the recent snowfalls in the Dandenong Ranges just east of Melbourne were on <!--del_lnk--> 10 August 2005 and November 15, 2006. There has not been a major snowfall in Melbourne since 1951, when moderate cover was recorded in both the CBD and suburbs. More commonly, Melbourne experiences <!--del_lnk--> frosts and <!--del_lnk--> fog in winter. On nearby <!--del_lnk--> Mount Dandenong, snow is recorded every few winters, with falls recorded in all years since 2001 with the exception of 2003.<p>During the <a href="../../wp/s/Spring_%2528season%2529.htm" title="Spring (season)">spring</a>, Melbourne commonly enjoys extended periods of mild weather and clear skies. Melbourne is also known to have hot, dry <a href="../../wp/s/Summer.htm" title="Summer">summers</a>, with maximum temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius. The hottest temperature on record was 45.6 degrees Celsius on <!--del_lnk--> 13 January <!--del_lnk--> 1939 during a 4 day nationwide <!--del_lnk--> heat wave.<p>In 2006, Melbourne, like most of Australia, has experienced one of the worst <a href="../../wp/d/Drought.htm" title="Drought">droughts</a> on record. 2006 was among the driest years on record with virtually no rainfall in September/October, usually two of the wettest months of the year. Higher than average temperatures have been recorded.<table class="wikitable" style="margin: 0 auto 0 auto; text-align:right">

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Melbourne City Council governs the <!--del_lnk--> City of Melbourne, which takes in the CBD and a few adjoining inner suburbs. However the head of the Melbourne City Council, the <!--del_lnk--> Lord Mayor of Melbourne, is frequently treated as a representative of greater Melbourne (the entire metropolitan area), particularly when interstate or overseas. The current Lord Mayor is <!--del_lnk--> John So.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The rest of the metropolitan area is divided into <!--del_lnk--> 30 municipalities. All these are designated as cities, except for five on the city&#39;s outer fringes which have the title of Shire. The municipalities have elected councils and are responsible for a range of functions (delegated to them from the State Government of Victoria under the Local Government Act of 1989 ). These include <!--del_lnk--> planning, <a href="../../wp/w/Waste_management.htm" title="Waste management">waste management</a>, <!--del_lnk--> public space, <!--del_lnk--> child-care and preschool facilities, local festivals and cultural activities, services to the elderly, supervision of <!--del_lnk--> public health and other similar matters. Councils levy rates from their residents to pay for these services. The councils are collectively represented by the Municipal Association of Victoria (MAV).<p>Melbourne&#39;s dominance of the state of Victoria&#39;s population and economy means the <!--del_lnk--> Victorian state government is also effectively the city government of greater Melbourne. Most city-wide government activities are controlled by the state government. These include public transport, main roads, traffic control, policing, education above preschool level, and planning of major infrastructure projects. Because three quarters of Victoria&#39;s population lives in Melbourne, state governments have traditionally been reluctant to allow the development of city-wide governmental bodies, which could create a rival to the state government. For this reason the <!--del_lnk--> Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, which had become a powerful semi-autonomous authority, was abolished in 1992.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>

      <p>Melbourne is a large <!--del_lnk--> commercial and <a href="../../wp/i/Industry.htm" title="Industry">industrial</a> centre. It is home to three of Australia&#39;s largest corporations: <!--del_lnk--> Telstra, <!--del_lnk--> BHP Billiton and the <!--del_lnk--> National Australia Bank, and also to the <!--del_lnk--> Business Council of Australia, the <!--del_lnk--> Australian Council of Trade Unions and many of the companies listed on the <!--del_lnk--> Australian Stock Exchange. Many <!--del_lnk--> multinational corporations (approximately one-third of the 100 largest multinationals operating in Australia as of 2002) also have their main Australian office in Melbourne. The demand for office space means that there are many <!--del_lnk--> skyscrapers in Melbourne (although the tallest, the <!--del_lnk--> Eureka Tower (at 300m above street level) is mostly residential). The tallest <!--del_lnk--> office tower, the <!--del_lnk--> Rialto Towers (251m above street level) is also the tallest office building in the <!--del_lnk--> southern hemisphere and houses an observation deck.<p>Melbourne is home to Australia&#39;s largest <!--del_lnk--> seaport and much of Australia&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> automotive industry, which include <!--del_lnk--> Ford and <!--del_lnk--> Toyota manufacturing facilities, and the <!--del_lnk--> engine manufacturing facility of <!--del_lnk--> Holden. It is also home to many other <a href="../../wp/m/Manufacturing.htm" title="Manufacturing">manufacturing</a> industries. In mid-November 2006, Melbourne played host to the summit of <!--del_lnk--> G20 finance ministers, amid violent protests.<p>Melbourne is also a major technology hub, with a strong <!--del_lnk--> ICT industry that employs over 60,000 people (one third of Australia&#39;s ICT workforce), has a turnover of <!--del_lnk--> AUD$19.8 billion, and has export revenues of <!--del_lnk--> AUD$615 million.<p>Most recent major infrastructure projects, such as the redevelopment of <!--del_lnk--> Southern Cross Station (formerly Spencer Street Station), have been centred around the <!--del_lnk--> 2006 Commonwealth Games, which were held in the city from <!--del_lnk--> 15 March - <!--del_lnk--> 26 March <!--del_lnk--> 2006. The centrepiece of the Commonwealth Games projects was the redevelopment project for the <!--del_lnk--> Melbourne Cricket Ground, the stadium set for the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games. The project involved rebuilding the northern half of the stadium and laying a temporary athletics track at a cost of <!--del_lnk--> AUD$434 million.<p>Construction began in February 2006 of a <!--del_lnk--> AUD$1 billion 5000-seat international convention centre, Hilton Hotel and commercial precinct adjacent to the <!--del_lnk--> Melbourne Exhibition and Convention Centre to link development along the <!--del_lnk--> Yarra River with the Southbank precinct and multi-billion dollar <!--del_lnk--> Docklands redevelopment.<p><!--del_lnk--> Tourism plays an important role in Melbourne&#39;s economy, with approximately 7.6 million domestic visitors and 1.88 million international visitors in 2004.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

From 20,000 inhabitants in 1851, an additional 15,000 arrived within months of the discovery of <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a> in August 1852. In 1865, Melbourne overtook Sydney as Australia&#39;s most populous city. By 1900, Sydney and Melbourne were of the same size and in 1902 Sydney had once again assumed the title of Australia&#39;s most populous city.<table class="wikitable" style="float:left; margin-left:3px; text-size:80%; text-align:right">

Attraction of a large proportion of overseas immigrants and interstate migration from Sydney due to <i>more</i> affordable housing are two recent key factors. In recent years, <!--del_lnk--> Melton, <!--del_lnk--> Wyndham and <!--del_lnk--> Casey, part of the Melbourne statistical division, have recorded the highest growth rate of all <!--del_lnk--> local government areas in Australia.<p>Melbourne&#39;s population density declined following <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, with the private <a href="../../wp/a/Automobile.htm" title="Automobile">motor car</a> and the lure of house and land extending the suburbs, mainly to the east. After much discussion (both at general public and planning levels) in the 1980s the decline has been reversed since the recession of the early 1990s, and the city has seen increased density in the inner and western suburbs.

The University of Melbourne is also the oldest university in Victoria and the second oldest university in Australia. St. Mary&#39;s Primary School, Williamstown is the oldest school in Victoria and <!--del_lnk--> Scotch College (1851) is the oldest secondary school.<p>Melbourne&#39;s two largest and most prestigious tertiary institutions are the University of Melbourne and <!--del_lnk--> Monash University. Both are members of the <!--del_lnk--> Group of Eight. Melbourne University ranked second among Australian universities in the 2006 <!--del_lnk--> THES international rankings, after the Australian National University, it was however placed first in 2005. <i><!--del_lnk--> The Times Higher Education Supplement</i> also includes three other Melbourne-based institutions in its top 100, <!--del_lnk--> Monash University, <!--del_lnk--> La Trobe University and <!--del_lnk--> RMIT University. <!--del_lnk--> Geelong based <!--del_lnk--> Deakin University maintains two campuses in Melbourne and is the third largest university in Victoria. Other universities located in Melbourne include <!--del_lnk--> Swinburne University of Technology, <!--del_lnk--> Victoria University and the St Patrick&#39;s campus of the <!--del_lnk--> Australian Catholic University. In recent years, the number of <!--del_lnk--> international students at Melbourne&#39;s universities has risen rapidly, a result of an increasing number of places being made available to full fee paying students.<p>Although non-tertiary <!--del_lnk--> public education is free, 35% of students attend a private primary or secondary school. The most numerous <!--del_lnk--> private schools are <!--del_lnk--> Catholic, and the rest are <!--del_lnk--> Independent (see <!--del_lnk--> Public and Private Education in Australia). The most prestigious independent schools are members of the <!--del_lnk--> Associated Public Schools of Victoria (APS) or the <!--del_lnk--> Associated Grammar Schools of Victoria (AGSV). The main purpose of these two groups is sporting competition. Private schools achieve better results on average in the <!--del_lnk--> VCE (the final year certificate) than <!--del_lnk--> public schools - the exceptions to this rule are two academically selective public high schools, <!--del_lnk--> Melbourne High School and <!--del_lnk--> MacRobertson Girls High School. Because of this, private school students dominate admissions into tertiary institutions.<p>Most <!--del_lnk--> High schools in Melbourne are called &#39;Secondary Colleges&#39;, a remnant of the <!--del_lnk--> Kirner <!--del_lnk--> Labor government. There are two completely selective public schools in Melbourne (mentioned above), but all public schools may restrict entry to students living in their regional &#39;zone&#39;. As a result, some families move suburb in order that their children are eligible to attend a public school in the &#39;zone&#39;. One effect of this has been to push up property prices in suburbs with public schools perceived to be of good quality.<p><a id="Society_and_culture" name="Society_and_culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Society and culture</span></h2>

In 1959, it was made into a film directed by <!--del_lnk--> Stanley Kramer, and starring <!--del_lnk--> Gregory Peck, <!--del_lnk--> Ava Gardner and <!--del_lnk--> Anthony Perkins. The film depicted the denizens of Melbourne quietly slipping off into eternity as the last victims of a global nuclear holocaust. Filmed on location in and around Melbourne (a great novelty for Melbourne at the time), it is perhaps best remembered for a comment Ava Gardner never made, describing Melbourne as &#39;the perfect place to make a film about the end of the world&quot;. The purported quote was invented by journalist Neil Jillett. Similar filming was undertaken when a 2000 <!--del_lnk--> television movie remake was produced.<p>In recent years, many more films have been made in Melbourne. Some of the more famous include <i><!--del_lnk--> Mad Max</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Chopper</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Romper Stomper</i>, featuring a young <!--del_lnk--> Russell Crowe as a terrifying Melburnian <!--del_lnk--> racist skinhead; <!--del_lnk--> Salaam Namaste, <!--del_lnk--> Jackie Chan&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Mr. Nice Guy</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Castle</i>. Melbourne has also produced many talented film and television actors including <!--del_lnk--> Cate Blanchett, <!--del_lnk--> Guy Pearce, <!--del_lnk--> Eric Bana and is home to <!--del_lnk--> Geoffrey Rush.<p>Australian audiences saw Melbourne portrayed in the 1960s&ndash;70s <!--del_lnk--> Crawford Productions police television drama series <i><!--del_lnk--> Homicide</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Division 4</i>. Perhaps better known to a contemporary audience is the <!--del_lnk--> soap opera <i><a href="../../wp/n/Neighbours.htm" title="Neighbours">Neighbours</a></i>, set in the fictional eastern suburb of Erinsborough, which presents a microcosm of suburban Australian life. Other contemporary television shows set in Melbourne include <i><!--del_lnk--> Stingers</i> (a police drama), <i><!--del_lnk--> The Secret Life Of Us</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Kath and Kim</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Prisoner</i> (known as <i>Prisoner: Cell Block H</i> for US and UK broadcasts), <i><!--del_lnk--> Halifax FP</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> MDA</i>.<p>Singer <!--del_lnk--> Paul Kelly has written several well-known songs about aspects of the city close to the heart of many Melburnians, notably &quot;Leaps And Bounds&quot; and &quot;From St Kilda To King&#39;s Cross&quot;, while <!--del_lnk--> Skyhooks also wrote some more tongue in cheek songs about Melbourne. &quot;Balwyn Calling&quot;, &quot;Carlton (Lygon Street Limbo)&quot; and &quot;Toorak Cowboy&quot; are examples. Native band <!--del_lnk--> The Living End purportedly wrote the song &quot;West End Riot&quot; about differences between eastern and western suburbs in the city. Melbourne has produced many popular international vocalists and singers including 1900&#39;s soprano <!--del_lnk--> Dame Nellie Melba, who took her name from her native city.<p>Melbourne-born satirist <!--del_lnk--> Barry Humphries created his main character <!--del_lnk--> Dame Edna Everage as a comedic version of a suburban <!--del_lnk--> homemaker. Through her he has performed cutting odes to Melbourne mores and the <!--del_lnk--> middle class suburbs of <!--del_lnk--> Moonee Ponds and <!--del_lnk--> Highett, among others.<p><!--del_lnk--> Carols by Candlelight, first held in 1938, is a <!--del_lnk--> Christmas Eve tradition that originated in Melbourne, held annually at the <!--del_lnk--> Sidney Myer Music Bowl.<p>The Bollywood movie Salaam Namaste starring Preity Zinta and Saif Ali Khan was shot in Melbourne.<p><a id="Infrastructure" name="Infrastructure"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Infrastructure</span></h2>

      <p>Melbourne has an integrated <!--del_lnk--> public transport system known as <!--del_lnk--> Metlink. While the public transport network is of considerable size, many of Melbourne&#39;s outlying suburbs still face transport difficulties.<p>Melbourne&#39;s public transport system was largely laid out late in the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a> when trains and trams were the primary methods of travelling to the suburbs. Since this time, the extensive system has been maintained and modernised. The 1950s saw a trend towards private vehicles and freeway construction. This policy has continued with successive governments despite relentless traffic congestion. The result has been a significant drop in public transport modeshare from the 1940s level of around 25% to the current level of around 9%. Melbourne&#39;s public transport system was <!--del_lnk--> privatised in 1999.<p><!--del_lnk--> Melbourne&#39;s famous tram network is both one of the world&#39;s most extensive and the only one comprising more than a single line remaining in Australia, a distinctive feature of the city. Trams are not only a form of transport, but a tourist icon of Melbourne. Visitors are served by a free <!--del_lnk--> City Circle Tram, taking in many tourist sights and there is also a fleet of <!--del_lnk--> restaurant trams, the first of its kind in the world. There are almost 300 <!--del_lnk--> bus routes and a mostly-<!--del_lnk--> electric <a href="../../wp/t/Train.htm" title="Train">train</a> system with more than 15 lines. <!--del_lnk--> Flinders Street Station is a prominent Melbourne landmark and meeting place. From the 1920s to the 1940s it was the world&#39;s busiest passenger station. The city has rail connections with several regional cities in the state, as well as interstate rail services to <a href="../../wp/s/Sydney.htm" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Adelaide.htm" title="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, which depart from Melbourne&#39;s other major rail terminus, <!--del_lnk--> Southern Cross Station.<p>Melbourne has a high dependency on private cars for transport, with only 7.1% of trips made by public transport.  Melbourne has a total of 3.6 million private vehicles using 22,320&nbsp;km of road, and one of the higest lengths of road per capita.  Although it is claimed by the government that no home in Melbourne is more than 400 m from a bus route, many of these routes have an infrequent service and do not operate in the evenings or on Sundays. There is a major campaign that hopes to bring about government change in transport planning and the <!--del_lnk--> Public Transport Users Association, the first advocacy organisation for public transport in Australia has been active many years. Major highways feeding into the city include the <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Freeway, <!--del_lnk--> Monash Freeway and <!--del_lnk--> West Gate Freeway (which spans the spectacular <!--del_lnk--> Westgate Bridge), whilst other significant road systems include <!--del_lnk--> CityLink and the <!--del_lnk--> Western Ring Road, <!--del_lnk--> Calder Freeway, <!--del_lnk--> Tullamarine Freeway (main airport link) and the <!--del_lnk--> Hume Freeway which links Melbourne to <a href="../../wp/s/Sydney.htm" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Port of Melbourne is Australia&#39;s largest container and general cargo port and also its busiest. <!--del_lnk--> Melbourne Airport is the nation&#39;s second busiest. <!--del_lnk--> Station Pier in <!--del_lnk--> Port Phillip Bay handles <!--del_lnk--> cruise ships and the <!--del_lnk--> Spirit of Tasmania ferries which cross <!--del_lnk--> Bass Strait to <!--del_lnk--> Tasmania.<p>Melbourne has four significant airports. <!--del_lnk--> Melbourne International Airport located at Tullamarine is the city&#39;s main international and domestic (<!--del_lnk--> Qantas and <!--del_lnk--> Virgin Blue) gateway. <!--del_lnk--> Avalon Airport, located between Melbourne and <!--del_lnk--> Geelong, is the main hub of <!--del_lnk--> Jetstar, a <!--del_lnk--> low cost airline owned by <!--del_lnk--> Qantas, and is also used as a freight and maintenance facility. <!--del_lnk--> Moorabbin Airport is a significant <!--del_lnk--> general aviation airport in the city&#39;s south east. <!--del_lnk--> Essendon Airport, which was once the city&#39;s main airport before the construction of the airport at Tullamarine, handles general aviation and some cargo flights, and is the base of the <!--del_lnk--> Victoria Police air wing and <!--del_lnk--> air ambulance.<p><a id="Utilities" name="Utilities"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Utilities</span></h3>
      <p>Water storage and supply for Melbourne is managed by <!--del_lnk--> Melbourne Water, which is owned by the Victorian Government. The organisation is also responsible for management of sewerage and the major <!--del_lnk--> water catchments in the region. Water is mainly stored in the largest dam, the <!--del_lnk--> Thomspon Reservoir which is capable of holding around 60% of Melbourne&#39;s water capacity, while smaller dams such as the <!--del_lnk--> Upper Yarra Reservoir and the <!--del_lnk--> Cardinia Reservoir carry secondary supplies. Like most cities in Australia, Melbourne currently faces a water crisis, with water storages at less than 50% for most of 2006. <!--del_lnk--> Water restrictions are in place and the state government has considered <!--del_lnk--> water recycling schemes for the city.<p>The main natural gas and electricity to Melbourne are <!--del_lnk--> Origin Energy, <!--del_lnk--> AGL and <!--del_lnk--> Energy Australia. Numerous telecommunications companies operate in Melbourne providing terrestrial and mobile telecommunications services. Electricity for Melbourne is primarily sourced from the <!--del_lnk--> coal power stations of <!--del_lnk--> Latrobe City.<p><a id="Sister_cities" name="Sister_cities"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sister cities</span></h2>
