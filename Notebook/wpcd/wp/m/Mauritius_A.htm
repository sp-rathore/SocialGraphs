<h2>SOS Children in Mauritius</h2>
<img src="../../wp/m/Mauritius_Map.jpg" width="388" height="400" alt="SOS Children Sponsorship Sites in Mauritius" class="left" /><p>The island of Mauritius is in the Indian Ocean, about 800 km east of the island of Madagascar, off the coast of East Africa. A former British colony, it became independent in 1968. It is one of the most densely populated countries in the world with 585 inhabitants per square kilometre. </p><p>Even though Mauritius is a popular tourist destination, there is still much poverty and many of the child welfare facilities are inadequate. Increasing industrialisation has resulted in economic growth and higher standards of living, but there has been a corresponding increase in social problems caused by broken families and problems of alcohol and drug addiction, coupled with an increase in crime. </p><p>The charity began its work on Mauritius in 1990 when the first community was opened in Beau Bassin, about 20kms north of the capital, Port Louis, on land donated by the government. The village is in a mainly residential, middle class suburb of the town and has fifteen family-sized houses built in traditional Creole style. Two youth houses with eight apartments provide accommodation for the older children where they can take their first guided steps towards independence while completing their education or vocational training, under the guidance of a youth leader.</p><p>Like most SOS Children's Villages, Beau Bassin has a kindergarten which is also open to children in the local community, as is the village sports ground. There are several good schools in the area for the older children and medical care is available at a state health centre in Beau Bassin. </p><p>In 2003, a second village was opened at Bambous, the capital of the Black River Province, 12 miles south of the village at Beau Bassin.  There are twelve family houses, a kindergarten for 75 children and a SOS social centre that supports 250 vulnerable children and their families</p><h3>Local Contacts</h3>
