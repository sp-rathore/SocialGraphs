      <p><b>Millard Fillmore</b> (<!--del_lnk--> January 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1800 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> March 8, <!--del_lnk--> 1874) was the thirteenth <a href="../../wp/p/President_of_the_United_States.htm" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a>, serving from 1850 until 1853, and the last member of the <!--del_lnk--> Whig Party to hold that office. He succeeded from the <!--del_lnk--> Vice Presidency on the death of President <a href="../../wp/z/Zachary_Taylor.htm" title="Zachary Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a>, who died of acute <!--del_lnk--> gastroenteritis, becoming the second U.S. President to assume the office in this manner. Fillmore was never elected President in his own right; after serving out Taylor&#39;s term he was not nominated for the Presidency by the <!--del_lnk--> Whigs in the <!--del_lnk--> 1852 Presidential election, and in 1856 he again failed to win election as President as the <!--del_lnk--> Know Nothing Party candidate.<p>

      <p>Fillmore was born in poverty to Nathaniel Fillmore and Phoebe Millard Fillmore in <!--del_lnk--> Summerhill, New York as the second of nine children and the eldest son. Though a Unitarian in later life, Fillmore was descended from Scottish Presbyterians on his father&#39;s side, and English dissenters on his mother&#39;s. He was first apprenticed to a <!--del_lnk--> fuller to learn the clothmaking trade. He struggled to obtain an education under frontier conditions, attending New Hope Academy for six months. Later, Fillmore bought out his apprenticeship and moved to <!--del_lnk--> Buffalo, New York to continue his studies. He was admitted to the <!--del_lnk--> bar in 1823 and began his law practice in <!--del_lnk--> East Aurora. In 1828, he was elected to the <!--del_lnk--> New York Legislature and served from 1829 to 1831.<p><a id="Early_political_career" name="Early_political_career"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Early political career</span></h2>
      <p>Fillmore was elected as a Whig to the <!--del_lnk--> 23rd Congress (1833-1835); he was also elected, to the <!--del_lnk--> 25th, <!--del_lnk--> 26th and <!--del_lnk--> 27th Congresses (1837-1843). He declined to be a candidate for renomination in 1842. He was an unsuccessful candidate for <!--del_lnk--> governor of New York in 1844. He was <!--del_lnk--> state comptroller of New York from 1848 to 1850.<p><a id="Vice-Presidency" name="Vice-Presidency"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Vice-Presidency</span></h2>

      <p>Having worked his way up through the Whig Party in New York, Fillmore was selected as <a href="../../wp/z/Zachary_Taylor.htm" title="Zachary Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> running mate. (It was thought that the obscure, self-made candidate from <!--del_lnk--> New York would complement Taylor, a slave-holding military man from the south.)<p>Taylor and Fillmore disagreed on the <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slavery</a> issue in the new western territories taken from <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> in the <!--del_lnk--> Mexican-American War. Taylor wanted the new states to be free states, while Fillmore supported slavery in those states as a means of appeasing the South. In his own words: &quot;God knows that I detest slavery, but it is an existing evil ... and we must endure it and give it such protection as is guaranteed by the Constitution.&quot;<p>Fillmore presided over the Senate during the months of nerve-wracking debates over the <!--del_lnk--> Compromise of 1850. He made no public comment on the merits of the compromise proposals, but a few days before President Taylor&#39;s death, Fillmore suggested to the president that, should there be a tie vote on <!--del_lnk--> Henry Clay&#39;s bill, he would vote in favour of it.<br clear="all" />

      <p><a id="Policies" name="Policies"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Policies</span></h3>
      <p>Fillmore ascended to the presidency upon the sudden and unexpected death of President Taylor in July 1850. The sudden change in leadership also signaled an abrupt political shift in the administration. Taylor&#39;s cabinet resigned and President Fillmore at once appointed <!--del_lnk--> Daniel Webster to be Secretary of State, thus proclaiming his alliance with the moderate Whigs who favored the <!--del_lnk--> Compromise of 1850.<p>A bill to admit <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a> to the Union still aroused all the violent arguments for and against the extension of slavery without any progress toward settling the major issues. Clay, exhausted, left Washington to recuperate, throwing leadership upon Senator <!--del_lnk--> Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois. At this critical juncture, President Fillmore announced his support of the Compromise of 1850.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> August 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1850, he sent a message to Congress recommending that <!--del_lnk--> Texas be paid to abandon her claims to part of <!--del_lnk--> New Mexico. This helped shift a critical number of northern Whigs in Congress away from their insistence upon the <!--del_lnk--> Wilmot Proviso&mdash;the stipulation that all land gained by the Mexican War must be closed to slavery.<p>Douglas&#39;s effective strategy in Congress combined with Fillmore&#39;s pressure gave impetus to the Compromise movement. Breaking up Clay&#39;s single legislative package, Douglas presented five separate bills to the Senate:<ul>
       <li>Admit California as a free state.<li>Settle the Texas boundary and compensate the state for lost lands.<li>Grant territorial status to New Mexico.<li>Place Federal officers at the disposal of slaveholders seeking escapees&mdash;the <!--del_lnk--> Fugitive Slave Act.<li>Abolish the slave trade in the <a href="../../wp/w/Washington%252C_D.C..htm" title="Washington, D.C.">District of Columbia</a>.</ul>
      <p>Each measure obtained a majority, and, by <!--del_lnk--> September 20, President Fillmore had signed them into law. Webster wrote, &quot;I can now sleep of nights.&quot;<p>Another important legacy of Fillmore&#39;s administration was the sending of <!--del_lnk--> Commodore <!--del_lnk--> Matthew C. Perry to open <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> to Western trade, though Perry did not reach Japan until <a href="../../wp/f/Franklin_Pierce.htm" title="Franklin Pierce">Franklin Pierce</a> had replaced Fillmore as president.<p><a id="Administration_and_Cabinet" name="Administration_and_Cabinet"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Administration and Cabinet</span></h3>

      <p>Fillmore was one of the founders of the <!--del_lnk--> University of Buffalo. The school was chartered by an act of the New York State Legislature on May 11, 1846, and at first was only a medical school <!--del_lnk--> . Fillmore was the first <!--del_lnk--> Chancellor, a position he maintained while both Vice President and President. Upon completing his presidency, Fillmore returned to Buffalo, where he continued to serve as chancellor.<p>While touring <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> in 1855, Fillmore was offered an <!--del_lnk--> honorary <!--del_lnk--> Doctor of Civil Law (D.C.L.) degree by the <!--del_lnk--> University of Oxford. Fillmore turned down the honour, explaining that he had neither the &quot;literary nor scientific attainment&quot; to justify the degree.<!--del_lnk-->  He is also quoted as having explained that he &quot;lacked the benefit of a classical education&quot; and could not, therefore, understand the <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> text of the <!--del_lnk--> diploma, then joking that he believed &quot;no man should accept a degree he cannot read.&quot;<!--del_lnk--> <p>By 1856, Fillmore&#39;s Whig Party had ceased to exist, having fallen apart due to dissension over the slavery issue, and especially the <!--del_lnk--> Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. Fillmore refused to join the new <!--del_lnk--> Republican Party, where many former Whigs found refuge. Instead, Fillmore joined the anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic American Party, the political organ of the <!--del_lnk--> Know-Nothing movement. He would run in the <!--del_lnk--> <b>election of 1856</b> as their candidate, attempting to win a non-consecutive second term as President (a feat that has been accomplished only once in American politics, by <a href="../../wp/g/Grover_Cleveland.htm" title="Grover Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a>). Fillmore finished third, carrying only the state of Maryland and its eight electoral votes, but he won 21.6% of the popular vote, one of the best showings ever by a Presidential third-party candidate.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> February 10, <!--del_lnk--> 1858, he married a widow <!--del_lnk--> Mrs. Caroline Carmichael McIntosh.<p>Throughout the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a>, he opposed <a href="../../wp/a/Abraham_Lincoln.htm" title="Abraham Lincoln">President Lincoln</a> and during <!--del_lnk--> Reconstruction supported <a href="../../wp/a/Andrew_Johnson.htm" title="Andrew Johnson">President Johnson</a>.
