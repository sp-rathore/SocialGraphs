      <p>The <b>City of Manila</b> (<!--del_lnk--> Filipino: <i>Lungsod ng Maynila</i>), or simply <b>Manila</b>, is the <a href="../../wp/c/Capital.htm" title="Capital">capital</a> of the <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>. The city is located on the eastern shore of <!--del_lnk--> Manila Bay on <!--del_lnk--> Luzon, the country&#39;s largest island.<p>Manila is the hub of a thriving metropolitan area home to over 10 million people. The <!--del_lnk--> Metro Manila area also known as the National Capital Region (NCR), of which the City of Manila is a part, is a much bigger metropolis consisting of 17 cities and municipalities. This article discusses the city itself; see <!--del_lnk--> Metro Manila for the article on the metropolis.<p>Manila is the second most populous city proper in the Philippines, with more than 1.5 million inhabitants. Only nearby <!--del_lnk--> Quezon City, the country&#39;s former capital, is more populous. It is currently included in the roster of <!--del_lnk--> global cities of the world.<p>Manila got its name from <i>may nilad</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Tagalog for &quot;there is nilad,&quot; in reference to the flowering mangrove plant that grew on the marshy shores of the bay. In the 16th century, Manila (then <i>Maynilad</i>) grew from a <!--del_lnk--> Muslim <!--del_lnk--> settlement on the banks of the <!--del_lnk--> Pasig River into the seat of the <!--del_lnk--> colonial government of <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> when it controlled the Philippine Islands for over three centuries from 1565 to 1898. Beginning in 1898, the United States occupied and controlled the city and the Philippine archipelago until 1946. During World War II, much of the city was destroyed. The Metropolitan Manila region was enacted as an independent entity in 1975. Today, the city and the metropolis thrive as an important cultural and economic centre. However, overpopulation, traffic congestion, pollution, and crime challenge the city.<p>Manila has been classified as a &quot;Gamma&quot; <a href="../../wp/g/Global_city.htm" title="Global city">global city</a> by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network. <p>

      <p>Manila lies at the mouth of the <!--del_lnk--> Pasig River on the eastern shores of <!--del_lnk--> Manila Bay, which is on the western side of <!--del_lnk--> Luzon. It lies about 950 kilometers southeast of <a href="../../wp/h/Hong_Kong.htm" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> and 2,400 kilometers northeast of <a href="../../wp/s/Singapore.htm" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>. The river bisects the city in the middle. Almost all of the city sits on top of centuries of prehistoric <!--del_lnk--> alluvial deposits built by the waters of the Pasig River and on some land reclaimed from Manila Bay. The layout of the city was haphazardly planned during Spanish Era as a set of communities surrounding the original Spanish Era walled city of Manila, called <!--del_lnk--> Intramuros. Intramuros is one of the oldest walled cities in the far east. During the American Period, some semblance of city planning using the architectural designs by <!--del_lnk--> Daniel Burnham, was done on the portions of the city south of the Pasig River.<p>Manila is bordered by several municipalities and cities in <!--del_lnk--> Metro Manila: <!--del_lnk--> Navotas and <!--del_lnk--> Caloocan City to the north, <!--del_lnk--> Quezon City to the northeast, <!--del_lnk--> San Juan and <!--del_lnk--> Mandaluyong City to the east, <!--del_lnk--> Makati City to the southeast, and <!--del_lnk--> Pasay City to the south.<p><a id="City_seal" name="City_seal"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">City seal</span></h3>
      <p>The Seal of Manila depicts the words <i>Lungsod ng Maynila</i> and <i>Pilipinas</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Filipino for <i>City of Manila</i> and <i>Philippines</i>, in a circle around a shield. The circle also contains six yellow stars representing the city&#39;s six congressional districts. The shield, in the shape of pre-colonial people&#39;s shield, depicts the city&#39;s nickname <i>Pearl of the Orient</i> on top; a sea lion in the middle, in reference to the city&#39;s Spanish influences; and the waves of the <!--del_lnk--> Pasig River and <!--del_lnk--> Manila Bay in the bottom portion. The colors of the seal mirror that of the <!--del_lnk--> Flag of the Philippines.<p><a id="Districts" name="Districts"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Districts</span></h3>
      <p>The city is divided into sixteen (16) districts. Only one district was not an original town - Port Area. Seven (7) districts are located north of the Pasig River and eight (8) are in the south. San Andres Bukid was previously part of Santa Ana, Paco, and what used to Singalong, while Santa Mesa was once a part of Sampaloc.<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="" style="background-color: transparent; width: 100%">

      </table>
      <p>All of these districts, with the exception of Port Area, have their own churches, and several of these districts have achieved recognition in their own right. Intramuros being the old and original enclave of Manila is a historical site. The district of Binondo is the city&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Chinatown. Tondo is the densest in terms of population, the largest in land area and also with the highest poverty level. The districts of Ermita and Malate are well-known and popular with tourists, having many bars, restaurants, five-star hotels, and shopping malls while the districts of San Miguel and Pandacan hosts the official residence of the President of the country, Malaca&ntilde;ang Palace.<p><a id="Parks_and_open_areas" name="Parks_and_open_areas"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Parks and open areas</span></h3>
      <p>Directly south of Intramuros lies <!--del_lnk--> Rizal Park, the country&#39;s most significant park. Also known as <i>Luneta</i> (Spanish term for &quot;crescent or moon&quot;) and previously as <i>Bagumbayan</i>, the 60 hectare Rizal Park sits on the site where <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; Rizal, the country&#39;s national hero, was executed by the Spaniards on charges of subversion. A monument stands in his honour where Rizal&#39;s remains were buried. The big flagpole west of the Rizal Monument is Kilometer Zero for road distances on the island of <!--del_lnk--> Luzon and the rest of the country.<p>Other attractions in Rizal Park include the Chinese and Japanese Gardens, the Department of Tourism building, the National Museum of the Filipino People, The <!--del_lnk--> National Library of the Philippines, the Planetarium, the Orchidarium and Butterfly Pavilion, an open-air auditorium for cultural performances, a relief map of the Philippines, a fountain area, a children&#39;s lagoon, a chess plaza, a light and sound presentation, and the Quirino Grandstand.<p>Another famous open space in Manila is the <i><!--del_lnk--> Baywalk</i>. This promenade lies in front of the Manila Bay where one can experience one of the most breathtaking sunsets of the world. Coconut trees, giant kaleidoscopic lamp posts, al fresco caf&egrave;s and restaurants, and live acoustic bands dot this two-kilometer stretch of ample space beside Roxas Boulevard.<p>Aside from Rizal Park, Manila has very few other open public spaces. Rajah Sulayman Park, Manila Boardwalk, Liwasang Bonifacio, Plaza Miranda, Paco Park, Remedios Circle, Manila Zoological and Botanical Garden, Plaza Balagtas and the Malaca&ntilde;ang Garden are some of the other parks in the city. In 2005, Mayor Joselito Atienza opened the Pandacan Linear Park, a strip of land that served as a buffer zone between the oil depot and the residential-commercial properties in Pandacan and could be found along the banks of the Pasig River. In the northern most part of the city lies the three cemeteries of Loyola, Chinese, and Manila North Green Park, the largest public cemetery in Metropolitan Manila.<p><a id="People" name="People"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">People</span></h2>

There are also <!--del_lnk--> Americans, <!--del_lnk--> Arabs, <!--del_lnk--> Indonesians, <!--del_lnk--> Indians, and <!--del_lnk--> Koreans in Manila. Intermarriage between ethnic groups is not uncommon in the Philippines.<p>There are 3 distinct local ethnic groups in Manila. The natives (darker skinned), the Chinese, and the Spanish. The Chinese and Spanish groups, companies and families control most political and financial institutions.<p><a id="Population_density" name="Population_density"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Population density</span></h4>

      <p>Manila is the seat of the <!--del_lnk--> Archdiocese of Manila and the <!--del_lnk--> Primate of the Philippines. Being the seat of the Spanish colonial government in past centuries, it has been used as the base of numerous Roman Catholic missions to the Philippines. Among the religious orders that have gone to the Philippines include the <!--del_lnk--> Dominicans, the <!--del_lnk--> Jesuits, the <!--del_lnk--> Franciscans, and the <!--del_lnk--> Augustinians (which includes the <!--del_lnk--> Augustinian Recollects).<p>Intramuros is currently the seat of the <!--del_lnk--> Archdiocese of Manila, the oldest archdiocese in the country. The archdiocese&#39;s offices is located in the <!--del_lnk--> Manila Cathedral (Basilica Minore de la Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Immaculada Concepcion) in Intramuros.<p>Other notable churches and cathedrals in the city include <!--del_lnk--> Cat&eacute;dral de San Agustin in Intramuros, a <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">UN</a> <a href="../../wp/w/World_Heritage_Site.htm" title="World Heritage Site">World Heritage Site</a> is a favorite wedding place of notable people and one of two fully air-conditioned churches in the city; <!--del_lnk--> Quiapo Church, also known as the Basilica Minore del <!--del_lnk--> Nazareno Negro, site of the annual January Black Nazarene procession; <!--del_lnk--> Binondo Church, also known as Basilica Minore de <!--del_lnk--> St. Lorenzo Ruiz; <!--del_lnk--> Malate Church (<!--del_lnk--> Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Remedios); and <!--del_lnk--> San Sebastian Church or the Basilica Minore de San Sebastian, the only all-steel church in Gothic style in Asia.

      <p>Every district in the city with the exception of Port Area has its own public market, locally called the <i>pamilihang bayan</i>. Public markets are often divided into two, the dry goods section and the wet goods section. Commerce in these public markets is lively, especially in the early morning. Under the urban renewal program of the incumbent administration, some of the public markets had been refurbished and given a fresher look, like the Sta. Ana public market. It is one of the more advanced markets in the city featuring a modern 2-story building with an escalator.<p>The tropical climate in Manila plus the facilities of its world-class malls continue to attract Filipinos to the shopping malls. Modern shopping malls dot the city especially in the areas of Malate and Ermita. SM City Manila, part of the country&#39;s largest chain of malls, stands behind the Manila City Hall, while the original SM Department store still operates in Carriedo in Sta. Cruz while another called SM Centrepoint is located north east of the city in Sta. Mesa close to the Quezon City-San Juan boundary. One of the popular malls that lies at the heart of Manila is Robinson&#39;s Place Ermita. In the southern part of the city in Malate district is Harrison Plaza, one of the city&#39;s oldest shopping malls.<p>For the adventurous shoppers, you may venture beyond the hotel/shopping complex package and combine other interesting destinations for cheap buys such as in Divisoria and Quiapo districts. Bargaining is the major part of your shopping experience when you pass by on these areas, as it sells goods at rock-bottom prices. In Divisoria, there is already a shopping mall that caters to the adventurous shoppers. Tutuban Center in Divisoria gives a little comfort to the shoppers as it offers air-conditioned mall, but the price of the goods here is still very similar to the goods bought outside. In Quiapo, one unique spot is the marketplace under the bridge. It sells indigenous Filipino crafts and delicacies. Raon Centre is famous for its cheap electronic products. Though through the changing times, department stores began sprouting the Quiapo area, but still the flea market of Quiapo is still vibrant and very much popular among the average Filipinos. Photo and video enthusiasts looking for cheap equipment can proceed to R. Hidalgo street in the Quiapo district.<p><a id="Manufacturing" name="Manufacturing"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Manufacturing</span></h3>
      <p>Manila connects manufacturing facilities with design and sales departments, giving key stakeholders insight into how fluctuations in manufacturing capacity and demand impact them.

Followed by the newly repackaged Cebu Pacific Airlines that uses all A320 aircraft and promotes online booking being the truly first Budget airline in the country. Air Philippines, a subsidiary of Philippine Airlines uses the old planes of the latter for certain routes and competes with Cebu Pacific on the budget market. Some 48-seater planes used by Asian Spirit, Sea Air are some of the little airlines in the city of Manila.<p>Another alternative point of embarkation and disembarkation is the DMIA, Diosdado Macapagal International airport in Clark. As of October 2006, flights from Singapore, Hong Kong, Macau, Seoul, Kota Kinabalu, Kuala Lumpur and chartered flights from Shanghai, Taipei uses this small airport because of its cheaper landing and parking fee.

      <p>Manila began as a Muslim settlement at the mouth of the Pasig River along the shores of Manila Bay. The name came from the term <i>maynilad</i>, literally &quot;there is nilad.&quot; Nilad is a white-flowered mangrove plant that grew in abundance in the area.<p>In the mid-16th century, the area of present-day Manila was governed by three <i>rajahs</i>, or Muslim community leaders. They were <!--del_lnk--> Rajah Sulayman and <!--del_lnk--> Rajah Matanda who ruled the communities south of the Pasig, and <!--del_lnk--> Rajah Lakandula who ruled the community north of the river. Manila was then the northernmost Muslim sultanate in the islands. It held ties with the sultanates of <a href="../../wp/b/Brunei.htm" title="Brunei">Brunei</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Sulu, and <!--del_lnk--> Ternate in <!--del_lnk--> Cavite.<p><a id="Spanish_rule" name="Spanish_rule"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Spanish rule</span></h3>
      <p>In 1570, a <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spanish</a> expedition ordered by the <!--del_lnk--> conquistador <!--del_lnk--> Miguel L&oacute;pez de Legazpi demanded the conquest of Manila. His second in command, <!--del_lnk--> Mart&iacute;n de Goiti departed from <!--del_lnk--> Cebu and arrived in Manila. The Muslim <!--del_lnk--> Tagalogs welcomed the foreigners, but Goiti had other plans. The Spanish force of 300 soldiers marched through Manila and a battle was fought with the heavily armed Spaniards quickly defeating the native settlements. Legazpi and his men followed the next year and made a peace pact with the three rajahs and organized a city council consisting of two mayors, 12 councilors, and a secretary. A walled city known as <!--del_lnk--> Intramuros, at the southern banks of <!--del_lnk--> Pasig River was built to protect the Spanish colonizers. On <!--del_lnk--> June 10, <!--del_lnk--> 1574, <a href="../../wp/p/Philip_II_of_Spain.htm" title="Philip II of Spain">King Philip II</a> of Spain gave Manila the title of <i>Insigne y Siempre Leal Ciudad</i> (&quot;Distinguished and Ever Loyal City&quot;).<p>In 1595, Manila was proclaimed as the capital of the Philippine Islands and became a centre of trans-Pacific trade for more than three centuries. For example, the famous <!--del_lnk--> Manila galleons sailed between Manila and the port of <!--del_lnk--> Acapulco in today&#39;s <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. These Manila galleons carried silver and other precious metals from the <!--del_lnk--> New World to Manila to purchase goods and raw materials from throughout Asia &mdash; for example, spices transshipped from the <!--del_lnk--> Spice Islands to the south, and <!--del_lnk--> porcelain, <a href="../../wp/i/Ivory.htm" title="Ivory">ivory</a>, <!--del_lnk--> lacquerware and processed <!--del_lnk--> silk cloth from China and Southeast Asia. Some of these Asian goods were used in Mexico, however, most of the cargo was transhipped across Mexico for delivery to Spain, to be sold in European markets.<p><a id="British_occupation" name="British_occupation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">British occupation</span></h3>
      <p>There was a brief British occupation of Manila from 1762-1764 as a result of the <!--del_lnk--> Seven Years&#39; War, which was fought between <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>. Spain became a British enemy when it sided with France due to ties between their royal families. The British Occupation was confined to Manila and <!--del_lnk--> Cavite while <!--del_lnk--> Sim&oacute;n de Anda y Salazar, acting as a <i>de facto</i> Spanish governor general, kept the countryside for Spain with the help of Filipino soldiers. The Indian soldiers known as <!--del_lnk--> Sepoys, who came with the British, deserted in droves and settled in <!--del_lnk--> Cainta, Rizal, and explains the uniquely Indian features of generations of Cainta residents. French mercenaries who came with the British also settled in various locations around Manila.<p><a id="U.S._occupation" name="U.S._occupation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">U.S. occupation</span></h3>
      <p>U.S. Troops invaded Manila in 1898 and waged war with the Spaniards and Filipinos in the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish-American War and the <!--del_lnk--> Philippine-American War. Following the defeat of Spain, U.S. forces took control of the city and the islands. In the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Paris in 1898, Spain handed over the Philippines to the United States of America for <!--del_lnk--> US$ 20,000,000 and ending 377 years of Spanish rule in the islands.<p>The headquarters for <!--del_lnk--> USAFFE were located here as were the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. 31st Infantry Regiment and the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. 808th Military Police Company. The headquarters and bulk of the <!--del_lnk--> Philippine Division was located just to the south, at <!--del_lnk--> Fort William McKinley. The headquarters for the <!--del_lnk--> Far East Air Force was on the outskirts of town, at <!--del_lnk--> Nielson Field. Nearby, at <!--del_lnk--> Nichols Field was the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. 20th Air Base Group. A battalion of the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. 12th Quartermaster Regiment was located in the port area and training was conducted there for quartermasters of the <!--del_lnk--> Philippine Army.<p>There were 6 <!--del_lnk--> airfields, for the <!--del_lnk--> Far East Air Force, within 130 km of Manila, notably <!--del_lnk--> Clark, <!--del_lnk--> Nichols, and <!--del_lnk--> Nielson fields. All U.S. military and airforce bases was closed down in 1992.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>American combat units were ordered to withdraw from the city and all military installations removed on <!--del_lnk--> December 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1941, Manila was declared an open city by President <!--del_lnk--> Manuel L. Quezon, to spare the city from death and destruction. Quezon issued a decree enlarging the safe zone to include outlying areas of Manila as safe zones, establishing the new administrative jurisdiction called Greater Manila.<p>The post of mayor of Greater Manila was given to Quezon&#39;s former Executive Secretary, <!--del_lnk--> Jorge B. Vargas. On the evening of New Year&#39;s Day of 1942, a Japanese courier delivered notice to Vargas that Japanese forces already bivouacked at Para&ntilde;aque would enter Greater Manila the following day. From 9AM to 10AM of January 2, <!--del_lnk--> Japanese imperial forces marched into the City of Manila.<p>Vargas was tasked to hand over to the new authorities Greater Manila and present the remaining Filipino leaders to Japanese authorities. Vargas and the Filipino leaders present were asked to choose three options; (1) a purely Japanese military administration, (2) a dictatorial government run by a Filipino under <!--del_lnk--> Gen. Artemio Ricarte who went on self-exile to Japan after the Filipino-American war, or (3) a government by commission selected by Filipinos. Vargas and the local leaders chose the third option and established the <!--del_lnk--> Philippine Executive Commission to manage initially Greater Manila, and was later expanded to cover the whole Philippines.<p>Vargas assumed the position, chairman of the Philippine Executive Commission and appointed to the post of Mayor of Greater Manila in 1942, <!--del_lnk--> Leon G. Guinto Sr., a Secretary of Labor under the <!--del_lnk--> Philippine Commonwealth administration of President Manuel L. Quezon. Guinto held the position of Mayor of Greater Manila until the liberation of the city.<p>Under Guinto&#39;s war-time administration, the City of Manila that was expanded to Greater Manila included districts such as; <i>&quot;Bagumbayan&quot;</i> means New Town (South of Manila), <i>&quot;Bagumpanahon&quot;</i> means New Era (Sampaloc, Quiapo, San Miguel and Santa Cruz), <i>&quot;Bagumbuhay&quot;</i> means New Life (Tondo), <i>&quot;Bagong Diwa&quot;</i> means New Order (Binondo &amp; San Nicholas), the then newly established <!--del_lnk--> Quezon City was collapsed and divided into two districts, while the municipalities of <!--del_lnk--> Caloocan, <!--del_lnk--> Las Pi&ntilde;as, <!--del_lnk--> Malabon, <!--del_lnk--> Makati, <!--del_lnk--> Mandaluyong, <!--del_lnk--> Navotas, <!--del_lnk--> Para&ntilde;aque, <!--del_lnk--> Pasay, and <!--del_lnk--> San Juan became districts of Manila.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> February 5, <!--del_lnk--> 1944 American General <!--del_lnk--> Douglas MacArthur fulfilled a promise to return to the Philippines (see <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Leyte). From <!--del_lnk--> February 3 to <!--del_lnk--> March 3, after the climactic battle at Intramuros ended, the thoroughly devastated city of Manila was officially <!--del_lnk--> liberated. Allied troops did not reach the city in time to prevent the <!--del_lnk--> Manila Massacre though. Ironically, the <!--del_lnk--> carpet bombing and relentless shelling by the Americans killed many more than the fleeing Japanese.<p><a id="Manila_and_security" name="Manila_and_security"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Manila and security</span></h3>
      <p>Manila has been subject to militant attacks. The metropolis have been targeted twice by groups <!--del_lnk--> Moro Islamic Liberation Front and <!--del_lnk--> Abu Sayyaf. In addition, <!--del_lnk--> Al-Qaida cells have been discovered in the metropolis.<p><!--del_lnk--> Project Bojinka, which was a large-scale attack being planned in late 1994 and early 1995, was being planned in Manila. The project was abandoned after the night of <!--del_lnk--> January 6, 1995 and the morning of <!--del_lnk--> January 7, when an apartment fire led investigators to a laptop computer containing the plans.<p><a id="Sister_cities" name="Sister_cities"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sister cities</span></h2>
