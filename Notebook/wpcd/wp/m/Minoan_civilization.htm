      <p>The <b>Minoans</b> (<!--del_lnk--> Greek: &Mu;&iota;&nu;&omega;&#x3AF;&tau;&epsilon;&sigmaf;) were a civilization in <!--del_lnk--> Crete in the <!--del_lnk--> Aegean Sea. Ceramic items created during the Neolithic period in Crete date to <!--del_lnk--> 7000 BC and the height of the Minoan culture flourished from approximately <!--del_lnk--> 2700 to <!--del_lnk--> 1450 BC when their culture was superseded by the <!--del_lnk--> Mycenaean culture. The Minoans were one of the civilizations that flourished in and around the Mediterranean during the Bronze Age of Greece. These civilizations had much contact with each other, sometimes making it difficult to judge the extent to which the Minoans influenced, or were influenced by, their neighbors. Based on depictions in Minoan art, Minoan culture is often characterized as a <!--del_lnk--> matrilineal society centered on <!--del_lnk--> goddess worship.<p>The term &quot;Minoan&quot; was coined by the British <!--del_lnk--> archaeologist Sir <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Evans after the mythic &quot;king&quot; <!--del_lnk--> Minos associated with the <!--del_lnk--> labyrinth, which Evans identified as the site at <!--del_lnk--> Knossos. It is not known whether &quot;Minos&quot; was a personal name or a title. What the Minoans called themselves is unknown, although the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">Egyptian</a> place name &quot;Keftiu&quot; (*<i>kaft&#x101;w</i>) and the <!--del_lnk--> Semitic &quot;Kaftor&quot; or &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Caphtor&quot; and &quot;Kaptara&quot; in the <!--del_lnk--> Mari archives apparently refers to the island of Crete.<p>Much later, the <a href="../../wp/o/Odyssey.htm" title="Odyssey">Odyssey</a> calls the non-Greek speaking natives of Crete <!--del_lnk--> Eteocretans meaning, &#39;true Cretans&#39;.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p>Rather than give calendar dates for the Minoan period, archaeologists use two systems of <!--del_lnk--> relative chronology. The first, created by Evans and modified by later archaeologists, is based on <a href="../../wp/p/Pottery.htm" title="Pottery">pottery</a> styles. It divides the Minoan period into three main eras&mdash;Early Minoan (EM), Middle Minoan (MM), and Late Minoan (LM). These eras are further subdivided, e.g. Early Minoan I, II, III (EMI, EMII, EMIII). Another dating system, proposed by the Greek archaeologist Nicolas Platon, is based on the development of the architectural complexes known as &quot;palaces&quot; at <!--del_lnk--> Knossos, <!--del_lnk--> Phaistos, <!--del_lnk--> Malia, and <!--del_lnk--> Kato Zakros, and divides the Minoan period into Prepalatial, Protopalatial, Neopalatial, and Post-palatial periods. The relationship among these systems is given in the accompanying table, with approximate calendar dates drawn from Warren and Hankey (1989).<p>All calendar dates given in this article are approximate, and the subject of ongoing debate.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Thera eruption occurred during a mature phase of the LM IA period. The calendar date of the volcanic eruption is extremely controversial; see the article on <!--del_lnk--> Thera eruption for discussion. It often is identified as a catastrophic natural event for the culture, leading to its rapid collapse, perhaps being related mythically as <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantis.htm" title="Atlantis">Atlantis</a> by Classical Greeks.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h3>

      <p>The oldest signs of inhabitants on Crete are ceramic <!--del_lnk--> Neolithic remains that date to approximately <!--del_lnk--> 7000 BC. See <!--del_lnk--> History of Crete for details.<p>The beginning of its Bronze Age, around <!--del_lnk--> 2600 BC, was a period of great unrest in Crete, and also marks the beginning of Crete as an important centre of <a href="../../wp/c/Civilization.htm" title="Civilization">civilization</a>.<p>At the end of the MMII period (1700 BC) there was a large disturbance in Crete, probably an earthquake, or possibly an invasion from <!--del_lnk--> Anatolia. The Palaces at Knossos, Phaistos, Malia, and Kato Zakros were destroyed. But with the start of the Neopalatial period, population increased again, the palaces were rebuilt on a larger scale and new settlements were built all over the island. This period (the seventeenth and sixteenth centuries BC, MM III / Neopalatial) represents the apex of the Minoan civilization. The <!--del_lnk--> Thera eruption occurred during LMIA (and LHI).<p>On the Greek mainland, LHIIB began during LMIB, showing independence from Minoan influence. At the end of the LMIB period, the Minoan palace culture failed catastrophically. All palaces were destroyed, and only Knossos was immediately restored - although other palaces sprang up later in LMIIIA (like <!--del_lnk--> Chania).<p>LMIB ware has been found in Egypt under the reigns of <a href="../../wp/h/Hatshepsut.htm" title="Hatshepsut">Hatshepsut</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Tuthmosis III. Either the LMIB/LMII catastrophe occurred after this time, or else it was so bad that the Egyptians then had to import LHIIB instead.<p>A short time after the LMIB/LMII catastrophe, around <!--del_lnk--> 1420 BC, the island was conquered by the <!--del_lnk--> Mycenaeans, who adapted <!--del_lnk--> Linear A Minoan script as <!--del_lnk--> Linear B for their <!--del_lnk--> Mycenaean language, a form of <!--del_lnk--> Greek. The first such archive anywhere is in the LMII-era &quot;Room of the Chariot Tablets&quot;. Later Cretan archives date to LMIIIA (contemporary with LHIIIA) but no later than that.<p>During LMIIIA:1, <!--del_lnk--> Amenhotep III at Kom el-Hatan took note of <i>k-f-t-w</i> (Kaftor) as one of the &quot;Secret Lands of the North of Asia&quot;. Also mentioned are Cretan cities such as <i>i-&#39;m-n-y-s3</i>/<i>i-m-ni-s3</i> (Amnisos), <i>b3-y-s3-?-y</i> (Phaistos), <i>k3-t-w-n3-y</i> (Kydonia) and <i>k3-in-yw-s</i> (Knossos) and some <!--del_lnk--> toponyms reconstructed as Cyclades and Greek. If the values of these Egyptian names are accurate, then this <!--del_lnk--> pharaoh did not privilege LMIII Knossos above the other states in the region.<p>After about a century of partial recovery, most Cretan cities and palaces went into decline in the thirteenth century BC (LHIIIB; we should not speak of an independent &quot;LMIIIB&quot;).<p>Knossos remained an administrative centre until <!--del_lnk--> 1200 BC; the last of the Minoan sites was the defensive mountain site of <!--del_lnk--> Karfi.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

The island was probably divided into four political units, the north being governed from Knossos, the south from <!--del_lnk--> Phaistos, the central eastern part from <!--del_lnk--> Malia, and the eastern tip from <!--del_lnk--> Kato Zakros.

      <p>The Minoans were primarily a <!--del_lnk--> mercantile people engaged in overseas trade. Their culture, from ca 1700 BC onward, shows a high degree of organization.<p>Many historians and archaeologists believe that the Minoans were involved in the Bronze Age&#39;s important <a href="../../wp/t/Tin.htm" title="Tin">tin</a> trade: tin, alloyed with copper apparently from <a href="../../wp/c/Cyprus.htm" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, was used to make <!--del_lnk--> bronze. The decline of Minoan civilization and the decline in use of bronze tools in favour of superior iron ones seem to be correlated.<p>The Minoan trade in <a href="../../wp/s/Saffron.htm" title="Saffron">saffron</a>, which originated in the Aegean basin as a natural chromosome mutation, has left fewer material remains: a fresco of saffron-gatherers at <a href="../../wp/s/Santorini.htm" title="Santorini">Santorini</a> is well-known. This inherited trade pre-dated Minoan civilization: a sense of its rewards may be gained by comparing its value to <!--del_lnk--> frankincense, or later, to <a href="../../wp/b/Black_pepper.htm" title="Black pepper">pepper</a>. Archaeologists tend to emphasize the more durable items of trade: ceramics, copper, and tin, and dramatic luxury finds of <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Silver.htm" title="Silver">silver</a>.<p>Objects of Minoan manufacture suggest there was a network of trade with mainland <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greece</a> (notably <!--del_lnk--> Mycenae), <a href="../../wp/c/Cyprus.htm" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Anatolia, <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Mesopotamia.htm" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, and westward as far as the coast of <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Minoan men wore <!--del_lnk--> loincloths and <!--del_lnk--> kilts.

Women also had the option of wearing a strapless fitted <!--del_lnk--> bodice, the first fitted garments known in history. The patterns on <!--del_lnk--> clothes emphasized <a href="../../wp/s/Symmetry.htm" title="Symmetry">symmetrical</a> geometric designs.<p>The statues of <!--del_lnk--> priestesses in Minoan culture and frescoes showing men and women participating in the same sports such as bull-leaping, lead some archaeologists to believe that men and women held equal social status. Inheritance is thought to have been matrilineal. Minoan religion was goddess worship and women are represented as those officiating at religious ceremonies. The frescos include many depictions of people, with the genders distinguished by colour: the men&#39;s skin is reddish-brown, the women&#39;s white.<p><a id="Language_and_writing" name="Language_and_writing"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Language and writing</span></h3>

      <p>Knowledge of the spoken and written language of the Minoans is scant, despite the number of records found. Sometimes the Minoan language is referred to as <!--del_lnk--> Eteocretan, but this presents confusion between the language written in <!--del_lnk--> Linear A scripts and the language written in a <!--del_lnk--> Euboean-derived alphabet only after the <!--del_lnk--> Greek Dark Ages. While Eteocretan language is suspected to be a descendant of Minoan, there is no substantial evidence for this. It also is unknown whether the language written in <!--del_lnk--> Cretan hieroglyphs is Minoan. It is undeciphered and its phonetic values are unknown.<p>Approximately 3,000 tablets bearing writing have been discovered so far, many apparently being inventories of goods or resources and others inscriptions on religious objects associated with <!--del_lnk--> cult. Because most of these inscriptions are concise economic records rather than dedicatory inscriptions, the translation of Minoan remains a challenge.

      <p>The great collection of Minoan art is in the museum at <!--del_lnk--> Heraklion, near Knossos on the north shore of Crete. Minoan art, with other remains of <!--del_lnk--> material culture, especially the sequence of ceramic styles, has allowed archaeologists to define the three phases of Minoan culture (EM, MM, LM) discussed above.<p>Since wood and textiles have vanished through decomposition, the most important surviving examples of Minoan art are <!--del_lnk--> Minoan pottery, the palace architecture with its <!--del_lnk--> frescos that include landscapes, <!--del_lnk--> stone carvings, and intricately carved <!--del_lnk--> seal stones.<dl>

      <p>In the Early Minoan period ceramics were characterised by linear patterns of <!--del_lnk--> spirals, <!--del_lnk--> triangles, curved lines, <!--del_lnk--> crosses, <!--del_lnk--> fishbone motifs, and such. In the Middle Minoan period naturalistic designs such as <a href="../../wp/f/Fish.htm" title="Fish">fish</a>, <!--del_lnk--> squid, <a href="../../wp/b/Bird.htm" title="Bird">birds</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> lilies were common. In the Late Minoan period, flowers and animals were still the most characteristic, but the variability had increased. The &#39;palace style&#39; of the region around Knossos is characterised by a strong <a href="../../wp/g/Geometry.htm" title="Geometric">geometric</a> simplification of <!--del_lnk--> naturalistic shapes and <!--del_lnk--> monochromatic paintings.

      <p>The Minoans worshiped goddesses. Although there is some evidence of male gods, depictions of Minoan goddesses vastly outnumber depictions of anything that could be considered a Minoan god. While some of these depictions of women are believed to be images of worshipers and priestesses officiating at religious ceremonies, as opposed to the deity herself, there still seem to be several goddesses including a <!--del_lnk--> Mother Goddess of <!--del_lnk--> fertility, a <!--del_lnk--> Mistress of the Animals, a protectress of <a href="../../wp/c/City.htm" title="City">cities</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> household, the <a href="../../wp/h/Harvest.htm" title="Harvest">harvest</a>, and the <!--del_lnk--> underworld, and more. Some have argued that these are all aspects of a single goddess. They are often represented by <!--del_lnk--> serpents, birds, poppies, and a somewhat vague shape of an animal upon the head. Some suggest the goddess was linked to the &quot;Earthshaker&quot;, a male represented by the <a href="../../wp/c/Cattle.htm" title="Cattle">bull</a> and the <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">sun</a>, who would die each <a href="../../wp/a/Autumn.htm" title="Autumn">autumn</a> and be reborn each <a href="../../wp/s/Spring_%2528season%2529.htm" title="Spring (season)">spring</a>. Though the notorious bull-headed Minotaur is a purely Greek depiction, seals and seal-impressions reveal bird-headed or masked deities.<p><!--del_lnk--> Walter Burkert warns:<dl>
       <dd>&quot;To what extent one can and must differentiate between Minoan and Mycenaean religion is a question which has not yet found a conclusive answer&quot;</dl>
      <p>and suggests that useful parallels will be found in the relations between Etruscan and Archaic Greek culture and religion, or between Roman and Hellenistic culture. Minoan religion has not been transmitted in its own language, and the uses literate Greeks later made of surviving Cretan <!--del_lnk--> mythemes, after centuries of purely oral transmission, have transformed the meager sources: consider the Athenian point-of-view of the <!--del_lnk--> Theseus legend. A few Cretan names are preserved in <a href="../../wp/g/Greek_mythology.htm" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythology</a>, but there is no way to connect a name with an existing Minoan icon, such as the familiar <!--del_lnk--> serpent-goddess. Retrieval of metal and clay votive figures&mdash; <!--del_lnk--> double axes, miniature vessels, models of artifacts, animals, human figures&mdash;has identified sites of cult: here were numerous small shrines in Minoan Crete, and mountain peaks and very numerous sacred caves&mdash;over 300 have been explored&mdash;were the centers for some <!--del_lnk--> cult, but <!--del_lnk--> temples as the Greeks developed them were unknown. Within the palace complex, no central rooms devoted to cult have been recognized, other than the centre court where youths of both sexes would practice the <!--del_lnk--> bull-leaping ritual. It is notable that there are no Minoan frescoes that depict any deities.<p>Minoan sacred symbols include the <!--del_lnk--> bull and its horns of consecration, the <!--del_lnk--> labrys (double-headed axe), the <!--del_lnk--> pillar, the serpent, the sun-disk, and the <a href="../../wp/t/Tree.htm" title="Tree">tree</a>.<p><a id="Warfare_and_.22The_Minoan_Peace.22" name="Warfare_and_.22The_Minoan_Peace.22"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Warfare and &quot;The Minoan Peace&quot;</span></h3>

      <p>It is generally assumed there was little internal armed conflict on Minoan Crete. This condition is known as &quot;Pax Minoica,&quot; or &quot;The Minoan Peace.&quot; As with much of Minoan Crete, however, it is hard to draw any obvious conclusions from the evidence. One sometimes feels that the civilization is much like a Rorschach inkblot, in that interpretations often reflect more of the interpreter than the civilization itself. However, new excavations keep sustaining interests and documenting the impact around the Aegean <!--del_lnk--> <p>Many argue that there is little evidence for ancient Minoan fortifications. But as S. Alexiou has pointed out (in Kretologia 8), a number of sites, especially Early and Middle Minoan sites such as Aghia Photia, are built on hilltops or are otherwise fortified. As Lucia Nixon said, &quot;...we may have been over-influenced by the lack of what we might think of as solid fortifications to assess the archaeological evidence properly. As in so many other instances, we may not have been looking for evidence in the right places, and therefore we may not end with a correct assessment of the Minoans and their ability to avoid war.&quot; (&ldquo;Changing Views of Minoan Society,&rdquo; in Minoan Society ed L. Nixon).<p>Chester Starr points out in &quot;Minoan Flower Lovers&quot; (Hagg-Marinatos eds. Minoan Thalassocracy) that <!--del_lnk--> Shang China and the <a href="../../wp/m/Maya_civilization.htm" title="Maya civilization">Maya</a> both had unfortified centers and yet still engaged in frontier struggles, so that itself cannot be enough to definitively show the Minoans were a peaceful civilization unparalleled in history.<p>In 1998, however, when Minoan archaeologists met in a conference in Belgium to discuss the possibility that the idea of Pax Minoica was outdated, the evidence for Minoan war proved to be scanty.<p>Archaeologist Jan Driessen, for example, said the Minoans frequently show &lsquo;weapons&rsquo; in their art, but only in ritual contexts, and that &ldquo;The construction of fortified sites is often assumed to reflect a threat of warfare, but such fortified centers were multifunctional; they were also often the embodiment or material expression of the central places of the territories at the same time as being monuments glorifying an merging leading power&rdquo; (Driessen 1999, p. 16).<p>On the other hand, Stella Chryssoulaki&#39;s work on the small outposts or &#39;guard-houses&#39; in the east of the island represent possible elements of a defensive system. Claims that they produced no weapons are erroneous; type A Minoan swords (as found in palaces of Mallia and Zarkos) were the finest in all of the Aegean (See Sanders, AJA 65, 67, Hoeckmann, JRGZM 27, or Rehak and Younger, AJA 102).<p>Regarding Minoan weapons, however, archaeologist Keith Branigan notes that 95% of so-called Minoan weapons possessed hafting (hilts, handles) that would have prevented their use as weapons (Branigan, 1999). However more recent experimental testing of accurate replicas has shown this to be incorrect as these weapons were capable of cutting flesh down to the bone (and scoring the bone&#39;s surface) without any damage to the weapons themselves. Archaeologist Paul Rehak maintains that Minoan figure-eight shields could not have been used for fighting or even hunting, since they were too cumbersome (Rehak, 1999). And archaeologist Jan Driessen says the Minoans frequently show &lsquo;weapons&rsquo; in their art, but only in ritual contexts (Driessen 1999). Finally, archaeologist Cheryl Floyd concludes that Minoan &ldquo;weapons&rdquo; were merely tools used for mundane tasks such as meat-processing (Floyd, 1999). Although this interpretation must remain highly questionable as there are no parallels of one-meter-long swords and large spearheads being used as culinary devices in the historic or ethnographic record.<p>About Minoan warfare in general, Branigan concludes that &ldquo;[T]he quantity of weaponry, the impressive fortifications, and the aggressive looking long-boats all suggested an era of intensified hostilities. But on closer inspection there are grounds for thinking that all three key elements are bound up as much with status statements, display, and fashion as with aggression&hellip;. Warfare such as there was in the southern Aegean EBA [early Bronze Age] was either personalized and perhaps ritualized (in Crete) or small-scale, intermittent and essentially an economic activity (in the Cyclades and the Argolid/Attica)&rdquo; (1999, p. 92). Archaeologist Krzyszkowska concurs: &ldquo;The stark fact is that for the prehistoric Aegean we have no [sic] direct evidence for war and warfare per se [sic]&rdquo; (Krzyszkowska, 1999).<p>Furthermore, no evidence exists for a Minoan army, or for Minoan domination of peoples outside Crete. Few signs of warfare appear in Minoan art. &ldquo;Although a few archaeologists see war scenes in a few pieces of Minoan art, others interpret even these scenes as festivals, sacred dance, or sports events&rdquo; (Studebaker, 2004, p. 27). Although armed warriors are depicted being stabbed in the throat with swords, violence may occur in the context of ritual or blood sport.<p>Although on the Mainland of Greece at the time of the Shaft Graves at Mycenae, there is little evidence for major fortifications among the Mycenaeans there (the famous citadels post-date the destruction of almost all Neopalatial Cretan sites), the constant warmongering of other contemporaries of the ancient Minoans &ndash; the Egyptians and Hittites, for example &ndash; is well documented.<p><a id="Possibility_of_human_sacrifice" name="Possibility_of_human_sacrifice"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Possibility of human sacrifice</span></h4>

      <p>Evidence that suggest the Minoans may have performed human sacrifice has been found at three sites: (1) <!--del_lnk--> Anemospilia, in a MMII building near Mt. Juktas, interpreted as a temple, (2) an EMII sanctuary complex at <!--del_lnk--> Fournou Korifi in south central Crete, and (3) <!--del_lnk--> Knossos, in an LMIB building known as the &quot;North House.&quot;<p>The temple at Anemospilia was destroyed by earthquake in the MMII period. The building seems to be a tripartite shrine, and terracotta feet and some carbonized wood were interpreted by the excavators as the remains of a cult statue. Four human skeletons were found in its ruins; one, belonging to a young man, was found in an unusually contracted position on a raised platform, suggesting that he had been trussed up for sacrifice, much like the bull in the sacrifice scene on the Mycenaean-era <!--del_lnk--> Agia Triadha sarcophagus. A bronze dagger was among his bones, and the discoloration of the bones on one side of his body suggests he died of blood loss. The bronze blade was fifteen inches long and had images of a boar on each side. The bones were on a raised platform at the centre of the middle room, next to a pillar with a trough at its base.<p>The positions of the other three skeletons suggest that an earthquake caught them by surprise&mdash;the skeleton of a twenty-eight year old woman was spread-eagled on the ground in the same room as the sacrificed male. Next to the sacrificial platform was the skeleton of a man in his late thirties, with broken legs. His arms were raised, as if to protect himself from falling debris, which suggests that his legs were broken by the collapse of the building in the earthquake. In the front hall of the building was the fourth skeleton, too poorly preserved to allow determination of age or gender. Nearby 105 fragments of a clay vase were discovered, scattered in a pattern that suggests it had been dropped by the person in the front hall when s/he was struck by debris from the collapsing building. The jar had apparently contained bull&#39;s blood.<p>Unfortunately, the excavators of this site have not published an official excavation report; the site is mainly known through a 1981 article in <i>National Geographic</i> (Sakellarakis and Sapouna-Sakellerakis 1981, see also Rutter).<p>Not all agree that this was human sacrifice. Nanno Marinatos says the man supposedly sacrificed actually died in the earthquake that hit at the time he died. She notes that this earthquake destroyed the building, and also killed the two Minoans who supposedly sacrificed him. She also argues that the building was not a temple and that the evidence for sacrifice &ldquo;is far from &hellip; conclusive.&quot; Dennis Hughes concurs and also argues that the platform where the man lay was not necessarily an altar, and the blade was probably a spearhead that may not have been placed on the young man, but could have fallen during the earthquake from shelves or an upper floor.<p>At the sanctuary-complex of Fournou Korifi, fragments of a human skull were found in the same room as a small hearth, cooking-hole, and cooking-equipment. This skull has been interpreted as the remains of a sacrificed victim.<p>In the &quot;North House&quot; at Knossos, the bones of at least four children (who had been in good health) were found which bore signs that &quot;they were butchered in the same way the Minoans slaughtered their sheep and goats, suggesting that they had been sacrificed and eaten. The senior Cretan archaeologist Nicolas Platon was so horrified at this suggestion that he insisted the bones must be those of apes, not humans.&quot;<p>The bones, found by Peter Warren, date to Late Minoan IB (1580-1490), before the Myceneans arrived (in LM IIIA, circa 1320-1200) according to <!--del_lnk--> Paul Rehak and John G. Younger. Dennis Hughes and Rodney Castleden argue that these bones were deposited as a &#39;secondary burial&#39;.. Secondary burial is the not-uncommon practice of burying the dead twice: immediately following death, and then again after the flesh is gone from the skeleton. The main weakness of this argument is that it does not explain the type of cuts and knife marks upon the bones.<p><a id="Architecture" name="Architecture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Architecture</span></h2>
      <p>The Minoan cities were connected with stone-paved <!--del_lnk--> roads, formed from blocks cut with bronze <!--del_lnk--> saws.

      <p>The first palaces were constructed at the end of the Early Minoan period in the third millennium BC (<!--del_lnk--> Malia). While it was formerly believed that the foundation of the first palaces was synchronous and dated to the Middle Minoan at around 2000 BC (the date of the first palace at Knossos), scholars now think that palaces were built over a longer period of time in different locations, in response to local developments. The main older palaces are Knossos, Malia, and Phaistos.<p>The palaces fulfilled a plethora of functions: they served as centres of <a href="../../wp/g/Government.htm" title="Government">government</a>, administrative offices, <!--del_lnk--> shrines, workshops, and storage spaces (e.g., for grain). These distinctions might have seemed artificial to Minoans.<p>The use of the term &#39;palace&#39; for the older palaces, meaning a dynastic residence and seat of power, has recently come under criticism (see <!--del_lnk--> Palace), and the term &#39;court building&#39; has been proposed instead. However, the original term is probably too well entrenched to be replaced. Architectural features such as <!--del_lnk--> ashlar masonry, <!--del_lnk--> orthostats, columns, open courts, staircases (implying upper stories), and the presence of diverse basins have been used to define palatial architecture.<p>Often the conventions of better-known, younger palaces have been used to reconstruct older ones, but this practice may be obscuring fundamental functional differences. Most older palaces had only one story and no representative facades. They were U-shaped, with a big central court, and generally were smaller than later palaces. Late palaces are characterised by multi-storey buildings. The west facades had sandstone ashlar masonry. Knossos is the best-known example. See <!--del_lnk--> Knossos.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>One of the most notable contributions of Minoans to architecture is their unique column, which was wider at the top than the bottom. It is called an &#39;inverted&#39; column because most Greek columns are wider at the bottom, creating an illusion of greater height. The columns were also made of wood as opposed to stone, and were generally painted red.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Thera is the largest island of <a href="../../wp/s/Santorini.htm" title="Santorini">Santorini</a>, a little archipelago of volcanic fragments about 100 km distant from Crete. The <!--del_lnk--> Thera eruption (estimated to have had a <!--del_lnk--> Volcanic Explosivity Index of 6) has been identified by ash fallout in eastern Crete, and in cores from the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean seas. The massive eruption of Thera led to the volcano&#39;s collapse into a submarine <!--del_lnk--> caldera, causing <a href="../../wp/t/Tsunami.htm" title="Tsunami">tsunamis</a> which destroyed naval installations and settlements near the coasts. The impact of the Thera eruption on the Minoan civilization is debated.<p>Claims were made that the ash falling on the eastern half of Crete may have choked off plant life, causing starvation. It was alleged that 7-11 cm of ash fell on Kato Zakro, while 0.5cm fell on Knossos. However, when field examinations were carried out, this theory was dropped, as no more than 5mm had fallen anywhere in Crete. (Callender, 1999) Earlier historians and archaeologists appear to have been deceived by the depth of pumice found on the sea floor, however it has been established this oozed from a lateral crack in the volcano below sea level (Pichler &amp; Friedrich, 1980).<p>(The calendar date of the eruption is much disputed. Many archaeologists believe that synchronisms with Egypt require a date around 1500 BC; radiocarbon, however, puts the date in the late seventeenth century BC. See <!--del_lnk--> Thera eruption for details.)<p>Occasionally the eruption is tied to the legend of <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantis.htm" title="Atlantis">Atlantis</a>, with either Thera or Minoan as the fabled place. See <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantis.htm" title="Atlantis">Atlantis</a>.<p>Recent geological studies of the volume of pummice deposited around the island of Santorini, suggest that the volcanic eruption of 1450 BCE was far more catastrophic than previously thought.
