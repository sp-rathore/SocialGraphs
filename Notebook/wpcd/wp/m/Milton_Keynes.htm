      <p><b>Milton Keynes</b> <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[&#x2CC;m&#x26A;lt&#x259;n&#x2C8;ki&#x2D0;nz]</span> is a large town in northern <!--del_lnk--> Buckinghamshire, in <!--del_lnk--> South East England, about 45 miles/75 km north-west of <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, and roughly halfway between London and <a href="../../wp/b/Birmingham.htm" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>. Milton Keynes was formally designated as a <!--del_lnk--> new town in January 1967. Its 34 square miles (88km&sup2;) area incorporated the existing towns of <!--del_lnk--> Bletchley, <!--del_lnk--> Wolverton and <!--del_lnk--> Stony Stratford along with another fifteen villages and farmland in between. It took its name from the existing <!--del_lnk--> village of Milton Keynes, a few miles east of <!--del_lnk--> the planned city centre. Uniquely for the UK, the urban form uses a 1km grid for the top level of <!--del_lnk--> street hierarchy: the local form of most districts is more conventional.<p>At the 2001 census the population of the Milton Keynes urban area, also including the town of <!--del_lnk--> Newport Pagnell, was 184,506, and that of the wider <!--del_lnk--> borough of Milton Keynes, which has been a <!--del_lnk--> unitary authority independent of Buckinghamshire since 1997, was 207,063 (compared to a population of around 53,000 for the same area in 1961)<p>

      <p>In the 1960s, the Government decided that a further generation of <!--del_lnk--> new towns in the South East was needed to relieve housing congestion in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>.<p>Since the 1950s, overspill housing for several London boroughs  had been constructed in <!--del_lnk--> Bletchley. Further studies in the 1960s identified north Buckinghamshire as a possible site for a large new town, a new city, encompassing the existing towns of Bletchley, <!--del_lnk--> Stony Stratford and <!--del_lnk--> Wolverton. The New Town (informally, &quot;New City&quot;) was to be the biggest yet, with a target population of 250,000. The designated area was 25,200 acres/10,200 hectares. The name &quot;Milton Keynes&quot; was taken from the existing <!--del_lnk--> village of Milton Keynes on the site.<p>The site was deliberately located equidistant from London, <a href="../../wp/b/Birmingham.htm" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Leicester.htm" title="Leicester">Leicester</a>, <a href="../../wp/o/Oxford.htm" title="Oxford">Oxford</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Cambridge.htm" title="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> with the intention that it would be self-sustaining and eventually become a major regional centre in its own right. Planning control was taken from elected local authorities and delegated to the <!--del_lnk--> Milton Keynes Development Corporation (MKDC).<p>The Corporation&#39;s strongly <!--del_lnk--> modernist designs featured regularly in the magazines <!--del_lnk--> Architectural Design and the <!--del_lnk--> Architects&#39; Journal. MKDC was determined to learn from the mistakes made in the earlier New Towns and revisit the <!--del_lnk--> Garden City ideals. They set in place the characteristic grid roads that run between districts and the intensive planting, lakes and parkland that are so appreciated today.<p>The Government wound up MKDC in 1992, transferring control to the Commission for New Towns (CNT) and then finally to <!--del_lnk--> English Partnerships, with the planning function returning to local authority control (since 1974 and the <!--del_lnk--> Local Government Act 1972, the <!--del_lnk--> Milton Keynes Borough Council, which was subsequently made a <!--del_lnk--> unitary authority in the 1990s). Most recently, the Government has assigned significant planning control to <!--del_lnk--> English Partnerships, charging it with increasing the population beyond to 300,000 by 2030.<p>The borough applied for formal <a href="../../wp/c/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="City status in the United Kingdom">city status</a> in the 2000 and 2002 competitions, but was not successful.<p><a id="Prior_history" name="Prior_history"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Prior history</span></h3>
      <p>The area that was to become the New City encompassed a landscape that has a rich historic legacy. Evidence of permanent settlement dates back to the <a href="../../wp/b/Bronze_Age.htm" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a>. The area to be developed was largely farmland and undeveloped villages. Before construction began, every area was subject to detailed archaeological investigation: doing so has provided a unique insight into the history of a large sample of the landscape of south-central England. When the boundary of Milton Keynes was defined, some 40,000 people  lived in the &quot;designated area&quot; of 8,851<!--del_lnk--> ha/21,833<!--del_lnk--> a. Collections<!--del_lnk-->  of oral history covering the 20th century completes a picture that is described in detail at the article <!--del_lnk--> History of Milton Keynes.<p><a id="Urban_design" name="Urban_design"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Urban design</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Grid_squares" name="Grid_squares"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Grid squares</span></h3>
      <p>Milton Keynes Development Corporation planned the city&#39;s layout according to <!--del_lnk--> street hierarchy principles, using a <!--del_lnk--> grid pattern of approximately 1 km interval, rather than on the more conventional <!--del_lnk--> radial pattern found in older settlements. Major roads within the city run between communities, rather than through them: the major roads are known locally as <i>grid roads</i> and the spaces between them are known as <i>grid squares</i>. Intervals of 1 km were chosen so that people would always be within walking distance of a bus stop (buses were originally intended to run only on the grid but this has not happened &mdash; buses take tortuous routes through the grid squares). Consequently each grid square is a semi-autonomous community, making a unique collective of 100 clearly identifiable neighbourhoods within the overall <!--del_lnk--> urban environment. The grid squares have a variety of development styles, ranging from conventional urban development and industrial parks to original <!--del_lnk--> rural and modern urban and pseudo-rural developments.<p><a id="Roads" name="Roads"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Roads</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Roundabout junctions were built at intersections since the grid roads were intended to carry large volumes of traffic: this type of junction is efficient at dealing with these volumes. Along the edges of each grid road there are large grassed areas, known as &#39;reservations&#39;. This is deliberate and allows roads to be upgraded from single carriageway to become dual carriageways as traffic volumes dictate. The edges of each grid square are heavily landscaped and some are banked up and densely planted. The purpose of this was to reduce traffic noise for residents but traffic noise is still significant at some locations. Traffic movements are fast, with little congestion since there are many alternative routes to a particular destination. The national speed limit applies on dualled sections of the grid roads (70 mph) and most single carriageway grid roads (60 mph), although some single carriageway speed limits have now been reduced to 40 mph. Consequently the risk to unwary pedestrians and turning traffic is significant, although pedestrians rarely have to cross grid roads <!--del_lnk--> at grade, as <!--del_lnk--> underpasses exist in several places along each stretch of all of the grid roads. Monitoring station data shows that pollution is lower than in other settlements of a similar size. This can be partially attributed to the large number of trees, particularly to the fact that trees line grid roads in most places.<p><a id="Height" name="Height"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Height</span></h3>
      <p>The original design guidance for the city declared that &quot;no building [be] taller than the tallest tree&quot;. However, the <!--del_lnk--> Milton Keynes Partnership, in its <!--del_lnk--> expansion plans for Milton Keynes, believes that <!--del_lnk--> Central Milton Keynes (and elsewhere) needs &quot;landmark buildings&quot; and has recently lifted the height restriction for the area. As a result, 14-<!--del_lnk--> storey buildings are now being built in the town centre.<p><a id="Linear_parks" name="Linear_parks"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Linear parks</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> flood plains of the <!--del_lnk--> Great Ouse and of its tributaries (the Ouzel and some brooks) have been protected as linear parks that run right through the city. The <!--del_lnk--> Grand Union Canal is another green route (and demonstrates the level topology of the city - there is just one minor lock in its entire 10 mile route through from <!--del_lnk--> Fenny Stratford to the &quot;Iron Trunk&quot; <!--del_lnk--> Aqueduct at <!--del_lnk--> Wolverton. The <!--del_lnk--> Milton Keynes redway system of cycleways and footpaths uses these and other routes.<p><a name=".22City_in_the_forest.22"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">&quot;City in the forest&quot;</span></h3>
      <p>The original Development Corporation design concept aimed for a &quot;forest city&quot; and its foresters planted millions of trees from its own nursery in Newlands in the following years. As of 2006, the urban area has 20 million trees.<p><a id="Further_development_plans" name="Further_development_plans"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Further development plans</span></h3>

      <p>In January 2004, Deputy Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> John Prescott announced the Government&#39;s plan to double the population of Milton Keynes by <!--del_lnk--> 2025. He appointed <!--del_lnk--> English Partnerships to do so, taking planning controls away from <!--del_lnk--> Milton Keynes Borough Council and making EP the statutory planning authority. Their proposal for the next phase of expansion moves away from grid squares to large scale, mixed use, higher density development. The <!--del_lnk--> more detailed article expands on the details of their proposals.<p>As might be anticipated, these plans are controversial &mdash; especially as planning control has been removed again from elected local authorities and placed in a central-government appointed body.<p>Milton Keynes is at the centre of the <!--del_lnk--> South Midlands area identified by the government for growth. <!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>
      <p>The open air <!--del_lnk--> National Bowl is a 65,000 &quot;seat&quot; venue for large scale rock (and classical) concerts. It is situated off the A5 near Furzton.<p>The 1,400-seat <!--del_lnk--> Milton Keynes Theatre <!--del_lnk-->  (Blonski-Heard) opened in 1999. Its high booking rate allows it to lay claim to the title &quot;Britain&#39;s most popular theatre&quot;. The theatre has a unusual feature: the ceiling can be lowered closing off the third tier (gallery) to create a more intimate space for smaller scale productions. There are further performance spaces in Bletchley, <!--del_lnk--> Leadenhall, <!--del_lnk--> Shenley Church End, <!--del_lnk--> Stantonbury and <!--del_lnk--> Walton Hall.<div class="thumb tright">
