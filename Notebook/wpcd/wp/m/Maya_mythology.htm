      <p><b>Maya mythology</b> refers to the <!--del_lnk--> pre-Columbian <a href="../../wp/m/Maya_civilization.htm" title="Maya civilization">Maya civilization</a>&#39;s extensive <!--del_lnk--> polytheistic <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religious</a> beliefs. These beliefs had most likely been long-established by the time the earliest-known distinctively Maya monuments had been built and inscriptions depicting their <a href="../../wp/d/Deity.htm" title="Deity">deities</a> recorded, considerably pre-dating the <!--del_lnk--> 1st millennium BC. Over the succeeding <!--del_lnk--> millennia this intricate and multi-faceted system of beliefs was extended, varying to a degree between regions and time periods, but maintaining also an inherited tradition and customary observances. The Maya shared many traditions and rituals with the other <a href="../../wp/c/Civilization.htm" title="Civilization">civilizations</a> and cultures in the <!--del_lnk--> Mesoamerican region, both preceding and contemporary societies, and in general the entire region formed an interrelated mosaic of belief systems and conceptions on the nature of <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">the world</a> and <a href="../../wp/h/History_of_the_world.htm" title="History of the world">human existence</a>. However, the various <!--del_lnk--> Maya peoples over time developed a unique and continuous set of traditions which are particularly associated with their societies, and their achievements.<p>Despite the ca. <a href="../../wp/1/10th_century.htm" title="10th century">early 10th century</a> &quot;Terminal collapse&quot;, during which Maya monument construction and inscription recording effectively ceased over large areas and many centers were subsequently abandoned, the Maya peoples themselves endured and continued to maintain their assorted beliefs and traditions. The maintenance of these traditions can be seen in the relics and products of those centers which flourished during the <!--del_lnk--> Post-Classic phase, such as in the northern <!--del_lnk--> Yucat&aacute;n Peninsula, occasionally combined with other influences more characteristic of the <a href="../../wp/g/Gulf_of_Mexico.htm" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf coast</a> and central <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexican</a> regions. Although the southern lowland and highland Maya regions of present-day <a href="../../wp/g/Guatemala.htm" title="Guatemala">Guatemala</a> saw very little further monument building during this period, the maintenance of traditional beliefs among the local Maya is attested by the accounts and reports of the <a href="../../wp/1/16th_century.htm" title="16th century">16th</a> and <a href="../../wp/1/17th_century.htm" title="17th century">17th century</a> <!--del_lnk--> Spanish.<p>During and after the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish conquest, the stories and traditions of the Maya continued to be handed down to succeeding generations, albeit much influenced and restricted by the influx of European practices and beliefs, <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholicism in particular. Many Maya have experienced considerable persecution for their beliefs and political oppression over the centuries since the first European arrivals; although there can be no doubt that Maya society and tradition has undergone substantial change, many Maya people today maintain an identity which is very much informed by their collective history, traditions and beliefs&ndash; a heritage which is distinctively Maya even where substantially combined with the widespread adoption of <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>.<p>Apart from <!--del_lnk--> epigraphic inscriptions on monuments (which deal primarily with commemorations and dynastic successions), only three complete Maya texts and a fragment of a fourth have survived through the years. The majority of the <!--del_lnk--> Maya codices were burned by <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="European">Europeans</a> like <!--del_lnk--> Bishop <!--del_lnk--> Diego de Landa during their conquest of Mesoamerica and subsequent efforts to convert the <!--del_lnk--> Maya peoples to <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>. Available knowledge of Maya mythology, as such, is rather limited. What is known is drawn largely from 16th - 17th century accounts of post-conquest Maya beliefs and traditions, which do not necessarily correspond with the traditions which were maintained in earlier times.<p>

      <p>In common with other Mesoamerican civilizations, each of the <!--del_lnk--> cardinal (or world-) directions were ascribed certain properties and associations. These attributes held a particular significance, and they provided one of the major frameworks which interlinked much of Maya religion and <!--del_lnk--> cosmology. The Maya world-view recognized the four primary compass directions, and each of these was consistently associated with a particular colour&mdash; <!--del_lnk--> east with red, <!--del_lnk--> north with white, <!--del_lnk--> west with black and <!--del_lnk--> south with yellow. These associations and their respective <!--del_lnk--> glyphs are attested from at least the <!--del_lnk--> Early Classic period, and also figure markedly in the Postclassic <!--del_lnk--> Maya codices.<p>A fifth &#39;direction&#39;, the &quot;center&quot;, also formed a part of this scheme. Associated with a blue-green colour, this was most frequently represented by a great <!--del_lnk--> ceiba tree, conceptualized as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> tree of life&quot;. In Maya cosmology this formed a kind of <i><!--del_lnk--> axis mundi</i> which connected the Earth&#39;s center with the layers of both the underworld and the heavens. It is believed that living ceiba trees were maintained at the centre of many pre-Columbian Maya settlements in symbolic representation of this connection, and alternatively one was placed at each of the four cardinal directions as well.<p>Maya deities each displayed different aspects based on these five directions as well as a number of other natural and symbolic cycles observed by the Maya.<p>Maya deities also had <!--del_lnk--> dualistic natures associating them with day or night, life or death. There were thirteen gods of the thirteen heavens of the Maya religion and nine gods of the nine underworlds. Between the upperworlds of the heavens and the underworlds of the night and death was the earthly plane which is often shown in Maya art as a two-headed <!--del_lnk--> caiman or a <a href="../../wp/t/Turtle.htm" title="Turtle">turtle</a> lying in a great lake. Natural elements, stars and planets, numbers, crops, days of the calendar and periods of time all had their own gods. The gods&#39; characters, malevolence or benevolence, and associations changed according to the days in the Maya calendar or the positions of the sun, moon, <a href="../../wp/v/Venus.htm" title="Venus">Venus</a>, and the stars.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Quich&eacute; Maya creation story is outlined in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Popol Vuh</i>. This has the world created from nothing by the will of the Maya <!--del_lnk--> pantheon of gods. Man was made unsuccessfully out of mud and then wood before being made out of maize and being assigned tasks which praised the gods &mdash; silversmith, gem cutter, stone carver, potter, etc. Some argue this story adds credence to the belief that the Maya did not believe in art <i>per se</i>; all of their works were for the exaultation of the gods.<p>After the creation story, the Popol Vuh tells of the struggles of the legendary <!--del_lnk--> hero twins, <!--del_lnk--> Hunahpu and <!--del_lnk--> Ixbalanque, in defeating the lords of <!--del_lnk--> Xibalba, the <!--del_lnk--> underworld. The twins descend into the underworld, perish, and are eventually miraculously reborn. This myth provides a metaphor for the agricultural cycle and the annual rebirth of the crops. These two stories are focal points of Maya mythology and often found depicted in Maya art.<p><a id="The_Creation_Myth" name="The_Creation_Myth"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Creation Myth</span></h2>
      <p>In Maya mythology, <!--del_lnk--> Tepeu and <!--del_lnk--> Gucumatz (also known as Kukulkan, and as the Aztec&#39;s <a href="../../wp/q/Quetzalcoatl.htm" title="Quetzalcoatl">Quetzalcoatl</a>) are referred to as the Creators, the Makers, and the Forefathers. They were two of the first beings to exist and were said to be as wise as sages. <!--del_lnk--> Huracan, or the <i>Heart of Heaven</i>, also existed and is given less personification. He acts more like a storm, of which he is the god.<p>Tepeu and Gucumatz hold a conference and decide that, in order to preserve their legacy, they must create a race of beings who can worship them. Huracan does the actual creating while Tepeu and Gucumatz guide the process. Earth is created, but the gods make several false starts in setting humanity upon the earth. Animals were created first; however, with all of their howling and squawking they did not worship their creators and were thus banished forever to the forest. Man is created first of mud, but they just crumbled and dissolved away. Other gods are summoned and man is next created of wood but has no soul, and they soon forgot their makers, so the gods turned all of their possessions against them and brought a black resinous rain down on their heads. Finally man is formed of <!--del_lnk--> masa or corn dough by even more gods and their work is complete. As such, the Maya believed that <a href="../../wp/m/Maize.htm" title="Maize">maize</a> was not just the cornerstone of their diet, but they were also made of the same stuff.<p><a id="Notable_Gods" name="Notable_Gods"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Notable Gods</span></h2>

      <p><a id="Bacabs" name="Bacabs"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Bacabs</span></h3>
      <p>The Bacabs were four brothers, the sons of <!--del_lnk--> Itzamna and <!--del_lnk--> Ixchel. A creator god placed these skybearers at the four corners of the universe. Because each stands at one of the four cardinal directions, each is associated with a colour and with a specific segment in the Maya calendar.<ul>
       <li><b>Hobnil</b> (later replaced by <!--del_lnk--> Chaac) - bacab of the east, is assigned the colour red and the Kan years.<li><b>Can Tzicnal</b> - bacab of the north, is assigned the colour white, and the Muluc years.<li><b>Zac Cimi</b> - bacab of the west, is assigned the colour black and the Ix years.<li><b>Hozanek</b> - bacab of the south, is assigned the colour yellow and the Cauac years.</ul>
      <p>References to the Bacabs are found in the writings of sixteenth-century historian <!--del_lnk--> Diego de Landa and the various Maya histories known as the Chilam Balams. At some point, the brothers became associated with the figure of Chac, a Maya rain god. In the Yucat&aacute;n, the Maya of Chan Kom referred to the four skybearers as the four Chacs. They were also believed to be jaguar gods, and are associated with beekeeping. Like many other deities, the Bacabs were important in divination ceremonies, being approached with questions about crops, weather or the health of bees.<p><a id="The_First_Humans" name="The_First_Humans"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The First Humans</span></h2>
