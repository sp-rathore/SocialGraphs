      <p>Mercia&#39;s exact evolution from the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon invasions is more obscure than that of Northumbria, <!--del_lnk--> Kent, or even Wessex. <a href="../../wp/a/Archaeology.htm" title="Archaeology">Archaeological</a> surveys show that <!--del_lnk--> Angles settled the lands north of the <a href="../../wp/r/River_Thames.htm" title="River Thames">River Thames</a> by the <!--del_lnk--> sixth century. The name Mercia is <a href="../../wp/o/Old_English_language.htm" title="Old English language">Old English</a> for &quot;boundary folk&quot; (<i>see <!--del_lnk--> marches</i>), and the traditional interpretation was that the kingdom originated along the frontier between the <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Welsh</a> and the Anglo-Saxon invaders, although <!--del_lnk--> P. Hunter Blair has argued an alternative interpretation that they emerged along the frontier between the kingdom of Northumbria and the inhabitants of the <!--del_lnk--> Trent river valley.<p>The earliest known king of Mercia was named <!--del_lnk--> Creoda, said to have been the great-grandson of <!--del_lnk--> Icel. He came to power about 585 and was succeeded by his son <!--del_lnk--> Pybba in 593. <!--del_lnk--> Cearl, a kinsman of Creoda, followed Pybba in 606; in 615, Cearl gave his daughter Cwenburga in marriage to <a href="../../wp/e/Edwin_of_Northumbria.htm" title="Edwin of Northumbria">Edwin</a>, king of <!--del_lnk--> Deira whom he had sheltered while he was an exiled prince. The next Mercian king was <a href="../../wp/p/Penda_of_Mercia.htm" title="Penda of Mercia">Penda</a>, who ruled from about 626 or 633 until 655. Some of what is known about Penda comes through the hostile account of <a href="../../wp/b/Bede.htm" title="Bede">Bede</a>, who disliked him both for being an enemy king to Bede&#39;s own <!--del_lnk--> Northumbria, but also for being a <!--del_lnk--> pagan. However, Bede admits that it was Penda who freely allowed <!--del_lnk--> Christian <!--del_lnk--> missionaries from <!--del_lnk--> Lindisfarne into Mercia, and did not restrain them from preaching. After a reign of successful battles against all opponents, Penda was defeated and killed at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Winwaed by the Northumbrian king <!--del_lnk--> Oswiu in 655.<p>The battle led to a temporary collapse of Mercian power. Penda was succeeded first by his son <!--del_lnk--> Peada, but in the spring of 656 Oswiu assumed control of the whole of Mercia after Peada&#39;s murder. A revolt in 658 resulted in the appearance of another son of Penda, <!--del_lnk--> Wulfhere, who ruled Mercia until his death in 675. Wulfhere was initially successful in restoring the power of Mercia, but the end of his reign saw a serious defeat against Northumbria. The next two kings, <!--del_lnk--> &AElig;thelred and <!--del_lnk--> Cenred son of Wulfhere, are better known for their religious activities; the king who succeeded them (in 709), <!--del_lnk--> Ceolred, is said in a letter of <!--del_lnk--> Saint Boniface to have been a dissolute youth who died insane. So ended the rule of the direct descendants of Penda.<p>At some point before the accession of <!--del_lnk--> &AElig;thelbald, the Mercians conquered the region around <!--del_lnk--> Wroxeter, known to the Welsh as &quot;The Paradise of Powys.&quot; Elegies written in the persona of its dispossessed rulers record the sorrow at this loss.<p>The next important king of Mercia was &AElig;thelbald (716 - 757). For the first few years of his reign he had to face the obstacles of two strong rival kings, <!--del_lnk--> Wihtred of Kent and <!--del_lnk--> Ine of Wessex. But when Wihtred died in 725, and Ine abdicated his throne the following year to become a <!--del_lnk--> monk in <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a>, &AElig;thelbald was free to establish Mercia&#39;s hegemony over the rest of the Anglo-Saxons south of the <!--del_lnk--> Humber. Because of his prowess as a military leader, he acquired the title of <!--del_lnk--> Bretwalda. &AElig;thelbald suffered a setback in 752, when he was defeated by the West Saxons under <!--del_lnk--> Cuthred, but he seems to have restored his supremacy over Wessex by 757.<p><a id="Reign_of_Offa_and_rise_of_Wessex" name="Reign_of_Offa_and_rise_of_Wessex"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Reign of Offa and rise of Wessex</span></h2>
      <p>Following the murder of &AElig;thelbald by one of his bodyguards in 757, a civil war followed, which was concluded with the victory of <!--del_lnk--> Offa. Offa was forced to build the hegemony over the southern English of his predecessor anew, but he not only did so successfully, he became the greatest king Mercia ever knew. Not only did he win battles and dominate southern England, he also took an active hand to administering the affairs of his kingdom by founding <!--del_lnk--> market towns and overseeing the first major issues of gold <a href="../../wp/c/Coin.htm" title="Coin">coins</a> in Britain, assumed a role in the administration of the <!--del_lnk--> Catholic church in England, and even negotiated with <a href="../../wp/c/Charlemagne.htm" title="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> as an equal. Offa is credited with the construction of <!--del_lnk--> Offa&#39;s Dyke, marking the border between Wales and Mercia.<p>Offa exerted himself to ensure that his son <!--del_lnk--> Ecgfrith of Mercia would succeed him, but after his death in July 796, Ecgfrith survived for only five more months, and the kingdom passed to a distant relative named <!--del_lnk--> Coenwulf in December 796. In 821, Coenwulf himself was succeeded by his brother <!--del_lnk--> Ceolwulf, who demonstrated his military prowess by his attack on and destruction of the fortress of <!--del_lnk--> Deganwy in <!--del_lnk--> Powys. The power of the <a href="../../wp/w/Wessex.htm" title="Wessex">West Saxons</a> under <!--del_lnk--> Egbert was rising during this period, however, and in 825 Egbert defeated the Mercian king <!--del_lnk--> Beornwulf (who had overthrown Ceolwulf in 823) at <!--del_lnk--> Ellendun.<p>The Battle of Ellendun proved decisive. Beornwulf was slain suppressing a revolt amongst the East Angles, and his successor, a former ealdorman named <!--del_lnk--> Ludeca, met the same fate. Another ealdorman, <!--del_lnk--> Wiglaf, subsequently ruled for less than two years before being driven out of Mercia by Egbert. In 830, Wiglaf regained independence for Mercia, but by this time Wessex was clearly the dominant power in England. Wiglaf was succeeded by <!--del_lnk--> Beorhtwulf.<p><a id="Arrival_of_the_Danes" name="Arrival_of_the_Danes"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Arrival of the Danes</span></h2>
      <p>In 852, <!--del_lnk--> Burgred came to the throne and with <!--del_lnk--> Ethelwulf of Wessex subjugated north <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a>. In <!--del_lnk--> 868, <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Danish</a> armies occupied <a href="../../wp/n/Nottingham.htm" title="Nottingham">Nottingham</a>. The Danes drove Burgred, the last king of Mercia from his kingdom in 874. In 886, the eastern part of the kingdom became part of the <!--del_lnk--> Danelaw, while Mercia was reduced to its western portion only. The Danes appointed a Mercian <!--del_lnk--> thegn, <!--del_lnk--> Ceolwulf II, as king in 873 while the remaining independent section of Mercia was ruled by <!--del_lnk--> &AElig;thelred, called an <!--del_lnk--> ealderman, not a king. He ruled from 883 until 911, in a close and trusting alliance with <a href="../../wp/w/Wessex.htm" title="Wessex">Wessex</a>. &AElig;thelred had married <!--del_lnk--> &AElig;thelfl&aelig;d, daughter of <a href="../../wp/a/Alfred_the_Great.htm" title="Alfred the Great">Alfred the Great</a> of Wessex. She gradually assumed power as her husband sickened after about 900, possibly as a result of his wounds gained at the decisive battle against the Vikings at <!--del_lnk--> Tettenhall where the last large Viking army to ravage England suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the combined Mercian and Wessex army. After Aethelred&#39;s death she ruled alone until her death in 918 when her brother, <!--del_lnk--> Edward the Elder of Wessex became king. Ethelfleda freely gave London and Oxford to her brother in Wessex as a token of loyalty, and concentrated on fortifying Mercia&#39;s existing borders &mdash; east towards Nottingham, north to Chester, along the Welsh marches, and down to the <a href="../../wp/r/River_Severn.htm" title="River Severn">Severn</a> estuary.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercia&quot;</div>
