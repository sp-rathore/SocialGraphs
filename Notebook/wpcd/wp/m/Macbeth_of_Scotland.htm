      <p>Mac Bethad was the son of <!--del_lnk--> Findl&aacute;ech mac Ruaidr&iacute;, <!--del_lnk--> mormaer of <!--del_lnk--> Moray. His mother is sometimes supposed to have been a daughter of <a href="../../wp/m/Malcolm_II_of_Scotland.htm" title="Malcolm II of Scotland">M&aacute;el Coluim mac Cin&aacute;eda</a>. This may be derived from <!--del_lnk--> Andrew of Wyntoun&#39;s <i>Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland</i> which makes Mac Bethad&#39;s mother a grand-daughter, rather than a daughter, of M&aacute;el Coluim. <p>Mac Bethad&#39;s paternal ancestry can be traced in the Irish genealogies contained in the Rawlinson B.502 manuscript:<blockquote>
       <p><b>Mac Bethad son of Findl&aacute;ech</b> son of Ruadr&iacute; son of Domnall son of Morgg&aacute;n son of Cathamal son of Ruadr&iacute; son of Ailgelach son of Ferchar son of Fergus son of Nechtan son of Colm&aacute;n son of B&aacute;et&aacute;n son of Eochaid son of Muiredach son of Loarn son of Ercc son of Eochaid Muinremuir.</blockquote>
      <p>This should be compared with the ancestry claimed for <a href="../../wp/m/Malcolm_II_of_Scotland.htm" title="Malcolm II of Scotland">M&aacute;el Coluim mac Cin&aacute;eda</a> which traces back to Loarn&#39;s brother <!--del_lnk--> Fergus M&oacute;r. Several of Mac Bethad&#39;s ancestors can tentatively be identified: Ailgelach son of Ferchar as <!--del_lnk--> Ainbcellach mac Ferchair and Ferchar son of Fergus (correctly, son of Feredach son of Fergus) as <!--del_lnk--> Ferchar Fota, while Muiredach son of <!--del_lnk--> Loarn mac Eirc, his son Eochaid and Eochaid&#39;s son B&aacute;et&aacute;n are given in the <!--del_lnk--> Senchus fer n-Alban. So, while the descendants of <!--del_lnk--> Cin&aacute;ed mac Ailp&iacute;n saw themselves as coming off the Cen&eacute;l nGabr&aacute;in of <a href="../../wp/d/D%25C3%25A1l_Riata.htm" title="D&aacute;l Riata">D&aacute;l Riata</a>, the northern kings of Moray traced their origins back to the rival Cen&eacute;l Loairn.<p>Mac Bethad&#39;s father Findl&aacute;ech was killed c. 1020 - one obit calls him king of Alba - most probably by his successor, his brother M&aacute;el Brigte&#39;s son <!--del_lnk--> M&aacute;el Coluim. M&aacute;el Coluim died in 1029, the circumstances are unknown, but violence is not suggested; he is called king of Alba by the <!--del_lnk--> Annals of Tigernach. However, <i>king of Alba</i> is by no means the most impressive title used by the <!--del_lnk--> Irish annals. Many deaths reported in <!--del_lnk--> Irish annals in the <a href="../../wp/1/11th_century.htm" title="11th century">11th century</a> are of rulers called <i>Ard R&iacute; Alban</i> - <!--del_lnk--> High-King of Scotland. It is not entirely certain whether M&aacute;el Coluim was followed by his brother <!--del_lnk--> Gille Coemg&aacute;in or by Mac Bethad.<p>Gille Coemg&aacute;in&#39;s death in 1032 was not reported by Tigernach, but the <!--del_lnk--> Annals of Ulster record:<blockquote>
       <p>Gille Coemg&aacute;in son of M&aacute;el Brigte, mormaer of Moray, was burned together with fifty people.</blockquote>
      <p>Some have supposed that Mac Bethad was the perpetrator. Others have noted the lack of information in the Annals, and the subsequent killings at the behest of M&aacute;el Coluim mac Cin&aacute;eda to suggest other answers. Gille Coemg&aacute;in had been married to <!--del_lnk--> Gruoch, daughter of <!--del_lnk--> Boite mac Cin&aacute;eda, with whom he had a son, the future king <!--del_lnk--> Lulach.<p>It is not clear whether Gruoch&#39;s father was a son of <!--del_lnk--> Cin&aacute;ed mac Duib (d. 1005) or of <!--del_lnk--> Cin&aacute;ed mac Ma&iacute;l Coluim (d. 997), either is possible chronologically. After Gille Coemg&aacute;in&#39;s death, Mac Bethad married his widow and took Lulach as his step-son. Gruoch&#39;s brother, or nephew, his name is not recorded, was killed in 1033 by M&aacute;el Coluim mac Cin&aacute;eda.<p><a id="Mormaer_and_dux" name="Mormaer_and_dux"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Mormaer and <i>dux</i></span></h2>
      <p>When <a href="../../wp/c/Canute_the_Great.htm" title="Canute the Great">Canute the Great</a> came north in 1031 to accept the submission of M&aacute;el Coluim mac Cin&aacute;eda, Mac Bethad too submitted to him:<blockquote>
       <p>... Malcolm, king of the Scots, submitted to him, and became his man, with two other kings, Mac Bethad and Iehmarc ...</blockquote>
      <p>Some have seen this as a sign of Mac Bethad&#39;s power, others have seen his presence, together with Iehmarc, who may be <!--del_lnk--> Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, as proof that M&aacute;el Coluim mac Cin&aacute;eda was overlord of Moray and of <!--del_lnk--> the Kingdom of the Isles. Whatever the true state of affairs in the early 1030s, and it seems more probable that Mac Bethad was subject to the king of Alba, M&aacute;el Coluim died at <!--del_lnk--> Glamis, on <!--del_lnk--> 25 November <!--del_lnk--> 1034. The <!--del_lnk--> Prophecy of Berchan is apparently alone in near contemporary sources in reporting a violent death, calling it a kinslaying. Tigernan&#39;s chronicle says only:<blockquote>
       <p>M&aacute;el Coluim son of Cin&aacute;ed, king of Alba, the honour of western Europe, died.</blockquote>
      <p>M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s grandson, Donnchad mac Cr&iacute;n&aacute;in, was acclaimed as king of Alba on <!--del_lnk--> 30 November <!--del_lnk--> 1034, apparently without opposition. Donnchad appears to have been <i>t&aacute;naise r&iacute;g</i>, the king in waiting, so that far from being an abandonment of <!--del_lnk--> tanistry, his kingship was a vindication of the practice. Previous successions had involved strife between various <i>r&iacute;gdomna</i> - men of royal blood. Far from being the aged King Duncan of Shakespeare&#39;s play, the real Donnchad was a young man in 1034, and even at his death in 1040 his youthfulness is remarked upon.<p>Perhaps due to his youth, Donnchad&#39;s early reign was unremarkable. His later reign, in line with his description as &quot;the man of many sorrows&quot; in the <i>Prophecy of Berch&aacute;n</i>, was not successful. In 1039, Strathclyde was attacked by the <!--del_lnk--> Northumbrians, and a retaliatory raid led by Donnchad against <a href="../../wp/d/Durham.htm" title="Durham">Durham</a> in 1040 turned into a disaster. Later in 1040, Donnchad led an army into Moray, where he was killed by Mac Bethad on 15 August, at Pitgaveny near <!--del_lnk--> Elgin.<p><a id="High-King_of_Alba" name="High-King_of_Alba"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">High-King of Alba</span></h2>
      <p>On Donnchad&#39;s death, Mac Bethad became king. No resistance is known at this time, but it would be entirely normal if his reign were not universally accepted. In 1045, Donnchad&#39;s father Cr&iacute;n&aacute;n was killed in a battle between two Scots armies.<p><!--del_lnk--> John of Fordun wrote that Donnchad&#39;s wife fled Scotland, taking her children, including the future kings <a href="../../wp/m/Malcolm_III_of_Scotland.htm" title="Malcolm III of Scotland">M&aacute;el Coluim III</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Domnall III with her. Based on the author&#39;s beliefs as to whom Donnchad married, various places of exile, <!--del_lnk--> Northumbria and <a href="../../wp/o/Orkney.htm" title="Orkney">Orkney</a> among them, have been proposed. However, the simplest solution is that offered long ago by <!--del_lnk--> E. William Robertson: the safest place for Donnchad&#39;s widow and her children would be with her or Donnchad&#39;s kin and supporters in <!--del_lnk--> Atholl.<p>After the defeat of Cr&iacute;n&aacute;n, Mac Bethad was evidently unchallenged. <!--del_lnk--> Marianus Scotus tells how the king made a <!--del_lnk--> pilgrimage to <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a> in 1050, where, Marianus says, he gave money to the poor as if it were seed.<p>In 1052, he found himself involved indirectly in the strife in the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of England between <!--del_lnk--> Godwin, Earl of Wessex and <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_the_Confessor.htm" title="Edward the Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a> when he received a number of <!--del_lnk--> Norman exiles from England in his court, perhaps becoming the first king of Scots to introduce <!--del_lnk--> feudalism to Scotland. In 1054, Edward&#39;s Earl of Northumbria, <!--del_lnk--> Siward, led a very large invasion of Scotland. The campaign led to a bloody battle in which the <!--del_lnk--> Annals of Ulster report 3000 Scots and 1500 English dead, which can be taken as meaning very many on both sides, and one of Siward&#39;s sons and a son-in-law were among the dead. The result of the invasion was that M&aacute;el Coluim - not M&aacute;el Coluim (III) mac Donnchada - &quot;son of the king of the Cumbrians&quot; was restored to his throne, i.e. as ruler of <!--del_lnk--> kingdom of Strathclyde. It may be that events of 1054 are responsible for the idea, which appears in Shakespeare&#39;s play, that M&aacute;el Coluim III was put in power by the English.<p>Mac Bethad certainly survived the English invasion, for he was defeated and mortally wounded or killed by M&aacute;el Coluim mac Donnchada in battle at <!--del_lnk--> Lumphanan, on the north side of the <!--del_lnk--> Mounth in 1057. The <i>Prophecy of Berch&aacute;n</i> has it that he was wounded and died at <!--del_lnk--> Scone, sixty miles to the south, some days later. Mac Bethad&#39;s stepson Lulach mac Gille Coemg&aacute;in was installed as king soon after.<p>Unlike later writers, no near contemporary source remarks on Mac Bethad as a tyrant. The <!--del_lnk--> Duan Albanach, which survives in a form dating to the reign of M&aacute;el Coluim (III) mac Donnchada calls him &quot;Mac Bethad the renowned&quot;. The <i>Prophecy of Berch&aacute;n</i>, a verse history which purports to be a prophecy, describes him as &quot;the generous king of <!--del_lnk--> Fortriu&quot;, and says:<blockquote>
       <p>The red, tall, golden-haired one, he will be pleasant to me among them; Scotland will be brimful west and east during the reign of the furious red one.</blockquote>

      <p>Mac Bethad&#39;s life, like that of Donnchad, had progressed far towards legend by the end of the 14th century, when John of Fordun and Andrew of Wyntoun wrote their histories. <!--del_lnk--> Hector Boece, <!--del_lnk--> Walter Bower and <!--del_lnk--> George Buchanan all contributed to the legend.<p>The influence of <a href="../../wp/w/William_Shakespeare.htm" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>&#39;s <i><a href="../../wp/m/Macbeth.htm" title="Macbeth">Macbeth</a></i> towers over mere histories, and has made the name of Macbeth infamous. Even his wife has gained some fame along the way, lending her Shakespeare-given title to a short story by <!--del_lnk--> Nikolai Leskov and the opera by <!--del_lnk--> Dmitri Shostakovich entitled <i>Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk</i>. The historical content of Shakespeare&#39;s play is drawn from <!--del_lnk--> Holinshed&#39;s <i>Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland</i>, which in turn borrows from Hector Boece&#39;s 1527 <i>Scotorum Historiae</i> which flattered the antecedents of Boece&#39;s patron, king <!--del_lnk--> James V of Scotland.<p>In modern times, <!--del_lnk--> Dorothy Dunnett&#39;s novel <i>King Hereafter</i> aims to portray a historical Macbeth, but proposes that Mac Bethad and his rival and sometime ally <!--del_lnk--> Thorfinn of Orkney are one and the same (Thorfinn is his birth name and Macbeth is his baptismal name). <!--del_lnk--> John Cargill Thompson&#39;s play <i>Macbeth Speaks 1997</i>, a reworking of his earlier <i>Macbeth Speaks</i>, is a monologue delivered by the historical Macbeth, aware of what Shakespeare and posterity have done to him. Macbeth is also a recurring character in animated television series <i><!--del_lnk--> Gargoyles</i> in which his reign is portrayed sympathetically, and his success is a result of an alliance with the titular creatures.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth_of_Scotland&quot;</div>
