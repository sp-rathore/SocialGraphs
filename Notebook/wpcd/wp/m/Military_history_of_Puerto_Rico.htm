      <p>The <b>recorded <!--del_lnk--> military history</b> of <b><a href="../../wp/p/Puerto_Rico.htm" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a></b> encompasses the period from the 16th century, when <!--del_lnk--> Spanish <!--del_lnk--> conquistadores battled native <!--del_lnk--> Tainos, to the present employment of Puerto Ricans in the <!--del_lnk--> United States Armed Forces in the military campaigns in <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq.htm" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>.<p>Puerto Rico was part of the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish Empire for four centuries, when the Puerto Ricans defended themselves against invasions from the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British</a>, <!--del_lnk--> French, and <!--del_lnk--> Dutch. During the mid-19th century, the quest for <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin American</a> independence from <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> spread to Puerto Rico, culminating in the failed revolution known as <i><!--del_lnk--> El Grito de Lares</i>. The island was invaded by the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> during the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish-American War; the war ended when Spain officially ceded the island under the <!--del_lnk--> 1898 Treaty of Paris. Puerto Rico became a <!--del_lnk--> United States territory and a military regiment known as the Porto Rico Regiment was established on the island.<p>As citizens of the United States, Puerto Ricans have participated in every major United States military engagement from <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, with Puerto Rico&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> 65th Infantry Regiment distinguishing themselves in combat during the <!--del_lnk--> Korean War.<p>

      <p><a href="../../wp/c/Christopher_Columbus.htm" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> discovered the island of Puerto Rico on <!--del_lnk--> November 19, <!--del_lnk--> 1493 during his second voyage to the New World. The island was inhabited by the <!--del_lnk--> Arawak group of <!--del_lnk--> indigenous peoples known as Tainos, who called the island &quot;Boriken&quot; or &quot;Borinquen&quot;. Columbus named the island <i><!--del_lnk--> San Juan Bautista</i> in honour of <!--del_lnk--> Saint John the Baptist. The main port was named <i>Puerto Rico (Rich Port)</i> (eventually the island was renamed Puerto Rico and the port which was to evolve into the capital of the island was renamed San Juan). The conquistador <!--del_lnk--> Juan Ponce de Le&oacute;n accompanied Columbus on this trip.<div class="thumb tleft">

      </div>
      <p>When Ponce de Le&oacute;n arrived in Puerto Rico, he was well received by the <i>cacique</i> <!--del_lnk--> Ag&uuml;eyban&aacute;, chieftain of the island Taino tribes. Besides the conquistadors, some of the first colonists were farmers and miners in search of <!--del_lnk--> gold. In 1508, Ponce de Le&oacute;n became the first appointed governor of Puerto Rico, founding the first settlement of <!--del_lnk--> Caparra between the modern-day cities of <!--del_lnk--> Bayam&oacute;n and San Juan. After being named Governor, de Le&oacute;n and the conquistadors forced the Tainos to work in the mines and to build fortifications; many Tainos died as a result of cruel treatment during their labor. In 1510, Ag&uuml;eyban&aacute; II (Ag&uuml;eyban&aacute;&#39;s brother) and a group of Tainos led <!--del_lnk--> Diego Salcedo, a Spaniard, to a river and drowned him, proving to his people that the white men were not gods. Upon realizing this, Ag&uuml;eyban&aacute; led the first island rebellion against the better armed Spanish forces. The colonists formed a citizens&#39; <!--del_lnk--> militia to defend themselves against the attacks. Ag&uuml;eyban&aacute; II was shot and killed, ending the first recorded military action in Puerto Rico.<p><a id="Europeans_fight_over_Puerto_Rico" name="Europeans_fight_over_Puerto_Rico"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Europeans fight over Puerto Rico</span></h2>

      <p>Puerto Rico was considered the &quot;Key to the Antilles&quot; by the Spanish because of its location as a way station and port for Spanish vessels. In 1540, with revenue from <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexican</a> mines, the Spanish settlers began the construction of <!--del_lnk--> Fort San Felipe del Morro (&quot;the promontory&quot;) in San Juan. With the completion of the initial phase of the construction in 1589 <i>El Morro</i> became the island&#39;s main military fortification, guarded by professional soldiers. The rest of Puerto Rico had to rely on only a handful of soldiers and the local volunteer militia to defend the island against militant and pirate attacks.<p><a id="The_English" name="The_English"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The English</span></h3>
      <p>In 1585, war broke out between England and Spain. The <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Spanish War was not limited to Europe&mdash;extending to Spanish and English territories in the Americas. On <!--del_lnk--> November 22, <!--del_lnk--> 1595, Sir Francis Drake, the <!--del_lnk--> vice-admiral in command of the <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Navy.htm" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> that overcame the <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_Armada.htm" title="Spanish Armada">Spanish Armada</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Sir John Hawkins attempted an invasion of the island with 26 vessels. Unable to take the island, Drake set San Juan on fire. In 1596, Drake died of <!--del_lnk--> dysentery after another unsuccessful attack on San Juan. On <!--del_lnk--> June 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1598, the British fleet, led by <!--del_lnk--> George Clifford, landed in Santurce and held the island for several months. He was forced to abandon the island upon an outbreak of bacillary dysentery among his troops. In 1599, 400 additional soldiers and 46 cannons were sent to the island along with a new governor, Alonso de Mercado, to rebuild the city.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The British continued their attacks against Spanish colonies in the Caribbean, taking minor islands including <!--del_lnk--> Vieques east of Puerto Rico. On <!--del_lnk--> August 5, <!--del_lnk--> 1702, the city of <!--del_lnk--> Arecibo, on Puerto Rico&#39;s northern coast, was invaded by the British. Armed only with spears and <!--del_lnk--> machetes, under the command of Captain <!--del_lnk--> Antonio de los Reyes Correa, 30 militia members defended the city from the British, who were armed with <!--del_lnk--> muskets and <!--del_lnk--> swords. The British were defeated, suffering 22 losses on land and 8 at sea. Reyes Correa was declared a <!--del_lnk--> national hero and was awarded the <i><!--del_lnk--> Medalla de Oro de la Real Efigie</i> (&quot;Gold Medal of the Royal Image&quot;) and the title of &quot;Captain of Infantry&quot; by <!--del_lnk--> King Philip V.<p>Native-born Puerto Rican (<i>criollos</i>) had petitioned the Spanish Crown to serve in the regular Spanish army, resulting in the 1741 organization of the Regimiento Fijo de Puerto Rico. The Fijo served in the defense of Puerto Rico and other Spanish overseas possessions, performing in battles in Santo Domingo, other islands in the Caribbean, and South America, most notably in <a href="../../wp/v/Venezuela.htm" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>. However, Puerto Rican complaints that the Fijo was being used to suppress the revolution in Venezuela caused the Crown to bring the Fijo home and in 1815 it was mustered out of service.<p>In 1765, the Spanish Crown sent Field Marshall <!--del_lnk--> Alejandro O&#39;Reilly to Puerto Rico to form an organized militia. O&#39;Reilly, known as the &quot;Father of the Puerto Rican Militia&quot;, oversaw training to bring fame and glory to the militia in future military engagements, nicknaming the civilian militia the &quot;Disciplined Militia.&quot; O&#39;Reilly was later appointed governor of colonial Louisiana in 1769 and became known as &quot;Bloody O&#39;Reilly.&quot;<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>During the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Revolutionary_War.htm" title="American Revolutionary War">American Revolutionary War</a>, Spain lent the rebelling colonists the use of its ports in Puerto Rico, through which flowed financial aid and arms for their cause. Puerto Rican volunteers fought the British, alongside the <!--del_lnk--> Continental Army, in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Bunker Hill in 1775, under the command of Captain General Torre. An incident occurred in the coast of Mayag&uuml;ez, in 1777, between two <!--del_lnk--> Continental Navy ships, the <i>Eudawook</i> and the <i>Henry</i>, and a Royal Navy warship, the <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Glasgow</i>. Both American ships were chased by the larger and more powerful <i>Glasgow</i>. The American ships were close to the coast of Mayag&uuml;ez; members of the Puerto Rican militia of that town, realizing that something was wrong, signaled for the ships to dock at the town&#39;s bay. After the ships docked, the crews of both ships got off and some Mayag&uuml;ezanos boarded and raised the Spanish flag on both ships. The commander of the <i>Glasgow</i> became aware of the situation and asked the island&#39;s governor, Jose Dufresne to turn over the ships. Dufresne refused and ordered the English warship out of the Puerto Rican dock.<p>The governor of <!--del_lnk--> Louisiana, <!--del_lnk--> Bernardo de G&aacute;lvez, was named general of the Spanish colonial army in North America. In 1779, Galvez and his troops, composed of Puerto Ricans and other Hispanic groups, distracted the British from the revolution by capturing the cities of <!--del_lnk--> Baton Rouge, <!--del_lnk--> Mobile, <!--del_lnk--> Pensacola and <!--del_lnk--> St. Louis. Galvez and his troops also provided the Continental Army with guns, cloth, gunpowder and medicine shipped from <a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> up the <a href="../../wp/m/Mississippi_River.htm" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</a>.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> February 17, <!--del_lnk--> 1797, the appointed governor of Puerto Rico, <!--del_lnk--> brigadier general Ram&oacute;n de Castro, received the news that England had invaded the island of Trinidad. Believing that Puerto Rico would be the next British objective he decided to put the local militia on alert and to prepare the island&#39;s forts against any military action. On <!--del_lnk--> April 17, 1797, British ships under the command of Sir <!--del_lnk--> Ralph Abercromby approached the coastal town of <!--del_lnk--> Lo&iacute;za, to the east of San Juan. On <!--del_lnk--> April 18, British soldiers and German mercenaries (&quot;<!--del_lnk--> Hessians&quot;) landed on Lo&iacute;za&#39;s beach. Under the command of de Castro, British ships were attacked with artillery and mortar fire from both El Morro and the San Ger&oacute;nimo fortresses. The British twice tried to take the Mart&iacute;n Pe&ntilde;a Bridge, a key passage to the San Juan islet, but after fiercely fighting the Spanish forces and local militia, were defeated in both attempts. The invasion failed because a total of 16,000 Puerto Rican volunteers and Spanish troops fought back and defended the island. The British also attacked <!--del_lnk--> Aguadilla and Punta Salinas, but they were defeated, and the British troops that had landed on the island were taken prisoner. The British retreated on <!--del_lnk--> April 30 to their ships and on <!--del_lnk--> May 2 set sail northward. Because of the defeat given to the British forces, governor Ramon de Castro petitioned Spanish King <!--del_lnk--> Charles IV for recognition for the victors; he was promoted to Field Marshal and several others were promoted and given pay raises.<p>After Abercromby&#39;s defeat the British persisted in invading Puerto Rico with unsuccessful skirmishes on the coastal towns of Aguadilla (December 1797), Ponce, Cabo Rojo, and Mayag&uuml;ez until 1802 when the war finally came to an end.<div class="thumb tleft">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>While Spain and Britain were in a power struggle in the New World, Puerto Rican <!--del_lnk--> privateering of British ships was encouraged by the Spanish Crown. Captains <!--del_lnk--> Miguel Henriquez and <!--del_lnk--> Roberto Cofresi were two of the most famous pirates. In the latter half of the 17th century, Henriquez, a <!--del_lnk--> shoemaker by occupation, decided to try his luck as a pirate. He showed great valor in intercepting English merchant ships and other ships dedicated to <!--del_lnk--> contraband that were infesting the seas of Puerto Rico and the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> in general. Miguel Henriquez organized an expeditionary force which fought and defeated the British in the island of Vieques. Henriquez was received as a national hero when he returned the island of Vieques to the Spanish Empire and to the governorship of Puerto Rico. In recognition of his service, the Spanish Crown awarded Henriquez the <i>Medalla de Oro de la Real Efigie</i> (The Gold Medal of the Royal Image), named him &quot;Captain of the Seas and Land&quot;, and gave him a <!--del_lnk--> letter of marque and reprisal thus granting him the privileges of privateer.<p>In the case of Captain Roberto Cofresi, the Spanish government received many complaints from the nations whose ships he attacked. Cofresi and his men attacked eight ships, amongst them an American ship. The Spanish government, which routinely encouraged piracy against other nations, was pressured and felt obliged to pursue and capture the famous pirate. In 1824, Captain John Slout of the U.S. Naval Forces and his schooner &quot;Grampus&quot; engaged Cofresi in a fierce battle. The pirate Cofresi was captured, along with eleven of his crew members, and turned over to the Spanish Government. He was imprisoned in <!--del_lnk--> El Castillo del Morro in San Juan. Cofresi was judged by a Spanish Council of War, found guilty, and executed by firing squad on <!--del_lnk--> March 29, <!--del_lnk--> 1825.<p><a id="The_Dutch" name="The_Dutch"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Dutch</span></h3>
      <p>The <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> was a world military and commercial power by 1625, competing in the Caribbean with the British. The Dutch wanted to establish a military stronghold in the area, and dispatched Captain Balduino Enrico (Boudewijn Hendricksz) to capture Puerto Rico. On <!--del_lnk--> September 24, <!--del_lnk--> 1625, Enrico arrived at the coast of San Juan with 17 ships and 2,000 men. The governor of Puerto Rico, Juan de Haros, was an experienced military man and, expecting an attack in the section known as Boqueron, had that area fortified. However, the Dutch took another route and landed in La Puntilla.<div class="thumb tright">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>De Haro realized that an invasion was inevitable and ordered 300 men stationed at El Morro Castle and the city of San Juan evacuated. He also had former governor Juan de Vargas organize an armed resistance in the interior of the island. On <!--del_lnk--> September 25 Enrico attacked San Juan, besieging El Morro Castle and <!--del_lnk--> La Fortaleza (the Governor&#39;s Mansion). He invaded the capital city and set up his headquarters in La Fortaleza. The Dutch were counterattacked by the civilian militia on land and by the cannons of the Spanish troops in El Morro Castle. The land battle left 60 Dutch soldiers dead and Enrico wounded. The Dutch ships at sea were boarded by Puerto Ricans who defeated those aboard. After a long battle, the Spanish soldiers and volunteers of the city&#39;s militia were able to defend the city from the attack and save the island from an invasion. On <!--del_lnk--> October 21, Enrico set La Fortaleza and the city ablaze upon his retreat. He then tried to invade the island by attacking the town of <!--del_lnk--> Aguada. He was again defeated by the local militia and abandoned the idea of invading Puerto Rico.<p><a id="French" name="French"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">French</span></h3>
      <p>The British and the Dutch were not the only enemies that Spain faced in the Caribbean during this period. On <!--del_lnk--> October 11, <!--del_lnk--> 1528, the French sacked and burned the settlement of <!--del_lnk--> San Germ&aacute;n during an attempt to capture the island, destroying many of the island&#39;s first settlements&mdash;including Gu&aacute;nica, Sotomayor, Daguao and Loiza&mdash;before the local militia forced them to retreat. The only settlement that remained was San Juan.<p>France had threatened to invade the Spanish Colony of <!--del_lnk--> Santo Domingo. In 1808, the Spanish Crown sent their Navy, under the command of Puerto Rican Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Ramon Power y Giralt, to prevent the invasion of Santo Domingo by the <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> by enforcing a <!--del_lnk--> blockade.

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>In the early 19th century the Spanish colonies, in what is known as the <!--del_lnk--> Latin American revolutions, began to revolt against Spanish rule. <!--del_lnk--> Antonio Valero de Bernabe was a Puerto Rican military leader known in Latin America as the &quot;Liberator from Puerto Rico&quot;. Valero was a recent graduate of the Spanish Military Academy when <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleon_I_of_France.htm" title="Napoleon I of France">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> convinced King Charles IV of Spain to permit him to pass through Spanish soil with the sole purpose of attacking <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>. When Napoleon refused to leave, the Spanish government declared war. Valero joined the Spanish Army and helped defeat Napoleon&#39;s army at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Zaragoza. Valero became a hero; he was promoted to the rank of colonel and was awarded many decorations.<p>When <!--del_lnk--> Ferdinand VII assumed the throne of Spain in 1813, Valero became critical of the new king&#39;s policies towards the Spanish colonies in Latin America. He developed a keen hatred of the monarchy, resigned his commission in the army, and headed for <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. There he joined the insurgent army headed by <!--del_lnk--> Agust&iacute;n de Iturbide, in which Valero was named chief of staff. He fought for and helped achieve <!--del_lnk--> Mexico&#39;s independence from Spain. After the Mexican victory, Iturbide proclaimed himself Emperor of Mexico. Since Valero had developed anti-monarchist feelings following his experiences in Spain, he revolted against Iturbide. His revolt failed and he attempted to escape from Mexico by way of sea.<p>Valero was captured by a Spanish pirate, who turned him over to the Spanish authorities in Cuba. Valero was imprisoned but managed to escape with the help of a group of men that identified with <a href="../../wp/s/Sim%25C3%25B3n_Bol%25C3%25ADvar.htm" title="Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var">Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var</a>&#39;s ideals. Upon learning of Bol&iacute;var&#39;s dream of creating a unified Latin America, including Puerto Rico and Cuba, Valero decided to join him. Valero stopped in <!--del_lnk--> St. Thomas, where he established contacts with the Puerto Rican independence movement. He then traveled to Venezuela, where he was met by General <!--del_lnk--> Francisco de Paula Santander. He next joined Bol&iacute;var and fought alongside &quot;The Liberator&quot; against Spain, gaining his confidence and admiration. Valero was named Military Chief of the Department of Panama, Governor of Puerto Cabello, Chief of Staff of Colombia, Minister of War and Maritime of Venezuela, and in 1849 was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General.<p><a id="Puerto_Rico" name="Puerto_Rico"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Puerto Rico</span></h3>

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> April 13, <!--del_lnk--> 1855, a <!--del_lnk--> mutiny broke out among the artillerymen at <!--del_lnk--> Fort San Crist&oacute;bal. They were protesting an extended two years of military service imposed by the island&#39;s Spanish governor, Garcia Cambia. The mutineers pointed their cannons towards San Juan, creating a state of panic among the population. Upon their surrender, the governor had the eight men arrested and <!--del_lnk--> sentenced to death by <!--del_lnk--> firing squad.<p>Many Spanish colonies had gained their independence by the mid-1850s. In Puerto Rico, there were two groups: the loyalists, who were loyal to Spain, and the <i>independentistas</i>, who advocated independence. In 1866, Dr. <!--del_lnk--> Ram&oacute;n Emeterio Betances, <!--del_lnk--> Segundo Ruiz Belvis, and other independence advocates met in <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a> where they formed the Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico. An outcome of this venture was a plan to send an armed expedition from the <a href="../../wp/d/Dominican_Republic.htm" title="Dominican Republic">Dominican Republic</a> to invade the island. Several revolutionary cells were formed in the western towns and cities of Puerto Rico. Two of the most important cells were at <!--del_lnk--> Mayag&uuml;ez, led by <!--del_lnk--> Mathias Brugman and code named &quot;Capa Prieto&quot; and at Lares, code-named &quot;Centro Bravo&quot; and headed by <!--del_lnk--> Manuel Rojas. &quot;Centro Bravo&quot; was the main centre of operations and was located in the Rojas plantation of El Triunfo. Manuel Rojas was named &quot;Commander of the Liberation Army&quot; by Betances. <!--del_lnk--> Mariana Bracetti (sister-in-law of Manuel) was named &quot;Leader of the Lares Revolutionary Council.&quot; Upon the request of Betances, Bracetti knitted the revolutionary <!--del_lnk--> Flag of Lares (<i>Bandera de Lares</i>).<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The Spanish authorities discovered the plot and were able to confiscate Betances&#39;s armed ship before it arrived in Puerto Rico. The Mayor of the town of <!--del_lnk--> Camuy, Manuel Gonzalez (leader of that town&#39;s revolutionary cell), was arrested and charged with treason. He learned that the Spanish Army was aware of the independence plot, and escaped to warn Manuel Rojas. Alerted, the revolutionists decided to start the revolution as soon as possible, and set the date for <!--del_lnk--> September 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1868. Mathias Brugman and his men joined with Manuel Rojas&#39;s men and with about 800 men and women, marched on and took the town of Lares. This was to be known as &quot;el <!--del_lnk--> Grito de Lares.&quot; The revolutionists entered the town&#39;s church and placed Mariana Bracetti&#39;s revolutionary flag on the High Altar as a sign that the revolution had begun. They declared Puerto Rico to be the &quot;Republic of Puerto Rico&quot; and named <!--del_lnk--> Francisco Ramirez its President. Manuel and his poorly armed followers proceeded to march on to the town of <!--del_lnk--> San Sebasti&aacute;n, armed only with clubs and machetes. The Spanish Army had been forewarned, and awaited with superior fire power. The revolutionists were met with deadly fire. The revolt failed, many revolutionists were killed, and at least 475, including Manuel Rojas and Mariana Bracetti, were imprisoned in the jail of <!--del_lnk--> Arecibo and sentenced to death.<p>Others fled and went into hiding. Mathias Brugman was hiding in a local farm where he was betrayed by a farmer named Francisco Qui&ntilde;ones; he was captured and executed on the spot. In 1869, fearing another revolt, the Spanish Crown disbanded the Puerto Rican Militia, which had been composed almost entirely of native-born Puerto Ricans, and also the Compa&ntilde;ia de Artilleros Morenos de Cangrejos, a separate company of black Puerto Ricans. They then organized the Volunteer Institute, composed entirely of Spaniards and their sons.<p><a id="Cuba" name="Cuba"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cuba</span></h3>

      <p>The United States declared war on Spain in 1898 following the sinking of the battleship &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Maine&quot; in Havana harbour, Cuba.

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> August 8, 1898, the Spanish-American War ended, and upon the signing of the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Paris on <!--del_lnk--> December 10, Puerto Rico became a territory of the United States. The Spanish troops had already left by <!--del_lnk--> October 18, and the United States named General <!--del_lnk--> John R. Brooke as military governor of the island. On <!--del_lnk--> July 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1899, &quot;The Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry, United States Army&quot; was created, and approved by the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Congress on <!--del_lnk--> May 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1908. The regiment was a segregated, all-volunteer unit made up of 1,969 Puerto Ricans.<p>In 1897, before the onset of fighting in Puerto Rico, <!--del_lnk--> Juan Alonso Zayas, born in San Juan, was a Second Lieutenant in the Spanish Army when he received orders to head for the Philippines to take command of the 2nd Expeditionary Battalion stationed in <!--del_lnk--> Baler. He arrived in <a href="../../wp/m/Manila.htm" title="Manila">Manila</a>, the capital, in May 1897. There he took a vessel and headed for Baler, on the island of <!--del_lnk--> Luzon. The distance between Manila and Baler is 62 miles (100 km); if traveled through the jungles and badly-built roads, the actual distance was 144 miles (230 km). At that time a system of communication between Manila and Baler was almost non-existent. The only way Baler received news from Manila was by way of vessels. The Spanish colonial government was under constant attack from local Filipino groups who wanted independence. Zayas&#39;s mission was to fortify Baler against any possible attack. Among his plans for the defense of Baler was to convert the local church of San Luis de Tolosa into a fort.<p>The independence advocates, under the leadership of Colonel Calixto Vilacorte, were called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> insurgents&quot; (<i>tagalos</i>) by the Spanish crown. On <!--del_lnk--> June 28, 1898, they demanded the surrender of the Spanish army. The Spanish governor of the region, Enrique de las Morena y Fossi, refused; the Filipinos immediately attacked Baler in a battle that was to last for seven months. Despite being outnumbered and suffering hunger and disease, the battalion did not capitulate. In the meantime, Zayas and the rest of the battalion were totally unaware of the Spanish-American War that was going on. On August 1898, the hostilities between the United States and Spain came to an end. The Philippines became a U.S. possession under the accordance of the Treaty of Paris. The battalion at Baler found out about the Spanish-American War and its aftermath in May 1899, and surrendered on <!--del_lnk--> June 2, 1899. They were unaware that they had been fighting for a possession that was no longer theirs. The 32 survivors of Zayas Battalion were sent to Manila, where they boarded a ship for Spain. In Spain, they were given a hero&#39;s welcome and became known as <i>los Ultimos de Baler</i>&mdash;&quot;the Last of Baler.&quot;<p><a id="Puerto_Rican_National_Guard" name="Puerto_Rican_National_Guard"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Puerto Rican National Guard</span></h2>

      <p>In 1906, a group of Puerto Ricans met with the appointed Governor Winthrop, and suggested the organization of a Puerto Rican National Guard. The petition failed because the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Constitution.htm" title="United States Constitution">U.S. Constitution</a> prohibits the formation of any armed force within the United States and its territories without the authorization of Congress. On <!--del_lnk--> June 19, <!--del_lnk--> 1915, Major General <!--del_lnk--> Luis R. Esteves of the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Army became the first Puerto Rican to graduate from the <!--del_lnk--> United States Military Academy at <!--del_lnk--> West Point, New York. While he attended West Point, he tutored fellow classmate <a href="../../wp/d/Dwight_D._Eisenhower.htm" title="Dwight D. Eisenhower">Dwight D.

Pershing when he was sent to <!--del_lnk--> El Paso, <!--del_lnk--> Texas in the <!--del_lnk--> Pancho Villa Expedition. From El Paso, he was sent to the town of Polvo, where he was appointed mayor and judge by its citizens. Esteves helped organize the 23rd Battalion, which would be composed of Puerto Ricans and be stationed in <a href="../../wp/p/Panama.htm" title="Panama">Panama</a> during World War I. He would also play a key role in the formation of the Puerto Rican National Guard.<p><a id="World_Wars" name="World_Wars"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">World Wars</span></h2>

      <p>Upon the outbreak of World War I, the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Congress approved the <!--del_lnk--> Jones-Shafroth Act, which granted Puerto Ricans <a href="../../wp/c/Citizenship.htm" title="Citizenship">citizenship</a>. As a result, many Puerto Ricans, with the exception of women, became eligible for the military <!--del_lnk--> draft. On <!--del_lnk--> May 3, <!--del_lnk--> 1917, the Regiment recruited 1,969 men. The 295th and 296 Infantry Regiments were created in Puerto Rico. The first shot of World War I by the U.S. was fired in Puerto Rico by a Puerto Rican serving in the U.S. Army, Lieutenant <!--del_lnk--> Teofilo Marxuach. Lt. Marxuach was officer of the day at El Morro Castle, at the entrance to San Juan Bay, when war was declared. An armed supply ship for German submarines in the Atlantic, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Odenwald</i>, tried to force its way out of the bay. Lieutenant Marxuach opened fire from the walls of the fortress and forced the ship to return to port and be interned.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> May 17, 1917, the Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry was sent to guard the <a href="../../wp/p/Panama_Canal.htm" title="Panama Canal">Panama Canal</a> in defense of the <!--del_lnk--> Panama Canal Zone.<p>By 1918, the Army realized that there was a shortage of physicians specializing in anesthesia, a low salary specialty required in the military operating rooms. Therefore, the Army reluctantly began hiring women physicians as civilian contract employees. The first Puerto Rican woman doctor to serve in the Army under contract was Dr. Dolores Pi&#x148;ero from San Juan. She was assigned to the San Juan base hospital where she worked as an anesthesiologist during the mornings and in the laboratory during the afternoons.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> New York, many Puerto Ricans joined the 396th Infantry Regiment which was mostly composed of <!--del_lnk--> Afro-Americans. They were not allowed to fight alongside their white counterparts; however, they were permitted to fight as members of a French unit in French uniforms. They fought along the <!--del_lnk--> Western Front in <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, and their reputation earned them the nickname of &quot;the Harlem Hell Fighters&quot; by the <!--del_lnk--> Germans. Among them was <!--del_lnk--> Rafael Hernandez, considered by many as Puerto Rico&#39;s greatest composer. The 396th was awarded French Croix De Guerre for battlefield gallantry by the President of France. The Porto Rico Regiment returned to Puerto Rico on March 1919 and was renamed the <!--del_lnk--> 65th Infantry Regiment under the Reorganization Act of <!--del_lnk--> June 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1920.<p>The need for a Puerto Rican National Guard unit became apparent to Major General Luis R. Esteves, who had served as instructor of Puerto Rican Officers for the Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry at Camp Las Casas in Puerto Rico. His request was met with the approval of the government and Puerto Rican Legislature. In 1919, the first regiment of the Puerto Rican National Guard was formed, and General Luis R. Esteves became the first official Commandant of the Puerto Rican National Guard.<p>Puerto Rico suffered greatly during the <!--del_lnk--> Great Depression of the 1930s, and many Puerto Ricans moved to the <!--del_lnk--> East Coast of the United States looking for jobs and a better way of life. On the island, the unemployment rate continued to rise and many Puerto Ricans who were unable to find a job looked to the Armed Forces of the United States as a source of employment. Not only were they paid better than at the few other available jobs, but they were also guaranteed three meals a day, clothing, and shelter.<p><a id="World_War_II" name="World_War_II"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">World War II</span></h3>
      <p>World War II was the first conflict in which women, other than nurses, were allowed to serve in the U.S. Armed Forces. However, when the United States entered World War II, Puerto Rican nurses volunteered for service but were not accepted into the Army or Navy Nurse Corps. As a result, many of the island&#39;s women work force migrated to the mainland U.S. to work in the factories which produced military equipment. In 1944, the Army Nurse Corps decided to actively recruit Puerto Rican nurses so that Army hospitals would not have to deal with the language barriers. Among them was Second Lieutenant <!--del_lnk--> Carmen Dumler, who became one of the first Puerto Rican female military officers.<p>The 149th <!--del_lnk--> Women&#39;s Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) Post Headquarters Company was the first WAAC Company to go overseas, setting sail from New York Harbour for Europe on January 1943. The unit arrived in Northern Africa on <!--del_lnk--> January 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1943 and rendered overseas duties in <a href="../../wp/a/Algiers.htm" title="Algiers">Algiers</a> within General <a href="../../wp/d/Dwight_D._Eisenhower.htm" title="Dwight D.

      <p>The most notable of these occurred in Jayuya in what became known as <i><!--del_lnk--> El Grito de Jayuya</i> (Jayuya Uprising). Nationalist leader <!--del_lnk--> Blanca Canales led the armed nationalists into the town and attacked the police station. A small battle with the police occurred; one officer was killed and three others were wounded before the rest dropped their weapons and surrendered. The nationalists cut the telephone lines and burned the post office. Canales led the group into the town square where the illegal light blue version of the <!--del_lnk--> Puerto Rican Flag was raised. In the town square, Canales gave a speech and declared Puerto Rico a free Republic. The town was held by the nationalists for three days.<p>The United States declared <!--del_lnk--> martial law in Puerto Rico and sent the Puerto Rico National Guard to attack Jayuya. The town was attacked by U.S. bomber planes and ground artillery. Even though part of the town was destroyed, news of this military action was prevented from spreading outside of Puerto Rico. It was called an incident between Puerto Ricans. The top leaders of the nationalist party, including Albizu Campos and Blanca Canales, were arrested and sent to jail to serve long prison terms.<p><!--del_lnk--> Griselio Torresola, Albizu Campos&#39;s boyguard, was in the United States at the time of the Jayuya Uprising. Together with fellow nationalist <!--del_lnk--> Oscar Collazo, he decided to assassinate <!--del_lnk--> President Harry S. Truman. On <!--del_lnk--> November 1, 1950, they attacked the <!--del_lnk--> Blair House where Torresola and a policeman, <!--del_lnk--> Leslie Coffelt, lost their lives. Oscar Collazo was arrested and sentenced to death. His sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment by President Truman and he eventually received a presidential pardon.<p><a id="Cold_War_.281947-1991.29" name="Cold_War_.281947-1991.29"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Cold War (1947-1991)</span></h2>
      <p>After <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> a <!--del_lnk--> geopolitical, <!--del_lnk--> ideological, and <!--del_lnk--> economic struggle emerged between the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> and the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> which included their respective allies. This struggle was popularly named the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> because open hostilities never occurred between the main parties involved. The so-called &quot;war&quot; involved a nuclear and conventional weapons arms race, networks of military alliances, economic warfare and trade embargos, propaganda, espionage, and proxy wars. The <!--del_lnk--> Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 was the most important direct confrontation.

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> USS Cochino (SS-345), was a <!--del_lnk--> Gato-class submarine under the command of <!--del_lnk--> Rafael Celestino Benitez. On <!--del_lnk--> August 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1949, the <i>Cochino</i>, along with the <!--del_lnk--> USS <i>Tusk</i>, departed from the harbour of <!--del_lnk--> Portsmouth, England. Both diesel submarines were supposed to be on a cold-water training mission, however, according to &quot;Blind Man&#39;s Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage,&quot; the submarines were part of an American intelligence operation. They had snorkels that allowed them to spend long periods underwater, largely invisible to an enemy, and they carried electronic gear designed to detect far-off radio signals. The mission of the <i>Cochino</i> and the <i>Tusk</i> was to eavesdrop on communications that revealed the testing of submarine-launched Soviet missiles that might soon carry <!--del_lnk--> nuclear warheads. Thus, making this the first American undersea spy missions of the cold war.<p>The mission was cut short when one the <i>Cochino</i>&#39;s 4,000-pound batteries caught fire. Commander Benitez directed the firefighting, trying both to save the ship and his crew from the toxic gases. The crew members of the <i>Tusk</i> rescued all except one <i>Cochino</i> crew member and convinced Commander Benitez, who was the last man on the <i>Cochino</i>, to board the <i>Tusk</i>. The <i>Cochino</i> sank off the coast of <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a> two minutes after Benitez&#39;s departure. Benitez retired as a Rear Admiral from the Navy in 1957.<p><a id="The_Korean_War" name="The_Korean_War"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Korean War</span></h3>

      <p>Sixty-one thousand Puerto Ricans served in the Korean War, including 18,000 Puerto Ricans who enlisted in the <!--del_lnk--> continental United States. Puerto Ricans distinguished themselves as part of the 65th Infantry Division receiving many awards and recognitions; however, they were also involved in the largest court martial of the Korean War.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> August 26, 1950, the 65th Infantry departed from Puerto Rico and arrived in Pusan, Korea on <!--del_lnk--> September 23, 1950. It was during the long sea voyage that the 65th Infantry was nicknamed the &quot;Borinqueneers&quot;. The name is a combination of the words &quot;Borinquen&quot; (the Ta&iacute;no name for Puerto Rico) and &quot;Buccaneers&quot;. The men of the 65th were the first infantrymen to meet the enemy on the battle fields of Korea. Among the hardships suffered by the Puerto Ricans was the lack of warm clothing during the cold, harsh winters. The enemy made many attempts to encircle the Regiment, but each time they failed because of the many casualties inflicted by the 65th. On December 1950, the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Marines found themselves at the Chosin Reservoir area. In June 1951, The 65th was part of a task force which enabled the Marines to withdraw from the Hauack-on Reservoir. When the Marines were encircled by the <!--del_lnk--> Chinese Communist troops close to the <!--del_lnk--> Manchurian border, the 65th rushed to their defense. As a consequence, the Marines were able to return safely to their ships.<p>Among the battles and operations in which the 65th participated was the Operation &quot;Killer&quot; of January 1951, becoming the first Regiment to cross the <!--del_lnk--> Han River. On April 1951, the Regiment participated in the Uijonber Corridor drives and on June 1951, the 65th was the third Regiment to cross the Han Ton River. The 65th was the Regiment that took and held Cherwon and they were also instrumental in breaking the &quot;Iron Triangle&quot; of Hill 717 on July 1951. On November 1951, the Regiment fought off an attack by two Regimental size enemy units, with success. Colonel <!--del_lnk--> Juan Cesar Cordero Davila was named commander of 65th Infantry on <!--del_lnk--> February 8, <!--del_lnk--> 1952, thus becoming one of the highest ranking ethnic officers in the Army. On <!--del_lnk--> July 3, 1952, the Regiment defended the MLR for 47 days and saw action at Cognac, King and Queen with successful attacks on Chinese positions. On October the Regiment also saw action in the Cherwon Sector and on Iron Horse, Hill 391, whose lower part was called &quot;Jackson Heights&quot;. On September 1952, the 65th Infantry was holding on to a hill known as &quot;Outpost Kelly&quot;. Chinese Communist forces that had joined the North Koreans overran the hill in what became known as the Battle for Outpost Kelly. Twice the 65th Regiment was overwhelmed by Chinese artillery and driven off.<p>In June 1953, the 2nd <!--del_lnk--> Battalion conducted a series of successful raids on Hill 412 and in November, the Regiment successfully counterattacked enemy units in the Numsong Valley and held their positions until the truce signing between all parts involved.<p><a id="Mass_court-martial_and_post-war_recognitions" name="Mass_court-martial_and_post-war_recognitions"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Mass court-martial and post-war recognitions</span></h4>
      <p>Col. Cordero Davila was relieved of his command by Col. Chester B. DeGavre, a West Point graduate and a &quot;continental&quot; officer from the mainland United States and the officer staff of the 65th was replaced with non-Hispanic officers. DeGavre ordered that the unit stop calling itself the Borinqueneers, cut their special rations of rice and beans, ordered the men to shave off their mustaches and had ome of them wear signs that read &quot;I am a coward&quot;. It is believed that as a result of this humiliation, combat exhuastion, and the language barrier where factors that influenced some of the men of Company L of the 65th in their refusal to continue to fight.<p>In December 1954, 162 Puerto Ricans of the 65th Infantry were arrested, 95 were court martialed, and 91 were found guilty and sentenced to prison terms ranging from 1 to 18 years of hard labor. It was the largest mass <!--del_lnk--> court martial of the Korean War. The <!--del_lnk--> Secretary of the Army <!--del_lnk--> Robert Stevens moved quickly to remit the sentences and granted clemency and pardons to all those involved. Though the men who were court martialed were pardoned, there is currently a campaign for a formal exoneration.<p>An Army report released in 2001 blamed the breakdown of the 65th on the following factors: a shortage of officers and noncommissioned officers, a rotation policy that removed combat-experienced leaders and soldiers, tactics that led to high casualties, an ammunition shortage, communication problems between largely white, English-speaking officers and Spanish-speaking Puerto Rican enlisted men, and declining morale. The report also found bias in the prosecution of the Puerto Ricans, citing instances of continental soldiers who were not charged after refusing to fight in similar circumstances, before and after Jackson Heights.<p>The 65th Infantry was credited with battle participation in nine campaigns. Among the distinctions awarded to the members of the 65th were 10 <!--del_lnk--> Distinguished Service Cross, 256 <!--del_lnk--> Silver Star Medals and 595 <!--del_lnk--> Bronze Star Medals. According to &quot;El Nuevo D&iacute;a Newspaper, 30 May 2004&quot; a total of 756 Puerto Ricans lost their lives in Korea, from all four branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. More then half of these were from the 65th Infantry (This is without including non-Puerto Ricans). The 65th Infantry returned to Puerto Rico and was deactivated in 1956. However, Brig. General Juan Cordero, Puerto Rico&#39;s Adjutant General, persuaded the Department of the Army to transfer the 65th Infantry from the regular Army to the Puerto Rican National Guard. This was the only unit ever transferred from active component Army to the Army Guard.<p>Among the Puerto Ricans from the regiment who distinguished themselves are:Brigadier General <!--del_lnk--> Antonio Rodriguez Balinas (awarded two <!--del_lnk--> Silver Stars), Colonel <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Betances Ramirez (only Puerto Rican officer to command an infantry batallion), Master Sergeant <!--del_lnk--> Pedro Rodriguez (awarded two Silver Stars), and Staff Sergeant <!--del_lnk--> Modesto Cartagena (the most decorated Hispanic in history). Other Puerto Ricans who distinguished themselves were: Private First Class <!--del_lnk--> Fernando Luis Garcia, who became the first Puerto Rican recipient of the <a href="../../wp/m/Medal_of_Honor.htm" title="Medal of Honor">Medal of Honour</a> when he covered a grenade with his body, saving the lives of his fellow Marines, and Major General <!--del_lnk--> Salvador E.
