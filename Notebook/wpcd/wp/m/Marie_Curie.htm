      <p>Born in Warsaw, then under the control of the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Empire, her early years were sad ones, marked by the death of her sister from <!--del_lnk--> typhus, and four years later, her mother. She was noted to have an amazing memory and a diligent <!--del_lnk--> work ethic, neglecting even food and sleep while studying. After graduating from <!--del_lnk--> high school at the top of her class at the age of fifteen she was sent to the countryside to recover. Due to her gender and to Russian (<!--del_lnk--> anti-Polish) reprisals following the <!--del_lnk--> January Uprising she was not allowed admission to any university, so she worked as a governess for several years and attended the illegal <i><!--del_lnk--> Flying University</i>. Eventually, with the monetary assistance of her elder sister Bronia, she moved to <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>. She went to high school at the <!--del_lnk--> Coll&egrave;ge S&eacute;vign&eacute;, and then studied <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physics</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> at the <!--del_lnk--> Sorbonne, later becoming the first woman to teach there. Marie graduated first in her undergraduate class in the spring of 1893. A year later, she obtained her <!--del_lnk--> master&#39;s degree in mathematics, also at the Sorbonne. Under the doctoral supervision of <!--del_lnk--> Henri Becquerel, in 1903 she received her DSc from the <!--del_lnk--> ESPCI, Paris, becoming the first woman in France to complete her doctorate.<p>At the Sorbonne, she met and married <!--del_lnk--> Pierre Curie, another instructor. Together they studied <!--del_lnk--> radioactive materials, particularly <!--del_lnk--> pitchblende, the ore from which <a href="../../wp/u/Uranium.htm" title="Uranium">uranium</a> was extracted, which had the curious property of being more radioactive than the uranium extracted from it. By <!--del_lnk--> 1898 they deduced that the pitchblende must contain traces of an unknown radioactive component far more radioactive than uranium: on <!--del_lnk--> December 26th Marie Curie announced the existence of this new substance.<p>Over several years of unceasing labour they refined several tons of <!--del_lnk--> pitchblende, progressively concentrating the radioactive components, and eventually isolating the chloride salts (refining <!--del_lnk--> radium chloride on <!--del_lnk--> April 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1902) and then two new <a href="../../wp/c/Chemical_element.htm" title="Chemical element">chemical elements</a>. The first they named <a href="../../wp/p/Polonium.htm" title="Polonium">polonium</a> after Marie&#39;s native country Poland, and the other was named <a href="../../wp/r/Radium.htm" title="Radium">radium</a> from its intense radioactivity.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Together with <!--del_lnk--> Pierre Curie and <!--del_lnk--> Henri Becquerel, she was awarded the <!--del_lnk--> Nobel Prize in Physics, <!--del_lnk--> 1903: &quot;in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the <!--del_lnk--> radiation phenomena discovered by Professor <!--del_lnk--> Henri Becquerel&quot;. She was the first woman to be awarded a Nobel Prize. Eight years later, she received the <!--del_lnk--> Nobel Prize in Chemistry, <!--del_lnk--> 1911 &quot;in recognition of her services to the advancement of chemistry by the discovery of the elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element&quot;. In an unusual move, Curie intentionally did not <!--del_lnk--> patent the radium isolation process, instead leaving it open so the scientific community could research unhindered. A month after accepting her 1911 Nobel Prize, Marie was hospitalized with depression and kidney trouble. Whenever she was feeling especially depressed she took a trip to the country to relax.<p>She was the first person to win or share two Nobel Prizes. She is one of only two people who has been awarded a <!--del_lnk--> Nobel Prize in two different fields, the other being <a href="../../wp/l/Linus_Pauling.htm" title="Linus Pauling">Linus Pauling</a>. As of 2006 she remains the only woman to win two Nobel prizes.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>After her husband&#39;s death from a street accident, she supposedly had an affair with physicists <!--del_lnk--> Zack Jewett and <!--del_lnk--> Paul Langevin, both married men who had left their wives, which resulted in a press scandal, taken advantage of by her academic opponents to damage her credibility. Despite her fame as an honored scientist working for <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, the public&#39;s attitude to the scandal tended towards <!--del_lnk--> xenophobia &mdash; she was a foreigner born to a genteel family (<!--del_lnk--> Do&#x142;&#x119;ga-Sklodowski) from a little-known land (Poland was still referred to as a geographical area, under the Russian Tsar), an area known to have a significant <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jew">Jewish</a> population (although raised as a <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic, a faith which she later abandoned). France at the time was still reeling from the effects of the <!--del_lnk--> Dreyfus affair etc, so the scandal&#39;s effect on the public was all the more acute. It is a strange coincidence that Langevin&#39;s grandson Michel later married her granddaughter H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Langevin-Joliot.<p>During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, she pushed for the use of mobile <!--del_lnk--> radiography units, named &quot;Little Curies&quot; (or &quot;petites Curies&quot;), for the treatment of wounded soldiers. These units were powered using tubes of <i>radium emanation,</i> a colorless, radioactive gas given off by radium, later to be identified as <a href="../../wp/r/Radon.htm" title="Radon">radon</a>. Marie personally provided the tubes, derived from the radium she purified. Promptly after the war started, she donated her and her husband&#39;s gold Nobel Prize Medals for the war effort.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1921, she toured the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, where she was welcomed triumphantly, to raise funds for research on radium.<p>In her later years, she was disappointed by the many physicians and makers of <!--del_lnk--> cosmetics who used <!--del_lnk--> radioactive material without precautions.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Her death near <!--del_lnk--> Sallanches in 1934 was from <!--del_lnk--> aplastic anaemia, almost certainly due to massive exposure to radiation&mdash;much of her work had been carried out in a shed with no safety measures being taken, as the damaging effects of hard radiation were not yet known. She carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket and stored them in her desk drawer, resulting in massive exposure to radiation. She remarked on the pretty blue-green light the substances gave off in the dark.<p>She was initially buried at the cemetery in Sceaux where Pierre lay, but in 1995 their ashes were transferred to the <!--del_lnk--> Panth&eacute;on to honour their works.<p>Her eldest daughter, <!--del_lnk--> Ir&egrave;ne Joliot-Curie, won a Nobel Prize for Chemistry in <!--del_lnk--> 1935.<p><a id="Prizes" name="Prizes"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Prizes</span></h2>
