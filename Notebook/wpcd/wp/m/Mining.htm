      <p>Environmental issues can include <!--del_lnk--> erosion, formation of <!--del_lnk--> sinkholes, loss of <a href="../../wp/b/Biodiversity.htm" title="Biodiversity">biodiversity</a>, and contamination of <!--del_lnk--> groundwaters by chemicals from the mining process and products.<p>Modern mining companies in many countries are required to follow strict environmental and rehabilitation codes, ensuring the area mined is returned to close to its original state, or an even better environmental state than before mining took place. In some countries with pristine environments, such as large parts of <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>, this is impossible despite the best intentions. Past mining methods have had, and methods used in countries with lax environmental regulations can continue to have, devastating environmental and public health effects.<p>Mining can have adverse effect on surrounding surface and ground water if protection measures are not exercised. The result can be unnaturally high concentrations of some chemical elements over a significantly large area of surface or subsurface. Coal mining releases approximately twenty toxic release chemicals, of which 85% is said to be managed on site. Combined with the effects of water and the new &#39;channels&#39; created for water to travel through, collect in, and contact with these chemicals, a situation is created where mass-scale contamination can occur. In well-regulated mines hydrologists and geologists take careful measures to mitigate any type of water contamination that could be caused by mines. In modern American mining, operations must, under federal and state law, meet standards for protecting surface and ground waters from contamination, including acid mine drainage (AMD). To mitigate these problems water is continuously monitored at coal mines. The five principal technologies used to control water flow at mine sites are: diversion systems, containment ponds, groundwater pumping systems, subsurface drainage systems, and subsurface barriers. In the case of AMD, contaminated water is generally pumped to a treatment facility that neutralizes the contaminants.<p>Some examples of environmental problems associated with mining operations are:<dl>

       <dd><b><!--del_lnk--> Berkeley Lake</b>, an abandoned pit mine in <!--del_lnk--> Butte, Montana that has filled with water which is now acidic and poisonous. In 2003, a water treatment plant came on-line, initially treating &quot;new&quot; water entering the pit and thereby reducing the rate of rise of pit water. Treated water is currently used in the concentrator of the nearby Montana Resources Continental Pit, but it is clean enough to return to Silver Bow Creek. Eventually, water in the pit itself will be treated.</dl>

       <dd><b><!--del_lnk--> Britannia Mines</b>, a former copper mine near Vancouver, British Columbia. Copper from the abandoned mine washes into <!--del_lnk--> Howe Sound, polluting the water. No animal life remains there now. - Latest reports are that after a water treatment plant was put in, fish are returning to Britannia Bay - maybe for the first time ever. The name used by the <!--del_lnk--> First Nations tribes of Britannia Beach, even before mining started, means &quot;The Place of No Fish&quot;.</dl>

      <dl>
       <dd><b>Tar Creek</b>, an abandoned mining area in <!--del_lnk--> Picher, Oklahoma that is now an <!--del_lnk--> Environmental Protection Agency <!--del_lnk--> superfund site.

      <p>Although such issues have been associated with some mining operations in the past, modern mining practices have improved significantly and are subject to close environmental scrutiny. To ensure completion of <!--del_lnk--> reclamation (restoring mine land) the Office of Surface Mining requires that mining companies post a bond to be held in escrow until productivity of reclaimed land has been convincingly demonstrated. Since 1978 the mining industry has reclaimed more than 2 million acres (8,000 km&sup2;) of land. This reclaimed land has renewed vegetation and wildlife in previous mining lands and can even be used for farming and ranching.<p>For further reading on reclamation of former mining sites, see <!--del_lnk--> Restoration ecology.<p><a id="Mining_industry" name="Mining_industry"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Mining industry</span></h2>
      <p>While exploration and mining can sometimes be conducted by individual entrepreneurs or small business, most modern-day mines are large enterprises requiring large amounts of capital to establish. Consequently, the mining sector of the industry is dominated by large, often multinational, mostly publicly-listed companies. See <!--del_lnk--> Category:Mining companies for a list. However, what is referred to as the &#39;mining industry&#39; is actually two sectors, one specializing in exploration for new resources, the other specializing in mining those resources. The exploration sector is typically made up of individuals and small mineral resource companies dependant on public investment. The mining sector is typically large and multi-national companies sustained by mineral production from their mining operations.<p><a id="Employment_in_the_U.S._mining_industry_and_government_regulations" name="Employment_in_the_U.S._mining_industry_and_government_regulations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Employment in the U.S. mining industry and government regulations</span></h2>
      <p>Miners today do more than just dig tunnels in the Earth&#39;s subsurface. There are many different jobs, direct and indirect, in the mining industry, ranging from engineers and lab technicians to geologists and environmental specialists. Beyond employment directly linked to mine-site activity, the modern mining industry also employs many other professionals, including accountants, lawyers, sales representatives, public relations specialists, not to mention thousands of men and women involved who manufacture the machines and equipment necessary to mine minerals.<p>Employment in the mining industry offers highly competitive wages and benefits, especially in rural or remote areas. According to the <!--del_lnk--> Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), wages for coal miners are 30% higher than the wage earned by the average American. Employees possessing at least a bachelor&#39;s degree in mining or geological engineering can earn a median pay of over $80,000 annually.<p>The US Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that 675,000 are employed in the natural resources and mining sector. Estimated employment by selected specific commodity (including mine, mill, smelter, and quarry workers) listed below is from <!--del_lnk--> US Geological Survey Mineral Commodity Surveys:<ul>
       <li>Crushed Stone - 79,700 workers<li>Copper - 7,000<li>Cement - 18,000<li>Sand and Gravel - 38,300<li>Gold - 7,600<li>Aluminium - 56,000<li>Iron Ore - 4,400<li>Platinum Group Metals - 1,600<li>Salt - 4,100<li>Phosphate Rock - 2,900</ul>
      <p>The mining industry has an experienced but aging workforce with a mean average age of 50 years and median of 46 years. Indeed, while the industry will require new employees to meet future demand, the largest dilemma currently facing mine operators is finding employees to fill vacancies left by a generation of miners, mine engineers, senior managers, technical experts and others who are set to retire between 2005 and 2015. However, the industry is struggling to meet that demand due to current low enrollment levels in mining education programs at American colleges and universities.<p>Mining is regulated under a comprehensive federal safety law (Federal Mine Safety and Health Act) that is administered by the Department of Labor&#39;s Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). Currently under federal law, and enforced by MSHA each U.S. miner must have an approved worker training program in health and safety issues, including at least 40 hours of basic safety training for new underground miners with no experience; 24 hours for new miners at surface mines with no experience; plus eight hours of annual refresher training for all miners.<p><a id="Mine_planning_software" name="Mine_planning_software"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Mine planning software</span></h2>
      <p>One of the most dramatic changes in the mining industry has been the role that sophisticated three-dimensional mine planning software packages have had. Once the decision has been taken to proceed with a mine, one will need to create detailed designs that take into account the topography and infrastructure and of course, the physical parameters of the orebody. Manual design and old fashioned planning methods can be tedious and there are many road blocks that were unique depending on the nature of the mine (e.g., panel layouts, stope designs, decline design, ramp design). Initially with the 3-D technology relatively simple tasks - like rendering graphic images of drill holes - meant that it became easier for surveyors, geologists, mine planners, mining engineers and other technical staff to manipulate and visualize data. In recent years the range of integrated mine planning tools have meant that massively complex models can be built to optimize the extraction and processing of mineral resources.<p><b>Mining Software Links</b><ul>

      <p><a id="Safety_issues_and_improvements" name="Safety_issues_and_improvements"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Safety issues and improvements</span></h2>
      <p>Safety has long been a controversial issue in the mining business especially with sub-surface mining. While mining today is substantially safer than it was in the previous decades, <!--del_lnk--> mining accidents and tragedies are often very high profile such as the <!--del_lnk--> Quecreek Mine Rescue saving 9 trapped Pennsylvania coal miners in 2002.<p>Mining ventilation is also seen to be a safety concern for many miners and their family. Poor ventilation of mining causes exposure to harmful gases, heat and dust inside sub-surface mines. These can cause harmful physiological effects or death. Methane gas is a common source of ignition of explosions in coal mines and can propagate into the more violent coal dust explosions. High temperatures and humidity may result in any of the heat illnesses including heat stroke which can be fatal. Dusts can cause lung problems. These include <!--del_lnk--> silicosis, <!--del_lnk--> asbestosis and <!--del_lnk--> pneumoconiosis also known as miners lung or <!--del_lnk--> black lung disease.<p>A ventilation system is set up to course air through the working areas of the mine. The air movement necessary for effective mine ventilation is generated by one or more large mine fans usually located above ground. In the United States, main fans at coal mines are required to be above ground. Air flows in one direction only, making circuits through the mine such that each main work area receives a supply of fresh air.<p>Mining is regulated under the federal <!--del_lnk--> Mine Safety and Health Act by MSHA, which employs nearly one safety inspector for every four coal mines. Underground coal mines are thoroughly inspected at least four times annually by MSHA inspectors. In addition, miners can report violations, request additional inspections and cannot lose their jobs for doing so.<p><b>Immediately reportable accidents and injuries are:</b><ol>
       <li>A death of an individual at a mine;<li>An injury to an individual at a mine which has a reasonable potential to cause death;<li>An entrapment of an individual for more than thirty minutes;<li>An unplanned inundation of a mine by a liquid or gas;<li>An unplanned ignition or explosion of gas or dust;<li>An unplanned mine fire not extinguished within 30 minutes of discovery;<li>An unplanned ignition or explosion of a blasting agent or an explosive;<li>An unplanned roof fall at or above the anchorage zone in active workings where roof bolts are in use; or, an unplanned roof or rib fall in active workings that impairs ventilation or impedes passage;<li>A coal or rock outburst that causes withdrawal of miners or which disrupts regular mining activity for more than one hour;<li>An unstable condition at an impoundment, refuse pile, or culm bank which requires emergency action in order to prevent failure, or which causes individuals to evacuate an area; or, failure of an impoundment, refuse pile, or culm bank;<li>Damage to hoisting equipment in a shaft or slope which endangers an individual or which interferes with use of the equipment for more than thirty minutes; and<li>An event at a mine which causes death or bodily injury to an individual not at the mine at the time the event occurs.</ol>
      <p>Statistical analyses performed by the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Department of Labor&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) show that between 1990 and 2004, the industry cut the rate of injuries (a measure comparing the rate of incidents to overall number of employees or hours worked) by more than half and fatalities by two-thirds following three prior decades of steady improvement.<p><a id="Machinery" name="Machinery"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Machinery</span></h2>

      <p>It is estimated that there are between 700,000 and 800,000 abandoned mines in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. Many of these abandoned mines are associated with abandoned neighboring towns often referred to as <!--del_lnk--> ghost towns.<p>Experts strongly warn against entering or exploring old or abandoned mines. It is estimated that approximately 25% of the abandoned mine lands (AML) sites pose physical safety hazards. Old mines are often dangerous and can contain deadly gases, <!--del_lnk--> snakes, and other dangerous animals. The entrance to an old mine in particular can be very dangerous, as weather may have <!--del_lnk--> eroded the earth/rock surrounding the entrance. Old mine workings, caves, etc are commonly hazardous simply due to the lack of oxygen in the air and this is a deadly killer which provides no warning to those entering such an environment.<p>Every year, dozens of people are injured or killed in recreational accidents on mine property. It is only fair to note, however, that the majority of these deaths are not related to mine exploration. Drownings in open quarries and ATV accidents on abandoned mine properties are the main culprits behind these deaths. MSHA (Mine Safety and Health Administration) launched the &quot;Stay Out &ndash; Stay Alive&quot; campaign in 1999. &quot;Stay Out&ndash;Stay Alive&quot; is a national public awareness campaign aimed at warning and educating children and adults about the dangers of exploring and playing on active and abandoned mine sites.<p>The Abandoned Mine Land Initiative, launched by the Western Governors Association and the National Mining Association is an effort focusing on reporting the number of high-priority AML sites, and to identify, measure and report on the progress of current reclamation cleanup programs on an annual basis.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining&quot;</div>
