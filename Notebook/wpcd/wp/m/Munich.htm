The city has a population of about 1.3 million (<!--del_lnk--> as of 2006) and the Munich <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan area is home to around 2.7 million people.

      <p>Munich lies on the elevated plains of <!--del_lnk--> Upper Bavaria, about 50 km north of the northern edge of the <!--del_lnk--> Alps, at an altitude of about 520 m.<p>Munich is situated in the Northern Alpine Foreland. The northern part of this sandy plateau includes a highly fertile flint area which is no longer affected by the folding processes found in the Alps, while the southern part is covered by <!--del_lnk--> morainic hills. In between there are fields of fluvio-glacial out-wash, like around Munich. Wherever these deposits get thinner, the ground water can permeate the gravel surface and flood the area, leading to marshes as in the north of Munich.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>
      <p>Because of the city&#39;s altitude and proximity to the northern edge of the <!--del_lnk--> Alps, precipitation is rather high. Rain storms often come violently and unexpectedly. The range of temperature between day and night or summer and winter can be extreme. A warm downwind from the Alps (<!--del_lnk--> F&ouml;hn) can change the temperatures completely within a few hours, even in the winter. Winters last from December to March. Munich experiences rather cold winters, but heavy rainfall is rarely seen in the winter. The coldest month is January with an average temperature of 1&deg; C (33&deg; F). Snow cover is seen for at least a couple of weeks during winter. Summers in Munich city are fairly warm with average temperature of 19&deg; C (67&deg; F) in the hottest month of July. The summers last from May till August. In the summer, there is frequent rainfall accompanied by thunderstorms.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Origin" name="Origin"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Origin</span></h3>
      <p>As foundation date the year 1158 is assumed which is the earliest date the city is mentioned in a document. By that time the <!--del_lnk--> Guelph <!--del_lnk--> Henry the Lion, Duke of <!--del_lnk--> Saxony and <!--del_lnk--> Bavaria, had built a bridge over the river Isar next to a settlement of <!--del_lnk--> Benedictine <!--del_lnk--> monks. The monks&#39; presence dated back to the <a href="../../wp/8/8th_century.htm" title="8th century">8th century</a>, although settlement in the Munich area can be traced back to Roman times. To force traders to use his bridge (and charge them for doing so) Henry also destroyed a nearby bridge owned by bishop <!--del_lnk--> Otto von Freising (<!--del_lnk--> Freising). Subsequently the bishop and Henry quarreled about the city before Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Frederick I Barbarossa at an <i><!--del_lnk--> Imperial Diet</i> held in <!--del_lnk--> Augsburg in 1158. This sanctioned Henry&#39;s spoliation, and awarded an annual compensation for the bishop, and also confirmed Munich&#39;s trading and currency rights.<p><a id="Middle_Ages" name="Middle_Ages"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Middle Ages</span></h3>

      <p>Almost two decades later in 1175 Munich was officially granted city status and fortified. In 1180, with the trial of Henry the Lion, <!--del_lnk--> Otto I Wittelsbach became Duke of Bavaria and Munich was handed over to the bishop of Freising. Otto&#39;s heirs, the <!--del_lnk--> Wittelsbach dynasty would rule Bavaria until 1918. In 1240 Munich itself was transferred to <!--del_lnk--> Otto II Wittelsbach and in 1255, when the dukedom of Bavaria was split in two, Munich became the ducal residence of <!--del_lnk--> Upper Bavaria.<p>Duke <!--del_lnk--> Louis IV was elected German king in 1314 and crowned as <!--del_lnk--> Holy Roman Emperor in 1328. He strengthened the city&#39;s position by granting it the salt monopoly, thus assuring it of additional income. In 1327 most of the city was destroyed by a fire but was rebuilt, extended and protected with a new fortification some years later. Philosophers like <!--del_lnk--> Michael of Cesena, <!--del_lnk--> Marsilius of Padua and <!--del_lnk--> William of Ockham supported Louis IV in his fight with the papacy and were protected at the emperor&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> court. Since the citizenry several times revolted against the dukes a new <!--del_lnk--> castle was built close to the fortification from 1385 onwards. A rising of the guilds in 1397 was thrown down the following year.<p>Another devastating fire destroyed parts of the city in 1429. Since the town fathers considered themselves threatened by the <!--del_lnk--> Hussites the fortification was extended. In the late 15th century Munich underwent a revival of <!--del_lnk--> gothic arts - the Old Town Hall was enlarged and a new cathedral - the <!--del_lnk--> Frauenkirche - constructed within only twenty years from 1468 onwards. The cathedral has become a symbol for the city with its two brick towers and onion domes.<p><a id="Capital_of_the_reunited_duchy_of_Bavaria" name="Capital_of_the_reunited_duchy_of_Bavaria"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Capital of the reunited duchy of Bavaria</span></h3>

      <p>When Bavaria was reunited in 1506 Munich became capital of the whole of Bavaria. The arts and politics became increasingly influenced by the court. During the 16th century Munich was a centre of the German <!--del_lnk--> counter reformation, and also of <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">renaissance</a> arts. Duke <!--del_lnk--> Wilhelm V commissioned the Jesuit <!--del_lnk--> Michaelskirche, which became a centre for the counter-reformation, and also built the <!--del_lnk--> Hofbr&auml;uhaus for brewing brown beer in 1589.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Catholic League was founded in Munich in 1609. In 1623 during the <!--del_lnk--> Thirty Years&#39; War Munich became electoral residence when <!--del_lnk--> Maximilian I, Duke of Bavaria was invested with the electoral dignity but in 1632 the city was occupied by <!--del_lnk--> Gustav II Adolph of Sweden. When the <!--del_lnk--> bubonic plague broke out in 1634 and 1635 about one third of the population died. After the war Munich quickly became a centre of <a href="../../wp/b/Baroque.htm" title="Baroque">baroque</a> life. Elector <!--del_lnk--> Ferdinand Maria&rsquo;s consort Henriette Adelaide of Savoy invited numerous Italian architects and artists to the city, and built the <!--del_lnk--> Theatinerkirche and <!--del_lnk--> Nymphenburg palace on the occasion of the birth of their son and heir <!--del_lnk--> Maximilian II Emanuel, elector of Bavaria in 1662.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Munich was under the control of the <!--del_lnk--> Habsburg family for some years after Maximilian II Emanuel had made a pact with France in 1705 during the <a href="../../wp/w/War_of_the_Spanish_Succession.htm" title="War of the Spanish Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>. The occupation led to bloody uprisings against the Austrian imperial troops followed by a massacre while farmers were rioting (the &quot;Sendlinger Mordweihnacht&quot; or Murder Christmas of Sendling). The coronation of Max Emanuel&#39;s son elector Charles Albert as Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Karl VII in 1742 led to another Habsburg occupation. The city&#39;s first academic institution, the <!--del_lnk--> Bavarian Academy of Sciences, was founded in 1759 by <!--del_lnk--> Maximilian III Joseph, who abandoned his forefather&#39;s imperial ambitions and made peace. From 1789 onwards, when the old medieval fortification was demolished, the <!--del_lnk--> English Garden was laid out - it is one of the world&#39;s largest urban public parks. By that time, the city was growing very quickly and was one of the largest cities in continental Europe.<p><a id="Capital_of_the_Kingdom_of_Bavaria" name="Capital_of_the_Kingdom_of_Bavaria"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Capital of the Kingdom of Bavaria</span></h3>

The <!--del_lnk--> Technical University of Munich was founded in 1868. The city hosted Germany&#39;s first exhibition of <a href="../../wp/e/Electricity.htm" title="Electricity">electricity</a>, and in 1930 the first ever television was showcased at the city&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Deutsches Museum (founded in 1903) on the banks of the Isar.

Munich, and especially its suburb of <!--del_lnk--> Schwabing, became the domicile of many artists and writers. <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Mann wrote about this period &quot;Munich shone&quot;. <!--del_lnk--> Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider), a group of expressionist artists, was established in Munich in 1911. The city was a home for painters like <!--del_lnk--> Paul Klee, <!--del_lnk--> Wassily Kandinsky, <!--del_lnk--> Alexej von Jawlensky, <!--del_lnk--> Gabriele M&uuml;nter, <!--del_lnk--> Franz Marc, <!--del_lnk--> August Macke and <!--del_lnk--> Alfred Kubin and for numerous writers like <!--del_lnk--> Rainer Maria Rilke and <!--del_lnk--> Frank Wedekind. In 1846 Munich&#39;s population was about 100,000, and by 1901 this had risen to about 500,000.<p><a id="World_War_I_and_revolution" name="World_War_I_and_revolution"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">World War I and revolution</span></h3>
      <p>Following the outbreak of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> in 1914, life in Munich became very difficult, as the Allied blockade of Germany led to food and fuel shortages. During French air raids in 1916 three bombs fell on Munich. After World War I, the city was at the centre of much political unrest. In November 1918 on the eve of revolution, <!--del_lnk--> Ludwig III and his family fled the city. After the murder of the first republican <!--del_lnk--> premier of Bavaria <!--del_lnk--> Kurt Eisner in February 1919 by <!--del_lnk--> Anton Graf von Arco-Valley, a member of the right-wing <i><!--del_lnk--> Thule Gesellschaft</i> (Thule Society), the <!--del_lnk--> Munich Soviet Republic (M&uuml;nchner R&auml;terepublik) was proclaimed. After <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communist">Communists</a> had taken power, <a href="../../wp/v/Vladimir_Lenin.htm" title="Lenin">Lenin</a>, who had lived in Munich some years before, sent a congratulatory telegram, but the Soviet Republic was put down on <!--del_lnk--> May 3, <!--del_lnk--> 1919 by the <!--del_lnk--> Freikorps. After the R&auml;terepublik had been brutally put down and the republican government had been restored, Munich subsequently became a hotbed of right-wing politics, among which <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and the <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">Nazis</a> rose to prominence.<p><a id="Weimar_Republic_.2F_Nazi_Regime_and_World_War_II" name="Weimar_Republic_.2F_Nazi_Regime_and_World_War_II"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Weimar Republic / Nazi Regime and World War II</span></h3>
      <p>In 1923 Hitler and his supporters, who at that time were concentrated in Munich, staged the <!--del_lnk--> Beer Hall Putsch, an attempt to overthrow the <a href="../../wp/w/Weimar_Republic.htm" title="Weimar Republic">Weimar Republic</a> and seize power. The revolt failed, resulting in Hitler&#39;s arrest and the temporary crippling of the <!--del_lnk--> Nazi Party, which was virtually unknown outside Munich.<p>Munich remained a centre of cultural life during the Weimar period, as figures such as <!--del_lnk--> Lion Feuchtwanger, <!--del_lnk--> Bert Brecht and <!--del_lnk--> Oskar Maria Graf were active.<p>The city however would once again become a Nazi stronghold when they took power in Germany in 1933. Because of its importance to the rise of Nazism, the Nazis called it the <i>Hauptstadt der Bewegung</i> (&quot;capital of the movement&quot;). The <!--del_lnk--> NSDAP headquarters were in Munich and many <i>F&uuml;hrerbauten</i> (&quot;<i>F&uuml;hrer</i>-buildings&quot;) were built around the <!--del_lnk--> K&ouml;nigsplatz, some of which have survived to this day. During the <!--del_lnk--> Night of the Long Knives in 1934 Hitler eliminated potential political rivals.<p>In 1938, the <!--del_lnk--> Munich Agreement, <!--del_lnk--> Neville Chamberlain&#39;s famous act of <!--del_lnk--> appeasement to Hitler, was signed in the city by representatives of <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> and <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">Britain</a>. It ceded the mostly German-speaking regions of <!--del_lnk--> Czechoslovakia called <i><!--del_lnk--> Sudetenland</i> to Germany. One year later <!--del_lnk--> Georg Elser failed with his attempt to assassinate Hitler during his annual speech to commemorate the Beer Hall Putsch in the <!--del_lnk--> B&uuml;rgerbr&auml;ukeller in Munich.<p>Munich was the base of the <!--del_lnk--> White Rose (German: <i>Die Wei&szlig;e Rose</i>), a group of students that formed a <!--del_lnk--> resistance movement from June 1942 to February 1943. The core members were arrested and executed following a distribution of leaflets in <!--del_lnk--> Munich University by <!--del_lnk--> Hans and Sophie Scholl.<p>The city was very heavily damaged by allied bombing during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> - the city was hit by 71 air raids over a period of five years.<p><a id="Postwar_Munich" name="Postwar_Munich"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Postwar Munich</span></h3>
      <p>After <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">American</a> occupation in 1945, Munich was completely rebuilt following a meticulous and - by comparison to other war-ravaged German cities - rather conservative plan which preserved its pre-war street grid.<p>In 1957 Munich&#39;s population passed the 1 million mark.<p>Munich was the site of the <!--del_lnk--> 1972 Summer Olympics, during which <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israeli</a> athletes were assassinated by <!--del_lnk--> Palestinian <a href="../../wp/t/Terrorism.htm" title="Terrorism">terrorists</a> (see <!--del_lnk--> Munich massacre), when terrorist gunmen from the Palestinian &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Black September&quot; group took hostage members of the Israeli Olympic team. A rescue attempt by the <!--del_lnk--> West German government was unsuccessful and resulted in the deaths of the Israeli hostages, five of the terrorists, and one German police officer.<p>Several games of the <!--del_lnk--> 1974 World Cup were also held in the city, including the German triumph against the Netherlands in a legendary final. Several games of the <!--del_lnk--> 2006 World Cup were also held in Munich.<p>In 1992 <!--del_lnk--> Munich&rsquo;s new airport was inaugurated and the inauguration of the Neue Messe, the new exhibition centre on the site of the former airport of Riem, took place in 1998.<p>The current (2006) <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic <a href="../../wp/p/Pope.htm" title="Pope">Pope</a> <a href="../../wp/p/Pope_Benedict_XVI.htm" title="Pope Benedict XVI">Benedict XVI</a> (Joseph Ratzinger) was ordained a priest in the Archdiocese of Munich and Freising on <!--del_lnk--> June 29, <!--del_lnk--> 1951.

      <p>At the centre of the city is the <i><!--del_lnk--> Marienplatz</i> - a large open square named after the Mariens&auml;ule, a <!--del_lnk--> Marian column in its centre - with the Old and the New Town Hall. Its tower contains the <i><!--del_lnk--> Rathaus-Glockenspiel</i>, an ornate <a href="../../wp/c/Clock.htm" title="Clock">clock</a> with almost life-sized moving figures that show scenes from a medieval jousting tournament as well as a performance of the famous &quot;Sch&auml;fflertanz&quot; (roughly translated &quot;Barrel-makers&#39; dance&quot;). Three gates of the demolished medieval fortification have survived to this day - the <i>Isartor</i> in the east, the <i>Sendlinger Tor</i> in the south and the <i>Karlstor</i> in the west of the inner city.

      <p>The <i><!--del_lnk--> Peterskirche</i> close to Marienplatz is the oldest church of the inner city. It was first built during the <!--del_lnk--> romanesque period, and was the focus of the early monastic settlement in Munich before the city&#39;s official foundation in 1158. The oldest church within the city borders is <i>Heilig Kreuz</i> in Fr&ouml;ttmaning next to the Allianzarena, known for its <!--del_lnk--> Romanesque fresco. Nearby St. Peter the gothic hall-church <i>Heiliggeistkirche</i> (The Church of the Holy Ghost) was converted to baroque style from <!--del_lnk--> 1724 onwards and looks down upon the <!--del_lnk--> Viktualienmarkt, the most popular market of Munich.<p>The <i><!--del_lnk--> Frauenkirche</i> (&quot;Dom zu unserer Lieben Frau&quot; - Cathedral of <!--del_lnk--> Our Lady) is the most famous building in the city centre and serves as <!--del_lnk--> cathedral for the <!--del_lnk--> Archdiocese of Munich and Freising. It is particularly famous for the brass <a href="../../wp/o/Onion_dome.htm" title="Onion dome">onion domes</a> that top the twin towers. The domes were added in the 16th century, in a style that contrasted with the <!--del_lnk--> gothic style of the rest of the building. The original design called for pointed towers like Cologne Cathedral but they were never completed due to lack of money. At first glance the two towers appear to be the same height but in fact one is slightly taller than the other. Unlike most buildings in Munich&#39;s old town, the towers of the Frauenkirche (but not the church itself) survived WW2 intact, making them more than 500 years old. The Frauenkirche&#39;s towers (99 meters or 325 feet) are also the measurement for a new rule which limits the height of new buildings to the same height in the city. This rule was passed in November 2004 by the people of Munich in a referendum organized by Georg Kronawitter, a former SPD mayor, despite opposition from the political parties in the city&#39;s parliament (&quot;Stadtrat&quot;) who feared that it would harm the city&#39;s attractiveness to investors. Other gothic churches are the former graveyard chapels of St. Peter, the <i>Kreuzkirche</i>, and of the Frauenkirche, <i>St Salvator</i> but also the former <i>Augustinerkirche</i> which serves today as German Hunting and Fishing Museum.<div class="thumb tright">

Other baroque churches in the inner city which are worth a detour are the <i>B&uuml;rgersaalkirche</i>, the <i>Dreifaltigkeitskirche</i>, the <i>St. Anna Damenstiftskirche</i> and <i>St. Anna im Lehel</i>, the first <a href="../../wp/r/Rococo.htm" title="Rococo">rococo</a> church in Bavaria. The <i><!--del_lnk--> Asamkirche</i> was endowed and built by the Brothers <!--del_lnk--> Asam, pioneering artists of the rococo period. <i><!--del_lnk--> St Michael in Berg am Laim</i> was built almost simultaneously by <!--del_lnk--> Johann Michael Fischer and might be the most remarkable church out of the inner city.<p>With the 19th century <a href="../../wp/a/Architecture.htm" title="Architecture">architectural</a> <!--del_lnk--> revival styles many new catholic churches were constructed also in Munich.

Next door the modern <i><!--del_lnk--> Residenz Theatre</i> was erected in the building that had housed the Cuvilli&eacute;s Theatre before World War II. The <i><!--del_lnk--> G&auml;rtnerplatz Theatre</i> is a ballet and musical state theatre on the left bank of the Isar in the south of the inner city. The modern <i><!--del_lnk--> Gasteig</i> centre on the opposite bank houses the <!--del_lnk--> Munich Philharmonic Orchestra. The third orchestra in Munich with international importance is the <!--del_lnk--> Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra.

      <p>The city has several important <!--del_lnk--> art galleries, most of which can be found in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Kunstareal</i>, including the <i><!--del_lnk--> Alte Pinakothek,</i> the <i><!--del_lnk--> Neue Pinakothek,</i> and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Pinakothek der Moderne</i>. Alte Pinakothek&#39;s rather monolithic structure contains a treasure trove of the works of European masters between the 14th and 18th centuries. The collection reflects the eclectic tastes of the Wittelsbachs over four centuries, and is sorted by schools over two sprawling floors. Major displays include <a href="../../wp/a/Albrecht_D%25C3%25BCrer.htm" title="Albrecht D&uuml;rer">Albrecht D&uuml;rer</a>`s Christ-like Self-Portrait, his Four Apostles, <!--del_lnk--> Raffael&#39;s paintings <!--del_lnk--> The Canigiani Holy Family and <!--del_lnk--> Madonna Tempi as well as <a href="../../wp/p/Peter_Paul_Rubens.htm" title="Peter Paul Rubens">Peter Paul Rubens</a> two-storey-high Judgment Day. The gallery houses one of the world&#39;s most comprehensive Rubens collections. Before <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Blaue Reiter group of artists worked in Munich. Many of their works can now be seen at the <i><!--del_lnk--> Lenbachhaus</i>. An important collection of Greek and Roman art is held in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Glyptothek</i> and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Staatliche Antikensammlung</i> (State Antiquities Collection). Louis I managed to acquire such famous pieces as the <!--del_lnk--> Medusa Rondanini, the <!--del_lnk--> Barberini Faun and the figures from the <!--del_lnk--> Temple of Aphaea on <!--del_lnk--> Aegina for the Glyptothek. The <!--del_lnk--> Kunstareal will be further augmented by the completion of the <i>Egyptian Museum</i>.<p>The famous gothic <a href="../../wp/m/Morris_dance.htm" title="Morris dance">Morris dancers</a> of <!--del_lnk--> Erasmus Grasser are exhibited in the <i>Munich City Museum</i> in the old arsenal building. The <i><!--del_lnk--> State Museum of Ethnology</i> in Maximilianstrasse is the second largest collection in Germany of artifacts and objects from outside Europe, while the <i><!--del_lnk--> Bavarian National Museum</i> and the adjoining <i>State Archeological Collections</i> in Prinzregentenstrasse rank among Europe&#39;s major art and cultural history museums. The nearby <i><!--del_lnk--> Schackgalerie</i> is an important gallery of German 19th century paintings.<p><a id="Modern_Munich" name="Modern_Munich"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Modern Munich</span></h3>

      <p>Munich features a wide and diverse array of modern architecture, although strict height limitations for buildings have limited the construction of <!--del_lnk--> skyscrapers. Most high-rise buildings are clustered at the northern edge of Munich, like the <!--del_lnk--> Hypohaus, the <!--del_lnk--> Arabella High-Rise Building, the <!--del_lnk--> Highlight Towers, <!--del_lnk--> Uptown Munich and the <!--del_lnk--> BMW Headquarters next to the Olympic Park. Several other high-rise buildings are located near the city centre and on the <!--del_lnk--> Siemens campus in southern Munich. A landmark of modern Munich is also the architecture of the sport stadiums (see below).<p>In November 2004, a <!--del_lnk--> referendum was held to decide whether the construction of high-rise buildings in the inner city should be prohibited; as a result of the referendum, several building projects, among them the planned new office building of <!--del_lnk--> S&uuml;ddeutscher Verlag, had to be changed substantially or given up completely. However, <!--del_lnk--> as of 2006, due to the very close result of the referendum and due to the fact that the referendum&#39;s result was binding only for one year, there is an ongoing discussion in the city council on how to proceed with future building plans.<p><a id="The_parks" name="The_parks"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The parks</span></h3>

      <p>Munich is a green city with numerous parks. The <i><!--del_lnk--> Englischer Garten</i>, close to the city centre and covering an area of 3.7 km&sup2;, is one of the world&#39;s largest urban public parks, and contains a <!--del_lnk--> nudist area, jogging tracks and bridle-paths. Other large green spaces are the modern <i>Olympic Park</i>, and the parks of <!--del_lnk--> Nymphenburg Palace (with the <i>Botanical Garden</i> to the north), and <!--del_lnk--> Schleissheim Palace. The city&#39;s oldest park is the <i>Hofgarten</i>, near the Residenz, and dating back to the 16th century. Most known for the largest beergarden in the town is the former royal <i>Hirschgarten</i>, founded in 1780 for deer which still live there. The city&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> zoo is the <i><!--del_lnk--> Tierpark Hellabrunn</i> near the Flaucher Island in the Isar in the south of the city. Another notable park is Ostpark, located in Perlach-Rammersdorf area which houses the swiming area , <i><!--del_lnk--> Michealibad</i>, one of the largest in Munich.<p><a id="Hofbr.C3.A4uhaus_and_Oktoberfest" name="Hofbr.C3.A4uhaus_and_Oktoberfest"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Hofbr&auml;uhaus and Oktoberfest</span></h3>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Hofbr&auml;uhaus am Platzl is arguably the most well-known beer hall, located in the city centre. It also operates the second largest tent at the <!--del_lnk--> Oktoberfest, perhaps Munich&#39;s most famous attraction. A 2-week-long fair, it offers a wide selection of rollercoasters and several large beer tents (&quot;Bierzelte&quot;). The Oktoberfest was first held on <!--del_lnk--> October 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1810 in honour of the marriage of crown prince <!--del_lnk--> Ludwig to Princess Therese von Sachsen-Hildburghausen. The festivities were closed with a horse race and in the following years the horse races were continued and later developed into what is now known as the Oktoberfest. Despite its name, most of <!--del_lnk--> Oktoberfest occurs in September. It always finishes on the first Sunday in October unless the German national holiday on <!--del_lnk--> 3 October (&quot;Tag der deutschen Einheit&quot; - Day of German Unity) is a Monday or Tuesday - then the Oktoberfest still opens for these days.<p><a id="Others" name="Others"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Others</span></h3>

      <p>Residents of Munich typically enjoy a high quality of life. Mercer HR Consulting consistently rates the city among the top 10 cities with highest quality of life worldwide - a 2005 survey ranked Munich as 7th. Munich enjoys a thriving economy, driven by the information technology, biotechnology, and publishing sectors. Environmental pollution is comparatively low, although <!--del_lnk--> as of 2006 the city council is concerned about levels of <!--del_lnk--> particulate matter (PM), especially along the city&#39;s major thoroughfares. Since the enactment of <!--del_lnk--> EU legislation concerning the concentration of particulate in the air, environmental groups such as <!--del_lnk--> Greenpeace have staged large protest rallies to urge the city council and the State government to take a harder stance on pollution.<p>Public transport is very efficient, although delays on the <!--del_lnk--> S-Bahn (commuter train) often cause frustration during extreme winter weather. The crime rate is very low compared to other large German cities, such as <a href="../../wp/h/Hamburg.htm" title="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> or <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin.htm" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>. This high quality of life and safety has caused the city to be nicknamed &quot;Toytown&quot; amongst some of the English-speaking residents. German inhabitants call it &ldquo;Millionendorf&rdquo;, which means &ldquo;village of a million people&rdquo;. Some also refer to it as &quot;Weltstadt mit Herz&quot; which was the official city slogan for some years and means &quot;world city with a heart&quot;.<p>The <i>Viktualienmarkt</i> is Munich&#39;s most popular market for fresh food and delicatessen. A very old feature of Munich&#39;s Fasching (carnival) is the dance of the Marktfrauen (market women) of the Viktualienmarkt in comical costumes.<p>The <i>Auer Dult</i> is held three times a year on the square around Mariahilf church and is one of Munich&#39;s oldest markets, well known for its jumble sale and antiques. Almost 300 stands offer rare books and old prints, haberdashery goods, natural hair and skin care and a large selection of china and cooking equipment. Many authentic traditional Bavarian garments, like <i>lederhosen</i> or <i>dirndl</i>, can be found there. For amusement the Auer Dult offers horseback riding, the puppet show, the merry-go-rounds, bumper cars and shooting galleries.<p>Three weeks before Christmas the <i>Christkindlmarkt</i> at Marienplatz and other squares in the city sells Christmas goods.<p>Caf&eacute; culture is strong in Munich, especially during the summer. There are many restaurants accommodating all preferences of cuisine. And possibly the most important free time activity during the summer: the <i>beer gardens</i>. There are around 20 major beer gardens, with four of the most famous and popular being located in the <!--del_lnk--> Englischer Garten and the largest one in the Hirschgarten.<p><a id="Nightlife_in_Munich" name="Nightlife_in_Munich"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Nightlife in Munich</span></h3>

A <i>Steckerlfisch</i> is a local fish like trout or whitefish speared on a wooden stick, grilled and smoked on charcoal, the typical feature is the crispy skin. Another classic is <i>A Hoibs <!--del_lnk--> Hendl</i> (half a grilled chicken). A <i>Ma&szlig;</i> is a litre of blond beer, a <i>Radler</i> consists of beer and half of lemonade.<p>Munich is famous for its breweries and the <i>Wei&szlig;bier</i> (or <i>Weizenbier</i>, wheat beer) is a speciality from Bavaria. <i>Helles</i> with its translucent gold colour is the most popular Munich beer today, although it&rsquo;s not very old (only introduced in 1895). Helles and Pils have almost ousted the <i>Munich Dark Beer</i>, which gets its dark colour from burnt malt, the most popular beer in Munich within the 19th century. <i>Starkbier</i> is the strongest Munich beers, containing 6-9 percent alcohol. It is dark amber and has a heavy malty taste.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Franz Josef Strauss International Airport (<!--del_lnk--> IATA: MUC, <!--del_lnk--> ICAO: EDDM) is Munich&#39;s main airport, some 30 km to the north east of the city centre. The airport can be reached by Schnellbahn train lines <b>S1</b> from the east and <b>S8</b> from the west part of the city. However, from the Hauptbahnhof (Main railway station), the journey takes 40-45 minutes. A <!--del_lnk--> magnetic levitation train (called <!--del_lnk--> Transrapid) which will run at speeds of up to 400km/h from the central station to the airport is under consideration. It would reduce the travel time from the Hauptbahnhof to only 10 minutes. The airport began operations in 1992, replacing the former main airport, the <!--del_lnk--> Munich-Riem airport (active 1939-1992).<p>Also, the Bavarian state government has announced plans to expand the Oberpfaffenhofen Air Station, located west of Munich, for commercial use. These plans are opposed by many residents of the Oberpfaffenhofen area. It seems these plans have now been put aside.<p><a id="Public_transportation" name="Public_transportation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Public transportation</span></h3>
      <p>For its population, Munich has one of the most comprehensive systems in the world, incorporating <!--del_lnk--> subways, <!--del_lnk--> suburban trains, trams and buses. The system is supervised by the <!--del_lnk--> Munich Transport and Tariff Association (M&uuml;nchner Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund GmbH).<p>The main train station is Munich <!--del_lnk--> Hauptbahnhof (Central Station), in the city centre, and there are two smaller main line stations at <!--del_lnk--> Pasing, in the west of the city, and <!--del_lnk--> Munich Ostbahnhof (East Station) in the east. All three are connected to the public transport system and serve as transportation hubs.<p><!--del_lnk--> ICE highspeed trains stop at Munich-Pasing and Munich Central only. <!--del_lnk--> InterCity and <!--del_lnk--> EuroCity trains with destinations East of Munich also stop at Munich East. Since <!--del_lnk--> 28 May <!--del_lnk--> 2006 Munich is connected to <!--del_lnk--> Nuremberg via <!--del_lnk--> Ingolstadt by a 300 km/h ICE high speed railway line.<p><a id="Individual_transportation" name="Individual_transportation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Individual transportation</span></h3>

      <p>The <i>Olympic Park</i> with its stadium was built for the <!--del_lnk--> Munich 1972 Summer Olympics. The Olympic buildings are famous for their design, which was inspired by dew-covered cobwebs. Visitors can get a great panoramic view of Munich and the Alps from the top of the Olympic Tower (<i><!--del_lnk--> Olympiaturm</i>), which is also used as a radio and TV broadcasting tower.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> 2006 World Cup did not take place in the traditional <i><!--del_lnk--> Olympic Stadium</i>, but in Munich&#39;s new football stadium, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Allianz Arena</i>, located in the northern suburb of <!--del_lnk--> Fr&ouml;ttmanning. However, the Olympic park was a public viewing area and nearly all World Cup matches were played on a massive television screen from inside Olympic Stadium.<p><a id="Colleges_and_universities" name="Colleges_and_universities"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Colleges and universities</span></h2>
      <p>Munich is a leading location for science and research with a long list of Nobel Prize winners from <!--del_lnk--> Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen in <!--del_lnk--> 1901 to <!--del_lnk--> Theodor H&auml;nsch in <!--del_lnk--> 2005. Both the universities of the Bavarian metropolis, the Ludwig Maximilian University (LMU) and the Technical University (TU), were found to be worthy of the title of elite university by the selection committee, which consisted of academics and members of the Ministries of Education and Research of the Federation and the German states (L&auml;nder). Only Munich&#39;s two universities and the Technical University of Karlsruhe have been awarded the prestigious title of elite university of Germany and millions of euro in funding.<ul>
