      <p><a href="../../wp/a/Antigua_and_Barbuda.htm" title="Antigua and Barbuda">Antigua and Barbuda</a> is a Caribbean nation in the <!--del_lnk--> Lesser Antilles island chain. The country is a second home for many of the pan-Caribbean genres of <!--del_lnk--> popular music, and has produced stars in <!--del_lnk--> calypso, <!--del_lnk--> soca, <!--del_lnk--> steeldrum, <!--del_lnk--> zouk and <a href="../../wp/r/Reggae.htm" title="Reggae">reggae</a>. Of these, steeldrum and calypso are the most integral parts of modern Antiguan popular music; both styles are imported from the <a href="../../wp/m/Music_of_Trinidad_and_Tobago.htm" title="Music of Trinidad and Tobago">music of Trinidad and Tobago</a>.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> population of Antigua and Barbuda is mostly descended from West Africans brought to the Caribbean as slaves. Thus, the <b>music of Antigua and Barbuda</b> is largely African in character, and has only felt a limited influence from European styles.<p>Little to no musical research has been undertaken on Antigua and Barbuda. As a result, much knowledge on the topic derives from novels, essays and other secondary sources.<p>

</script><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p>Documented music in Antigua and Barbuda began only with the discovery of Antigua, then populated by <!--del_lnk--> Arawak and <!--del_lnk--> Caribs, by <a href="../../wp/c/Christopher_Columbus.htm" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> in 1493. The islands&#39; early music, however, remains little studied. In the 1780s, documentation exists for African workers participating in outdoor dances accompanied by the <i><!--del_lnk--> banjar</i> (later <i>bangoe</i>, perhaps related to the <!--del_lnk--> banjo) and <i><!--del_lnk--> toombah</i> (later <i>tum tum</i>), a drum decorated with shell and tin jingles. By the 1840s, sophisticated subscription <!--del_lnk--> balls were common, held biweekly with European-derived <!--del_lnk--> quadrilles accompanied by <!--del_lnk--> fiddle, <!--del_lnk--> tambourine and <!--del_lnk--> triangle.<p>Colonial era churches and missionary activity displaced and disrupted the music of African slaves, who adopted elements of European-derived religious music. The <!--del_lnk--> brass bands of the <!--del_lnk--> Salvation Army are an important example. In the mid- to late 19th century, a number of Portuguese indentured workers came to Antigua, bringing with them <!--del_lnk--> their styles of music. When most of the Portuguese left in the 1880s, <!--del_lnk--> Lebanese music was brought to the island by immigrants from that country.<p><a id="Folk_music" name="Folk_music"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Folk music</span></h2>
      <p>During the period of French colonial rule, African slaves were prohibited from celebrating in <!--del_lnk--> Carnival; they continued to do so, secretly, at home. There, an Afro-Caribbean style of <!--del_lnk--> percussion, dance and song called <!--del_lnk--> benna developed. Later, Antiguan and Barbudan folk music became more dominated by Trinidadian <!--del_lnk--> calypso and <!--del_lnk--> steelpan.<p>Most forms of modern Antiguan and Barbudan music are not indigenous to the islands, and were imported from France, the United Kingdom, United States, Jamaica and Trinidad. Colonial dance styles like the <!--del_lnk--> highland fling and the <!--del_lnk--> quadrille remain popular in Africanized form. The loss of Antiguan traditions can be ascribed to the lack of a French colonial past (French islands of the Lesser Antilles retain much African-derived music and dance), the influence of the powerful <!--del_lnk--> Codrington family, a relatively unified African ethnic identity, the lack of African immigration after the peak of slavery importation, the British military presence at <!--del_lnk--> Shirley Heights and a modern history of unstable economy and government.<p><a id="Old_Time_Christmas_Festival" name="Old_Time_Christmas_Festival"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Old Time Christmas Festival</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Old Time Christmas Festival was a culturally significant celebration, replaced in 1957 by a Trinidadian-inspired Carnival. The Antiguan Christmas Festival included several elements that have been adopted into the modern Carnival.<p>Christmas Festival traditions include both music and dance, especially related to <!--del_lnk--> masquerades and iron bands. The <!--del_lnk--> highland fling is a common Christmas Festival dance, also played in the modern Carnival, performed by people wearing Scottish <!--del_lnk--> kilts, masks made of wire and bearing whips of cowhide. Dancers wearing banana leaves and animal horns took part in the <!--del_lnk--> John Bull, while carolers paraded with long poles covered in <!--del_lnk--> lanterns, called <i>carol trees</i>, singing with accompaniment by the <!--del_lnk--> concertina. Stilt dancers in robes, called the <i><!--del_lnk--> Moko Jumbie</i>, <i>Jumpa-Ben</i> or <i>Long Ghosts</i>, were also common, and were accompanied by kettle and bass drums, fife, triangle (<i>cling-a-ching</i>) and the <!--del_lnk--> boompipe, made from a plumbing joint one meter long.<p><a id="Benna" name="Benna"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Benna</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Benna (or <i>bennah</i>) is an uptempo Antiguan folk song that was introduced following the prohibition of slavery. Songs usually focused on scandalous and bawdy rumors and gossip, and were in a <!--del_lnk--> call-and-response form with a leader and an audience. Benna&#39;s popularity and similarity to calypso helped make the island receptive to that genre&#39;s introduction. The modern performer <!--del_lnk--> Short Shirt has attempted to revive the benna in modern years, with his 1977 album <i>Harambee</i> an influential work that began updating benna with social and political awareness.<p>By the beginning of the <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a>, it had become a method of folk communication, disseminating news and reports from across the island. In the <!--del_lnk--> 1940s and <!--del_lnk--> 50s, an improvisational benna singer named <!--del_lnk--> John &quot;Quarkoo&quot; Thomas sang up-to-date stories on legal scandals, and the sexual affairs of the upper-class. He was eventually imprisoned because of the lyrics to &quot;Cocoatea&quot;, which was about the daughter of a respected citizen, and her secret pregnancy while in a <!--del_lnk--> convent.<p><a id="Popular_music" name="Popular_music"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Popular music</span></h2>
      <p>In other popular genres of music Antigua is best known for oldest and most successful soca band the Burning Flames, who have claimed the road march title for many years, most recently 2005. Another well-known Antiguan musician was <!--del_lnk--> Patrick &quot;Johnny&quot; Gomes, who worked for, among many others, the calypso giant <!--del_lnk--> Mighty Sparrow. The most famous indigenous musician in Antigua and Barbuda may be <!--del_lnk--> Oscar Mason, whose son, <!--del_lnk--> O&#39;Neill is also a noted <!--del_lnk--> trombonist. The <!--del_lnk--> Antigua Community Players have been active for more than 52 years, performing a variety of musical productions in many styles, including the Antiguan folk song, <i>benna</i>.<p>Other famous indigenous musicians from Antigua/Barbuda are jazz recording artists <!--del_lnk--> Roland Prince (guitarist), <!--del_lnk--> Courtney Winter (saxophonist) and <!--del_lnk--> Wendell Richardson, a former guitarist of <!--del_lnk--> Osibisa. Country recording artists <!--del_lnk--> Billy Rose and <!--del_lnk--> Wayne Daniel were also born on the island of Antigua. Additionally, <!--del_lnk--> Basil Hill, owner of <!--del_lnk--> King Midas Records in New York built a large international nightclub called the Atmosphere in 1978, creating a direct outlet for Antigua and Barbudan singers and bands. Elements of non-Antiguan and Barbudan music have continued to be imported to the islands in the latter 20th century, including the electronic <!--del_lnk--> gospel music of the American Baptist church, and the Afro-Jamaican drumming of <!--del_lnk--> Rastafarian music.<p><a id="Carnival" name="Carnival"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Carnival</span></h3>
      <p><i>See full article: <b><!--del_lnk--> Antigua Carnival</b></i><p>The Antiguan <!--del_lnk--> Carnival is a celebration of music and dance held annually from the end of July to the first Tuesday in August. The most important day is that of the <i>j&#39;ouvert</i> (or <i>juv&eacute;</i>), in which brass and steel bands perform for much of the island&#39;s population. Barbuda&#39;s Carnival in June, and is known as <!--del_lnk--> Caribana. The Antiguan and Barbudan Carnivals replaced the <!--del_lnk--> Old Time Christmas Festival in 1957, with hopes of inspiring <!--del_lnk--> tourism in Antigua and Barbuda. Some elements of the Christmas Festival remain in the modern Carnival celebrations, which are otherwise largely based on the Trinidadian Carnival. The author Frank Manning has argued that this change, from indigenous traditions to tourist-oriented elements, has reduced Antiguans to &quot;positions as service personnel and &#39;mimic men&#39;, robbing the culture of its natural integrity and cultural history&quot;<p><a id="Steelpan" name="Steelpan"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Steelpan</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> steelpan comes in many different forms, and put together is called a <i>steel orchestra</i>. Steel bands traditionally are made up of old pieces of metal example old irons, tire rims, steel pipes etc. Antigua&#39;s steel orchestras and iron bands can be found in churches and in many villages, and have been popular since their introduction. Every Carnival there is a competition to dub the best band of the island. Antigua&#39;s largest and oldest steel orchestra that still competes is the <!--del_lnk--> Hell&#39;s Gate steel orchestra. The <!--del_lnk--> Brute Force Steel Band was the first Antiguan steelpan band to record an album.<p><a id="Calypso" name="Calypso"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Calypso</span></h3>
      <p>Calypso was invented in <!--del_lnk--> Trinidad, and was used by the poor as a platform for social and political commentary, using complex <!--del_lnk--> metaphors and <a href="../../wp/f/Folklore.htm" title="Folklore">folkloric</a> references to obscure their meaning to outsiders. Later, beginning in the <!--del_lnk--> 1960s, a popularized kind of calypso was developed for use in <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">tourist</a> hotels.<p>The first hotel calypsonians were <!--del_lnk--> Black Shirt, <!--del_lnk--> Skeetch and <!--del_lnk--> Dadian, who were accompanied by a <!--del_lnk--> string ensemble of two <a href="../../wp/g/Guitar.htm" title="Guitar">guitars</a> and a <!--del_lnk--> bass guitar (created out of an oil drum). The <!--del_lnk--> Antigua Carnival, and the <!--del_lnk--> Antiguan Calypso King competition, began in <!--del_lnk--> 1957; the King that year was <!--del_lnk--> Styler. This era also saw a growth in patriotic calypsos, focused on an emerging sense of victorious nationalism in the wake of growing autonomy.<p>By the middle of the <!--del_lnk--> 1960s, two rival calypsonians dominated the Antiguan scene, <!--del_lnk--> Zemaki and <!--del_lnk--> Lord Canary. Their conflict was perpetuated as the <!--del_lnk--> King Short Shirt and <!--del_lnk--> Swallow rivalry during the <!--del_lnk--> 1970s and <!--del_lnk--> 1980s. In the middle of the 1980s, the <!--del_lnk--> Burning Flames emerged, winning the road march with &quot;Styley Tight&quot; in <!--del_lnk--> 1985. They achieved pan-Caribbean acclaim.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Antigua_and_Barbuda&quot;</div>
