      <p><b>M&aacute;el Coluim mac Cin&aacute;eda</b> (<!--del_lnk--> anglicised <b>Malcolm II</b>) (c. 980 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> 25 November <!--del_lnk--> 1034) was <!--del_lnk--> King of Scots from 1005 until his death. He was a son of <!--del_lnk--> Cin&aacute;ed mac Ma&iacute;l Coluim; the <!--del_lnk--> Prophecy of Berch&aacute;n says that his mother was a woman of <!--del_lnk--> Leinster and refers to him as <i>forranach</i> (the Destroyer or Avenger).<p>To the <!--del_lnk--> Irish annals which recorded his death, M&aacute;el Coluim was <i>ard r&iacute; Alban</i>, <!--del_lnk--> High King of Scotland. In the same way that <!--del_lnk--> Brian B&oacute;ruma, <!--del_lnk--> High King of Ireland, was very far from being the only king in <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, M&aacute;el Coluim was one of several kings within the geographical boundaries of modern <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>. His fellow kings included the <!--del_lnk--> king of Strathclyde, who ruled much of the south-west, various <!--del_lnk--> Norse-Gael kings of the western coasts and the <a href="../../wp/h/Hebrides.htm" title="Hebrides">Hebrides</a> and, nearest and most dangerous rivals, the Kings or <!--del_lnk--> Mormaers of Moray. To the south, in the <!--del_lnk--> kingdom of England, the Earls of <!--del_lnk--> Bernicia and <!--del_lnk--> Northumbria, whose predecessors as <!--del_lnk--> kings of Northumbria had once ruled most of southern Scotland, still controlled large parts of the south-east.<p>

      <p>It is unclear if M&aacute;el Coluim first appears in 997, when &quot;Cin&aacute;ed mac Ma&iacute;l Coluim&quot; is credited with killing <!--del_lnk--> Causant&iacute;n mac Cuil&eacute;n. Whether M&aacute;el Coluim killed Causant&iacute;n or not, there is no doubt that in 1005 he killed Causant&iacute;n&#39;s successor <!--del_lnk--> Cin&aacute;ed mac Duib in battle at <!--del_lnk--> Monzievaird in <!--del_lnk--> Strathearn.<p><!--del_lnk--> John of Fordun writes that M&aacute;el Coluim defeated a <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norwegian</a> army &quot;in almost the first days after his coronation&quot;, but this is not reported elsewhere. Fordun says that the <!--del_lnk--> Bishopric of Mortlach (later moved to <a href="../../wp/a/Aberdeen.htm" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>) was founded in thanks for this victory over the Norwegians, but this appears to be a claim without foundation.<p><a id="Bernicia" name="Bernicia"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Bernicia</span></h2>
      <p>The first reliable report of M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s reign is of an invasion of Bernicia, perhaps the customary <i>crech r&iacute;g</i> (literally royal prey, a raid by a new king made to demonstrate prowess in war), which involved a siege of <a href="../../wp/d/Durham.htm" title="Durham">Durham</a>. This appears to have resulted in a heavy defeat, by the Northumbrians led by <!--del_lnk--> Uchtred, later <!--del_lnk--> Earl of Bernicia, which is reported by the <!--del_lnk--> Annals of Ulster.<p>A second war in Bernicia, probably in 1018, was more successful. The <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Carham, by the <!--del_lnk--> River Tweed, was a victory for the Scots led by M&aacute;el Coluim and the men of Strathclyde led by <!--del_lnk--> E&oacute;gan (Owen the Bald). By this time Earl Uchtred may have been dead, and <!--del_lnk--> Eir&iacute;kr H&aacute;konarson was appointed Earl of Northumbria by his brother-in-law <a href="../../wp/c/Canute_the_Great.htm" title="Canute the Great">Canute</a>, although his authority seems to have been limited to the south, the former kingdom of <!--del_lnk--> Deira, and he took no action against the Scots so far as is known. The work <i>De obsessione Dunelmi</i> (<i>The siege of Durham</i>, associated with <!--del_lnk--> Symeon of Durham) claims that Uchtred&#39;s brother <!--del_lnk--> Eadwulf Cudel surrendered <!--del_lnk--> Lothian to M&aacute;el Coluim, presumably in the aftermath of the defeat at Carham. This is likely to have been the lands between <!--del_lnk--> Dunbar and the Tweed as other parts of Lothian had been under Scots control before this time. It has been suggested that Canute received tribute from the Scots for Lothian, but as he had likely received none from the Bernician Earls this is not very probable.<p><a id="Canute" name="Canute"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Canute</span></h2>
      <p>Canute, reports the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, led an army into Scotland on his return from <!--del_lnk--> pilgrimage to <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a>. The Chronicle dates this to 1031, but there are reasons to suppose that it should be dated to 1027. <!--del_lnk--> Burgundian chronicler <!--del_lnk--> Rodulfus Glaber recounts the expedition soon afterwards, describing M&aacute;el Coluim as &quot;powerful in resources and arms ... very Christian in faith and deed.&quot; Ralph claims that peace was made between M&aacute;el Coluim and Canute through the intervention of <!--del_lnk--> Richard, <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Normandy, brother of <!--del_lnk--> Queen Emma. Richard died in about 1027 and Rodulfus wrote close in time to the events.<p>It has been suggested that the root of the quarrel between Canute and M&aacute;el Coluim lies in Canute&#39;s pilgrimage to Rome, and the coronation of <!--del_lnk--> Holy Roman Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Conrad II, where Canute and <!--del_lnk--> Rudolph, <!--del_lnk--> King of Burgundy had the place of honour. If M&aacute;el Coluim were present, and the repeated mentions of his piety in the annals make it quite possible that he made a pilgrimage to Rome, as did <a href="../../wp/m/Macbeth_of_Scotland.htm" title="Macbeth of Scotland">Mac Bethad mac Findl&aacute;ich</a> in later times, then the coronation would have allowed M&aacute;el Coluim to publicly snub Canute&#39;s claims to overlordship.<p>Canute obtained rather less than previous English kings, a promise of peace and friendship rather than the promise of aid on land and sea than <!--del_lnk--> Edgar and others had obtained. The sources say that M&aacute;el Coluim was accompanied by one or two other kings, certainly Mac Bethad, and perhaps <!--del_lnk--> Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, King of the <a href="../../wp/i/Isle_of_Man.htm" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Galloway. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle remarks of the submission &quot;but he [M&aacute;el Coluim] adhered to that for only a little while&quot;. Canute was soon occupied in <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a> against Olaf Haraldsson and appears to have had no further involvement with Scotland.<p><a id="Orkney_and_Moray" name="Orkney_and_Moray"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Orkney and Moray</span></h2>
      <p>A daughter of M&aacute;el Coluim, whose name is not known, married <!--del_lnk--> Sigurd Hlodvisson, <!--del_lnk--> Earl of Orkney. Their son <!--del_lnk--> Thorfinn Sigurdsson was said to be five years old when Sigurd was killed on <!--del_lnk--> 23 April <!--del_lnk--> 1014 in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Clontarf. The <i><!--del_lnk--> Orkneyinga Saga</i> says that Thorfinn was raised at M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s court and was given the <!--del_lnk--> Mormaerdom of Caithness by his grandfather. Thorfinn, says the <i><!--del_lnk--> Heimskringla</i>, was the ally of the king of Scots, and counted on M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s support to resist the &quot;tyranny&quot; of King <!--del_lnk--> Olaf Haraldsson of Norway. The chronology of Thorfinn&#39;s life is problematic, and he may have had a share in the Earldom of Orkney while still a child, if he was indeed only five in 1014. Whatever the exact chronology, before M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s death a client of the king of Scots was in control of Caithness and Orkney, although, as with all such relationships, it is unlikely to have lasted beyond his death.<p>If M&aacute;el Coluim exercised control over Moray, which is far from being generally accepted, then the annals record a number of events pointing to a struggle for power in the north. In 1020, Mac Bethad&#39;s father <!--del_lnk--> Findl&aacute;ech mac Ruaidr&iacute; was killed by the sons of his brother M&aacute;el Brigte. It seems that <!--del_lnk--> M&aacute;el Coluim mac M&aacute;il Brigti took control of Moray, for his death is reported in 1029.<p>It should be said that whatever the Irish annals say, English and Scandinavian writers appear to seen Mac Bethad as the rightful king of Moray, witness their descriptions of the meeting with Canute in 1027, before the death of M&aacute;el Coluim mac M&aacute;il Brigti. M&aacute;el Coluim was followed as king or mormaer by his brother <!--del_lnk--> Gille Coemg&aacute;in, husband of <!--del_lnk--> Gruoch, a granddaughter of <!--del_lnk--> Cin&aacute;ed mac Duib. It has been supposed that Mac Bethad was responsible for the killing of Gille Coemg&aacute;in in 1032, but if Mac Bethad had a cause for feud in the killing of his father in 1020, M&aacute;el Coluim too had reason to see Gille Coemg&aacute;in dead. Not only had Gille Coemg&aacute;in&#39;s ancestors killed many of M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s kin, but Gille Coemg&aacute;in and his son <!--del_lnk--> Lulach might be rivals for the throne. M&aacute;el Coluim had no sons, or no living sons, and the threat to his plans for the succession was obvious. The following year another man who might some day be king, Gruoch&#39;s brother or nephew, was killed by M&aacute;el Coluim.<p><a id="Strathclyde_and_the_succession" name="Strathclyde_and_the_succession"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Strathclyde and the succession</span></h2>
      <p>It has traditionally been supposed that King E&oacute;gan of Strathclyde died at the Battle of Carham and that the kingdom passed into the hands of the Scots afterwards. This rests on some very weak evidence. It is far from certain that E&oacute;gan died at Carham, and it is reasonable certain that there were kings of Strathclyde as late as the 1054, when <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_the_Confessor.htm" title="Edward the Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a> sent <!--del_lnk--> Earl Siward to install &quot;<!--del_lnk--> M&aacute;el Coluim son of the king of the Cumbrians&quot;. The confusion is old, probably inspired by <!--del_lnk--> William of Malmesbury and embellished by John of Fordun, but there is no firm evidence that the kingdom of Strathclyde was a part of the kingdom of the Scots, rather than a loosely subjected kingdom, before the time of M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s great-grandson <a href="../../wp/m/Malcolm_III_of_Scotland.htm" title="Malcolm III of Scotland">M&aacute;el Coluim mac Donnchada</a>.<p>As has been said, by the 1030s M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s sons, if he had had any, were dead. The only evidence that he did have a son or sons is in Ralph Glaber&#39;s chronicle where Canute is said to have stood as godfather to a son of M&aacute;el Coluim. His grandson Thorfinn would have been unlikely to accepted as king by the Scots, and he chose the sons of his other daughter, <!--del_lnk--> Beth&oacute;c, who was married to <!--del_lnk--> Cr&iacute;n&aacute;n, <!--del_lnk--> lay abbot of <!--del_lnk--> Dunkeld, and perhaps <!--del_lnk--> Mormaer of Atholl. It may be no more than coincidence, but in 1027 the Irish annals had reported the burning of Dunkeld, although no mention is made of the circumstances. M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s chosen heir, and the first and last <i>t&aacute;naise r&iacute;g</i> certainly known in Scotland, was <!--del_lnk--> Donnchad mac Cr&iacute;n&aacute;in.<p>It is possible that a third daughter of M&aacute;el Coluim married Findl&aacute;ech mac Ruaidr&iacute; and that Mac Bethad was thus his grandson, but this rests on relatively weak evidence.<p><a id="Death_and_posterity" name="Death_and_posterity"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Death and posterity</span></h2>
      <p>M&aacute;el Coluim died in 1034, <!--del_lnk--> Marianus Scotus giving the date as <!--del_lnk--> 25 November <!--del_lnk--> 1034. The king lists say that he died at <!--del_lnk--> Glamis, variously describing him as a &quot;most glorious&quot; or &quot;most victorious&quot; king. The Annals of Tigernach report that &quot;M&aacute;el Coluim mac Cin&aacute;eda, king of Scotland, the honour of all the west of Europe, died.&quot; The Prophecy of Berch&aacute;n, perhaps the inpiration for John of Fordun and <!--del_lnk--> Andrew of Wyntoun&#39;s accounts where M&aacute;el Coluim is killed fighting bandits, says that he died by violence, fighting &quot;the parricides&quot;, suggested to be the sons of M&aacute;el Brigte of Moray.<p>Perhaps the most notable feature of M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s death is the account of Marianus, matched by the silence of the Irish annals, which tells us that Donnchad became king and ruled for five years and nine months. Given that his death in 1040 is described as being &quot;at an immature age&quot; in the Annals of Tigernach, he must have been a young man in 1034. The absence of any opposition suggests that M&aacute;el Coluim had dealt thoroughly with any likely opposition in his own lifetime.<p>On the question of M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s putative pilgrimage, pilgrimages to Rome, or other long-distance journeys, were far from unusual. Thorfinn Sigurdsson, Canute and Mac Bethad have already been mentioned. <!--del_lnk--> Rognvald Kali Kolsson is known to have gone crusading in the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> in the 12th century. Nearer in time, <!--del_lnk--> Domnall mac E&oacute;gain of Strathclyde died on pilgrimage to Rome in 975 as did M&aacute;el Ruanaid u&aacute; M&aacute;ele Doraid, King of the <!--del_lnk--> Cen&eacute;l Conaill, in 1025.<p>Not a great deal is known of M&aacute;el Coluim&#39;s activities beyond the wars and killings. The <!--del_lnk--> Book of Deer records that M&aacute;el Coluim &quot;gave a king&#39;s dues in Biffie and in Pett Meic-Gobraig, and two davochs&quot; to the monastery of <!--del_lnk--> Old Deer. As has been said, he was probably not the founder of the Bishopric of Mortlach-Aberdeen. John of Fordun has a peculiar tale to tell, related to the supposed &quot;Laws of Malcom MacKenneth&quot;, saying that M&aacute;el Coluim gave away all of Scotland, except for the Moot Hill at <!--del_lnk--> Scone, which is unlikely to have the least basis in fact.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_II_of_Scotland&quot;</div>
