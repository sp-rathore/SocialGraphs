      <p>Under the <!--del_lnk--> caste system of colonial <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin America</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>, the term originally applied only to the children resulting from the union of one <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="European">European</a> and one <!--del_lnk--> Amerindian parent, or the children of two mestizo parents. During this era a myriad of other terms (<!--del_lnk--> castizo, cuarter&oacute;n de indio, <!--del_lnk--> cholo, etc.) were in use to denote other individuals of European/Amerindian ancestry in ratios smaller or greater than the 50:50 of mestizos. Today, mestizo refers to all people with discernible amounts of both European and Amerindian ancestry.<p>Mestizos are thought to make up the majority of the populations of <a href="../../wp/c/Chile.htm" title="Chile">Chile</a><sup>1</sup> (65%), <a href="../../wp/c/Colombia.htm" title="Colombia">Colombia</a> (58%), <a href="../../wp/e/Ecuador.htm" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a> (65%), <a href="../../wp/e/El_Salvador.htm" title="El Salvador">El Salvador</a> (90%), <a href="../../wp/h/Honduras.htm" title="Honduras">Honduras</a><sup>2</sup> (90%), <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a><sup>2</sup> (60%), <a href="../../wp/n/Nicaragua.htm" title="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a> (69%), <a href="../../wp/p/Panama.htm" title="Panama">Panama</a><sup>2</sup> (70%), <a href="../../wp/p/Paraguay.htm" title="Paraguay">Paraguay</a> (95%) and <a href="../../wp/v/Venezuela.htm" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> (67%).<p>In other American countries where mestizos do not constitute a majority, they nonetheless represent a significant portion of their populations; <a href="../../wp/a/Argentina.htm" title="Argentina">Argentina</a><sup>3</sup> (approx. 13%), <a href="../../wp/b/Belize.htm" title="Belize">Belize</a> (44%), <a href="../../wp/b/Bolivia.htm" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a> (30%), <a href="../../wp/p/Peru.htm" title="Peru">Peru</a> (37%), and <a href="../../wp/u/Uruguay.htm" title="Uruguay">Uruguay</a><sup>3</sup> (8%).

      <p>Hispanic nations of the Caribbean are a peculiar case with respect to ancestry. At least in <a href="../../wp/p/Puerto_Rico.htm" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a> - where broad <!--del_lnk--> U.S. census categories have disallowed the mixed ancestry of most Puerto Ricans to be officially acknowledged - the population has been said to comprise a White majority, an extinct Amerindian population, persons of mixed ancestry, Africans and a small Asian minority. However, recent genetic research has revealed matrilineal Native American ancestry in roughly 61% of the population and patrilineal European ancestry in 75%, thus technically deeming most to be mestizos. An overwhelming majority of Puerto Ricans, however, simply define themselves as &quot;Puerto Rican&quot;, placing greater importance to national-ethnic identity rather than racial categorization.<p>In Mexico and Peru, mestizo has also come to be used as a cultural label. In a cultural context, people are considered <i>ind&iacute;gena</i> (Amerindian) if they live following their traditional ways of life (clothing, customs and indigenous languages), otherwise they are also deemed <i>mestizo</i>, or what in <!--del_lnk--> Central America would be called a <i><!--del_lnk--> ladino</i>. Additionally in the Mexican case, most of the <!--del_lnk--> Afro-Mexican minority would also simply identify as <i>mestizo</i> by virtue of their cultural traits, rather than as black, <!--del_lnk--> mulatto or <!--del_lnk--> zambo by their ancestry. These cultural implications of &quot;mestizo&quot; can result in an overcount of the population - in the Mexican case, as high as 80% according to some sources - which would otherwise be mestizo on a racial level. Also, race is not recorded by the Mexican nor Peruvian census, so that any calculations performed by government bodies or independent agencies are always estimates.<p>Furthermore, though <a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> and the <a href="../../wp/d/Dominican_Republic.htm" title="Dominican Republic">Dominican Republic</a> are recorded as primarily mulatto nations, evidence of Amerindian bloodlines exists and traces of indigenous <!--del_lnk--> Taino culture are ubiquitous.<p><a id="Mestizos_from_Hispanic_America_in_Europe" name="Mestizos_from_Hispanic_America_in_Europe"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Mestizos from Hispanic America in Europe</span></h4>
      <p>The first mestizos of whom there is verified evidence of having set foot on <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European</a> soil are the grandchildren of <!--del_lnk--> Moctezuma II, <a href="../../wp/a/Aztec.htm" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> emperor of Mexico, whose royal descent the Spanish crown acknowledged. Of this family, the most infamous descendants are the Counts of Miravalle, in <!--del_lnk--> Andaluc&iacute;a, <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>, who even today demand the payment of the so called &quot;Moctezuma pensions&quot; by the Mexican government.

      <p><b>The M&eacute;tis</b><dl>
       <dd>
      </dl>
      <p>In Canada, the <b>M&eacute;tis</b> are regarded as an independent ethnic group. This community of descent consists of individuals descended from marriages of <!--del_lnk--> First Nation women, specifically <!--del_lnk--> Cree, <!--del_lnk--> Ojibway and <!--del_lnk--> Saulteaux with <!--del_lnk--> French Canadian and <!--del_lnk--> British employees of the <!--del_lnk--> Hudson&#39;s Bay Company. Their history dates to the mid 17th century, and they have been recognized as a people since the early eighteenth.<p>Their territory roughly includes the three <!--del_lnk--> Prairie Provinces (<!--del_lnk--> Manitoba, <!--del_lnk--> Alberta and <!--del_lnk--> Saskatchewan), parts of <!--del_lnk--> Ontario, <!--del_lnk--> British Columbia and the <!--del_lnk--> Northwest Territories, as well as parts of the northern <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> (including <!--del_lnk--> North Dakota and <!--del_lnk--> Montana).<p>Traditionally, the M&eacute;tis spoke a mixed language called <!--del_lnk--> Michif (with various regional dialects). Michif (a phonetic spelling of the M&eacute;tis pronunciation of <i>M&eacute;tif</i>, a variant of <i>M&eacute;tis</i>) is also used as the name of the M&eacute;tis people. The name is most commonly applied to descendants of communities in what is now southern <!--del_lnk--> Manitoba. The name is also applied to the descendants of similar communities in what are now <!--del_lnk--> Ontario, <!--del_lnk--> Quebec, <!--del_lnk--> Labrador and the <!--del_lnk--> Northwest Territories, although these groups&#39; histories are different from that of the western M&eacute;tis.<p>Estimates of the number of M&eacute;tis vary from 300,000 to 700,000 or more. In September <!--del_lnk--> 2002, the M&eacute;tis people adopted a national definition of M&eacute;tis for citizenship within the &quot;M&eacute;tis Nation&quot;. Based on this definition, it is estimated that there are 350,000 to 400,000 M&eacute;tis Nation citizens in Canada , although many M&eacute;tis classify anyoneas M&eacute;tis that can prove that an ancestor applied for money scrip or land scrip as part of nineteenth-century treaties with the Canadian government.<p>The M&eacute;tis are not recognized as a First Nation by the Canadian government and do not receive the benefits granted to First Nation peoples (see <!--del_lnk--> Indian Act). However, the new Canadian constitution of 1982 recognizes the M&eacute;tis as an <!--del_lnk--> Aboriginal people and has enabled individual M&eacute;tis to sue successfully for recognition of their traditional rights, such as rights to hunt and trap. In <!--del_lnk--> 2003, a court ruling in <!--del_lnk--> Ontario found that the M&eacute;tis deserve the same rights as other aboriginal communities in Canada.<p><a id="The_United_States" name="The_United_States"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The United States</span></h3>
      <p><b>&quot;Mixed-Bloods&quot; and Mestizos</b><p>In the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States of America">United States</a> the term &quot;mixed-blood&quot; is more often employed for non-Hispanic individuals of mixed European and Native American ancestry, while <i>mestizo</i> is the term of choice for <!--del_lnk--> Hispanic individuals (whether U.S.-born or immigrant) of that same mixed ancestry.<p>Of the <!--del_lnk--> Mexican Americans who have lived in the <!--del_lnk--> Southwestern United States for several generations prior to annexation and incorporation of that region into the United States - previously a part of <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> - many classify themselves as mestizo, particularly those who also identify as <!--del_lnk--> Chicano. <i>See also <!--del_lnk--> Tejanos</i>.<p>Of the over 35 million Hispanics counted in the <!--del_lnk--> Federal 2000 Census, the overwhelming majority of the 48.2% who identified &quot;some other race&quot; are believed to be mestizos. Of the 48.6% of Hispanics who identified as &quot;White Hispanic&quot;, many are thought to possess at least some Amerindian ancestry. The remaining 3.2% of Hispanics identified as &quot;Black Hispanic&quot;.<p>Renowned <i>mixed-blooded</i> persons in United States&#39; history are many. One such example is <!--del_lnk--> Jean Baptiste Charbonneau, who guided the <!--del_lnk--> Mormon Battalion from <!--del_lnk--> New Mexico to the city of <!--del_lnk--> San Diego in <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1846, and then accepted an appointment there as <!--del_lnk--> alcalde of <!--del_lnk--> Mission San Luis Rey.

      <p>During the early colonial period of the <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>, the term &quot;Mestizo&quot; originally referred only to those of mixed <!--del_lnk--> Filipino and <!--del_lnk--> Spanish or <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexican</a> ancestry. However, the term soon became generic and <!--del_lnk--> synonymous for &quot;mixed race&quot;.<p>The term has since been freely used to refer to all Filipinos of physically traceable mixed ancestry, irrespective of racial combination or ratio, but typically including an ethnic <!--del_lnk--> Filipino base stock. A recent <!--del_lnk--> genetic study by <!--del_lnk--> Stanford University, indicates that 3.6% of the population have Spanish, Mexican or other <!--del_lnk--> European ancestries.<p>Modern day Filipino mestizos include the already mentioned Filipinos with Spanish ancestry or Filipinos mixed with Chinese, Japanese (those of mixed <!--del_lnk--> Filipino and <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japanese</a> descent) and/or American ancestry (those of mixed <!--del_lnk--> Filipino and <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">American</a><sup>4</sup> descent), <i>et cetera</i>. Although those Filipinos of Chinese, Japanese and other <!--del_lnk--> North Asian ancestry is also interchangeably referred to as &quot;Chinito/a&quot; (diminutive of <i>Chino/a</i>; Chinese) to specify the type of racial Mestizo background, this would more correctly be applied only to those mestizos of Chinese descent. More correct terms denoting Filipino-Chinese mestizos include <!--del_lnk--> Sangley and the vernacular &quot;Tsinoy&quot;.<p><a id="Mestizo_ascendancy" name="Mestizo_ascendancy"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Mestizo ascendancy</span></h4>
      <p>In contrast to Latin America, where <i><!--del_lnk--> Latino mestizos</i> (<a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="European">European</a>/<!--del_lnk--> Amerindian) quickly came to comprise the majority of the population, in the Philippines the combined number of all types of <i><!--del_lnk--> Filipino mestizos</i> never accounted for more than 4% of a population which, apart from a Spanish, Mexican and Chinese minority which numbered fewer than the mestizos, was mainly and predominantly native Filipino. Upon the retreat of Spain and Mexico at the end of colonial occupation, people of mestizo ancestry were able to position themselves at the top of a caste-based <!--del_lnk--> social structure which the Spanish had previously established and dominated. As a result, mestizos held the greatest governing influence in the country, almost absolute control of commerce and industry, and an excessively disproportionate share of wealth.<p>Conversely, their <!--del_lnk--> Latino mestizo counterparts, who by then comprised the common majority of Latin America, possessed little governing influence, lived at subsistence levels, and were ruled by an established <i><!--del_lnk--> criollo</i> population (<!--del_lnk--> Americas-born persons deemed of legally unmixed Spanish ancestry) that was to remain in power. In essence, the absence of a post-colonial population of <!--del_lnk--> insulares (Philippine-born persons deemed of legally unmixed Spanish ancestry) presence in the Philippines allowed the small minority of Filipino mestizos to fill the roles vacated by the <i>insulares</i>, unlike the situation in Latin America, where the criollos had by that time formed a relatively large population.<p>During the late <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a>, Filipino mestizos initiated most movements and revolts against Spain. One such movement lead by the national hero of the Philippines, Filipino-Chinese mestizo <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; Rizal, was the Propaganda Movement. Although these movements failed to achieve their intended goals, Filipino mestizos also initiated the calls for Filipino revolt and, with the aid of the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish-American War and the <!--del_lnk--> Philippine-American War, subsequently achieved independence.<p>By the time the Philippines had gained independence from Spain, Filipino mestizos had placed themselves as the fundamental role players in the founding of the modern Philippine government, and in the majority of its key positions. The first president of the First Philippine Republic, <!--del_lnk--> Emilio Aguinaldo, was a Filipino-Chinese mestizo, while the next and first president of the Philippine Commonwealth, <!--del_lnk--> Manuel L. Quez&oacute;n, was a Filipino-Spanish mestizo.<p>Today, despite constituting one of the smallest minorities, mestizos continue to hold a monopoly over the country&rsquo;s economic <a href="../../wp/o/Oligarchy.htm" title="Oligarchy">oligarchic</a> political systems.<p>Filipino-Spanish mestizos have long constituted the great majority of the upper and middle class and rarely intermingle with those outside their ethnic group. Today, a great majority are in politics, including high-ranked executives of commerce and industry, entertainment or in sporting ranks and hold great control over the country&#39;s economy.<p>Filipino-Chinese mestizos also form part of both the upper and middle classes. Most are successful and prosperous business people, and also highly involved in the running of the country. Some are also in the entertainment industry.<p>Two famous Filipina-Spanish mestizas residing outside of the <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a> are <!--del_lnk--> Isabel Preysler, mother of pop singer <!--del_lnk--> Enrique Iglesias and ex-wife of Spanish music legend <!--del_lnk--> Julio Iglesias; and <!--del_lnk--> Lalaine Vergara, more commonly known for playing &quot;Miranda S&aacute;nchez&quot; (a <!--del_lnk--> Mexican-American character) on <!--del_lnk--> Disney Channel&#39;s highly-rated show, <!--del_lnk--> Lizzie McGuire.<p><a id="East_Timor" name="East_Timor"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">East Timor</span></h3>
