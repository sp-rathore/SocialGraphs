      <p>The <b>military history of France</b> encompasses an immense panorama of conflicts and struggles extending for more than 2,000 years across areas including modern <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, greater <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> European territorial possessions overseas. Because of such lengthy periods of warfare, the peoples of France have often been at the forefront of military development, and as a result, military trends emerging in France have had a decisive impact on <!--del_lnk--> European and <a href="../../wp/h/History_of_the_world.htm" title="History of the world">world history</a>.<p><!--del_lnk--> Gallo-Roman conflict predominated from 400 <!--del_lnk--> BC to 50 BC, with the Romans emerging victorious in the <!--del_lnk--> conquest of Gaul by <a href="../../wp/j/Julius_Caesar.htm" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>. After the decline of the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>, a <!--del_lnk--> Germanic tribe known as the <a href="../../wp/f/Franks.htm" title="Franks">Franks</a> took control of <!--del_lnk--> Gaul by defeating competing tribes. The &quot;land of Francia,&quot; from which France gets its name, had high points of expansion under kings <!--del_lnk--> Clovis I and <a href="../../wp/c/Charlemagne.htm" title="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>. In the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, rivalries with <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> and the <a href="../../wp/h/Holy_Roman_Empire.htm" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> prompted major conflicts such as the <a href="../../wp/h/Hundred_Years%2527_War.htm" title="Hundred Years&#39; War">Hundred Years&#39; War</a>. With an increasingly centralized monarchy and the first standing army since Roman times, France came out of the Middle Ages as the most powerful nation in Europe, only to lose that status to <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> following defeat in the <!--del_lnk--> Italian Wars. The <!--del_lnk--> Wars of Religion crippled France in the late sixteenth century, but a major victory over Spain in the <!--del_lnk--> Thirty Years&#39; War, with help from <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, made France the most powerful nation on the continent once more. The wars of <!--del_lnk--> Louis XIV in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries left France territorially larger, but bankrupt.<p>In the eighteenth century, global competition with <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> led to defeat in the <!--del_lnk--> Seven Years&#39; War, where France lost its <!--del_lnk--> North American holdings, but consolation came in the form of the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Revolutionary_War.htm" title="American Revolutionary War">American Revolutionary War</a>, where <a href="../../wp/f/France_in_the_American_Revolutionary_War.htm" title="France in the American Revolutionary War">extensive French aid</a> led to America&#39;s independence.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_aid"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Internal political upheaval eventually led to 23 years of nearly continuous war in the <!--del_lnk--> French Revolutionary Wars and the <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleonic_Wars.htm" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>. France reached the zenith of its power during this period, but by 1815 it had been restored to its pre-Revolutionary borders. The rest of the nineteenth century witnessed the growth of the <!--del_lnk--> French colonial empire and wars with <!--del_lnk--> Russia, <!--del_lnk--> Austria, and <!--del_lnk--> Prussia. Following defeat in the <!--del_lnk--> Franco-Prussian War, Franco-German rivalry reasserted itself again in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, this time France, with British and to a much lesser extent, American aid, emerging as the winner. Tensions over the <a href="../../wp/t/Treaty_of_Versailles.htm" title="Treaty of Versailles">Versailles Treaty</a> led to the <!--del_lnk--> Second World War, where it was defeated in the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_France.htm" title="Battle of France">Battle of France</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Allies eventually emerged victorious over the Germans, however, and France was given an <!--del_lnk--> occupation zone in Germany. The two world wars destroyed Franco-German rivalry and paved the way for <!--del_lnk--> European integration, economically, politically, and militarily. Today, <!--del_lnk--> French military intervention is most often seen in its former colonies and with its <a href="../../wp/n/NATO.htm" title="NATO">NATO</a> allies in hot spots around the world.<p>

      <p>French strategic thinking has often been driven by the need to attain or preserve the so-called &quot;natural frontiers,&quot; the <!--del_lnk--> Pyrenees to the southwest, the <!--del_lnk--> Alps to the southeast, and the <!--del_lnk--> Rhine River to the east. Starting with <!--del_lnk--> Clovis, 1,500 years of warfare has witnessed the accomplishment of most of these objectives, with modern-day France lacking only about two-thirds of the Rhine, which is in <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>. Nevertheless, France is territorially the largest nation-state in <!--del_lnk--> Western Europe.<p>Warfare with other European powers was not always determined by these considerations, and often peoples in France extended their continental authority far beyond these barriers, most notably under Charlemagne, Louis XIV, and Napoleon. These periods of heavy militaristic activity were characterized by their peculiar sociopolitical and war-related conventions, but all required strong central leadership in order to permit the extension of French rule.<p>Important military rivalries in human history have come about as a result of conflict between French peoples and other European powers. Anglo-French rivalry, for preeminence in Europe and around the world, continued for centuries, while the more recent Franco-German rivalry required two world wars to stabilize. French involvement in these protracted geostrategic clashes was at times both successful and unsuccessful. The wars themselves had complex political dimensions, often involving alliance systems that rarely remained static and that yielded dynamic solutions on the battlefield.<p><a id="Imperial_objectives_and_post-colonial_status" name="Imperial_objectives_and_post-colonial_status"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Imperial objectives and post-colonial status</span></h3>
      <p>Starting in the early sixteenth century, much of France&#39;s military efforts were dedicated to securing its overseas possessions and putting down dissent among both French colonists and native populations. French troops were spread all across its empire, primarily to deal with the local population. This phase of French militarism only came to an end with the failed attempt to subdue Algerian nationalists in the late 1950s. However, even in the twenty-first century, many former French colonies still expect France to provide assistance to put down revolutionary activity.<p>Since <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, France&#39;s efforts have been directed at maintaining its status as a great power and its influence on the <!--del_lnk--> UN Security Council, despite the fact its military capability is being overtaken by the rising power of the <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">People&#39;s Republic of China</a> and India, among others. However, France has also been instrumental in attempting to unite the armed forces of Europe for their own defense in order to both balance the power of <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> and to lessen European military dependence on the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. For example, for some time France withdrew from NATO over complaints that its role in the organization was being subordinated to the demands of the United States.<p>French objectives in this era have undergone major shifts. Unencumbered by continental wars or intricate alliances, France now deploys its military forces as part of international peacekeeping operations, security enforcers in former colonies, or maintains them combat ready and mobilized to respond to threats from <!--del_lnk--> rogue states. France is a nuclear power with the largest nuclear arsenal in Europe, and its nuclear capabilities, just like its conventional forces, are being restructured to rapidly deal with emerging threats.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_nuclear"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p><a id="Gauls" name="Gauls"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Gauls</span></h2>

Gallo-Roman conflict in <!--del_lnk--> Cisalpine Gaul had been occurring for centuries prior to <a href="../../wp/j/Julius_Caesar.htm" title="Julius Caesar">Caesar</a>&#39;s invasion of <!--del_lnk--> Transalpine Gaul. In either 390 BC or 387 BC,<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_date"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> a Gallic army under <!--del_lnk--> Brennus destroyed a <!--del_lnk--> Roman force at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Allia, which led to the sacking of <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a> and the destruction of all Roman historical records prior to that period.<p>Growing professionalism in the <!--del_lnk--> Roman army eventually led to victories, most noticeably at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Sentinum and the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Telamon, over their Gallic counterparts, whose <!--del_lnk--> tactics and <a href="../../wp/w/Weapon.htm" title="Weapon">weapons</a> changed little over the years.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_tactics"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> However, in order to permanently end the Gallic threat, a consistent effort was required by the Romans, and this was finally provided by Julius Caesar.<p>Caesar&#39;s conquest of Gaul was met with little resistance initially. The 60 or so tribes that made up Gaul were unable to unite and defeat the Roman army, something Caesar exploited by pitting one tribe against another. In 58 BC, Caesar defeated the Germanic tribe of the <!--del_lnk--> Suebi, which was led by <!--del_lnk--> Ariovistus. The following year he conquered the Belgian Gauls after claiming that they were conspiring against Rome. The string of victories continued in a naval triumph against the <!--del_lnk--> Veneti in 56 BC. In 53 BC, a united Gallic resistance movement under <!--del_lnk--> Vercingetorix emerged for the first time. Caesar laid siege to the fortified city of Avaricum (<!--del_lnk--> Bourges) and broke through the defenses after 21 days, with only 800 out of the 40,000 inhabitants managing to escape. He then <!--del_lnk--> besieged Gergovia, Vercingetorix&#39;s home town, and suffered one of the worst defeats in his career when he had to retreat to suppress a revolt in another part of Gaul. After returning, Caesar surrounded Vercingetorix at <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Alesia.htm" title="Battle of Alesia">Alesia</a> in 52 BC. The townspeople were starved into submission and Caesar&#39;s unique defensive earthworks, protruding towards the city and away from it in order to stop a massive Gallic relief force,<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_force"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> eventually forced Vercingetorix to surrender.

      <p>As Roman power weakened in the fourth and fifth centuries, a Germanic tribe, the Franks, overran large areas that today form modern France. Under <!--del_lnk--> King Clovis I in the late fifth and early sixth centuries, Frankish dominions quadrupled as they managed to defeat successive opponents for control of Gaul. In 486 the Frankish armies under Clovis triumphed over <!--del_lnk--> Syagrius, the last <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman</a> official in Northern Gaul, at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Soissons. In 491 Clovis defeated <!--del_lnk--> Thuringians east of his territories. In 496 he overcame the <!--del_lnk--> Alamanni at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Tolbiac. In 507 he scored the most impressive victory in his career, prevailing at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Vouill&eacute; against the <!--del_lnk--> Visigoths, who were led by <!--del_lnk--> Alaric II, the conqueror of Spain.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Following Clovis, territorial divisions in the Frankish domain sparked intense rivalry between the western part of the kingdom, <!--del_lnk--> Neustria, and the eastern part, <!--del_lnk--> Austrasia. The two were sometimes united under one king, but from the sixth to the eighth centuries they often warred against each other. Early in the eighth century, the Franks were preoccupied with <!--del_lnk--> Islamic invasions across the Pyrenees and up the <!--del_lnk--> Rhone Valley. Two key battles during this period were the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Toulouse and the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Tours.htm" title="Battle of Tours">Battle of Tours</a>, both won by the Franks, and both instrumental in slowing Islamic incursions. Claims that these victories permitted the independent development of European civilization seem exaggerated,<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_important"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> but nonetheless they were major symbolic triumphs over the &quot;Islamic hordes.&quot;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_exaggerated"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p>Under Charlemagne the Franks reached the height of their power. After campaigns against <!--del_lnk--> Lombards, <!--del_lnk--> Avars, <!--del_lnk--> Saxons, and <!--del_lnk--> Basques, the resulting <!--del_lnk--> Carolingian Empire stretched from the Pyrenees to Central Germany, from the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea.htm" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> to the <!--del_lnk--> Adriatic. In 800 the <a href="../../wp/p/Pope.htm" title="Pope">Pope</a> made Charlemagne <!--del_lnk--> Emperor of the West in return for protection of the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Catholic Church">Church</a>.

Charlemagne hoped to provide his nobles an incentive to fight by encouraging looting on campaign. Plunder and spoils of war were stronger temptations than imperial expansion, and several regions were invaded over and over in order to bolster the coffers of Frankish nobility.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_motivation"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Cavalry dominated the battlefields, and while the high costs associated with equipping horse and horse-rider helped limit their numbers, Carolingian armies maintained a decent size of 20,000 (average) by recruiting infantry from imperial territories near theaters of operation.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_armies"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The Empire lasted from 800 to 843, when, following Frankish tradition, it was split between the sons of <!--del_lnk--> Louis the Pious by the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Verdun.<p><a id="Middle_Ages" name="Middle_Ages"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Middle Ages</span></h2>

      <p>French military history during this period paralleled the rise and eventual fall of the armored <!--del_lnk--> knight. Following Charlemagne, there was a great increase in the proportion of cavalry supplemented by improvement in armor: leather and steel, steel helmets, coats of mail, and even full armor added to the defensive capabilities of mounted forces.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_mounted"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Cavalry eventually grew to be the most important component of French armies,<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_component"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> with the shock charge they provided becoming the standard tactic on the battlefield when it was invented in the eleventh century.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_tactic"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> At the same time, the development of agricultural techniques allowed the nations of Western Europe to radically increase food production, facilitating the growth of a particularly large aristocracy in France.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>During the <a href="../../wp/c/Crusades.htm" title="Crusades">Crusades</a>, there were in fact too many armored knights in France for the land to support. Some scholars believe that one of the driving forces behind the Crusades was an attempt by such landless knights to find land overseas, without causing the type of internecine warfare that would largely damage France&#39;s increasing military strength. However, such historiographical work on the Crusades is being challenged and rejected by a large part of the historical community. The ultimate motivation or motivations for any one individual are difficult to know, but regardless, nobles and knights from France generally formed very sizeable contingents of crusading expeditions.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_rejection"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In the eleventh century, French knights wore knee-length <!--del_lnk--> mail and carried long <!--del_lnk--> lances and swords. The <!--del_lnk--> Norman knights fielded at the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Hastings.htm" title="Battle of Hastings">Battle of Hastings</a> were more than a match for English forces, and their overwhelming victory simply cemented their power and influence. Improvements in armor over the centuries led to the establishment of <!--del_lnk--> plate armor by the fourteenth century, which was further developed more rigorously in the fifteenth century.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_plate"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> However, by the late fourteenth century and the early fifteenth, French military power declined during the first parts of the Hundred Years&#39; War. New weapons and tactics seemingly made the knight more of a sitting target than an effective battle force, but the often-praised <!--del_lnk--> longbowmen had little to do with the English success.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_little"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Poor coordination or rough terrain led to bungled French assaults.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_bungled"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The slaughter of knights at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Agincourt best exemplified this carnage. The French were able to field a much larger army of <!--del_lnk--> men-at-arms than their English counterparts, who had many longbowmen. Despite this, the French suffered about 6,000 casualties<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_suffered"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> compared to a few hundred for the English because the narrow terrain prevented the tactical envelopments envisioned in recently discovered French plans for the battle.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_plans"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The French suffered a similar defeat at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Golden Spurs against Flemish militia in 1302.

Given the successes of <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_V_of_England.htm" title="Henry V of England">Henry V</a>, his death in 1422 altered the nature of the war profoundly and may have permitted the French to recover virtually all their territory by the end of the conflict.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_nature"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p>Popular conceptions of the victory in the final stages of the Hundred Years&#39; War are often dominated by <a href="../../wp/j/Joan_of_Arc.htm" title="Joan of Arc">Joan of Arc</a>, but there were far deeper reasons for the French triumph.

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> French Renaissance and the beginning of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Ancien R&eacute;gime</i>, normally marked by the reign of <!--del_lnk--> Francis I, saw the nation become far more unified under the monarch. The power of the nobles was diminished as a national army was created. With England expelled from the continent and being consumed by the <a href="../../wp/w/Wars_of_the_Roses.htm" title="Wars of the Roses">Wars of the Roses</a>, France&#39;s main rival was the <a href="../../wp/h/Holy_Roman_Empire.htm" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>. This threat to France became alarming in 1516 when <!--del_lnk--> Charles V became the king of <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>, and grew worse when Charles was also elected <!--del_lnk--> Holy Roman Emperor in 1519. France was all but surrounded as Spain, Germany, and the Low Countries were controlled by the <!--del_lnk--> Habsburgs. The lengthy <!--del_lnk--> Italian Wars that took place during this period resulted in defeat for France and established <!--del_lnk--> Catholic Spain, which formed a branch of the Habsburg holdings, as the most powerful nation in Europe. Later in the sixteenth century, France was weakened internally by the <!--del_lnk--> Wars of Religion. As nobles managed to raise their own private armies, these conflicts between <!--del_lnk--> Huguenots and <!--del_lnk--> Catholics all but demolished centralization and monarchical authority, hence precluding France from remaining a powerful force in European affairs.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_nobles"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p>While France could do little to challenge the dominance of the Holy Roman Empire, the Empire itself faced many challenges. From the east it was severely endangered by the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, with which the French sometimes cooperated. The vast Habsburg empire also proved impossible to manage effectively, and the crown was soon divided between the Spanish and Austrian holdings. In 1568 the Dutch declared independence, launching a <!--del_lnk--> war that would take decades and illustrate the weaknesses of Habsburg power. Finally in the seventeenth century, the religious violence that had beset France a century earlier began to tear the empire apart. At first France sat on the sidelines, but under <!--del_lnk--> Cardinal Richelieu it saw an opportunity to advance its own interests at the expense of the Habsburgs. Despite France&#39;s staunch <!--del_lnk--> Catholicism, it intervened on the side of the <!--del_lnk--> Protestants. The Thirty Years&#39; War was long and extremely bloody, but France came out victorious and, for the next century and a half, was the undisputed great power of Europe.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The long reign of Louis XIV saw a series of conflicts: the <!--del_lnk--> War of Devolution, the <!--del_lnk--> Franco-Dutch War, the <!--del_lnk--> War of the Reunions, the <!--del_lnk--> Nine Years War, and the <a href="../../wp/w/War_of_the_Spanish_Succession.htm" title="War of the Spanish Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>. Wars in this era consisted of <a href="../../wp/s/Siege.htm" title="Siege">sieges</a> and movements that were rarely decisive. Few of Louis&#39; wars were either clear victories or definite defeats, but inexorably, France&#39;s borders expanded. The west bank of the Rhine, much of the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish Netherlands, and a good deal of <a href="../../wp/l/Luxembourg.htm" title="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a> were annexed while the War of the Spanish Succession saw a fellow Bourbon placed on the throne of Spain. To stop France&#39;s advance, several European powers formed coalitions. During Louis&#39; long reign, the English reemerged as France&#39;s great rivals, allied to the Habsburgs. While they could not stand up to France on land, the British <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Navy.htm" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> dominated the seas, and France lost many of its colonial holdings. The British economy also became Europe&#39;s most powerful, and British money funded the campaigns of their continental allies.<p>The armies of Louis XIV were some of the most impressive in <!--del_lnk--> French history, their quality reflecting militaristic as well political developments. In the mid-seventeenth century, royal power reasserted itself and the army became a tool through which the King could wield authority, replacing older systems of mercenary units and the private forces of recalcitrant nobles.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_authority"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Military administration also made gigantic progress as food supply, clothing, equipment, and armaments were provided in a regularity never before equaled.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_progress"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> In fact, the French embedded this standardization by becoming the first army to give their soldiers national uniforms in the 1680s and 1690s.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_uniforms"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p>The eighteenth century saw France remain the dominant power in Europe, but begin to falter largely because of internal problems. The country engaged in a long series of wars, such as the <!--del_lnk--> War of the Quadruple Alliance, the <!--del_lnk--> War of the Polish Succession, and the <!--del_lnk--> War of the Austrian Succession, but these conflicts gained France little. Meanwhile, Britain&#39;s power steadily increased, and a new force, <!--del_lnk--> Prussia, became a major threat. This change in the balance of power led to the <!--del_lnk--> Diplomatic Revolution of 1756, when France and the Habsburgs forged an alliance after centuries of animosity. This alliance proved less than effective in the <!--del_lnk--> Seven Years&#39; War, but in the American War of Independence, the French helped inflict a major defeat on the British.<p><a id="Revolutionary_France" name="Revolutionary_France"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Revolutionary France</span></h2>

      <p>The <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>, true to its name, revolutionized nearly all aspects of French and European life. The powerful sociopolitical forces unleashed by a people seeking <!--del_lnk--> libert&eacute;, &eacute;galit&eacute;, and fraternit&eacute; made certain that even warfare was not spared this upheaval. Eighteenth-century armies, with their rigid protocols, quasi-static operational strategy, unenthusiastic soldiers, and aristocratic officer classes, underwent massive remodeling as the French monarchy and nobility gave way to liberal assemblies obsessed with external threats.<p>In 1791 the <!--del_lnk--> Legislative Assembly passed the &quot;Drill-Book&quot; legislation, implementing a series of infantry doctrines created by French theorists because of their defeat to the Prussians in the <!--del_lnk--> Seven Years&#39; War (see &quot;Formations and Tactics&quot; in <a href="../../wp/l/La_Grande_Arm%25C3%25A9e.htm" title="La Grande Arm&eacute;e">La Grande Arm&eacute;e</a>).<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Chandler136"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The new developments hoped to exploit the intrinsic bravery of the French soldier, made even more powerful by the explosive nationalist forces of the Revolution. The changes also placed a faith on the ordinary soldier that would be completely unacceptable in earlier times; French troops were expected to harass the enemy and remain loyal enough to not desert, a benefit other Ancien R&eacute;gime armies did not have.<p>Following the declaration of war in 1792, an imposing array of enemies converging on French borders prompted the government in Paris to adopt radical measures. <!--del_lnk--> August 23, <!--del_lnk--> 1793, would become a historic day in military history; on that date the <!--del_lnk--> National Convention called a <!--del_lnk--> lev&eacute;e en masse, or mass conscription, for the first time in human history.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_history"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> By summer of the following year, conscription made some 500,000 men available for service and the French began to deal blows to their European enemies.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_conscription"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The French triumphed at the decisive <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Fleurus through numerical superiority; while both sides had roughly equivalent forces in the region, the French were able to concentrate theirs more effectively. Armies during the Revolution became noticeably larger than their Roman counterparts, and combined with the new enthusiasm of the soldiery, the tactical and strategic opportunities became almost limitless. By 1797 the French had defeated the <!--del_lnk--> First Coalition, occupied the Low Countries, the west bank of the Rhine, and Northern Italy, objectives which had defied the <!--del_lnk--> Valois and <!--del_lnk--> Bourbon dynasties for centuries. Unsatisfied with the results, many European powers formed a <!--del_lnk--> Second Coalition, but by 1801 this too had been decisively beaten.<p>Another key aspect of French success was the changes wrought in the officer classes. Traditionally, European armies left major command positions to those who could be trusted, namely, the aristocracy. The hectic nature of the French Revolution, however, tore apart France&#39;s old army, meaning new men were required to become officers and commanders.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_tore"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> As a result of political pressure, competition, promotion, and constant campaigning, France emerged out of the <!--del_lnk--> Revolutionary Wars with the best officers in Europe, a very helpful feature during the later <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleonic_Wars.htm" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>. In the nineteenth century, all European armies adopted the fluid officer class the Revolution had introduced, and for that fact, the French Revolution can be credited with establishing the world&#39;s first professional armies.<p>Besides opening a flood of tactical and strategic opportunities, the Revolutionary Wars also laid the foundation for modern military theory. Later authors that wrote about &quot;nations in arms&quot; drew inspiration from the French Revolution, where dire circumstances seemingly mobilized the entire French nation for war. Although the reality of war in the France of 1795 would be different from that in the France of 1915, conceptions and mentalities of war evolved significantly. <!--del_lnk--> Clausewitz correctly analyzed the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras to give posterity a thorough and complete theory of war that emphasized struggles between nations occurring everywhere, from the battlefield to the legislative assemblies, and to the very way that people think. War now emerged as a vast panorama of physical and psychological forces heading for victory or defeat.<p><a id="Napoleonic_France" name="Napoleonic_France"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Napoleonic France</span></h2>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Napoleonic Era saw France&#39;s influence and power reach immense heights, but just as quickly, it collapsed back to its old borders at an immense cost to the French people. The reasons for the success are varied, but a few points do survive analysis. In the century and a half preceding the Revolutionary Era, France had transformed <!--del_lnk--> demographic leverage to military and political weight; the French population was 19 million in 1700,<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_sevenpop"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> but this had grown to over 29 million in 1800, much higher than most other European powers.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_pop"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> These numbers permitted France to raise armies at a rapid pace should the need arise. Furthermore, military innovations carried out during the Revolution and the <!--del_lnk--> Consulate, evidenced by improvements in artillery and cavalry capabilities on top of better army and staff organization, gave the French army a decisive advantage in the initial stages of the Napoleonic Wars. Another ingredient of success was <!--del_lnk--> Napoleon Bonaparte himself&mdash;intelligent, charismatic, and a military genius, Napoleon absorbed the latest military theories of the day and applied them in the battlefield with deadly effect.<p>Napoleon developed an army based on conscription using huge masses of poorly trained troops that could usually be readily replaced, led by a few elite units, like the <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Guard. What his armies lacked in skill they made up for in bulk. Napoleon&#39;s huge losses suffered during the disastrous <!--del_lnk--> Russian campaign would have destroyed any professional commander of the day, but those losses were quickly replaced with new draftees. After Napoleon, nations planned for huge armies with professional leadership and a constant supply of new soldiers, which had huge human costs when improved weapons like the <!--del_lnk--> rifled musket replaced the inaccurate muskets of Napoleon&#39;s day during the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>This large size came at a cost, as the logistics of feeding a huge army made them especially dependent on supplies. Most armies of the day relied on the supply-convoy system established during the Thirty Years&#39; War by <!--del_lnk--> Gustavus Adolphus. This limited mobility, since the soldiers had to wait for the convoys, but it did keep possibly mutinous troops from deserting, and thus helped preserve an army&#39;s composure. However, Napoleon&#39;s armies were so large that feeding them using the old method proved ineffective, and consequently, French troops were allowed to live off the land. Infused with new concepts of nation and service, French soldiers proved reliable enough to pillage Europe without &quot;going native.&quot; Napoleon often attempted to wage decisive, quick campaigns so that he could allow his men to live off the land. The French army did use a convoy system, but it was stocked with very few days worth of food; Napoleon&#39;s troops were expected to march quickly, effect a decision on the battlefield, then disperse to feed. For the Russian campaign, the French did store 24 days&#39; worth of food before beginning active operations, but this campaign was the exception, not the rule.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_food"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p>Napoleon&#39;s biggest influence in the military sphere was in the conduct of warfare. Weapons and technology remained largely static through the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, but eighteenth-century operational strategy underwent massive restructuring. <a href="../../wp/s/Siege.htm" title="Siege">Sieges</a> became infrequent to the point of near-irrelevance, a new emphasis towards the destruction, not just outmaneuvering, of enemy armies emerged, and invasions of enemy territory occurred over broader fronts, thus introducing a plethora of strategic opportunities that made wars costlier and, just as importantly, more decisive.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_decisive"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Defeat for a European power now meant much more than losing isolated enclaves; near-Carthaginian peaces intertwined whole national efforts, sociopolitical, economic, and militaristic, into gargantuan collisions that severely upset international conventions as understood at the time.

Not used to such catastrophic defeats in the rigid power system of eighteenth-century Europe, many nations found existence under the French yoke difficult, sparking revolts, wars, and general instability that plagued the continent until 1815, when the forces of reaction finally triumphed at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Waterloo.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_system"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p><a id="French_colonial_empire" name="French_colonial_empire"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">French colonial empire</span></h2>

      <p>The history of French colonial <!--del_lnk--> imperialism can be divided into two major eras: the first from the early seventeenth century to the middle of the eighteenth century, and the second from the early nineteenth century to the middle of the twentieth century. In the first phase of expansion, France concentrated its efforts mainly in <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a> and India, setting up commercial ventures that were backed by military force.

These areas of the world had generally resisted <!--del_lnk--> European colonialism until the start of the nineteenth century, but advances in weapons technology allowed small numbers of European troops to overcome much larger bodies of native warriors.<p>In Europe, post-Napoleonic France remained a powerful force in continental affairs, inflicting a defeat on the Habsburgs in the <!--del_lnk--> Franco-Austrian War of 1859, a defeat which led to the <!--del_lnk--> unification of Italy in 1861, after having triumphed over Russia with other allies in the <a href="../../wp/c/Crimean_War.htm" title="Crimean War">Crimean War</a>.

      <p>Despite having one of the largest and most technologically advanced standing armies in Europe, and the money to support it, France consistently lost out on the development of new tactics through insufficient training. <!--del_lnk--> Charles De Gaulle had foreseen the importance of <!--del_lnk--> armored warfare after World War I, but his theories were widely ignored in France, only to be taken up by the Germans, who used them to great effect with <a href="../../wp/b/Blitzkrieg.htm" title="Blitzkrieg">Blitzkrieg</a>. Furthermore, low population growth forced the French government to extend conscription terms and made military life more unpopular. Prior to the Battle of France, there were sentiments among many Allied soldiers, French and British, of pointless repetition; they viewed the war with dread since they had already beaten the Germans once, and images of that first major conflict were still poignant in military circles.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Keegan64"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The costs of World War I inspired the French to look for more defensive measures. The <!--del_lnk--> Maginot Line was the result of these deliberations: the French originally allocated three billion <!--del_lnk--> francs for the project, but by 1935 seven billion had been spent.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_billion"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The Maginot Line successfully held off the German attacks in 1940, but defeat in the northern sectors spelled the end of the Third Republic.<p>After its defeat, France remained occupied until 1944. The <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Normandy.htm" title="Battle of Normandy">Normandy landings</a> in that year were the first step towards the eventual <!--del_lnk--> Liberation of France. The <!--del_lnk--> Free French Forces under de Gaulle had participated widely throughout previous campaigns, but their growing size made them especially notable in the final phases of the war. In May 1945, the final month of the war in Europe, the French had a total of 1.25 million soldiers; ten divisions of these, seven infantry and three armored, were fighting in Germany.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_divisions"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> At the end of the conflict, France was given one of four occupation zones in Germany and in <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin.htm" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>.<p>Historically, the military had sided with the monarchy and the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a>, but their struggles over the twentieth century eventually allowed the Republican and secular forces that had first come to the fore during the French Revolution to cement their hold over <!--del_lnk--> French politics. The last attempt by the military to set its own policy came during the <!--del_lnk--> Algerian War of Independence, when French forces took the suppression of rebellious Algerians into their own hands, against the directions of then President De Gaulle. Eventually, De Gaulle distanced himself from the military and appealed to public support, resulting in the establishment of the <!--del_lnk--> Fifth Republic. However, this also had the effect of lessening France&#39;s military standing in the world to the point where De Gaulle often believed that France had little control over its own military destiny. Today, despite having some of the best trained and best equipped military forces in the world, and being a nuclear power, the role of France is seen in terms of coalition interventions, peacekeeping, and minor disputes. Conflicts indicative of this status are the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf War in 1991, in which France sent 18,000 troops, 60 combat aircraft, 120 helicopters, and 40 tanks,<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_indicative"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> <!--del_lnk--> Mission H&eacute;racles in the <!--del_lnk--> War in Afghanistan, and recent <!--del_lnk--> peacekeeping actions in <a href="../../wp/c/C%25C3%25B4te_d%2527Ivoire.htm" title="C&ocirc;te d&#39;Ivoire">C&ocirc;te d&#39;Ivoire</a>.<p><a id="Topical_subjects" name="Topical_subjects"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Topical subjects</span></h2>

      <p>Many consider the <!--del_lnk--> Arm&eacute;e de l&#39;Air to have been the first professional <!--del_lnk--> air force in the world. The French took active interest in developing their air force and had the first fighter pilots of World War I. During the <!--del_lnk--> interwar years, however, particularly in the 1930s, the quality fell when compared with the <!--del_lnk--> Luftwaffe, which crushed both the French and <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Air_Force.htm" title="Royal Air Force">British</a> air forces during the Battle of France. In the post&ndash;World War II era, the French made a concerted and successful effort to develop a homegrown aircraft industry. <!--del_lnk--> Dassault Aviation led the way forward with their unique and effective <!--del_lnk--> delta-wing designs, which formed the basis for the famous <!--del_lnk--> Mirage series of <!--del_lnk--> jet fighters.

Currently, the French Air Force is expanding and replacing. The French are awaiting the <!--del_lnk--> A400M military transport aircraft, which is still in developmental stages, and the integration of the new <!--del_lnk--> Rafale multi-role jet fighter, whose first squadron of 20 aircraft became operational in 2006 at <!--del_lnk--> Saint-Dizier.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_operational"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p><a id="French_Navy" name="French_Navy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">French Navy</span></h3>

      <p>Although the history of the <!--del_lnk--> French Navy goes back to the Middle Ages, when it was defeated by the English at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Sluys and, with <!--del_lnk--> Castilian help, managed to beat the English at <!--del_lnk--> La Rochelle, it did not become a consistent instrument of national power until the seventeenth century with Louis XIV. Under the tutelage of the &quot;Sun King,&quot; the French Navy was well financed and equipped, managing to resoundingly defeat a combined Spanish-Dutch fleet at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Palermo in 1676 during the Franco-Dutch War, although, along with the English navy, it suffered several strategic reversals against the Dutch, who were led by the brilliant <!--del_lnk--> Michiel de Ruyter. It scored several early victories in the Nine Years War against the <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Navy.htm" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Dutch Navy. Financial difficulties, however, allowed the English and the Dutch to regain the initiative at sea.<p>A perennial problem for the French Navy was the strategic priorities of France, which were first and foremost tied to its European ambitions. This meant the army was often treated better than the navy, and as a result, the latter suffered in training and operational performance. The eighteenth century saw the beginning of Royal Navy domination, which managed to inflict a number of significant defeats on the French. However, in a very impressive effort, a French fleet under <!--del_lnk--> de Grasse managed to defeat an English fleet at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Chesapeake in 1781, ensuring that the Franco-American ground forces would win the ongoing <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Yorktown. Beyond that, and <!--del_lnk--> Suffren&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> impressive campaigns against the British in India, there was not much more good news. The French Revolution all but crippled the French Navy, and efforts to make it into a powerful force under Napoleon were dashed at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, where the British all but annihilated a combined Franco-Spanish fleet. The disaster guaranteed British naval domination until World War II.<p>Later in the nineteenth century, the navy recovered and became the second finest in the world after the Royal Navy. It conducted a successful blockade of Mexico in the <!--del_lnk--> Pastry War of 1838 and obliterated the Chinese navy at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Foochow in 1884. It also served as an effective link between the growing parts of the French empire. The navy performed well during World War I, in which it mainly protected the naval lanes in the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>. At the onset of the war, the French, with 16 battleships, 6 cruisers, and 24 destroyers, had the largest fleet in the Mediterranean.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_fleet"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The defeat of France in World War II, however, forced the British to destroy the French navy at <!--del_lnk--> Mers-el-Kebir in order to prevent its fall to the Germans. Currently, French naval doctrine calls for two <a href="../../wp/a/Aircraft_carrier.htm" title="Aircraft carrier">aircraft carriers</a>, but the French only have one, the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Charles de Gaulle</i>, due to restructuring. The navy is in the midst of major technological and procurement changes; newer submarines and a second aircraft carrier have been ordered on top of the Rafales (the naval version) replacing older aircraft.<p><a id="French_Foreign_Legion" name="French_Foreign_Legion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">French Foreign Legion</span></h3>

On April 30, 1863, a company of 65 legionnaires was ambushed by 2,000 Mexican troops at the Hacienda Camar&oacute;n; in the resulting <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Camar&oacute;n, the legionnaires resisted bravely for several hours and inflicted 300-500 casualties on the Mexicans while 62 of them died and three were captured.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_cameron"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> One of the Mexican commanders, impressed by the memorable intransigence he had just witnessed, characterized the Legion in a way they&#39;ve been known ever since, &quot;These are not men, but devils!&quot;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_devils"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Today, legionnaires recognize April 30 as &quot;Cameron Day.&quot;<p>After the French defeat in Mexico, the Legion participated effectively in the Franco-Prussian War, spearheading the attack that lead to the only French victory of the war in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Coulmiers.
