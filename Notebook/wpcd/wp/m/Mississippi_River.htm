      <p>the Mississippi is a river in mississippi. With its source <!--del_lnk--> Lake Itasca at 1,475 feet (450 m) above sea level in <!--del_lnk--> Itasca State Park located in <!--del_lnk--> Clearwater County, Minnesota, the river falls to 725 feet (220 m) just below <!--del_lnk--> Saint Anthony Falls in <!--del_lnk--> Minneapolis. The Mississippi is joined by the <!--del_lnk--> Illinois River and the <a href="../../wp/m/Missouri_River.htm" title="Missouri River">Missouri River</a> near <!--del_lnk--> St. Louis, Missouri, and by the Ohio River at <!--del_lnk--> Cairo, Illinois. The <!--del_lnk--> Arkansas River joins the Mississippi in the state of <!--del_lnk--> Arkansas. The <!--del_lnk--> Atchafalaya River in <!--del_lnk--> Louisiana is a major <!--del_lnk--> distributary of the Mississippi.<p>The Mississippi drains most of the area between the <a href="../../wp/r/Rocky_Mountains.htm" title="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Appalachian Mountains, except for the areas drained by the <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Lakes.htm" title="Great Lakes">Great Lakes</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Rio Grande. It runs through two states &mdash; <a href="../../wp/m/Minnesota.htm" title="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> and Louisiana &mdash; and was used to define the borders of eight states (the river has since shifted) &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> Wisconsin, <!--del_lnk--> Iowa, <!--del_lnk--> Illinois, <!--del_lnk--> Missouri, <!--del_lnk--> Kentucky, <!--del_lnk--> Arkansas, <!--del_lnk--> Tennessee, and <!--del_lnk--> Mississippi &mdash; before emptying into the <a href="../../wp/g/Gulf_of_Mexico.htm" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> about 100 miles (160 km) downstream from <!--del_lnk--> New Orleans. Measurements of the length of the Mississippi from Lake Itasca to the Gulf of Mexico vary, but the <!--del_lnk--> EPA&#39;s number is 2,320 miles (3,733 km). The retention time from Lake Itasca to the Gulf is about 90 days.<div class="thumb tright">

      </div>
      <p>The river is divided into the <!--del_lnk--> upper Mississippi, from its source south to the Ohio River, and the lower Mississippi, from the Ohio to its mouth near New Orleans. The upper Mississippi is further divided into three sections: the headwaters, from the source to <!--del_lnk--> Saint Anthony Falls; a series of man-made lakes between Minneapolis and St. Louis, Missouri; and the middle Mississippi, a relatively free-flowing river downstream of the confluence with the Missouri River at St. Louis.<p>A series of 29 <!--del_lnk--> locks and dams on the upper Mississippi, most of which were built in the 1930s, is designed primarily to maintain a 9 foot (2.7 m) deep channel for commercial barge traffic. The lakes formed are also used for recreational boating and fishing. The dams make the river deeper and wider but do not stop it. No flood control is intended. During periods of high flow, the gates, some of which are submersible, are completely opened and the dams simply cease to function. Below St. Louis, the Mississippi is relatively free-flowing, although it is constrained by numerous levees and directed by numerous wing dams.<p>Through a natural process known as <!--del_lnk--> deltaic switching the lower Mississippi River has shifted its final course to the ocean every thousand years or so. This occurs because the deposits of silt and sediment raise the river&#39;s level causing it to eventually find a steeper route to the <a href="../../wp/g/Gulf_of_Mexico.htm" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>. The abandoned distributary diminishes in volume and forms what are known as <!--del_lnk--> bayous. This process has, over the past 5,000 years, caused the coastline of south Louisiana to advance toward the Gulf from 15 to 50 miles (25-80 km).<p>U.S. government scientists determined in the 1950s that the Mississippi River was starting to switch to the <!--del_lnk--> Atchafalaya River channel because of its much steeper path to the Gulf of Mexico, and eventually the Atchafalaya River would capture the Mississippi River and become its main channel to the Gulf of Mexico. As a result, the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Congress authorized a project called the <!--del_lnk--> Old River Control Structure, which has prevented the Mississippi River from leaving its current channel that drains into the Gulf via New Orleans. Because of the large scale of high energy water flow through the Old River Control Structure threatening to damage the structure, an auxiliary flow control station was built adjacent to the standing control station. This <!--del_lnk--> US$300 million project was completed in 1996 by the Army Corp Of Engineers. k0<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Illinoian Glacier, about 200,000 to 125,000 years before present, blocked the Mississippi near <!--del_lnk--> Rock Island, diverting it to its present channel farther to the west (current western border of Illinois). The <!--del_lnk--> Hennepin Canal roughly follows the ancient channel of the Mississippi downstream from Rock Island to Hennepin. South of <!--del_lnk--> Hennepin, the current <!--del_lnk--> Illinois River is actually following the ancient channel of the Mississippi River to <!--del_lnk--> Alton before the Illinoian glaciation.<p>Other changes in the course of the river have occurred because of <a href="../../wp/e/Earthquake.htm" title="Earthquake">earthquakes</a> along the <!--del_lnk--> New Madrid Fault Zone, which lies near the cities of <!--del_lnk--> Memphis and St. Louis. Three earthquakes in 1811 and 1812, estimated at approximately 8 on the <!--del_lnk--> Richter Scale, were said to have temporarily reversed the course of the Mississippi. These earthquakes also created <!--del_lnk--> Reelfoot Lake in Tennessee from the altered landscape near the river. The faulting is related to an <!--del_lnk--> aulacogen (geologic term for a failed rift) that formed at the same time as the Gulf of Mexico.<p><a id="Watershed" name="Watershed"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Watershed</span></h3>

      <p>The word <i>Mississippi</i> comes from the <!--del_lnk--> Ojibwa name for the river, &quot;Messipi&quot; (or <i>Misi-ziibi</i> in contemporary spelling), which means <i>great river</i>, or from the <!--del_lnk--> Algonquin <i>Missi Sepe</i>, &quot;great river,&quot; poetically, &quot;father of waters.&quot; The Ojibwe called Lake Itasca <i>Omashkoozo-zaaga&#39;igan</i> (Elk Lake) and the river flowing out of it <i>Omashkoozo-ziibi</i> (Elk River). After flowing into <!--del_lnk--> Lake Bemidji, the Ojibwe called the river <i>Bemijigamaa-ziibi</i> (River from the Traversing Lake). After flowing into <!--del_lnk--> Cass Lake, the name of the river again changed to <i>Miskwaawaakokaa-ziibi</i> (Red Cedar River) and then to <i>Gichi-ziibi</i> (Big River) after flowing into <!--del_lnk--> Lake Winnibigoshish. The Ojibwe name <i>Misi-ziibi</i> applied only to the portion below the <!--del_lnk--> Crow Wing River, but the ever-changing names of the river seemed illogical to the English speakers, so after the expedition by <!--del_lnk--> Henry Schoolcraft, the longest stream above the juncture of the Crow Wing River and <i>Gichi-ziibi</i> was named &quot;Mississippi River&quot;.<p><a id="Early_American" name="Early_American"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early American</span></h3>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> May 8, <!--del_lnk--> 1541, <!--del_lnk--> Hernando de Soto became the first recorded <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European</a> to reach the Mississippi River, which he called &quot;Rio de Espiritu Santo&quot; (River of the Holy Spirit). French explorers <!--del_lnk--> Louis Joliet and <!--del_lnk--> Jacques Marquette began exploring the Mississippi. He traveled with a <!--del_lnk--> Sioux named &quot;Ne Tongo&quot; (which in <!--del_lnk--> Sioux means <i>big river</i>) in 1673. In 1682, <!--del_lnk--> Ren&eacute; Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle and <!--del_lnk--> Henri de Tonty claimed the entire Mississippi River Valley for France, calling the river <i>Colbert River</i> after <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Baptiste Colbert and the region <i>Louisiana</i>, for <!--del_lnk--> King Louis XIV. In 1718, New Orleans was established by <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville.<p>France lost all its territories on the North American mainland as a result of the <!--del_lnk--> French and Indian War. The <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Paris (1763) gave the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Great Britain rights to all land in the valley east of the Mississippi and <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> rights to land west of the Mississippi. Spain also ceded <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a> to England to regain <a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, which the English occupied during the war. Britain then divided the territory into <!--del_lnk--> East Florida and <!--del_lnk--> West Florida.<p>In the second <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Paris, which ended the <!--del_lnk--> American Revolution, Britain ceded West Florida back to Spain to regain the <a href="../../wp/t/The_Bahamas.htm" title="Bahamas">Bahamas</a>, which Spain had occupied during the war. Spain then had control over the river south of 32&deg;30&#39; north latitude and, in what is known as the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish Conspiracy, hoped to gain greater control of Louisiana and all of the west. These hopes ended when Spain was pressured into signing <!--del_lnk--> Pinckney&#39;s Treaty in 1795. France reacquired &#39;Louisiana&#39; from Spain in the secret <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1800. The United States bought the territory from France in the <!--del_lnk--> Louisiana Purchase of 1803.<p>The river was noted for the number of bandits which called its islands and shores home, including <!--del_lnk--> John Murrell who was a well-known murderer, horse stealer and slave &quot;re-trader&quot;. His notoriety was such that author <a href="../../wp/m/Mark_Twain.htm" title="Mark Twain">Mark Twain</a> devoted an entire chapter to him in his book <i><!--del_lnk--> Life on the Mississippi</i>, and Murrell was rumored to have an island headquarters on the river at <!--del_lnk--> Island 37.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Twain&#39;s book also extensively covered the <!--del_lnk--> steamboat races which took place from 1830 to 1870 on the river before more modern boating methods replaced the steamer. It was published first in serial form in <i><!--del_lnk--> Harper&#39;s Weekly</i> in seven parts in 1875 and was intended to chronicle the rapidly disappearing steamboat culture. The full version, including a passage from the unfinished <i><!--del_lnk--> Huckleberry Finn</i> and works from other authors, was published by <!--del_lnk--> James R. Osgood &amp; Co. in 1885. The first steamboat to travel the full length of the Mississippi from the Ohio River to New Orleans, Louisiana, was the <i>New Orleans</i> in December 1811. Its maiden voyage occurred during the series of <!--del_lnk--> New Madrid earthquakes in 1811&ndash;12.<p>In 1815, America retained control over the Mississippi by scoring a decisive victory over the British at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of New Orleans, part of the <!--del_lnk--> War of 1812.<p>The river was played a decisive role in the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Union&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Vicksburg Campaign called for Union control of the lower Mississippi River. The Union victory at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Vicksburg in 1863 was pivotal to the Union&#39;s final victory of the Civil War.<p>In 1848, the <!--del_lnk--> Illinois and Michigan Canal was built to connect the Mississippi River to <!--del_lnk--> Lake Michigan via the <!--del_lnk--> Illinois River near <!--del_lnk--> Peru, Illinois. In 1900, the canal was replaced by the <!--del_lnk--> Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. The canal allowed <a href="../../wp/c/Chicago.htm" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> to address specific health issues (<!--del_lnk--> typhoid, <a href="../../wp/c/Cholera.htm" title="Cholera">cholera</a> and other waterborne diseases) by sending its waste down the Illinois and Mississippi river systems rather than polluting its water source of Lake Michigan. The canal also provided a shipping route between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi.<p>The sport of <!--del_lnk--> water skiing was invented on the river in a wide region between Minnesota and Wisconsin known as <!--del_lnk--> Lake Pepin. <!--del_lnk--> Ralph Samuelson of <!--del_lnk--> Lake City, Minnesota, created and refined his skiing technique in late June and early July 1922. He later performed the first water ski jump in 1925 and was pulled along at 80 miles per hour (128 km/h) by a <!--del_lnk--> Curtiss <!--del_lnk--> flying boat later that year.<p><a name="1900s"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1900s</span></h3>
      <p>In the spring of 1927, the river broke out of its banks in 145 places during the <!--del_lnk--> Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and inundated 27,000 square miles (70,000 km&sup2;) to a depth of up to 30 feet (10 m).<p>On <!--del_lnk--> October 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1976, the automobile ferry <i><!--del_lnk--> MV George Prince</i> was struck by a ship traveling upstream as the ferry attempted to cross from <!--del_lnk--> Destrehan, Louisiana, to <!--del_lnk--> Luling, Louisiana. Seventy-eight passengers and crew died; only eighteen survived the accident.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Great Flood of 1993 was another significant flood, although it primarily affected the Mississippi above its confluence with the Ohio River at Cairo, Illinois.<p>Two portions of the Mississippi were designated as some of the <!--del_lnk--> American Heritage Rivers in 1997: The lower portion around Louisiana and Tennessee, and the upper portion around Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota and Missouri.<p><a id="Present" name="Present"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Present</span></h3>

      <p>The task of maintaining a navigation channel on the Mississippi is the responsibility of the U.S. Army <!--del_lnk--> Corps of Engineers, which began as early as 1829 removing snags, closing off secondary channels and excavating rocks and <!--del_lnk--> sandbars. In 1829, the Corps surveyed the two major obstacles on the upper Mississippi, the Des Moines Rapids and the Rock Island Rapids, where the river was shallow and the riverbed was rock. The Des Moines Rapids were about 11 miles (18 km) long and just above the mouth of the <!--del_lnk--> Des Moines River at <!--del_lnk--> Keokuk, Iowa. The Rock Island Rapids were between <!--del_lnk--> Rock Island and <!--del_lnk--> Moline, Illinois. Both rapids were considered virtually impassable.<p>On a side note, it is at this area of the Mississippi River that the river flows East to West as opposed to its normal course North to South. The area of the <!--del_lnk--> Quad Cities is known for this fast fact.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The Corps recommended excavation of a 5 foot (1.5 m) deep channel at the Des Moines Rapids, but work did not begin until after Lieutenant <!--del_lnk--> Robert E. Lee endorsed the project in 1837. The Corps later also began excavating the Rock Island Rapids. By 1866, it had become evident that excavation was impractical, and it was decided to build a canal around the Des Moines Rapids. The canal opened in 1877, but the Rock Island Rapids remained an obstacle.<p>In 1878, Congress authorized the Corps to establish a 4.5 foot (1.4 m) channel deep to be obtained by building wing dams which direct the river to a narrow channel causing it to cut a deeper channel, by closing secondary channels and by dredging. The channel project was complete when the Moline Lock, which bypassed the Rock Island Rapids, opened in 1907.<p>To improve navigation between <!--del_lnk--> St. Paul, Minnesota, and <!--del_lnk--> Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, the Corps constructed several dams on lakes in the headwaters area, including Lake Winnibigoshish and Lake Pokegama. The dams, which were built beginning in the 1880s, stored spring run-off which was released during low water to help maintain channel depth.<p>In 1907, Congress authorized a 6 foot (1.8 m) deep channel project on the Mississippi, which was not complete when it was abandoned in the late 1920s in favour of the 9 foot (2.7 m) deep channel project.<p>In 1913, construction was complete on a dam at Keokuk, Iowa, the first dam below St. Anthony Falls. Built by a private power company to generate electricity, the Keokuk dam was one of the largest hydro-electric plants in the world at the time. The dam also eliminated the Des Moines Rapids.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Lock and Dam No. 1 was completed in Minneapolis in 1917 and Lock and Dam No. 2 at <!--del_lnk--> Hastings, Minnesota, was completed in 1930.<p>Prior to the 1927 flood, the Corps&#39; primary strategy was to close off as many side channels as possible to increase the flow in the main river. It was thought that the river&#39;s velocity would scour off bottom sediments, deepening the river and decreasing the possibility of flooding. The 1927 flood proved this so wrong that communities threatened by the flood began to make their own levee breaks to relieve the tension of the rising river.<p>The Corps now actively creates floodways to divert periodic water surges into backwater channels and lakes. The main floodways are the Birds Point-New Madrid Floodway; the Morganza Floodway, which directs floodwaters down the Atchafalaya River; and the <!--del_lnk--> Bonnet Carr&eacute; Spillway which directs water to <!--del_lnk--> Lake Pontchartrain. The Old River Control structure also serve as a major floodgates that can be opened to prevent flooding. Some of the pre-1927 strategy is still in use today; the Corps actively cuts the necks of horseshoe bends, allowing the water to move faster and reducing flood heights.<p>The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1930 authorized the 9-foot channel project, which called for a navigation channel 9 feet deep and 400 feet (120&nbsp;m) wide to accommodate multiple-barge tows. This was achieved by a series of locks and dams, and by dredging. Twenty-three new locks and dams were built on the upper Mississippi in the 1930s in addition to the three already in existence. Two new locks were built north of Lock and Dam No. 1 at Saint Anthony Falls in the 1960s, extending the <!--del_lnk--> head of navigation for commercial traffic several miles, but few barges go past the city of Saint Paul today.<p>Beginning in the 1970s, the Corps applied <!--del_lnk--> hydrology transport models to analyze flood flow and water quality of the Mississippi.<div class="thumb tleft">

Lock and Dam 27, which consists of a low-water dam and an 8.4 mile (13.5&nbsp;km) long canal, was added in 1953 just below the confluence with the Missouri River, primarily to bypass a series of rock ledges at St. Louis. It also serves to protect the St. Louis city water intakes during times of low water.<p>Dam 26 at Alton, Illinois, which had structural problems, was replaced by the Mel Price Lock and Dam in 1990. The original Lock and Dam 26 was demolished.<p>

      <p>The first bridge across the Mississippi River was built in 1856. It spanned the river between <!--del_lnk--> Arsenal Island at <!--del_lnk--> Rock Island, Illinois and <!--del_lnk--> Davenport, Iowa. Steamboat pilots of the day, fearful of competition from the railroads, considered the new bridge &quot;a hazard to navigation&quot;. Two weeks after the bridge opened, the steamboat <i>Effie Afton</i> rammed part of the bridge and started it on fire. Legal proceedings ensued - with a young lawyer named <a href="../../wp/a/Abraham_Lincoln.htm" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> defending the railroad. The lawsuit went all the way up to the <a href="../../wp/s/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States.htm" title="Supreme Court of the United States">Supreme Court</a>, and was eventually ruled in favour of Lincoln and the railroad.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Many of the works of <a href="../../wp/m/Mark_Twain.htm" title="Mark Twain">Mark Twain</a> deal with or take place near the Mississippi River. One of his first major works, <i><!--del_lnk--> Life on the Mississippi,</i> is in part a history of the river, in part a memoir of Twain&#39;s experiences on the river, and a collection of tales that either take place on or are associated with the river. Twain&#39;s most famous work, <i><!--del_lnk--> Huckleberry Finn,</i> is largely a journey down the river. The novel works as an episodic meditation on American culture with the river as the central metaphor.<p><!--del_lnk--> Herman Melville&#39;s novel <i><!--del_lnk--> The Confidence-Man</i> portrayed a <!--del_lnk--> Canterbury Tales-style group of steamboat passengers whose interlocking stories are told as they travel up the Mississippi River. The novel is written both as cultural satire and a metaphysical treatise. Like <i><!--del_lnk--> Huckleberry Finn,</i> it uses the Mississippi River as a metaphor for the larger aspects of American and human identity that unify the otherwise disparate characters. The river&#39;s fluidity is reflected by the often shifting personalities and identities of Melville&#39;s &quot;confidence man.&quot;<p>The 2nd chapter (&quot;The Master of the Mississippi&quot;) of <!--del_lnk--> Don Rosa&#39;s famous comic book <!--del_lnk--> The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck about the &quot;Last of the Clan McDucks&quot; is set on the Mississippi.
