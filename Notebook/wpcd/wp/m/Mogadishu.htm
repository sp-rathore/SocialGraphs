      <p>Trade connected Somalis in the Mogadishu area to other communities along the Indian coast as early as <a href="../../wp/a/Anno_Domini.htm" title="Anno Domini">AD</a> 800. Muslims from the <!--del_lnk--> Arabian Peninsula colonized Mogadishu circa 900. The relative affluence of these settlers made them powerful in Somalia. Inter-marriage with the locals produced economically beneficial relationships. Mogadishu was well suited to become a regional centre. While the majority of the Somali coast is arid, the area around Mogadishu is more suitable to agriculture and could support a larger population. It is also the northernmost site in East Africa with a good natural harbour.<p>The northernmost of the East African <!--del_lnk--> city-states, Mogadishu prospered with trade with the interior, which spread Islam throughout Somalia. Beginning about 1000, trade increased among the Swahili cities of coastal East Africa. This trade drove the Mogadishu economy by the early 1100s. The origin of the name &quot;Mogadishu&quot; is unclear; one version claims it as the Somali version of the <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic language</a> and/or <!--del_lnk--> Persian name &quot;maqad shah&quot; (imperial seat of the shah). The historic Mosque of <!--del_lnk--> Fakr ad-Din, built 1269, still stands.<p>Archaeological excavations have recovered many coins from <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Annam. The majority of the Chinese coins date to the <!--del_lnk--> Song Dynasty, although the <a href="../../wp/m/Ming_Dynasty.htm" title="Ming Dynasty">Ming Dynasty</a> and <a href="../../wp/q/Qing_Dynasty.htm" title="Qing Dynasty">Qing Dynasty</a> &quot;are also represented,&quot;<sup>2</sup> according to Richard R.K. Pankhurst. The trading <!--del_lnk--> Zanj city-states of the <!--del_lnk--> Swahili civilization imported Arabic pottery, Chinese porcelain, and Indian cloth. They exported wood, ivory, shells, slaves, and iron. <!--del_lnk--> Kilwa, which dominated the gold trade from the <!--del_lnk--> Great Zimbabwe, ultimately eclipsed Mogadishu, <!--del_lnk--> Lamu, <!--del_lnk--> Zanzibar, and other northern cities after the 1200s.<p>Trading across the Arabian Sea enabled major ports like Mogadishu to prosper during the later Middle Ages. Ross E. Dunn describes Mogadishu and other East African Muslim settlements as &quot;a kind of medieval America, a fertile, well-watered land of economic opportunity and a place of salvation from drought, famine, overpopulation, and war at home.&quot;<sup>1</sup><p>The abundance of food in Mogadishu around 1330 impressed visitor <a href="../../wp/i/Ibn_Battuta.htm" title="Ibn Battuta">Ibn Battuta</a>. He remarked that a single person &quot;eats as much as a whole company of us would eat, as a matter of habit, and they are corpulent and fat in the extreme.&quot;<sup>3</sup><p><a id="European_domination" name="European_domination"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">European domination</span></h3>

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> October 3, <!--del_lnk--> 1993, the <!--del_lnk--> United States Army Rangers and the army&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Delta Force went on a mission to capture two of Aidid&#39;s warlords. Although the mission was successful, five American army <!--del_lnk--> UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters were shot down during the battle (two in the city [Durant&#39;s &quot;Super 64&quot; and Wolcot&#39;s &quot;Super 61&quot;] and 3 at a safe area), causing about 100 <!--del_lnk--> United States Army Rangers and Delta Force operators to be pinned down in the city, trying to rescue survivors and recover the dead. In this <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Mogadishu, the Somalis killed 18, one soldier three days later in a mortar strike and 1 Malaysian soldier and injured several dozen. Estimates put the number of Somali casualties at 500-1000 militia and civilians dead and 3000-4000 injured. The later nonfiction books <!--del_lnk--> Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War, <!--del_lnk--> In The Company Of Heroes, and motion picture <i><!--del_lnk--> Black Hawk Down</i> dramatized the events of this battle.<p>With these casualties, <a href="../../wp/p/President_of_the_United_States.htm" title="President of the United States">United States President</a> <a href="../../wp/b/Bill_Clinton.htm" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> withdrew American forces in 1994.

      <p>Excessive Isbaros {checkpoints} and violence continued to rule Mogadishu and much of southern Somalia through the late 1990s and early 2000s, including the deaths of British Aid workers <!--del_lnk--> Dick and Enid Eyeington in 2003. Now clans have established territory for themselves and claim independence from the Republic of Somalia. All attempts to restore state order, by forming transitional governments while in exile, have failed.<p>&lrm;<p>On <!--del_lnk--> October 10, <!--del_lnk--> 2004, Somali MPs elected <!--del_lnk--> Abdullahi Yusuf, president of <!--del_lnk--> Puntland, to be the next president. Because of the chaotic situation in Mogadishu, the election was held in a sports centre in <a href="../../wp/n/Nairobi.htm" title="Nairobi">Nairobi</a>, <a href="../../wp/k/Kenya.htm" title="Kenya">Kenya</a>. Yusuf was elected transitional President by Somalia&#39;s transitional parliament. He won 189 of the 275 votes from Parliament. The session of Parliament was also held in Nairobi. His government is recognized by most western nations as the country&#39;s legitimate rulers, though his actual authority is extremely questionable. Right now the government refuses to enter Mogadishu due to security concerns and continuous fighting in the capital.<p>The worst clan warfare continues on the north side of the city; the southern neighborhoods, by contrast, experience significantly less violence and more prosperity. Some southern neighborhoods are rather safe and affluent enough to contain Somali-style mansions.<p>Currently Mogadishu is the only capital in the world where the UN does not have access for <!--del_lnk--> international humanitarian staff, due to insecurity, despite an estimated 250,000 internally displaced living in the city.

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> 7 May <!--del_lnk--> 2006, fighting broke out between <!--del_lnk--> Islamist militias and an alliance of Somali warlords over control of Mogadishu. The three rival groups in Somalia are the transitional government, the <!--del_lnk--> Islamic Court Union (ICU), and the <!--del_lnk--> Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counter-Terrorism (ARPCT). Accroding to the <!--del_lnk--> UN report, the interim government received arms and up to 8,000 troops from <a href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia.htm" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, <a href="../../wp/y/Yemen.htm" title="Yemen">Yemen</a> and <a href="../../wp/u/Uganda.htm" title="Uganda">Uganda</a> and the ICU receives weapons from <a href="../../wp/e/Eritrea.htm" title="Eritrea">Eritrea</a>, <a href="../../wp/d/Djibouti.htm" title="Djibouti">Djibouti</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Libya.htm" title="Libya">Libya</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Saudi_Arabia.htm" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> and even <!--del_lnk--> Hezbollah.<!--del_lnk-->  However accuracy of this report is disputed.<!--del_lnk-->  The <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> has in past admitted financing of the ARPCT.<p>Most of the combat is concentrated in the Sii-Sii (often written &quot;CC&quot; in English) district in northern Mogadishu with both the Islamist militias and the secular warlords fighting for control of Mogadishu. Though the Bush administration has neither confirmed nor denied support, American officials have anonymously confirmed that the U.S. is funding the ARPCT, due to concerns that the ICU has ties to <!--del_lnk--> al-Qaeda and is sheltering three al-Qaeda leaders indicted in the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in <a href="../../wp/k/Kenya.htm" title="Kenya">Kenya</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Tanzania.htm" title="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>. It is believed that this al-Qaeda cell was also responsible for a 2002 suicide bombing of an Israeli-owned hotel in Kenya that killed fifteen people and a simultaneous failed attempt to shoot down an Israeli airliner over the country. <!--del_lnk--> <p>The fighting parties signed a cease-fire agreement on <!--del_lnk--> 14 May <!--del_lnk--> 2006 and as of <!--del_lnk--> 21 May, the Somali Cabinet suggested that <a href="../../wp/u/Uganda.htm" title="Uganda">Ugandan</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Sudan.htm" title="Sudan">Sudanese</a> peacekeepers come to try and improve security.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> United Nations Security Council has rejected recommendations for tighter control of illegal weapons in Somalia and for targeted sanctions.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 5 June <!--del_lnk--> 2006, the ICU militia seized Mogadishu, raising concerns in the U.S. due to suspected al-Qaeda links. While the ICU has consolidated control over Mogadishu, a transitional UN-supported government still exists in Baidoa; it is believed that the ICU may attempt to overthrow this government next. <!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Culture_and_economy" name="Culture_and_economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture and economy</span></h2>

      <p>Mogadishu serves as a commercial and financial centre. The economy recovered somewhat from the worst civil unrest although the civil war still presents problems. The effective absence of government yields free trade without taxes or regulatory expenditures, making business relatively inexpensive. Businesses have hired armed militias to provide security against gunmen, leading to a gradual reduction in street violence.<div class="thumb tleft">
