      <p>The <b>Mandan</b> are a <!--del_lnk--> Native American tribe that historically lived along the banks of the <a href="../../wp/m/Missouri_River.htm" title="Missouri River">Missouri River</a> and its tributaries, the <!--del_lnk--> Heart and <!--del_lnk--> Knife Rivers in present-day <!--del_lnk--> North and <!--del_lnk--> South Dakota. Unlike many neighboring tribes in the <!--del_lnk--> Great Plains region, the Mandan practiced agriculture and established permanent villages. These villages were composed of round <!--del_lnk--> earthen lodges surrounding a central plaza. In addition to farming, the Mandan gathered wild plants and berries and hunted <!--del_lnk--> buffalo. In contrast to the other tribes in the region, which led a <!--del_lnk--> nomadic existence following herds of buffalo, the Mandan developed a religious ceremony known as the Okipa, with the dual purpose of attracting buffalo and renewing the world for another year.<p>Archaeological research suggests the Mandan people migrated from the <!--del_lnk--> Ohio River valley to the banks of the Missouri River. They were first encountered by Europeans along the Missouri in <!--del_lnk--> 1738. The Mandan&#39;s friendliness and willingness to trade brought many traders and <!--del_lnk--> fur trappers to their villages over the next century. By the turn of the 19th century, because of attacks by neighboring tribes and epidemics of <a href="../../wp/s/Smallpox.htm" title="Smallpox">smallpox</a> and <!--del_lnk--> whooping cough, the numbers of the Mandan had diminished dramatically. Beginning in 1837, a major smallpox outbreak reduced the number of Mandan to approximately 125. With such meager numbers, the Mandan banded together with two neighboring tribes, the <!--del_lnk--> Arikara and <!--del_lnk--> Hidatsa.<p>In an effort to establish good relations, the U.S. government founded the Fort Berthold Agency to care for the combined tribes. The Agency soon set up the <!--del_lnk--> Fort Berthold Reservation. With the 1934 <!--del_lnk--> Indian Reorganization Act, the Mandan officially merged with the Hidatsa and the Arikara into the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Three Affiliated Tribes,&quot; known as the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation. About half of the Mandan still reside in the area of the reservation, the rest residing around the United States and in Canada.<p>

      <p>The English name <i>Mandan</i> is derived from similar <!--del_lnk--> exonyms from surrounding Siouan languages, such as <!--del_lnk--> Teton <i>Miw&aacute;t&#x105;ni</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Yanktonai <i>Miw&aacute;tani</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Yankton <i>Maw&aacute;tani</i> or <i>M&#x105;w&aacute;tan&#x12F;</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Dakota <i>Maw&aacute;t&#x105;na</i> or <i>Maw&aacute;tad&#x105;</i>, etc. The Mandan have used several terms at different times to refer to themselves:<ul>
       <li><i>R&#x173;w&#x105;&#x301;&#x294;ka&middot;ki</i> &quot;men, people&quot;: before 1837 (transcribed by Westerners as <i>Numakaki</i>, <i>Numangkake</i>)<li><i>W&#x12F;&#x301;&#x294;ti &#x172;&#x301;tah&#x105;kt</i> &quot;East Village&quot; (after the village of the same name): late 19th century (transcribed by Westerners as <i>Metutahanke</i> or <i>Mitutahankish</i>)<li><i>R&#x173;&#x301;&#x294;eta</i> &quot;ourselves, our people&quot; (originally the name of a specific division): the currently-used term</ul>
      <p>The Mandan probably used <i>R&#x173;w&#x105;&#x301;&#x294;ka&middot;ki</i> to refer to a general tribal entity. Later, this word fell to disuse and instead two divisions names were used, <i>Nuweta</i> or <i>Ruptare</i> (i.e. Mandan <i>R&#x173;&#x301;&#x294;eta</i>). Later the term, <i>R&#x173;&#x301;&#x294;eta</i> was extended to refer to a general tribal entity. The name <i>Mi-ah&acute;ta-n&#x113;s</i> recorded by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden in 1862 reportedly means &quot;people on the river bank&quot;, but this is may be a <!--del_lnk--> folk etymology. Various other terms and alternate spellings that occur in the literature including: May&aacute;tana, May&aacute;tani, M&#x105;w&aacute;dan&#x12F;, M&#x105;w&aacute;d&#x105;&delta;&#x12F;, Huatanis, Mandani, Wahtani, Mantannes, Mantons, Mendanne, Mandanne, Mandians, Maw-d&acirc;n, Meandans, les Mandals, Me-too&acute;-ta-h&auml;k, Numakshi, R&#x173;w&#x105;&#x301;&#x294;k&scaron;i, W&iacute;hwatann, Mevatan, Mevataneo. Gloria Jahoda in her book <i>Trail of Tears</i> states that they also call themselves the &quot;Pheasant people.&quot;<p><a id="Language" name="Language"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Language</span></h2>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Mandan language belongs to the <!--del_lnk--> Siouan language family. It was initially thought to be closely related to the languages of the <!--del_lnk--> Hidatsa and the <!--del_lnk--> Crow. However, since the Mandan language has been in <!--del_lnk--> contact with Hidatsa and Crow for many years, the exact relationship between Mandan and other Siouan languages (including Hidatsa and Crow) has been obscured and is currently undetermined. For this reason, Mandan is most often considered to be a separate branch of the Siouan family.<p>Mandan has two main <!--del_lnk--> dialects: Nuptare and Nuetare. Only the Nuptare variety survived into the 20th century, and all speakers were bilingual in Hidatsa. Linguist <!--del_lnk--> Mauricio Mixco of the <!--del_lnk--> University of Utah has been involved in fieldwork with remaining speakers since 1993. As of 1999, there were only six fluent speakers of Mandan still alive, though there are currently programs in local schools to encourage the use of the language.<p>The Mandan and their language received much attention from Euro-Americans because of their lighter skin colour, which some speculated was due to an ultimate European origin. In the <!--del_lnk--> 1830s, <!--del_lnk--> Prince Maximilian of Wied spent more time recording Mandan over all other Siouan languages and additionally prepared a comparison list of Mandan and <!--del_lnk--> Welsh words (he thought that the Mandan may be displaced Welsh). The theory of the Mandan/Welsh connection, now discounted, was also supported by <!--del_lnk--> George Catlin.<p>Mandan has different grammatical forms that depend on <a href="../../wp/g/Gender.htm" title="Gender">gender</a> of the <!--del_lnk--> addressee. Questions asked of men must use the <!--del_lnk--> suffix <i><span class="Unicode">-o&#x294;&scaron;a</span></i> while the suffix <i><span class="Unicode">-o&#x294;r&#x105;</span></i> is used when asking of women. Likewise the <!--del_lnk--> indicative suffix is <i><span class="Unicode">-o&#x294;s</span></i> when addressing men and <i><span class="Unicode">-o&#x294;re</span></i> when addressing women, and also for <!--del_lnk--> imperatives: <i><span class="Unicode">-ta</span></i> (male), <i><span class="Unicode">-r&#x105;</span></i> (female). Mandan, like many other North American languages, has elements of <!--del_lnk--> sound symbolism in their vocabulary. A <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/s/</span> sound often denotes smallness/less intensity, <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/&#x283;/</span> denotes medium-ness, <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/x/</span> denotes largeness/greater intensity:<ul>

      <p>One of the most recognizable features of the Mandan was their permanent villages made up of earthen lodges. Each lodge was circular with a <!--del_lnk--> dome-like roof and a square hole at the apex of the dome through which smoke could escape. The exterior was covered with a matting made from reeds and twigs and then covered with hay and earth. The lodge also featured a <!--del_lnk--> portico-type structure at the entrance. The interior had four large pillars upon which crossbeams supported the roof. These lodges were designed, built and owned by the women of the tribe, and ownership was passed through the female line. Lodges could hold up to 30 or 40 people and villages usually had around 120 lodges. Reconstructions of these lodges may be seen at <!--del_lnk--> Fort Abraham Lincoln State Park near <!--del_lnk--> Mandan, North Dakota, and the <!--del_lnk--> Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site. Originally lodges were rectangular, but around 1500 <!--del_lnk--> CE, lodges began to be constructed in a circular form. Towards the end of the 19th century, the Mandan began constructing small <!--del_lnk--> log cabins, usually with two rooms. When traveling or hunting, the Mandan would use skin <!--del_lnk--> tipis. Today, Mandan live in modern dwellings.<p>Villages were usually oriented around a central <!--del_lnk--> plaza that was used for games and ceremonial purposes. In the centre of the plaza was a tree surrounded by a wood enclosure representing the Lone Man, one of the main figures in Mandan mythology, who built a wooden wall thus saving the people of the world from a deluge. Villages were often situated on high bluffs over the river. Often, villages would be constructed at the meeting of tributaries in order to use the water as a natural barrier. Where there were few or no natural barriers, the villages utilized some type of fortification including ditches and <!--del_lnk--> palisades.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Some speculate that the lodging, religion, and occasional blue eyes among the Mandan were remnants of Viking explorers, who left the Kensington Runestone as evidence of contact with the plains Indians. <a id="Family_life" name="Family_life"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Family life</span></h3>
      <p>The Mandan were originally divided into thirteen <!--del_lnk--> clans organized around successful hunters and their kin. Each clan was expected to care for its own, including orphans and the elderly, from birth to death. Clans held a sacred bundle, which consisted of a few gathered objects believed to hold sacred powers. Those in possession of the bundles were considered to have sacred powers bestowed to them by the spirits and thus were considered the leaders of the clan and tribe.<p>Children were named ten days after their birth in a naming ceremony, which also officially linked the child with their family and clan. Girls would be taught domestic duties, farming, and how to keep a home, while boys were taught hunting and fishing, and would begin <!--del_lnk--> fasting at the age of ten or eleven. Marriage among the Mandan was generally arranged by members of one&#39;s own clan, though occasionally it would take place without the approval of the couple&#39;s parents. Divorce could be easily obtained.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Upon the death of a family member, a scaffold would be erected near the village to contain the body. The body would be placed with the head towards the northwest and feet to the southeast. (Southeast is the direction of the Ohio River Valley, from whence the Mandan came. The Mandan would not sleep in this orientation, because it invited death.) After a ceremony to send the spirit away, the family would mourn at the scaffold for four days. After the body rotted and the scaffold collapsed, the bones would be gathered up and buried except for the skull, which was placed in a circle near the village. Family members would visit the skulls and talk to them, sometimes bearing their problems or regaling the dead with jokes. After the Mandan moved onto the Fort Berthold Reservation, they resorted to placing the bodies in boxes or trunks or wrapped them in fur robes and placed them in rocky crevices.<p><a id="Subsistence" name="Subsistence"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Subsistence</span></h3>

      <p>The Mandan survived by hunting, farming and gathering wild plants, though some food came from trade. Mandan gardens were often located near river banks, where annual flooding would leave the most fertile soil, sometimes in locations miles from villages. The gardens were owned and tended by the women, and they would plant <a href="../../wp/m/Maize.htm" title="Maize">corn</a>, <!--del_lnk--> beans and <!--del_lnk--> squash, usually enough to last a single year.<p>The buffalo which the Mandan hunted played an important part in Mandan rituals; calling the buffalo near to the village being one of the main objectives of the Okipa ceremony at the beginning of each summer. In addition to eating the flesh, the Mandan used all remaining parts of the buffalo, so nothing went to waste. The hides were used for buffalo-fur robes or were tanned, and the leather used for clothing and other uses. The Mandan were known for their painted buffalo hides that often recorded historic events. The bones would be carved into items such as needles and <!--del_lnk--> fish hooks. Bones were also used in farming, such as the <!--del_lnk--> scapula, which was used as a <!--del_lnk--> hoe-like device for breaking the soil. Besides buffalo, the Mandan trapped small mammals for food and hunted <!--del_lnk--> deer. Deer <!--del_lnk--> antlers were used to create <!--del_lnk--> rake-like implements used in farming. Birds were hunted for feathers, which were used for adornment.<p><a id="Dress" name="Dress"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Dress</span></h3>

These items were often ornamented with quills and bird feathers and sometimes even the <!--del_lnk--> scalps of enemies.<p>Mandan women wore ankle-length dresses made of deerskin or sheepskin. This would often be girded at the waist with a wide belt. Sometimes the hem of the dress would be ornamented with pieces of buffalo <!--del_lnk--> hoof. Underneath the dress, <!--del_lnk--> leather leggings would be worn with ankle-high moccasins. Women&#39;s hair was worn straight down in braids.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>During the winter months, men would commonly wear deerskin tunics and leggings with moccasins. They also kept themselves warm by wearing a robe of buffalo fur. During the summer months, however, a loincloth of deerskin or sheepskin would often suffice. Unlike the women, men would wear various ornaments in their hair. The hair was parted across the top with three sections hanging down in front. Sometimes the hair would hang down the nose and would be curled upwards with a curling stick. The hair would hang to the shoulders on the side, and the back portion would sometimes reach to the waist. The long hair in the back would create a tail-like feature, as it would be gathered into braids then smeared with <a href="../../wp/c/Clay.htm" title="Clay">clay</a> and <!--del_lnk--> spruce gum then tied with cords of deerskin. Headdresses of feathers were often worn as well.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p><a id="Religion" name="Religion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h3>
      <p>Of the tribes living on the Great Plains, the Mandan&#39;s religion was one of the more complex. Much of their mythology centered on a figure known as <!--del_lnk--> Lone Man. Lone Man was involved in many of the creation myths as well as one of the deluge myths. In their <!--del_lnk--> creation myth, the world was created by two rival deities, the First Creator and the Lone Man. The Missouri River divided the two worlds that the beings created. First Creator created the lands to the south of the river with hills, valleys, trees, buffalo, <!--del_lnk--> antelope and snakes. To the north of the river, Lone Man created the Great Plains, domesticated animals, birds, fish and humans. The first humans lived underground near a large lake. Some of the more adventurous humans climbed a grapevine to the surface and discovered the two worlds. After returning underground they shared their findings and decided to return with many others. As they were climbing the grapevine it broke and half of the Mandan were left underground.<p>According to pre-Christian Mandan beliefs, each person possessed four different, immortal <!--del_lnk--> souls. The first soul was white and often seen as a shooting star. The second soul was colored a light brown and was seen in the form of the <!--del_lnk--> meadowlark. The third soul, called the lodge spirit, remained at the site of the lodge after death and would remain there forever. The final soul was black and after death would travel away from the village. These final souls existed as did living people; residing in their own villages, farming and hunting.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>One notable feature of the Mandan&rsquo;s religious life was the Okipa, which was first recorded by George Catlin. The ceremony opened with a Bison Dance followed by a variety of torturous ordeals through which warriors proved their courage and gained the approval of the <!--del_lnk--> spirits. The Okipa began with the warriors sitting with smiling faces while the skin of their chest was pierced with sticks. Using the sticks to support the weight of their bodies, the warriors would be suspended from the roof of the lodge and would hang there until they fainted. After fainting, the warrior would be pulled down and the men (women were not allowed to attend this ceremony) would watch the warrior until he awoke, proving the spirits&#39; approval. After awakening, the warrior would sacrifice the little finger on both hands, each finger being severed by a <!--del_lnk--> medicine man with a knife. Finally, the warrior would be taken outside where he would run around the central plaza of the village a number of times. Those finishing the ceremony were seen as being honored by the spirits; those completing the ceremony twice would gain everlasting fame among the tribe. Chief Four Bears, or Ma-to-toh-pe, completed this ceremony twice. The last Okipa ceremony was performed in 1889 but the ceremony was resurrected in a somewhat different form in 1983. The version of the Okipa as practiced by the <!--del_lnk--> Lakota may be seen in the 1970 film <i><!--del_lnk--> A Man Called Horse</i> starring <!--del_lnk--> Richard Harris.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Like all Native American peoples, the exact origins and early history of the Mandan is unknown. Early studies by linguists gave evidence that the Mandan language may have been closely related to the language of the <!--del_lnk--> Ho-Chunk or Winnebago people of present-day <!--del_lnk--> Wisconsin, which has given rise to the theory that they may have settled in the region at one time. This idea is possibly confirmed in their mythology, where reference is made to having come from an eastern location near a lake.<p>Ethnologists and scholars studying the Mandan subscribe to the theory that, like other Sioux people (possibly including the Hidatsa), they originated in the area of the upper <a href="../../wp/m/Mississippi_River.htm" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Ohio River in present-day <!--del_lnk--> Ohio. If this is the case, the Mandan would have migrated north towards the Missouri River valley and its tributary the Heart River in present-day <!--del_lnk--> North Dakota, where Europeans first encountered them. This migration is believed to have occurred possibly as early as the 7th century but probably between 1000 CE and the 13th century.<p>After their arrival on the banks of the Heart River, the Mandan constructed nine villages, two on the east side of the river and seven on the west side. At some point during this time, the Hidatsa people also moved into the region. Mandan tradition states that the Hidatsa were a nomadic tribe until their encounter with the Mandan, who taught them to build stationary villages and agriculture. The Hidatsa continued to maintain amicable relations with the Mandan and constructed villages north of them on the Knife River.<p><a id="European_encounter" name="European_encounter"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">European encounter</span></h3>

      <p>The first encounter with Europeans occurred with the visit of the French Canadian trader <!--del_lnk--> Sieur de la Verendrye in 1738. It is estimated that at the time of his visit there were approximately 15,000 Mandan residing in the nine villages on the Heart River. <a href="../../wp/h/Horse.htm" title="Horses">Horses</a> were acquired by the Mandan in the mid-18th century and were used for transportation and hunting. The horses helped with the expansion of Mandan hunting territory. The encounter with the French in the 18th century created a trading link between the French and the Native Americans of the region with the Mandan serving as <!--del_lnk--> middlemen in the of trade in furs, horses, <!--del_lnk--> guns, crops and buffalo products.<p>In 1796 the Mandan were visited by the Welsh explorer <!--del_lnk--> John Evans, who was hoping to find proof that their language contained Welsh words. Evans spent the winter of 1796-7 with the Mandan, but found no evidence of any Welsh influence.<p>By 1804 when <!--del_lnk--> Lewis and Clark visited the tribe, the number of Mandan had been greatly reduced due to smallpox epidemics and warring bands of <!--del_lnk--> Assiniboins, <!--del_lnk--> Lakotas and Arikaras (whom they would later join together with to fight against the Lakota). The nine villages at this point had consolidated into two villages. The Lewis and Clark expedition met with such hospitality in the Upper Missouri River villages that the expedition stopped there for the winter. In honour of their hosts, the expedition dubbed the settlement they constructed Fort Mandan. It was here that Lewis and Clark first met <!--del_lnk--> Sakakawea, a <!--del_lnk--> Shoshone woman who had been captured by the Hidatsa. Sakakawea guided the expedition westward towards the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. Upon their return to the Mandan villages, Lewis and Clark took the Mandan Chief Sheheke (Coyote or Big White) to Washington to meet with President <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Jefferson.htm" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>. Chief Sheheke died in Washington, D.C. in 1806.<p>In 1833, artist <!--del_lnk--> George Catlin visited the Mandan. Catlin painted and drew scenes of Mandan life as well as portraits of chiefs including <!--del_lnk--> Four Bears or Ma-to-toh-pe. His skill at rendering so impressed Four Bears that Catlin was the first man of European descent to be allowed to watch the Okipa ceremony. Catlin believed the Mandan were the &quot;Welsh Indians&quot; of folklore, the descendants Prince <!--del_lnk--> Madoc and his followers who had emigrated to America from <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a> circa 1170, a view that was then popular but is not accepted by the bulk of scholarship today. The winter months of 1833 and 1834 brought Prince <!--del_lnk--> Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied and Swiss artist <!--del_lnk--> Karl Bodmer to stay with the Mandan.<p><a id="Smallpox_epidemic_of_1837.E2.80.9338" name="Smallpox_epidemic_of_1837.E2.80.9338"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Smallpox epidemic of 1837&ndash;38</span></h3>

      <p>The Mandan were first plagued by smallpox in the 16th century and had been hit by similar epidemics every few decades. Between 1837 and 1838, another smallpox epidemic swept the region. In June 1837, an <!--del_lnk--> American Fur Company steamboat traveled westward up the Missouri River from St. Louis. Its passengers and traders aboard infected the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara tribes. There were approximately 1,600 Mandan living in the two villages at that time. The disease effectively destroyed the Mandan settlements. Almost all the tribal members, including the <!--del_lnk--> chief, Four Bears, died. Estimates of the number of survivors vary from only 27 individuals to up to 150, though most sources usually give the number 125. The survivors banded together with the nearby Hidatsa in 1845 and created <!--del_lnk--> Like-a-Fishhook Village.<p><a id="Late_19th_and_the_20th_centuries" name="Late_19th_and_the_20th_centuries"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Late 19th and the 20th centuries</span></h3>

      <p>The Mandan joined with the Arikara in 1862. By this time, Like-a-Fishhook Village had become a major centre of trade in the region. By the 1880s, though, the village was abandoned. With the second half of the 19th century there was a gradual decrease in the holdings of the Three Affiliated Tribes (the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara). The <!--del_lnk--> Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 recognized 12 million acres (49,000 km&sup2;) of land in the territory owned jointly by these tribes. With the creation of the Fort Berthold Reservation by <!--del_lnk--> Executive Order on <!--del_lnk--> 12 April <!--del_lnk--> 1870, the federal government recognized the holdings as only being 8 million acres (32,000 km&sup2;). On <!--del_lnk--> 1 July <!--del_lnk--> 1880, another executive order deprived the tribes of 7 million acres (28,000 km&sup2;) lying outside the boundaries of the reservation.<p>With the arrival of the 20th century, the government seized more land, and by 1910, the reservation had shrunk to a mere 900,000 acres (3,600 km&sup2;). This land is located in <!--del_lnk--> Dunn, <!--del_lnk--> McKenzie, <!--del_lnk--> McLean, <!--del_lnk--> Mercer, <!--del_lnk--> Mountrail and <!--del_lnk--> Ward counties in North Dakota. In 1951, the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began construction of <!--del_lnk--> Garrison Dam on the Missouri River. This dam created <!--del_lnk--> Lake Sakakawea, which flooded portions of the Fort Berthold Reservation including the villages of Fort Berthold and Elbowoods as well as a number of other villages. The former residents of these villages were moved and <!--del_lnk--> New Town was established for them.<p>While a new town was constructed for the displaced tribal members, much damage was done to the social and economic foundations of the reservation. The flooding claimed approximately one quarter of the reservations land. This land contained some of the most fertile agricultural land upon which the agricultural economy had been constructed. In addition, the flooding claimed the sites of historic villages and archaeological sites.<p><a id="Present_day" name="Present_day"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Present day</span></h3>
      <p>The Mandan and the two related tribes while being combined have intermarried but do maintain, as a whole, the varied traditions of their ancestors. The last full-blood Mandan died in 1971. The tribal residents have recovered from the trauma of their displacement in the 1950s and part of their recovery has been aided by two recent additions to New Town. The Four Bears Casino and Lodge was constructed in 1993 drawing tourists and money to the impoverished reservation. The most recent addition to the New Town area has been the new <!--del_lnk--> Four Bears Bridge, which was built in a joint effort between the three tribes and the North Dakota Department of Transportation. The bridge, spanning the Missouri River, replaces an older Four Bears Bridge that was built in 1955. The new bridge&mdash;the largest bridge in the state of North Dakota&mdash;is decorated with medallions celebrating the cultures of the three tribes. The bridge was opened to traffic <!--del_lnk--> 2 September <!--del_lnk--> 2005 and was officially opened in a ceremony on the <!--del_lnk--> 3 October.<p>
