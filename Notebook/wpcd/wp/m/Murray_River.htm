      <p>The <b>Murray River</b>, or <b>River Murray</b>, is <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>&#39;s second-longest <a href="../../wp/r/River.htm" title="River">river</a> in its own right (the longest being its tributary the <a href="../../wp/d/Darling_River.htm" title="Darling River">Darling</a>). At 2,575 <!--del_lnk--> kilometres (1,600 <!--del_lnk--> miles) in length, the Murray rises in the <!--del_lnk--> Australian Alps, draining the western side of Australia&#39;s highest mountains and, for most of its length, meanders across Australia&#39;s inland plains, forming the border between <!--del_lnk--> New South Wales and <!--del_lnk--> Victoria as it flows to the northwest, before turning south for its final 500 kilometres or so into <!--del_lnk--> South Australia. The waters of the Murray flow through several lakes that fluctuate in <!--del_lnk--> salinity (and were often fresh in the 1800s) including <!--del_lnk--> Lake Alexandrina and <!--del_lnk--> The Coorong before emptying through the <!--del_lnk--> Murray mouth into the <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Ocean.htm" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> (<a href="../../wp/s/Southern_Ocean.htm" title="Southern Ocean">Southern Ocean</a> according to Australian maps) near <!--del_lnk--> Goolwa. Despite discharging considerable volumes of water at times, particularly before the advent of large scale river regulation, the <!--del_lnk--> Murray mouth has always been comparatively small and shallow.<p>

      </div>
      <p>The Murray River forms part of the 3,750 kilometre (2,300 miles) long combined <!--del_lnk--> Murray-Darling river system which drains most of inland Victoria, New South Wales, and southern <!--del_lnk--> Queensland. Overall the catchment area is one seventh of Australia&#39;s land mass. The Murray carries only a small fraction of the <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a> of comparably-sized rivers in other parts of the world, and with a great annual variability of its flow. In its natural state it has even been known to dry up completely in extreme <a href="../../wp/d/Drought.htm" title="Drought">drought</a>, although that is extremely rare, with only two or three instances of this occurring.<p>The Murray makes up much of the border of the Australian states of Victoria and New South Wales. The border is generally agreed upon to be the southern high water mark of the river. This boundary definition can be ambiguous, as the river has changed its course slightly since the boundary was defined in <!--del_lnk--> 1851.<p>West of the 141&deg;E line of <!--del_lnk--> longitude, the river continues as the Victoria - South Australia border for 3.6 km. This was due to a miscalculation in the <!--del_lnk--> 1840s when the border was originally surveyed. Past this point, the Murray River is entirely within the state of South Australia.<p><a id="River_Life" name="River_Life"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">River Life</span></h2>
      <p>The Murray River (and associated tributaries) support a variety of unique river life adapted to its vagaries. This includes a variety of native fish such as the famous <!--del_lnk--> Murray cod, <!--del_lnk--> Trout cod, <!--del_lnk--> Golden perch, <!--del_lnk--> Macquarie perch, <!--del_lnk--> Silver perch, <!--del_lnk--> Eel-tailed Catfish, <!--del_lnk--> Australian Smelt and <!--del_lnk--> Western Carp Gudgeon, to name a few, and other aquatic species like the <!--del_lnk--> Murray Short-necked Turtle, <!--del_lnk--> Murray River Crayfish, Broad-clawed yabbies and the clawed <i>Macrobrachium</i> shrimp, as well as aquatic species more widely distributed through south-eastern Australia such as Common Long-necked Turtles, <!--del_lnk--> common Yabbies, Water Rats and <a href="../../wp/p/Platypus.htm" title="Platypus">Platypus</a>. The Murray River also supports fringing corridors and forests of the famous <!--del_lnk--> River Red Gum.<p>The health of the Murray River has declined significantly since European settlement, particularly due to river regulation, and much of its aquatic life including native fish are now declining, rare or endangered. Recent extreme droughts (2003-2004) have put significant stress on River Red Gum forests, with mounting concern over their long term survival.<p>Introduced fish species such as <!--del_lnk--> Carp, <!--del_lnk--> Gambusia, Weather Loach, <!--del_lnk--> Redfin perch and <!--del_lnk--> Brown Trout and <!--del_lnk--> Rainbow Trout have also had serious negative effects on native fish, while <!--del_lnk--> Carp have contributed to environmental degradation of the Murray River and tributaries by destroying aquatic plants and permanently raising turbidity. In some segments of the Murray, Carp have been the only species found<p><a id="Ancient_History" name="Ancient_History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Ancient History</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Lake_Bungunia" name="Lake_Bungunia"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Lake Bungunia</span></h3>
      <p>Between 2.5 and 0.5 million years ago the Murray River terminated in a vast freshwater lake called Lake Bungunia. Lake Bungunnia was formed by earth movement that blocked the Murray River near <!--del_lnk--> Swan Reach during this period of time. At its maximum extent Lake Bungunia covered 33,000 square kilometres, extending to near the Menindee Lakes in the north and to near <!--del_lnk--> Boundary Bend on the Murray in south. The draining of Lake Bungunnia approximately 0.5 million years ago must have been a dramatic event. Deep clays deposited by the lake are evident in cliffs around Chowilla in <!--del_lnk--> South Australia. Considerably higher rainfall would have been required to keep such a lake full; the draining of Lake Bungunnia appears to mark the end of a wet phase in the history of the <!--del_lnk--> Murray-Darling Basin and the onset of widespread arid conditions similar to today. A species of <i>Neoceratodus</i> <!--del_lnk--> lungfish existed in Lake Bungunnia; today <i>Neoceratodus</i> lungfish are only found in several <!--del_lnk--> Queensland rivers.<p><a id="Cadell_Fault_and_formation_of_the_Barmah_Red_Gum_Forests" name="Cadell_Fault_and_formation_of_the_Barmah_Red_Gum_Forests"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cadell Fault and formation of the Barmah Red Gum Forests</span></h3>
      <p>The famous Barmah Red Gum Forests owe their existence to the Cadell Fault. About 25,000 years BP, displacement occurred along the Cadell fault, raising the eastern edge of the fault (which runs north-south) 8-12 metres above the floodplain. This created a complex series of events. A section of the original Murray River channel immediately behind the fault was abandoned, and exists today as an empty channel known as Green Gully. The Goulburn River was dammed by the southern end of the fault to create a natural lake. The Murray River flowed to the north around the Cadell Fault, creating the channel of the Edwards River which exists today and through which much of the Murray River&#39;s waters still flow. Then the natural dam on the Goulburn River failed, the lake drained, and the Murray River avulsed to the south and started to flow through the smaller Goulburn River channel, creating &quot;The Barmah Choke&quot; and &quot;The Narrows&quot; (where the river channel is unusually narrow), before entering into the proper Murray River channel again.<p>This complex series of events however divert attention from the primary result of the Cadell Fault. The primary result of the Cadell Fault is that the west-flowing water of the Murray River strikes the north-south running fault and diverts both north and south around the fault in the two main channels (Edwards and ancestral Goulburn) as well as a fan of small streams, and regularly floods a large amount of low-lying country in the area. These conditions are perfect for River Red Gums, which rapidly formed forests in the area. Thus the displacement of the Cadell Fault 25,000 BP lead directly to the formation of the famous Barmah River Red Gum Forests<p>The Barmah Choke and The Narrows mean the amount of water that can travel down this part of the Murray River is restricted. In times of flood and high irrigation flows the majority of the water, in addition to flooding the Red Gum forests, actually travels through the Edwards River channel. The Murray River has not had enough flow power to naturally enlarge The Barmah Choke and The Narrows to increase the amount of water they can carry.<p>The town of <!--del_lnk--> Barmah, Victoria is unusual in that it is north of part of New South Wales, although everywhere else Victoria is south of New South Wales. Echuca on the map above is very close to Barmah.<p>The Cadell Fault is quite noticeable as a continuous, low, earthen embankment as one drives into Barmah from the west, although to the untrained eye it may appear man-made.<p><a id="Murray_Mouth" name="Murray_Mouth"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Murray Mouth</span></h2>

      <p>The Murray Mouth is the point at which the Murray river meets the <a href="../../wp/s/Southern_Ocean.htm" title="Southern Ocean">Southern Ocean</a>. Since the early <!--del_lnk--> 2000s, <!--del_lnk--> dredging machines have operated at the Murray Mouth, moving sand from the channel to maintain a minimal flow from the sea and into the <!--del_lnk--> Coorong&#39;s lagoon system. Without the 24 hour dredging, the Mouth would silt up and close, cutting the supply of fresh sea-water into the <!--del_lnk--> Coorong, which would then warm up, stagnate and die.<p><a id="Mythology" name="Mythology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Mythology</span></h2>
      <p>Being one of the major river systems in one of the driest continents of Earth, the Murray has significant cultural relevance to <!--del_lnk--> Indigenous Australians. According to the peoples of <!--del_lnk--> Lake Alexandrina, the Murray was created by the tracks of the Great Ancestor, <!--del_lnk--> Ngurunderi, as he pursued <!--del_lnk--> Pondi, the <!--del_lnk--> Murray Cod. The chase originated in the interior of New South Wales. Ngurunderi pursued the fish (who, like many totem animals in Aboriginal myths, is often portrayed as a man) on rafts (or <i>lala</i>) made from <!--del_lnk--> red gums and continually launched spears at his target. But Ponde was a wily prey and carved a weaving path, carving out the river&#39;s various tributaries. Ngurundi was forced to beach his rafts, and often create new ones as he changed from reach to reach of the river.<p>At Kobathatang, Ngurunderi finally got lucky, and struck Pondi in the tail with a spear. However, the shock to the fish was so great it launched him forward in a straight line to a place called Peindjalang, near <!--del_lnk--> Tailem Bend. Eager to rectify his failure to catch his prey, the hunter and his two wives (sometimes the escaped sibling wives of <!--del_lnk--> Waku and Kanu) hurried on, and took positions high on the cliff on which Tailem Bend now stands. They sprung an ambush on Ponde only to fail again. Ngurunderi set off in pursuit again, but lost his prey as Ponde dived into Lake Alexandrina. Ngurunderi and his women settled on the shore, only to suffer bad luck with fishing, being plagued by a water fiend known as <!--del_lnk--> Muldjewangk. They later moved to a more suitable spot at the site of present-day <!--del_lnk--> Ashville. The twin summits of <!--del_lnk--> Mount Misery are supposed to be the remnants of his rafts, they are known as <i>Lalangengall</i> or <i>the two watercraft</i>.<p>Remarkably, this story of a hunter pursuing a fish that carved out the Murray persists in numerous forms in various language groups that inhabit the enormous area spanned by the Murray system. The <!--del_lnk--> Wotojobaluk people of Victoria tell of <!--del_lnk--> Totyerguil from the area now known as <!--del_lnk--> Swan Hill who ran out of spears while chasing <!--del_lnk--> Otchtout the cod.<p><a id="Exploration" name="Exploration"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Exploration</span></h2>
      <p>The first Europeans to explore the river were <!--del_lnk--> Hamilton Hume and William Hovell, who crossed the river where <!--del_lnk--> Albury now stands in <!--del_lnk--> 1824: <!--del_lnk--> Hume named it the <i>Hume River</i> after his father. In <!--del_lnk--> 1830 <!--del_lnk--> Captain Charles Sturt reached the river after travelling down its tributary the <!--del_lnk--> Murrumbidgee River and named it the <i>Murray River</i> in honour of the then British <!--del_lnk--> Secretary of State for War and the Colonies Sir <!--del_lnk--> George Murray, not realising it was the same river that Hume and Hovell had encountered further upstream. Sturt continued down the remaining length of the Murray to finally reach <!--del_lnk--> Lake Alexandrina and the river&#39;s mouth. The area of the <!--del_lnk--> Murray Mouth was explored more thoroughly by Captain <!--del_lnk--> Collet Barker in <!--del_lnk--> 1831. In 1852 <!--del_lnk--> Francis Cadell built a canoe and set off to become the first European to travel the whole length of the river.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1858 the Government <!--del_lnk--> Zoologist, <!--del_lnk--> William Blandowski, along with <!--del_lnk--> Gerard Krefft, explored the lower reaches of the Murray and Darling rivers, compiling a list of <a href="../../wp/b/Bird.htm" title="Bird">birds</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Mammal.htm" title="Mammal">mammals</a>. During the expedition they accumulated 17,400 specimens and classified a number of newly discovered species.<p><a id="River_transport" name="River_transport"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">River transport</span></h2>

      <p>The lack of an <!--del_lnk--> estuary means that shipping cannot enter the Murray from the sea. However in the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a> the river used to support a substantial commercial trade using shallow-draft <!--del_lnk--> steamboats, the first trips being made by two boats from South Australia on the spring flood of <!--del_lnk--> 1853. One vessel, <i>Lady Augusta</i> reached <!--del_lnk--> Swan Hill while another, <i>Mary Ann</i> made it as far as <!--del_lnk--> Moama (near <!--del_lnk--> Echuca). In <!--del_lnk--> 1855 a steamer carrying gold-mining supplies reached Albury but Echuca was the usual turn-around point though small boats continued to link with up-river ports such as <!--del_lnk--> Tocumwal, <!--del_lnk--> Wahgunya and Albury.<p>The arrival of steamboat transport was welcomed by pastoralists who had been suffering from a shortage of transport due to the demands of the gold fields. By <!--del_lnk--> 1860 a dozen steamers were operating in the high water season along the Murray and its tributaries. Once the <a href="../../wp/r/Rail_transport.htm" title="Rail transport">railway</a> reached Echuca in <!--del_lnk--> 1864, the bulk of the <!--del_lnk--> woolclip from the <!--del_lnk--> Riverina was transported via river to Echuca and then south to Melbourne. The Murray was plagued by &quot;snags&quot;, fallen trees submerged in the water, and considerable efforts were made to clear the river of these threats to shipping by using <!--del_lnk--> barges equipped with steam-driven <!--del_lnk--> winches. In recent times, efforts have been made to restore many of these &quot;snags&quot; by placing dead gum trees back into the river. The primary purpose of this is to provide habitat for fish species whose breeding grounds and shelter were eradicated by the removal of &quot;snags&quot;.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The volume and value of river trade made Echuca Victoria&#39;s second port and in the decade from <!--del_lnk--> 1874 it underwent considerable expansion. By this time up to thirty steamers and a similar number of barges were working the river in season. River transport began to decline once the railways touched the Murray at numerous points. The unreliable levels made it impossible for boats to compete with the rail and later <!--del_lnk--> road transport. However, the river still carries pleasure boats along its entire length.<p>Today, most traffic on the river is recreational. Small private boats are used for <!--del_lnk--> water skiing and fishing. <!--del_lnk--> Houseboats are common, both commercial for hire and privately owned. There are a number of both historic <!--del_lnk--> paddle steamers and newer boats offering cruises ranging from a half-hour to 5 days.<p><a id="River_crossings" name="River_crossings"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">River crossings</span></h2>

      <p>Small-scale pumping plants began drawing water from the Murray in the <!--del_lnk--> 1850s and the first large-volume plant was constructed at Mildura in <!--del_lnk--> 1887. The introduction of pumping stations along the river promoted an expansion of <!--del_lnk--> farming and led ultimately to the development of <a href="../../wp/i/Irrigation.htm" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a> areas (including the <!--del_lnk--> Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area). In <!--del_lnk--> 1915 the three Murray states &mdash; New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia &mdash; signed the River Murray Agreement which proposed the construction of storage reservoirs in the river&#39;s headwaters as well as at <!--del_lnk--> Lake Victoria near the South Australian border. Along the intervening stretch of the river a series of <!--del_lnk--> locks and <!--del_lnk--> weirs were built. These were originally proposed to support navigation even in times of low water, but river-borne transport was already declining due to improved road and rail systems.<p><a id="Locks" name="Locks"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Locks</span></h2>
      <p>Lock 1 was completed near <!--del_lnk--> Blanchetown in <!--del_lnk--> 1922. <!--del_lnk--> Torrumbarry Weir downstream of <!--del_lnk--> Echuca began operating in December <!--del_lnk--> 1923. Of the numerous locks that were proposed, only thirteen were completed; Locks 1 to 11 on the stretch downstream of <!--del_lnk--> Mildura, Lock 15 at <!--del_lnk--> Euston and Lock 26 at Torrumbarry. Construction of the remaining weirs purely for navigation purposes was abandoned in <!--del_lnk--> 1934. The last lock to be completed was Lock 15, in <!--del_lnk--> 1937.<p>Lock 11, just downstream of Mildura, creates a 100 <!--del_lnk--> kilometre long lock pool which aided irrigation pumping from Mildura and <!--del_lnk--> Red Cliffs. Each lock has a navigable passage next to it through the weir, which is opened during periods of high river flow, when there is too much water for the lock. The weirs can be completely removed, and the locks completely covered by water during flood conditions. Lock 11 is unique in that the lock was built inside a bend of the river, with the weir in the bend itself. A Channel was dug to the lock, creating an island between it and the weir. The weir is also of a different design, being dragged out of the river during high flow, rather than lifted out.<p>Four large reservoirs were built along the Murray; in addition to Lake Victoria (completed late <!--del_lnk--> 1920s) is <!--del_lnk--> Lake Hume near <!--del_lnk--> Albury-Wodonga (completed <!--del_lnk--> 1936), <!--del_lnk--> Lake Mulwala at <!--del_lnk--> Yarrawonga (completed <!--del_lnk--> 1939) and <!--del_lnk--> Lake Dartmouth, which is actually on the <!--del_lnk--> Mitta Mitta River upstream of Lake Hume (completed <!--del_lnk--> 1979). The Murray also receives water from the complex dam and pipeline system of the <!--del_lnk--> Snowy Mountains Scheme.<p>These dams inverted the patterns of the river&#39;s natural flow from the original winter-spring flood and summer-autumn dry to the present low level through winter and higher during summer. These changes ensured the availability of water for irrigation and made the Murray Valley Australia&#39;s most productive agricultural region, but have seriously disrupted the life cycles of many ecosystems both inside and outside the river, and the irrigation has led to <!--del_lnk--> dryland salinity that now threatens the agricultural industries.<p>The disruption of the river&#39;s natural flow, run-off from <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>, and the introduction of pest species like the <!--del_lnk--> European Carp has led to serious environmental damage along the river&#39;s length and to concerns that the river will be unusably salty in the medium to long term &mdash; a serious problem given that the Murray supplies 40% of Adelaide&#39;s domestic water. Efforts to alleviate the problems proceed but political infighting between various interest groups stalls progress.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_River&quot;</div>
