      <p><b>Michigan State University</b> (<b>MSU</b>) is a <!--del_lnk--> public university in <!--del_lnk--> East Lansing, <!--del_lnk--> Michigan. Founded in 1855, it was the pioneer <!--del_lnk--> land-grant institution and served as a model for future land-grant colleges in the United States under the 1862 <!--del_lnk--> Morrill Act. It is the <!--del_lnk--> eighth-largest university in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, with 45,166 students and one of the top research universities in the world supporting no less than three medical schools. Listed as a <!--del_lnk--> Public Ivy, Michigan State is a member of the <!--del_lnk--> Association of American Universities.<p>Well known for its academic programs in <a href="../../wp/e/Education.htm" title="Education">education</a> and agriculture, MSU pioneered the studies of <!--del_lnk--> packaging and <!--del_lnk--> music therapy. MSU is home to the second-oldest <!--del_lnk--> hospitality school in the United States, and the <!--del_lnk--> study abroad program is the largest of any single-campus university in the country, offering more than 200 programs in more than 60 countries on all continents including <a href="../../wp/a/Antarctica.htm" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>.<p>Following the introduction of the <!--del_lnk--> Morrill Act, the college became <!--del_lnk--> coeducational and expanded its curriculum beyond agriculture. After <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the number of students tripled as the institution became a major university. <!--del_lnk--> As of 2005, MSU is the United States&#39; <!--del_lnk--> sixth-largest university by enrollment. As a <!--del_lnk--> research university, MSU is one of 60 members of the <!--del_lnk--> Association of American Universities.<p>MSU&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Division I sports teams are called the <!--del_lnk--> Spartans. They compete in the <!--del_lnk--> Big Ten Conference in all sports except ice hockey, in which the team is part of the <!--del_lnk--> Central Collegiate Hockey Association. MSU&#39;s <a href="../../wp/a/American_football.htm" title="American football">football</a> team won the <!--del_lnk--> Rose Bowl in 1954, 1956, and 1988.

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Michigan Constitution of 1850 called for the creation of an &quot;agricultural school&quot;, though it was not until <!--del_lnk--> February 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1855 that Michigan <!--del_lnk--> Governor <!--del_lnk--> Kinsley S. Bingham signed a bill establishing the United States&#39; first agriculture college, the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan. Classes began in May 1857 with three buildings, five faculty members, and 63 male students. The first president, <!--del_lnk--> Joseph R. Williams, designed a curriculum that required more scientific study than practically any undergraduate institution of the era. It balanced <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">science</a>, <!--del_lnk--> liberal arts, and practical training. The curriculum excluded <!--del_lnk--> Latin and <!--del_lnk--> Greek studies, since most applicants did not study any classical languages in their rural high schools. However, it did require three hours of daily <!--del_lnk--> manual labor, which kept costs down for both the students and the College. Despite Williams&#39; innovations and his defense of education for the masses, the State Board of Education saw Williams&#39; curriculum as <!--del_lnk--> elitist. They forced him to resign in 1859 and reduced the curriculum to a two-year vocational program.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>In 1860, Joseph Williams became acting <!--del_lnk--> lieutenant governor and helped pass the Reorganization Act of 1861. This gave the College a four-year curriculum and the power to grant <!--del_lnk--> master&#39;s degrees. Under the act, a newly-created body, known as the State Board of Agriculture, took over from the State Board of Education in running the institution. The College changed its name to State Agricultural College, and its first class graduated in the same year. However, there was no time for an elaborate graduation ceremony: the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a> had just begun, and the first alumni were drafted into the war effort. The following year, <a href="../../wp/a/Abraham_Lincoln.htm" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> signed the First Morrill Act of 1862 to support similar colleges, making the Michigan school a national model. Williams never witnessed the cause to which he had dedicated so much of his life, having taken ill and died the previous year.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The college first admitted women in 1870, although at that time there were no female dormitories. The few women who enrolled either boarded with faculty families or made the arduous <!--del_lnk--> stagecoach trek from <!--del_lnk--> Lansing. Nonetheless, even from the early days female students took the same rigorous scientific agriculture courses as male students. In 1896, the faculty created a &quot;Women Course&quot; that melded a <!--del_lnk--> home economics curriculum with <!--del_lnk--> liberal arts and sciences. That same year, the College turned the old Abbot Hall male dorm into a women&#39;s dormitory and more firmly established itself as co-ed. However, it was not until 1899 that the State Agricultural College admitted its first <!--del_lnk--> African American student, William O. Thompson. He went on to teach at what is now <!--del_lnk--> Tuskegee University under the wing of <!--del_lnk--> Booker T. Washington, whom President Jonathan L. Snyder invited to be the Class of 1900 commencement speaker. A few years later, Myrtle Craig became the first female African American student to enroll at the College. Along with the Class of 1907, she received her degree from U.S. President <a href="../../wp/t/Theodore_Roosevelt.htm" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, commencement speaker for the Semi-Centennial celebration. The City of East Lansing was incorporated in that same year, and two years later the college officially changed its name to Michigan Agricultural College (M.A.C.).<p><a id="Big_Ten_university" name="Big_Ten_university"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Big Ten university</span></h3>
      <p>During the early 20th century, M.A.C. expanded its curriculum well beyond agriculture. By 1925, it had expanded enough that it changed its name to Michigan State College of Agriculture and Applied Science (M.S.C.). In 1941, the Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture, <!--del_lnk--> John A. Hannah, became president of the College. He began the largest expansion in the institution&#39;s history, with the help of the 1945 <!--del_lnk--> G.I. Bill, which helped World War II veterans to receive an education. One of Hannah&#39;s strategies was to build a new dormitory building, enroll enough students to fill it, and use the income to start construction on a new dormitory. Under his plan, enrollment increased from 15,000 in 1950 to 38,000 in 1965. Hannah also got the chance to improve the athletic reputation of M.S.C. when the <a href="../../wp/u/University_of_Chicago.htm" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a> resigned from the <!--del_lnk--> Big Ten Conference in 1946. Hannah lobbied hard to take its place, gaining admission in 1950. Five years later, in its Centennial year of 1955, the State of Michigan renamed the College as Michigan State University of Agriculture and Applied Science. Nine years after that, the University governing body changed its name from the State Board of Agriculture to the MSU Board of Trustees. The State of Michigan allowed the University to drop the words &quot;Agriculture and Applied Science&quot; from its name. Since 1964, the institution has gone by the name of Michigan State University.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Since the end of the Hannah era, Michigan State has shifted its focus from increasing the size of its student body to advancing its national and global reputation. In recent years, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> town and gown&quot; relations have soured as students and permanent residents looked at each other with increasing hostility. Tensions worsened when East Lansing erupted in riots in 1997, and 1998,. The most recent disturbance occurred on <!--del_lnk--> April 2, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, after MSU&#39;s defeat to <!--del_lnk--> North Carolina in the 2005 men&#39;s basketball <!--del_lnk--> Final Four. Officially deemed a &quot;civil disturbance&quot; rather than a riot, the incident sparked a debate over <!--del_lnk--> police brutality in East Lansing, which has yet to be resolved. Despite the damage to MSU&#39;s image, the University looks to improve its academic reputation in the 21st century. In September 2005, current president <!--del_lnk--> Lou Anna Simon called for MSU, one of the <!--del_lnk--> public ivy institutions, to become the global model leader for Land Grant institutions by the year 2012. Her plans include creating a new <!--del_lnk--> residential college and increasing <!--del_lnk--> National Institutes of Health donations past the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">$</a>100 million mark. While there are over 100 Land Grant universities in the United States, she has stated that she would like Michigan State University to be the leader.<p><a id="Campus" name="Campus"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Campus</span></h2>

      <p>MSU&#39;s sprawling campus is located in <!--del_lnk--> East Lansing on the banks of the <!--del_lnk--> Red Cedar River. The campus started in 1857 with three buildings: a multipurpose building called <!--del_lnk--> College Hall, a dormitory later called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Saints&#39; Rest&quot;, and a barn. Today, MSU&#39;s contiguous campus consists of 5,200&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> acres (2,104&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ha), 2,000&nbsp;acres (809.4&nbsp;ha) of which are developed. There are currently 676 buildings: 203 for academics, 154 for agriculture, 245 for housing and food service, as well as 74 other buildings. Overall, the University has 21,931,085 <!--del_lnk--> square feet (2,037,464.5&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> m&sup2;) of total indoor space. Connecting it all is 27 <!--del_lnk--> miles (43 <!--del_lnk--> km) of roads and 100 miles (161 km) of sidewalks. MSU also owns 44 non-campus properties, totaling 22,000&nbsp;acres (8,903&nbsp;ha) in 28 different counties.<div class="thumb tleft">

To the east lies <!--del_lnk--> Eustace-Cole Hall and <!--del_lnk--> Marshall-Adams Hall, America&#39;s first freestanding laboratories for <!--del_lnk--> horticulture and <!--del_lnk--> bacteriology, respectively. Other landmarks include the bronze statue of former president <!--del_lnk--> John A. Hannah, the <!--del_lnk--> W. J. Beal Botanical Garden, and the painted <!--del_lnk--> boulder known as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The Rock&quot;, which is a popular spot for theatre, <!--del_lnk--> tailgating, and candlelight vigils. On the northwest corner of campus lies the University&#39;s hotel, the Kellogg Hotel and Conference Centre.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The campus south of the river consists mostly of post-World War II <!--del_lnk--> International Style buildings with sparse foliage, relatively straight roadways, and numerous parking lots. The &quot;2020 Vision&quot; Master Plan proposes replacing these parking lots with <!--del_lnk--> parking ramps and green space, but these plans will take many years to reach fruition. As part of the master plan, the University erected a new bronze statue of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The Spartan&quot; in 2005. This replica replaced the original <!--del_lnk--> modernist <!--del_lnk--> terra cotta statue, which can still be seen on the west concourse of the <!--del_lnk--> Spartan Stadium. Notable academic and research buildings on the South Campus include the <!--del_lnk--> Cyclotron and the <!--del_lnk--> College of Law. This part of campus is home to the <!--del_lnk--> MSU Horticulture Gardens and the adjoining <!--del_lnk--> 4-H Children&#39;s Garden. South of the gardens lie the <!--del_lnk--> Canadian National and <!--del_lnk--> CSX railroads, which divide the main campus from thousands of acres of university-owned farmland.<p><a id="Academics" name="Academics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Academics</span></h2>

MSU&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Industrial and Organizational Psychology  Ph.D. program is another program ranked number one for the better part of the last decade. In <i>U.S. News</i> &#39; 2006 ranking of <!--del_lnk--> nuclear physics programs, MSU ranked second behind only <!--del_lnk--> MIT. Indeed, MSU&rsquo;s Physics &amp; Astronomy department ranks highly based on the number and impact of publications its faculty publishes. In addition to this, the 2007 U.S. News &amp; World Report ranks Michigan State&#39;s Supply Chain Management program in the Eli Broad College of Business number one in the nation, beating out MIT (ranked second). The <!--del_lnk--> National Communication Association ranks MSU doctoral programs as the nation&rsquo;s most effective in educating researchers in health communication and communication technology.

      <p>The university spent <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">$</a>289,787,000 on research in 2002, capping a long history of productive research. In 1877, botany professor <!--del_lnk--> William J. Beal performed the first documented genetic crosses to produce hybrid <a href="../../wp/m/Maize.htm" title="Maize">corn</a>, which led to increased yields. MSU dairy professor <!--del_lnk--> G. Malcolm Trout invented the process for the <!--del_lnk--> homogenization of milk in the 1930s. In the 1960s, MSU scientists developed <!--del_lnk--> cisplatin, a leading cancer fighting drug. Today Michigan State continues its research with facilities such as the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Department of Energy-sponsored MSU-DOE Plant Research Laboratory and a <!--del_lnk--> particle accelerator called the <!--del_lnk--> National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory. In 2004, scientists at the Cyclotron produced and observed a new isotope of the element <a href="../../wp/g/Germanium.htm" title="Germanium">germanium</a>, called Ge-60. In that same year, Michigan State, in consortium with the <!--del_lnk--> University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the government of <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, broke ground on the 4.1-meter <!--del_lnk--> Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope (SOAR) in the <!--del_lnk--> Andes Mountains of <a href="../../wp/c/Chile.htm" title="Chile">Chile</a>. The consortium telescope will allow the Physics &amp; Astronomy department to study galaxy formation and origins.

The university library comprises nine branch locations including the main library. The <!--del_lnk--> Africana Collection is one of the largest of its kind in the nation with a collection of over 200,000 items. Other significant collections include the G. Robert Vincent Voice Library, the largest academic voice library in the nation, containing a collection of over 40,000 hours of <!--del_lnk--> spoken word recordings and includes the voices of over 100,000 persons from all walks of life, and the Russel B.

This collection includes over 100,000 comic books, and 10,000 related books and periodicals.<p><a id="Endowment" name="Endowment"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Endowment</span></h3>
      <p>MSU&#39;s (private, non-Morrill Act) <!--del_lnk--> endowment started in 1916 when the Engineering Building burned down. Automobile magnate <!--del_lnk--> R.E. Olds helped the program stay afloat with a gift of $100,000. While this opened the door for other types of private donations, MSU has often lagged behind peer institutions in terms of endowments. As recently as the early 1990s, MSU was last among the eleven Big Ten schools, with barely over $100 million in endowment funds. However, in the early 2000s, the University started a campaign to increase the size of the endowment. At the close of FY 2004&ndash;05, the endowment had risen to $1.325 billion, raising the University to sixth of the 11 Big Ten schools in terms of endowment; within $2M of the fifth-rated school. The rapid increase in the size of the endowment will help to improve outdated facilities, such as the Music Building, which the music department hopes to soon replace with money from its alumni fundraising program.<p><a id="Colleges" name="Colleges"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Colleges</span></h2>

      <p>MSU has several <!--del_lnk--> residential colleges, based on the <!--del_lnk--> Oxbridge &quot;living-learning&quot; model. By putting classes in student domitories, these colleges improve student access to faculty and facilities. MSU&#39;s first residential college, <!--del_lnk--> Justin Morrill College started in 1965 with an interdisciplinary curriculum. MSU closed Morrill College in 1979, but today the university has two remaining residential colleges, with a third scheduled to start in 2007.

Starting as a club sport in 1884, football gained varsity status in 1896. In the 1950s, MSU led the nation in desegregation, allowing black athletes in all sports. It won the <!--del_lnk--> Rose Bowl in 1954, 1956, and 1988. In 1967 the Spartans accounted for four of the top eight picks in the NFL draft, the only time a college football program has accomplished such feat.<p>Today, the football team competes in <!--del_lnk--> Spartan Stadium, a renovated 75,025 person football stadium in the centre of campus. The current coach is <!--del_lnk--> Mark Dantonio, who was hired on November 27, 2006. Dantonio had an 18-17 record in his three year tenure at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Cincinnati, including a 1-0 Bowl Game record.  MSU&#39;s traditional archrival is the <!--del_lnk--> University of Michigan, against whom they compete for the <!--del_lnk--> Paul Bunyan Trophy. MSU is traditionally the underdog, with a 28-66-5 record in the annual game. Michigan State is one of three Big Ten teams to have an annual non-conference football game against <!--del_lnk--> Notre Dame. MSU&#39;s record against the Fighting Irish is 25-44-1..

      <p><!--del_lnk--> East Lansing is very much a <!--del_lnk--> college town, with 58.6% of the population between the ages of 18 and 24. President John A. Hannah&#39;s push to expand in the 1950s and 1960s resulted in the largest <!--del_lnk--> residence hall system in the United States. 16,000 students live in MSU&#39;s 23 undergraduate halls, one graduate hall, and three apartment villages. Each residence hall has its own hall government, with representatives in the <!--del_lnk--> Residence Halls Association (RHA). Yet despite the size and extent of on-campus housing, 58% of students live off-campus, mostly in the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> student ghettos&quot; of East Lansing. One of these student-dominated neighborhoods is &quot;Cedar Village&quot;. The city since has declared Cedar Village &quot;<!--del_lnk--> blighted&quot;, and proposed to redevelop the 35&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> acre (14&nbsp;ha) site as a complex of upscale condominiums and retail stores called East Village. Several <!--del_lnk--> fraternities in the affected area have mounted a campaign against the redevelopment plan.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p><a id="Activism" name="Activism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Activism</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Activists have played an important role in MSU history. During the height of the <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_War.htm" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>, student protests helped create <!--del_lnk--> co-ed residence halls, blocked the routing of <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 496 through campus, and led to the resignation of MSU President <!--del_lnk--> John A. Hannah. In the 1980s, Michigan State students convinced the University to <!--del_lnk--> divest the stocks of companies doing business in <!--del_lnk--> apartheid <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> from its endowment portfolio, such as <!--del_lnk--> Coca-Cola. Today, MSU has many student groups focused on political change. The <!--del_lnk--> student government is the <!--del_lnk--> Associated Students of Michigan State University (ASMSU). It is known for its unusual nonpartisan bicameral structure, which includes the parallel <!--del_lnk--> Student Assembly and <!--del_lnk--> Academic Assembly. Graduate campus groups include the Graduate Employees Union (GEU) and the Council of Graduate Students (COGS). Michigan State also has a variety of <!--del_lnk--> partisan groups ranging from <!--del_lnk--> liberal to <!--del_lnk--> conservative, including the <!--del_lnk--> College Republicans, the <!--del_lnk--> College Democrats and several <!--del_lnk--> third party organizations. Other partisan activist groups include <!--del_lnk--> Young Americans for Freedom on the <!--del_lnk--> right and Students for Economic Justice and <i>Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan</i> (<!--del_lnk--> MEChA) on the <!--del_lnk--> left. Given MSU&#39;s proximity to the Michigan state capital of <!--del_lnk--> Lansing, many politically-inclined Spartans get internships for the state representatives.<h3> <span class="mw-headline">Greek Life</span></h3>
      <p>Michigan State University&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> greek system consists of around fifty Greek lettered student societies. These chapters are in turn under the jurisdiction of one of MSU&#39;s four Greek governing councils. Of these four, the <!--del_lnk--> Interfraternity Council (IFC) and the <!--del_lnk--> Women&#39;s Panhellenic Council are each entirely responsible for their own budgets, giving them the freedom to hold large fundraising and recruitment events. MSU&#39;s fraternities and sororities hold many <!--del_lnk--> philanthropy events and community fundraisers. Many chapters even hold two or three events per year. For example, in March 2006, the Greek system held Greek Week to raise over $170,000 for the <!--del_lnk--> American Cancer Society, Ele&#39;s Place, the <!--del_lnk--> Ronald McDonald House, and the <!--del_lnk--> Special Olympics.<p><a id="People" name="People"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">People</span></h2>

      <p>The current president of the University is <!--del_lnk--> Lou Anna Simon, who took over on <!--del_lnk--> January 1, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, after being appointed by MSU&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> governing board, the Board of Trustees. The Board receives its mandate from the Michigan Constitution since MSU is a state-owned school. The constitution allows for eight <!--del_lnk--> trustees, elected by statewide referendum every two years. Trustees have eight-year terms, with two of the eight elected every other year. As of 2005, the Board is made up of five <!--del_lnk--> Republicans and three <!--del_lnk--> Democrats, and has a 4:4 gender balance.<div class="thumb tright">
