      <p>The best-known mummies are those that have been deliberately <!--del_lnk--> embalmed with the specific purpose of preservation, particularly those in <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">ancient Egypt</a>. Egyptian culture believed the body was home to a person&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Ka which was essential in one&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> afterlife. In Egypt, the abdomens were opened and many organs were removed. The emptied body was then covered in <!--del_lnk--> natron, to speed up the process of <!--del_lnk--> dehydration, and to prevent decomposition.They are covered with sheets of white linen then wrapped with canvas.<p>In <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, preserved corpses have been recovered from submerged <!--del_lnk--> cypress coffins packed with medicinal herbs.<p><a id="Naturally_preserved_mummies" name="Naturally_preserved_mummies"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Naturally preserved mummies</span></h3>
      <p>Mummies formed as a result of naturally occurring environmental conditions, such as extreme cold (<!--del_lnk--> &Ouml;tzi the Iceman), acid (<!--del_lnk--> Tollund Man) or desiccating dryness have been found all over the world. Some of the best-preserved mummies formed under natural conditions date from the <a href="../../wp/i/Inca_Empire.htm" title="Inca">Inca</a> period in <a href="../../wp/p/Peru.htm" title="Peru">Peru</a>.<p><a id="Etymology" name="Etymology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Etymology</span></h2>
      <p>The <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> word <i>mummy</i> is derived from mediaeval <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>mumia</i>, a borrowing of the <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> word <i>m&#x16B;miyyah</i> (&#x645;&#x648;&#x645;&#x64A;&#x629;), which means &quot;<!--del_lnk--> bitumen&quot;. (Because of the blackened <!--del_lnk--> skin of unwrapped mummies, bitumen was once thought to be used extensively in ancient Egyptian <!--del_lnk--> embalming procedures. <!--del_lnk--> Asphalt and <!--del_lnk--> tar are forms of bitumen.) The Arabic word was itself borrowed from the <!--del_lnk--> Persian word <i>m&#x16B;miya</i>, meaning &quot;bitumen&quot;; this is related to another Persian word, <i>m&#x16B;m</i>, which means &quot;wax&quot;. (The ancient Greek historians record that the Persians sometimes mummified their kings and nobility in wax, though this practice has never been documented in Egypt.)<p><a id="Mummies_in_ancient_Egypt" name="Mummies_in_ancient_Egypt"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Mummies in ancient Egypt</span></h2>
      <p>The earliest known &#39;mummified&#39; individual dates back to approximately <!--del_lnk--> 3300 BC, although it is not an internationally renowned mummy, such as, <a href="../../wp/r/Ramesses_II.htm" title="Rameses II">Rameses II</a> or <!--del_lnk--> Seti I. This virtually unknown mummy is on display in the <!--del_lnk--> British Museum and has been given the nickname of &#39;Ginger&#39; because he has red hair. Ginger was buried in the hot desert sand, possibly with stones piled on top to prevent the corpse being eaten by <a href="../../wp/j/Jackal.htm" title="Jackal">jackals</a>. The hot, dry conditions desiccated and preserved the body. Ginger was buried with some pottery vessels, which would have held food and drink to sustain him on his journey to the other world. There are no written records of the religion from that time, but it likely resembled the later religion to some extent. The desert conditions were a fact of life &quot;and death&quot;, so, in any case, some physical preservation would be natural.<p><a id="Mummification" name="Mummification"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Mummification</span></h2>
      <p>Although mummification existed in other cultures, eternal life was the main focus of all Ancient Egyptians, which meant preserving the body forever. The earliest attempts were recorded in 3000 B.C. The technique used during this period was minimal and not yet mastered. As time progressed, the organs were eventually removed and stored in canopic jars, allowing the body to preserve better. It wasn&rsquo;t until the Middle Kingdom that embalmers used natural salts to remove moisture from the body. This dried it out and preserved more flesh than bone. Once dried, mummies were anointed with oils and perfumes, which was part of their ritual. The 21st Dynasty brought forth its most advanced skills in embalming and the mummification process reached its peak. After going though the process, the mummies were laid to rest inside a tomb. There the mummy would rest forever, or so it was thought.<p><a id="Mummies_in_other_civilizations" name="Mummies_in_other_civilizations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Mummies in other civilizations</span></h2>

      <p>Chinese mummies of an <!--del_lnk--> Indo-European type have been found in the <!--del_lnk--> Tarim Basin dating to as early as <!--del_lnk--> 1600 BC and suggesting very ancient contacts between the east and the west. It has been suggested that these mummified remains may have been the work of the ancestors of the <!--del_lnk--> Tocharians whose <!--del_lnk--> Indo-European language remained in use in the Tarim Basin (Modern day <!--del_lnk--> Xinjiang in <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>) until the <a href="../../wp/8/8th_century.htm" title="8th century">8th century AD</a> (see <!--del_lnk--> Silk Road: Tocharians).<p>An ancient mummy dubbed the &quot;handsome <!--del_lnk--> Yingpan man&quot; was found in China&#39;s remote northwest province of <!--del_lnk--> Xinjiang. Archaeologists from the <!--del_lnk--> Xinjiang Archeological Institute found the mummified body when they opened a coffin in a graveyard dating back 1,900 years, according to Xinhua news agency. The mummy had thick brown hair, a shrunken face and body, and gray and brown skin. Its beard, eyebrows and eyelashes were clearly discernible and its clothes were intact and retained their bright colour.<p>The mummified man, believed to have lived during the <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220 AD), was 1.8 <!--del_lnk--> meters (nearly six feet) tall and might have died at about 25 years of age. His coffin, which had colorful paintings on the outside, was discovered together with over 150 ancient tombs dating back to the Eastern Han Dynasty at Yingpan near Lop Nur in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. This coffin along with five others had been shipped to Urumqi, the regional capital, and were kept in the institute, unopened, for three years. The mummy is believed to be significant for the study of economic and cultural exchanges between China and Western countries in ancient times.<p>The &quot;handsome Yingpan man&quot; is thought to be comparable to the &quot;beautiful <!--del_lnk--> Loulan woman,&quot; a 3,800-year-old female mummy discovered in 1980 at the <!--del_lnk--> Tiebanhe Delta, about 200 kilometers east of Yingpan, said the report. Loulan was an ancient kingdom along China&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Silk Road in <!--del_lnk--> Xinjiang, about 200 <!--del_lnk--> kilometers east of Yingpan.<p>The three best-preserved mummies in the world are found in China. These mummies were debut on the US National Geographic Channel, September 6, 2004, as part of the kick-off of the National Geographic Channel&#39;s &quot;Most Amazing Discoveries&quot; series.<p><a id="Natural_mummies" name="Natural_mummies"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Natural mummies</span></h2>
      <p>Natural mummification is fairly rare, requiring specific conditions to occur, but it has produced some of the oldest known mummies. The most famous ancient mummy is <!--del_lnk--> &Ouml;tzi the Iceman, frozen in a <a href="../../wp/g/Glacier.htm" title="Glacier">glacier</a> in the <!--del_lnk--> &Ouml;tztal Alps around 3300 BC and found in 1991. An even older but less well preserved mummy was found in <!--del_lnk--> Spirit Cave, <!--del_lnk--> Nevada in <!--del_lnk--> 1940 and <!--del_lnk--> carbon-dated to around 7400 BC.<p>The <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, the <a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_Ireland.htm" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>, the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> and <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> have all produced a number of <!--del_lnk--> bog bodies, mummies of people deposited in <a href="../../wp/b/Bog.htm" title="Bog">sphagnum bogs</a> apparently as a result of murder or ritual sacrifices. In such cases, the acidity of the water, the cold temperature and the lack of oxygen combine to tan the body&#39;s skin and soft tissues. The skeleton typically disintegrates over time. Such mummies are remarkably well preserved, with skin and internal organs surviving&nbsp;; it is even possible to determine what their last meal was by examining their stomach contents.<p>In 1972, eight remarkably preserved mummies were discovered at an abandoned <!--del_lnk--> Inuit settlement called <!--del_lnk--> Qilakitsoq, in Greenland. The &quot;Greenland Mummies&quot; consisted of a six-month old baby, a four year old boy, and six women of various ages, who died around 500 years ago. Their bodies were naturally mummified by the sub-zero temperatures and dry winds in the cave in which they were found.<p>Some of the best-preserved mummies date from the <a href="../../wp/i/Inca_Empire.htm" title="Inca">Inca</a> period in <a href="../../wp/p/Peru.htm" title="Peru">Peru</a> some 500 years ago, where children were ritually sacrificed and placed on the summits of mountains in the <a href="../../wp/a/Andes.htm" title="Andes">Andes</a>. The cold, dry climate had the effect of desiccating the corpses and preserving them intact.<p>In the state of <!--del_lnk--> Guanajuato, <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> mummies were discovered in a cemetery of a city named <!--del_lnk--> Guanajuato northwest of <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico_City.htm" title="Mexico City">Mexico City</a> (near L&eacute;on). They are accidental modern mummies and were literally &quot;dug up&quot; between the years <!--del_lnk--> 1896 and <!--del_lnk--> 1958 when a local law required relatives to pay a kind of grave tax. The Guanajuato mummies are on display in the <i>Museo de las momias</i> high on a hill overlooking the city. <!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Mummies_in_recent_times" name="Mummies_in_recent_times"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Mummies in recent times</span></h2>

      <p>Mummies have been an object of intense interest in the West since <!--del_lnk--> archaeologists began finding them in large numbers. <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th-century</a> aristocrats would often entertain themselves by buying mummies, having them unwrapped, and holding observation sessions. On occasion a tea would be made from the wrappings. These sessions destroyed hundreds of mummies, because the exposure to the air caused them to disintegrate.<p>In the <!--del_lnk--> 1830s <!--del_lnk--> Jeremy Bentham, the founder of <a href="../../wp/u/Utilitarianism.htm" title="Utilitarianism">utilitarianism</a>, left instructions to be followed upon his death which led to the creation of a sort of modern-day mummy. He asked that his body be displayed to illustrate how the &quot;horror at dissection originates in ignorance&quot;; once so displayed and lectured about, he asked that his body parts be preserved, including his skeleton (minus his skull, for which he had other plans), which was to be dressed in the clothes he usually wore and &quot;seated in a Chair usually occupied by me when living in the attitude in which I am sitting when engaged in thought.&quot; His body, outfitted with a wax head created because of problems preparing his head as Bentham requested, is on display in the <!--del_lnk--> University College London.<p>Egyptian mummies were much sought-after by museums worldwide in the 19th and early 20th centuries and many exhibit mummies today. Notably fine examples are exhibited at the <!--del_lnk--> Egyptian Museum in <a href="../../wp/c/Cairo.htm" title="Cairo">Cairo</a>, at the <!--del_lnk--> &Auml;gyptisches Museum in <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin.htm" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>, and at the <!--del_lnk--> British Museum in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>.

      <p>Mummies were also believed to have medicinal properties, and were sold as <!--del_lnk--> pharmaceuticals in powdered form. As seen to the left, Emad Mousa, Ancient Mummy of the Obstetrical gods was very popular in historic Egyptian culture. An urban myth of mummies being used as <!--del_lnk--> fuel for <!--del_lnk--> steam locomotives, was popularized by <a href="../../wp/m/Mark_Twain.htm" title="Mark Twain">Mark Twain</a>, but whether it was true or not remains a debate. <!--del_lnk--> Encyclopedia Brittanica 1771 Edition claims that this was a real practice on the railway that ran from Cairo to Khartoum, an area with few trees but lots of mummies. During the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">First World War</a>, mummy wrapping linens were manufactured into <!--del_lnk--> paper.<p><a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">Science</a> has also taken notice of mummies. Dr. <!--del_lnk--> Bob Brier, an <!--del_lnk--> Egyptologist, has been the first modern scientist to successfully recreate a mummy using the Egyptian method. Mummies have been used in <a href="../../wp/m/Medicine.htm" title="Medicine">medicine</a>, to calibrate <!--del_lnk--> CAT scan machines at levels of <!--del_lnk--> radiation that would be too dangerous for use on living people. In fact, mummies can be studied without unwrapping them using <!--del_lnk--> CAT scan and <!--del_lnk--> X-ray machines to form a picture of what&#39;s inside.<p>They have been very useful to <a href="../../wp/b/Biology.htm" title="Biology">biologists</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Anthropology.htm" title="Anthropology">anthropologists</a>, as they have provided a wealth of information about the health and life expectancy of ancient peoples. In particular, mummies have demonstrated that even 5,000 years ago, humans were anatomically indistinguishable from their present-day counterparts. This has had important repercussions for the study of <!--del_lnk--> human evolution.<p>Scientists interested in <!--del_lnk--> cloning <a href="../../wp/d/DNA.htm" title="DNA">DNA</a> of mummies have recently reported findings of clonable DNA in an <!--del_lnk--> Egyptian mummy dating to circa <!--del_lnk--> 400 BC. Although analyzing the hair of <!--del_lnk--> Ancient Egyptian mummies from the Late <!--del_lnk--> Middle Kingdom has revealed evidence of a stable diet <!--del_lnk--> , <!--del_lnk--> Ancient Egyptian mummies from circa <!--del_lnk--> 3200 BC show signs of severe <a href="../../wp/a/Anemia.htm" title="Anemia">anaemia</a> and <!--del_lnk--> hemolitic disorders <!--del_lnk--> .<p>Artists also made use of mummies during the late 1800&#39;s, in the form of paint. The brownish paint was called &quot;Caput Mortum&quot;, latin for &quot;Dead Head&quot;, made from the wrappings of mummies.<p>In March 2006, the body of the <!--del_lnk--> Greek Orthodox <!--del_lnk--> Monk <!--del_lnk--> Vissarion Korkoliacos was found intact in his tomb, after fifteen years in grave. The event had as a result a dispute between those who spoke about a <!--del_lnk--> miracle and those who claimed the possibility of natural <!--del_lnk--> mummification. However, the scientific research did not come to an end until today and as a result of this any opinion on the matter could not be characterized as definitive.<p><a id="Modern_Mummies" name="Modern_Mummies"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Modern Mummies</span></h3>

      <p>In 1975, an <!--del_lnk--> esoteric organization by the name of <!--del_lnk--> Summum introduced &quot;Modern Mummification,&quot; a form of mummification that Summum claims uses modern techniques along with aspects of ancient methods. The service is available for <!--del_lnk--> spiritual reasons. Summum considers animals and people to have an <!--del_lnk--> essence that continues following the death of the body, and their mummification process is meant to preserve the body as a means to aid the essence as it transitions to a new destination. Summum calls this &quot;Transference,&quot; and the concept seems to correlate with ancient Egyptian reasons for mummification.<p>Rather than using a dehydration process that is typical of ancient mummies, Summum uses a chemical process that is supposed to maintain the body&#39;s natural look. The process includes leaving the body submerged in a tank of preservation fluid for several months. Summum claims its process preserves the body so well that the DNA will remain intact far into the future leaving open the possibility for <!--del_lnk--> cloning should science perfect the technique on humans.<p>According to news stories, Summum has mummified numerous pets such as birds, cats, and dogs. People were mummified early on when Summum developed its process and many have made personal, &quot;pre-need&quot; arrangements. Summum has been included in television programs from <!--del_lnk--> National Geographic and the <!--del_lnk--> British Broadcasting Corporation, and is also discussed in the book, <i>The Scientific Study of Mummies</i>, by Arthur C. Aufderheide.<p><a id="Plastination" name="Plastination"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Plastination</span></h4>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Plastination is a technique used in <a href="../../wp/a/Anatomy.htm" title="Anatomy">anatomy</a> to conserve bodies or body parts. The <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a> and <!--del_lnk--> fat are replaced by certain plastics, yielding specimens that can be touched, do not smell or decay, and even retain most microscopic properties of the original sample.<p>The technique was invented by <!--del_lnk--> Gunther von Hagens when working at the anatomical institute of the <!--del_lnk--> University of Heidelberg in <!--del_lnk--> 1978. Von Hagens has patented the technique in several countries and is heavily involved in its promotion, especially with his travelling exhibition <!--del_lnk--> Body Worlds showing plastinated human bodies all over the world. He also founded and directs the Institute for Plastination in <!--del_lnk--> Heidelberg.<p><a id="Mummies_in_fiction" name="Mummies_in_fiction"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Mummies in fiction</span></h2>

      <p>During the <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a>, <!--del_lnk--> horror films and other mass media popularized the notion of a <!--del_lnk--> curse associated with mummies. Films representing such a belief include the <!--del_lnk--> 1932 film <i><!--del_lnk--> The Mummy</i> starring <!--del_lnk--> Boris Karloff as <!--del_lnk--> Imhotep; four subsequent 1940&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Universal Studios mummy films which featured a mummy named <!--del_lnk--> Kharis (pictured at right in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Mummy&#39;s Ghost</i>), who also was the title mummy in <!--del_lnk--> a 1959 Hammer version; and <!--del_lnk--> a remake of the original film that was released in 1999. The belief in cursed mummies probably stems in part from the supposed curse on the tomb of <!--del_lnk--> Tutankhamun.<p>Mummies commonly feature in <!--del_lnk--> fantasy genres as a <!--del_lnk--> undead creature.<p>Mummy is <!--del_lnk--> Monster in My Pocket #41. He is associated with the good monsters.<p>Dark Magic Priest Meemy of <!--del_lnk--> Mahou Sentai Magiranger is based on the classic concept of reanimated mummies in horror films, Meemy&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Power Rangers: Mystic Force counterpart is Imperious.<p><a id="Famous_mummies" name="Famous_mummies"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Famous mummies</span></h2>
