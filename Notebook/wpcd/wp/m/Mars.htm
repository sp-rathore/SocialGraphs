Mars is also known as the &quot;Red Planet&quot; due to its reddish appearance when seen from Earth. The prefix <i>areo-</i>, from the <a href="../../wp/g/Greek_mythology.htm" title="Greek mythology">Greek god</a> of war, <!--del_lnk--> Ares, refers to Mars in the same way <i>geo-</i> refers to <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a>.<p>Mars has two <!--del_lnk--> moons, <!--del_lnk--> Phobos and <!--del_lnk--> Deimos, which are small and oddly-shaped. These may be captured <a href="../../wp/a/Asteroid.htm" title="Asteroid">asteroids</a> similar to <!--del_lnk--> 5261 Eureka, a Mars <!--del_lnk--> Trojan asteroid. Mars can be seen from Earth with the naked eye. Its apparent magnitude reaches -2.9, a brightness surpassed only by Venus, the Moon, and the Sun. For much of the year, <!--del_lnk--> Jupiter may appear brighter to the naked eye than Mars.<p>Until the first flyby of Mars by <!--del_lnk--> Mariner 4 in 1965, it was hoped, both within and especially perhaps outside scientific circles, especially in the popular media and literary circles, that Mars had ample liquid water. This was based on observations of periodic variations in light and dark patches, particularly in the polar latitudes, and long dark striations that could perhaps even be irrigation channels of liquid water.<p>These straight line features were shown in fact not to exist when they were subsequently analyzed and explained as optical illusions. Still, of all the planets in our solar system other than Earth, Mars is the most likely to harbour liquid <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a>, and perhaps <a href="../../wp/l/Life.htm" title="Life">life</a>, so the myth has had enough influence that even now probes carry packages to attempt to find microscopic life. Mars&#39; <!--del_lnk--> rotational period and seasonal cycles are also similar to those of the Earth. It has the highest <!--del_lnk--> mountain in the solar system, <!--del_lnk--> Olympus Mons, the largest canyon in the solar system, <!--del_lnk--> Valles Marineris, and <!--del_lnk--> polar ice caps.<p>Mars is currently host to four orbiting <!--del_lnk--> spacecraft: <!--del_lnk--> Mars Global Surveyor, <!--del_lnk--> Mars Odyssey, <!--del_lnk--> Mars Express, and <a href="../../wp/m/Mars_Reconnaissance_Orbiter.htm" title="Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter">Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</a>.

      <p>The red/orange appearance of Mars&#39; surface is caused by <!--del_lnk--> iron(III) oxide (rust). Mars has half the <!--del_lnk--> radius of the Earth and only one-tenth the <!--del_lnk--> mass, being less dense, but its <!--del_lnk--> surface area is only slightly less than the total area of Earth&#39;s dry land. While Mars is larger and more massive than <a href="../../wp/m/Mercury_%2528planet%2529.htm" title="Mercury (planet)">Mercury</a>, Mercury has slightly stronger gravity at the surface, due to its much higher density.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The surface of Mars is thought to be primarily composed of <!--del_lnk--> basalt, based upon the <!--del_lnk--> Martian meteorite collection and orbital observations. There is some evidence that a portion of the Martian surface might be more silica-rich than typical basalt, perhaps similar to <!--del_lnk--> andesitic stones on Earth, though these observations may also be explained by silica glass. Much of the surface is deeply covered by <!--del_lnk--> iron(III) oxide dust as fine as talcum powder.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>There is conclusive evidence that <!--del_lnk--> liquid water existed at one time on the surface of Mars. Key discoveries leading to this conclusion include the detection of various minerals such as <!--del_lnk--> hematite and <!--del_lnk--> goethite which usually only form in the presence of water.<p>Although Mars has no intrinsic magnetic field, observations have revealed that parts of the planet&#39;s crust have been magnetized. This magnetization has been compared to <!--del_lnk--> alternating bands found on the ocean floors of Earth. One theory, published in 1999 and reexamined in October 2005 with the help of the <!--del_lnk--> Mars Global Surveyor, is that these bands are evidence of the past operation of <a href="../../wp/p/Plate_tectonics.htm" title="Plate tectonics">plate tectonics</a> on Mars. Polar wandering could also explain this <!--del_lnk--> paleomagnetism.<p>Current models of the planet&#39;s interior infer a core region approximately 1,480&nbsp;km in radius, consisting primarily of <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a> with about 15-17% <a href="../../wp/s/Sulfur.htm" title="Sulfur">sulfur</a>. This <!--del_lnk--> iron sulfide core is partially fluid, with twice the concentration of light elements that exists at the Earth&#39;s core. The core is surrounded by a silicate <!--del_lnk--> mantle that formed many of the tectonic and volcanic features on the planet, but now appears to be inactive. The average thickness of the planet&#39;s crust is about 50&nbsp;km, and it is no thicker than 125&nbsp;km.<p>The geological history of Mars is split into three broad epochs:<ul>
       <li><b>Noachian epoch</b> (named after <!--del_lnk--> Noachis Terra): Formation of Mars to between 3800 and 3500 million years ago. Noachian age surfaces are scarred by many large impact craters. The <!--del_lnk--> Tharsis bulge is thought to have formed during this period, with extensive flooding by liquid water late in the epoch.<li><b>Hesperian epoch</b> (named after <!--del_lnk--> Hesperia Planum): 3500 million years ago to 1800 million years ago. The Hesperian epoch is marked by the formation of extensive lava plains.<li><b>Amazonian epoch</b> (named after <!--del_lnk--> Amazonis Planitia): 1800 million years ago to present. Amazonian regions have few meteorite impact craters but are otherwise quite varied. <!--del_lnk--> Olympus Mons formed during this period along with lava flows elsewhere on Mars.</ul>
      <p>An alternative series of classifications, based on data from OMEGA Visible and Infrared Mineralogical Mapping Spectrometer on board the <!--del_lnk--> Mars Express orbiter has also been put forward.<p><a id="Geography_of_Mars_.28Areography.29" name="Geography_of_Mars_.28Areography.29"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Geography of Mars (Areography)</span></h3>

      <p>Although better remembered for mapping the <a href="../../wp/m/Moon.htm" title="Moon">Moon</a> starting in 1830, <!--del_lnk--> Johann Heinrich M&auml;dler and <!--del_lnk--> Wilhelm Beer were the first &quot;areographers&quot;. They started off by establishing once and for all that most of Mars&#39; surface features were permanent, and pinned down Mars&#39; rotation period. In 1840, M&auml;dler combined ten years of observations and drew the first ever map of Mars. Rather than giving names to the various markings they mapped, Beer and M&auml;dler simply designated them with letters; Meridian Bay (Sinus Meridiani) was thus feature &quot;a&quot;.<p>Today, features on Mars are named from a number of sources. Large <!--del_lnk--> albedo features retain many of the older names, but are often updated to reflect new knowledge of the nature of the features. For example, <i>Nix Olympica</i> (the snows of Olympus) has become <i>Olympus Mons</i> (Mount Olympus).<p>Mars&#39; equator is defined by its rotation, but the location of its <!--del_lnk--> Prime Meridian was specified, as was Earth&#39;s, by choice of an arbitrary point. M&auml;dler and Beer selected a line in 1830 for their first maps of Mars. After the spacecraft <!--del_lnk--> Mariner 9 provided extensive imagery of Mars in 1972, a small crater (later called <!--del_lnk--> Airy-0), located in the <!--del_lnk--> Sinus Meridiani (&quot;Middle Bay&quot; or &quot;Meridian Bay&quot;), was chosen for the definition of 0.0&deg; longitude to coincide with the originally selected line.<p>Since Mars has no oceans and hence no &#39;sea level&#39;, a zero-elevation surface or <!--del_lnk--> mean gravity surface must be selected. The zero altitude is defined by the height at which there is 610.5 <!--del_lnk--> Pa (6.105 mbar) of atmospheric pressure (approximately 0.6% of Earth&#39;s). This pressure corresponds to the <!--del_lnk--> triple point of water.<p>The dichotomy of Martian topography is striking: northern plains flattened by lava flows contrast with the southern highlands, pitted and cratered by ancient impacts. The surface of Mars as seen from Earth is thus divided into two kinds of areas, with differing albedo. The paler plains covered with dust and sand rich in reddish iron oxides were once thought of as Martian &#39;continents&#39; and given names like <!--del_lnk--> Arabia Terra (<i>land of Arabia</i>) or <!--del_lnk--> Amazonis Planitia (<i>Amazonian plain</i>). The dark features were thought to be seas, hence their names <!--del_lnk--> Mare Erythraeum, <!--del_lnk--> Mare Sirenum and <!--del_lnk--> Aurorae Sinus. The largest dark feature seen from Earth is <!--del_lnk--> Syrtis Major.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> shield <a href="../../wp/v/Volcano.htm" title="Volcano">volcano</a>, Olympus Mons (<i>Mount Olympus</i>), at 26&nbsp;km is the highest known mountain in the solar system. It is an extinct volcano in the vast upland region Tharsis, which contains several other large volcanoes. It is over three times the height of Mt. Everest which in comparison only stands at 8848 m.<p>Mars is also scarred by a number of <!--del_lnk--> impact craters. The largest of these is the <!--del_lnk--> Hellas impact basin, covered with light red sand.Despite being closer to the asteroid belt, there are far fewer craters on Mars compared with <a href="../../wp/m/Moon.htm" title="Moon">the Moon</a> because Mars&#39; atmosphere provides protection against small meteors. Some craters have a morphology that suggests that the ground was wet when the meteor impacted.<p>The large canyon, <!--del_lnk--> Valles Marineris (Latin for <i><!--del_lnk--> Mariner Valleys</i>, also known as Agathadaemon in the old canal maps), has a length of 4000&nbsp;km and a depth of up to 7&nbsp;km. The length of Valles Marineris is equivalent to the length of Europe and extends across one-fifth the circumference of Mars. By comparison, the <a href="../../wp/g/Grand_Canyon.htm" title="Grand Canyon">Grand Canyon</a> on Earth is only 446&nbsp;km long and nearly 2&nbsp;km deep. Valles Marineris was formed due to the swelling of the Tharis area which caused the crust in the area of Valles Marineris to collapse. Another large canyon is Ma&#39;adim Vallis (Ma&#39;adim is Hebrew for Mars). It is 700&nbsp;km long and again much bigger than the Grand Canyon with a width of 20&nbsp;km and a depth of 2&nbsp;km in some places. It is possible that Ma&#39;adim Vallis was flooded with liquid water in the past.<p>Mars has two permanent polar ice caps, the northern one located at <!--del_lnk--> Planum Boreum and the southern one at <!--del_lnk--> Planum Australe.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> atmosphere of Mars is relatively thin; the <!--del_lnk--> atmospheric pressure on the surface varies from around 30 <!--del_lnk--> Pa (0.03 kPa) on Olympus Mons to over 1155 Pa (1.155 kPa) in the depths of <!--del_lnk--> Hellas Planitia, with a mean surface level pressure of 600 Pa (0.6 kPa), compared to Earth&#39;s 101.3&nbsp;kPa. The equivalent pressure of Mars&#39; atmosphere can be found at a height of 35&nbsp;km above the Earth&#39;s surface. The <!--del_lnk--> scale height of the atmosphere is about 11&nbsp;km, higher than Earth&#39;s 6&nbsp;km. The atmosphere on Mars consists of 95% <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, 3% <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen.htm" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, 1.6% <a href="../../wp/a/Argon.htm" title="Argon">argon</a>, and contains traces of <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> and <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a>. The atmosphere is quite dusty, giving the Martian sky a <!--del_lnk--> tawny colour when seen from the surface; the particulates responsible are about 1.5 <!--del_lnk--> &micro;m across.<p>Several researchers claim to have detected <!--del_lnk--> methane in the Martian atmosphere with a concentration of about 10 <!--del_lnk--> ppb by volume. Methane is an unstable <a href="../../wp/g/Gas.htm" title="Gas">gas</a> that is broken down by <a href="../../wp/u/Ultraviolet.htm" title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> radiation, typically lasting in the atmosphere for about 340 years, and its possible presence on Mars could indicate that there is (or has been within the last few hundred years) a source of the gas on the planet. <!--del_lnk--> Volcanic activity, <a href="../../wp/c/Comet.htm" title="Comet">comet</a> impacts, and the existence of life in the form of <!--del_lnk--> microorganisms such as <!--del_lnk--> methanogens are among possible sources. It was recently shown that methane could also be produced by a non-biological process involving water, carbon dioxide, and the <a href="../../wp/m/Mineral.htm" title="Mineral">mineral</a> <!--del_lnk--> olivine, which is known to be common on Mars.<p>In the winter months when the poles are in continuous darkness, the surface gets so cold that as much as 25&ndash;30% of the entire atmosphere condenses out into thick slabs of <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">CO<sub>2</sub></a> ice (dry ice).<p>When the poles are again exposed to sunlight, the CO<sub>2</sub> ice <!--del_lnk--> sublimes, creating enormous winds that sweep off the poles as fast as 400&nbsp;km/h (250 mph). These seasonal actions transport large amounts of dust and water vapor, giving rise to Earth-like <!--del_lnk--> frost and large <!--del_lnk--> cirrus clouds. Clouds of water-ice were photographed by the <i><!--del_lnk--> Opportunity</i> rover in 2004.<div class="thumb tleft">

However, about 4 billion years ago Mars&#39; planetary <!--del_lnk--> dynamo ceased, leaving only remnants of the planetary magnetic field to be <!--del_lnk--> frozen into magnetically susceptible minerals. Over time, most of this material was reprocessed through various geological events leaving only sections of the ancient southern highlands with remnant magnetic fields. Because of this, the solar wind interacts directly with the Martian <!--del_lnk--> ionosphere and thus the Martian atmosphere has been slowly stripped off into space, although the exact amount lost remains uncertain. Both <!--del_lnk--> Mars Global Surveyor and <!--del_lnk--> Mars Express have detected ionised atmospheric particles trailing off into space behind Mars.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Of all the planets, Mars&#39; seasons are the most Earth-like due to the similar tilts of the two planets&#39; rotational axes. However, the lengths of the Martian seasons are about twice those of Earth&#39;s, as Mars&#39; greater distance from the sun leads to the Martian year being approximately two Earth years in length. Martian surface temperatures vary from lows of approximately &ndash;140 <!--del_lnk--> &deg;C (&minus;220 <!--del_lnk--> &deg;F) during the polar winters to highs of up to 20 &deg;C (70 &deg;F) in summers. The wide range in temperatures is due to the thin atmosphere which cannot store much solar heat. Recent evidence has suggested that Mars is subject to short term regional climate changes.<p>If Mars had an Earthlike orbit, its seasons would be similar to Earth&#39;s because its axial tilt is similar to Earth&#39;s. However, the comparatively large eccentricity of the Martian orbit has a significant effect. Mars is near <!--del_lnk--> perihelion when it is summer in the southern hemisphere and winter in the north, and near <!--del_lnk--> aphelion when it is winter in the southern hemisphere and summer in the north. As a result, the seasons in the southern hemisphere are more extreme and the seasons in the northern are milder than would otherwise be the case.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Mars also has the largest <!--del_lnk--> dust storms in the Solar System. These can vary from a storm over a small area, to gigantic storms that cover the entire planet. They tend to occur when Mars is closest to the Sun, which increases the global temperature.<p>Mars possesses polar caps at both poles, which mainly consist of water ice. Frozen carbon dioxide (dry ice) accumulates as a thin layer about one metre thick on the north cap in the northern winter only, while the south cap has a permanent dry ice cover about eight metres thick.. The northern polar cap has a diameter of approximately 1,000 kilometres during the northern Mars summer, and contains about 1.6 million cubic kilometres of ice, which if spread evenly on the cap would be 2 kilometres thick The southern polar cap has a diameter of 350&nbsp;km, and a thickness of 3&nbsp;km. Both polar caps show spiral cuts, which remain unexplained. Both polar caps shrink and regrow following the temperature fluctuation of the Martian seasons.<p><a id="Orbit_and_rotation" name="Orbit_and_rotation"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Orbit and rotation</span></h2>

      <p>Mars has a relatively pronounced orbital eccentricity of about 9%; of the other planets in the solar system, only <!--del_lnk--> Mercury shows greater eccentricity. Mars&#39; average distance from the Sun is roughly 230 million&nbsp;km (1.5 AU) and its orbital period is 687 (Earth) days. The solar day (or sol) on Mars is only slightly longer than an Earth day: 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds.<p>Mars&#39; axial tilt is 25.19 degrees, which is similar to the axial tilt of the Earth. As a result, Mars has seasons like the Earth, though Mars&#39; are about twice as long given its longer year.<p>The image to the right shows a comparison between Mars and <a href="../../wp/1/1_Ceres.htm" title="1 Ceres">Ceres</a>, a <!--del_lnk--> dwarf planet in the <!--del_lnk--> Asteroid Belt as seen from the <!--del_lnk--> ecliptic pole (top) and from the ascending node (below).

      <p>Mars has two tiny natural moons, Phobos and <!--del_lnk--> Deimos, which orbit very close to the planet and are thought to be captured asteroids.<p>Both satellites were discovered in 1877 by <!--del_lnk--> Asaph Hall, and are named after the characters <!--del_lnk--> Phobos (panic/fear) and <!--del_lnk--> Deimos (terror/dread) who, in Greek mythology, accompanied their father Ares, god of war, into battle. Ares was known as Mars to the Romans.<p>From the surface of Mars, the motions of Phobos and Deimos appear very different from that of our own moon. Phobos rises in the west, sets in the east, and rises again in just 11 hours, while Deimos, being only just outside synchronous orbit, rises as expected in the east but very slowly. Despite its 30 hour orbit, it takes 2.7 days to set in the west as it slowly falls behind the rotation of Mars, and as long again to rise.<p>Because Phobos&#39; orbit is below synchronous altitude, the tidal forces are lowering its orbit and in about 50 million years, it will either crash into Mars&#39; surface or break up into a ring structure around Mars.<p>Famous literary author <!--del_lnk--> Jonathan Swift made reference to these moons of Mars, approximately 150 years before their actual discovery by Asaph Hall, detailing reasonably accurate descriptions of their orbits, in the 19th chapter of his novel <!--del_lnk--> Gulliver&#39;s Travels.<p><a id="Life" name="Life"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Life</span></h2>
      <p>Some evidence suggests that the planet was once significantly more habitable than it is today, but whether living <a href="../../wp/o/Organism.htm" title="Organism">organisms</a> ever existed there is still an open question. The <!--del_lnk--> Viking probes of the mid-1970s carried experiments designed to detect microorganisms in Martian soil at their respective landing sites, and had some positive results, later disputed by many scientists, resulting in a continuing fight. At the <!--del_lnk--> Johnson space centre lab organic compounds have been found in the <!--del_lnk--> meteorite <!--del_lnk--> ALH84001, which is supposed to have come from Mars. They concluded that these were deposited by primitive life forms extant on Mars before the meteorite was blasted into space by a meteor strike and sent on a 15 million-year voyage to Earth. Small quantities of <!--del_lnk--> methane, and <!--del_lnk--> formaldehyde are both claimed to be hints for life, as these particles would quickly break down in the Martian atmosphere. It is possible that these compounds may be replenished by volcanic or geological means such as <!--del_lnk--> serpentinization.<p>In general, Mars shows some promise in terms of <a href="../../wp/p/Planetary_habitability.htm" title="Planetary habitability">habitablity</a> but also several handicaps. It is half of an <!--del_lnk--> astronomical unit beyond the Sun&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> habitable zone and water is thus frozen on its surface, though liquid water flows in the past underscore the planet&#39;s potential. Its lack of a magnetosphere and extremely thin atmosphere are a greater challenge: the planet has little <!--del_lnk--> heat transfer across its surface, poor insulation against bombardment and the <!--del_lnk--> solar wind, and insufficient atmospheric pressure to keep water in liquid form (instead it sublimates to a gaseous state). Mars is also nearly, or perhaps totally, geologically dead; the end of volcanic activity has stopped the recycling of chemicals and minerals between the surface and interior of the planet.<p><a id="Exploration" name="Exploration"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Exploration</span></h2>

      <p>The first successful fly-by mission to Mars was NASA&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Mariner 4 launched in 1964. The first successful objects to land on the surface were two <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> probes, <!--del_lnk--> Mars 2 and <!--del_lnk--> Mars 3 from the <!--del_lnk--> Mars probe program, launched in 1971, but both lost contact within seconds of landing.

They also mapped the surface of Mars so well that the images are still sometimes used to this day. The Soviet probes <!--del_lnk--> Phobos 1 and 2 were also sent to Mars in 1988 to study Mars and its two moons, unfortunately Phobos 1 lost contact on the way to Mars, and Phobos 2, while successfully photographing Mars and Phobos, failed just before it was set to release two landers on Phobos&#39; surface.<p><a id="Current_missions" name="Current_missions"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Current missions</span></h3>

      <p>Future plans for unmanned Mars Exploration include the sending of the <a href="../../wp/p/Phoenix_%2528spacecraft%2529.htm" title="Phoenix (spacecraft)">Phoenix Lander</a> in 2007, followed by the <!--del_lnk--> Mars Science Laboratory in 2009, the <!--del_lnk--> Phobos-Grunt sample-return mission, to return samples of Phobos, a Martian moon. Other missions have been proposed, although not yet confirmed.<p>Manned Mars exploration by the United States has been explicitly identified as a long-term goal in the <!--del_lnk--> Vision for Space Exploration announced in 2004 by US President <a href="../../wp/g/George_W._Bush.htm" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>.<p>The European Space Agency hopes to land the first humans on Mars between 2030 and 2035. This will be preceded by successively larger probes, starting with the launch of the <!--del_lnk--> ExoMars probe in 2013, followed by the &#39;Mars Sample Return Mission&#39;. Likewise, astronauts will be sent to the moon between 2020 and 2025 in preparation for this mission.<p><a id="Astronomical_observations_from_Mars" name="Astronomical_observations_from_Mars"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Astronomical observations from Mars</span></h2>

      <p>It is now possible, with the existence of various orbiters, landers, and rovers to study <a href="../../wp/a/Astronomy.htm" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a> from the Martian skies. In particular, the Earth and the Moon would easily be visible to the <!--del_lnk--> naked eye. Also, one could observe the two <!--del_lnk--> moons of Mars. The moon Phobos appears about one third the <!--del_lnk--> angular diameter that the full Moon appears from Earth, and when it is full it is bright enough to cast shadows. On the other hand Deimos appears more or less starlike, and appears only slightly brighter than Venus does from Earth.<p>There are also various phenomena well-known on Earth that have now been observed on Mars, such as <a href="../../wp/m/Meteor.htm" title="Meteor">meteors</a> and <!--del_lnk--> auroras. The first meteor photographed on Mars was on <!--del_lnk--> March 7, <!--del_lnk--> 2004 by the <i><!--del_lnk--> Spirit</i> rover. Auroras occur on Mars, but they do not occur at the poles as on Earth, because Mars has no planetwide magnetic field. Rather, they occur near magnetic anomalies in Mars&#39;s <a href="../../wp/c/Crust_%2528geology%2529.htm" title="Crust (geology)">crust</a>, which are remnants from earlier days when Mars did have a magnetic field. They would probably be invisible to the naked eye, being largely <a href="../../wp/u/Ultraviolet.htm" title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> phenomena.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>A <!--del_lnk--> transit of the Earth as seen from Mars will occur on <!--del_lnk--> November 10, <!--del_lnk--> 2084. At that time, the Sun, Earth and Mars will be exactly collinear. There are also <!--del_lnk--> transits of Mercury and <!--del_lnk--> transits of Venus, and the moon Deimos is of sufficiently small angular diameter that its partial &quot;eclipses&quot; of the Sun are best considered transits (see <!--del_lnk--> Transit of Deimos from Mars).<p>The only <!--del_lnk--> occultation of Mars by Venus observed was that of <!--del_lnk--> October 3, <!--del_lnk--> 1590, seen by M.

      <p>To a naked-eye observer, Mars usually shows a distinct yellow, orange, or reddish colour, and varies in brightness more than any other planet, as seen from Earth, over the course of its orbit. When farthest away from the Earth, it is more than seven times as far from the latter as when it is closest (when least favourably positioned, it can be lost in the Sun&#39;s glare for months at a time). At its most favourable times &mdash; which occur twice every 32 years, alternately at 15 and 17-year intervals, and always between late July and late September &mdash; Mars shows a wealth of surface detail to a <a href="../../wp/t/Telescope.htm" title="Telescope">telescope</a>. Especially noticeable, even at low magnification, are the <a href="../../wp/p/Polar_ice_cap.htm" title="Polar ice cap">polar ice caps</a>.<p>Approximately every 780 days <!--del_lnk--> opposition occurs, which is about when Mars is nearest to Earth. (Because of the eccentricities of the orbits, the times of opposition and minimum distance can differ by up to 8.5 days.) The minimum distance varies between about 55 and 100 million km due to the planets&#39; <!--del_lnk--> elliptical orbits. The next Mars opposition will occur on <!--del_lnk--> December 24, <!--del_lnk--> 2007.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> August 27, <!--del_lnk--> 2003, at 9:51:13 UT, Mars made its closest approach to Earth in nearly 60,000 years: 55,758,006 km (approximately 35 million miles). This occurred when Mars was one day from <!--del_lnk--> opposition and about three days from its <!--del_lnk--> perihelion, making Mars particularly easy to see from Earth. The last time it came so close is estimated to have been on <!--del_lnk--> September 12, <!--del_lnk--> 57,617 BC., the next time being in 2287. However, this record approach was only very slightly closer than other recent close approaches. For instance, the minimum distance on <!--del_lnk--> August 22, <!--del_lnk--> 1924 was 0.37284 <!--del_lnk--> AU, compared to 0.37271 AU on <!--del_lnk--> August 27, <!--del_lnk--> 2003, and the minimum distance on <!--del_lnk--> August 24, <!--del_lnk--> 2208 will be 0.37278 AU.<p>The orbital changes of Earth and Mars are making the approaches nearer: the 2003 record will be bettered 22 times by the year 4000.<p><a id="Historical_observations_of_Mars" name="Historical_observations_of_Mars"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Historical observations of Mars</span></h3>

      <p>The history of observations of Mars is marked by the <!--del_lnk--> oppositions of Mars, when the planet is closest to Earth and hence is most easily visible, which occur every couple of years. Even more notable are the <!--del_lnk--> perihelic oppositions of Mars which occur approximately every 16 years, and are distiguished because Mars is close to <!--del_lnk--> perihelion making it even closer to Earth.<p>By the 19th century, the resolution of telescopes reached a level sufficient for surface features to be identified. In September 1877, a perihelic opposition of Mars occurred on <!--del_lnk--> September 5). In that year, <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italian</a> astronomer <!--del_lnk--> Giovanni Schiaparelli, while in <a href="../../wp/m/Milan.htm" title="Milan">Milan</a>, used a 22cm telescope to help produce the first detailed map of Mars. These maps notably contained features he called <i>canali</i>, which were later shown to be an <!--del_lnk--> optical illusion. These <i>canali</i> were supposedly long straight lines on the surface of Mars to which he gave names of famous rivers on Earth. His term was popularly mistranslated as <i>canals</i>.<p>Influenced by the observations the orientalist <!--del_lnk--> Percival Lowell founded an <!--del_lnk--> observatory which had a 12 and 18 inch telescope. The observatory was used for the exploration of Mars during the last good opportunity in 1894 and the following less favorable oppositions. He published several books on Mars and life on Mars which had a great influence on the public. The <i>canali</i> were also found by other astronomers, like Perrotin and Thollon in <!--del_lnk--> Nice, using one of the largest telescopes of that time.<p>The seasonal changes (consisting of the diminishing of the polar caps and the dark areas formed during Martian summer) in combination with the canals lead to speculation about life on Mars and it was a long held belief that Mars contained vast seas and vegetation. The telescope never reached the resolution required to give proof to any speculations. However, as bigger telescopes were used, fewer long, straight <i>canali</i> were observed. During an observation in 1909 by Flammarion with a 33 inch telescope, irregular patterns were observed, but no <i>canali</i> were seen. <p>Even in the 1960s articles were published on Martian biology, putting aside explanations other than life for the seasonal changes on Mars. Detailed scenarios for the metabolism and chemical cycles for a functional ecosystem have been published. <p>It was not until <!--del_lnk--> spacecraft visited the planet during <!--del_lnk--> NASA&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Mariner missions in the 1960s that these myths were dispelled. The results of the Viking life detection experiments started an intermission in which the hypothesis of hostile dead Mars was generally accepted.<p>Some maps of Mars were made using the data from these missions, but it wasn&#39;t until the <!--del_lnk--> Mars Global Surveyor mission, launched in 1996 and still operational as of 2006, that complete, extremely detailed maps were obtained. These maps are now available online at <!--del_lnk--> Google Mars.<p><a id="Mars_in_human_culture" name="Mars_in_human_culture"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Mars in human culture</span></h2>

      <p>Mars is named after the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Roman</a> <!--del_lnk--> god of war. In <a href="../../wp/b/Babylonia.htm" title="Babylonia">Babylonian</a> astronomy, the planet was named after <i><!--del_lnk--> Nergal</i>, their <a href="../../wp/d/Deity.htm" title="Deity">deity</a> of fire, war, and destruction, most likely due to the planet&#39;s reddish appearance. When the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Greeks</a> equated Nergal with their god of war, Ares, they named the planet &#x1F0C;&rho;&epsilon;&omega;&sigmaf; &#x1F00;&sigma;&tau;&#x1F21;&rho; (<i>Areos aster</i>), or &quot;star of Ares&quot;. Then, following the <!--del_lnk--> identification of Ares and Mars, it was translated into Latin as <i>stella Martis</i>, or &quot;star of Mars&quot;, or simply <i>Mars</i>. The Greeks also called the planet &Pi;&upsilon;&rho;&#x3CC;&epsilon;&iota;&sigmaf; <i>Pyroeis</i> meaning &quot;fiery&quot;. In <!--del_lnk--> Hindu mythology, Mars is known as <!--del_lnk--> Mangala (&#x92E;&#x902;&#x917;&#x932;). The planet is also called <i>Angaraka</i> in <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>. He is the god of war and is <!--del_lnk--> celibate. He is the owner of the <!--del_lnk--> Aries and <!--del_lnk--> Scorpio signs, and a teacher of the occult sciences. The planet was known by the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">Egyptians</a> as &quot;<i>&#x1E24;r D&scaron;r</i>&quot;;;;; or &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Horus the Red&quot;.

      <p>The depiction of Mars in fiction has been stimulated by its dramatic red colour and by early scientific speculations that its surface conditions might be capable of supporting life.<p>Until the arrival of planetary probes, the traditional view of Mars derived from the astronomers <!--del_lnk--> Percival Lowell and <!--del_lnk--> Giovanni Schiaparelli, whose observation of supposedly linear features on the planet created the myth of canals on Mars. For many years, the standard notion of the planet was a drying, cooling, dying world with ancient civilizations constructing irrigation works. Thus originated a large number of science fiction scenarios, the best known of which is <!--del_lnk--> H. G. Wells&#39; <i><!--del_lnk--> The War of the Worlds</i>, in which Martians seek to escape their dying planet by invading Earth. Of considerable note is the release of a radio broadcast of <!--del_lnk--> War of the Worlds on <!--del_lnk--> October 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1938. It was broadcasted as a news release, and many people mistook it for the truth. Also influential was Ray Bradbury&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> The Martian Chronicles</i>, in which human explorers find a dying Martian civilization, as well as <!--del_lnk--> Burroughs&#39; <i><!--del_lnk--> Barsoom series</i> and a number of <!--del_lnk--> Robert A. Heinlein stories prior to the mid-sixties.<p>After the <!--del_lnk--> Mariner and <!--del_lnk--> Viking spacecraft had returned pictures of Mars as it really is, an apparently lifeless and canal-less world, these ideas about Mars had to be abandoned and a vogue for accurate, realist depictions of human colonies on Mars developed, the best known of which may be <!--del_lnk--> Kim Stanley Robinson&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> <i>Mars</i> trilogy. However, pseudo-scientific speculations about the <!--del_lnk--> Face on Mars and other enigmatic landmarks spotted by space probes have meant that ancient civilizations continue to be a popular theme in science fiction, especially in film.<p>Another popular theme, particularly among American writers, is the Martian colony that fights for independence from Earth. This is a major plot element in the novels of <!--del_lnk--> Greg Bear and <!--del_lnk--> Kim Stanley Robinson, as well as the movie <i><!--del_lnk--> Total Recall</i> (based on a short story by <!--del_lnk--> Philip K. Dick) and the television series <i><!--del_lnk--> Babylon 5</i>. Many video games also use this element, such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Red Faction</i> and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Zone of the Enders</i> series. Mars (and its moons) were also the setting for the popular <a href="../../wp/d/Doom.htm" title="Doom">Doom</a> video game franchise and the later <!--del_lnk--> Martian Gothic .<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars&quot;</div>
