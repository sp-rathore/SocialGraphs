      <p>Mercury is used primarily for the manufacture of industrial chemicals or for electrical and electronic applications. It is used in some <!--del_lnk--> thermometers, especially ones which are used to measure high temperatures (In the United States, non-prescription sale of mercury fever thermometers is banned by a number of different states and localities). Other uses:<ul>
       <li>Mercury <!--del_lnk--> sphygmomanometers.<li>Mercury <!--del_lnk--> barometers, <!--del_lnk--> diffusion pumps, <!--del_lnk--> coulometers, and many other laboratory instruments. As an opaque liquid with a very high density, it is ideal for this role.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> triple point of mercury, -38.8344 &deg;C, is a fixed point used as a temperature standard for the International Temperature Scale (<!--del_lnk--> ITS-90).<li>In some gaseous <!--del_lnk--> electron tubes, <!--del_lnk--> mercury arc rectifier<li>Gaseous mercury is used in <!--del_lnk--> mercury-vapor lamps and some &quot;<!--del_lnk--> neon sign&quot; type advertising signs and <!--del_lnk--> fluorescent lamps.<li>Liquid mercury was sometimes used as a <!--del_lnk--> coolant for <!--del_lnk--> nuclear reactors. However, <a href="../../wp/s/Sodium.htm" title="Sodium">sodium</a> is proposed for reactors cooled with liquid metal, because the high density of mercury requires much energy for circulating the coolant.<li>Mercury was once used in the <!--del_lnk--> amalgamation process of refining <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Silver.htm" title="Silver">silver</a> <!--del_lnk--> ores.

      <p>From the mid-18th to the mid-19th centuries, a process called &quot;carroting&quot; was used in the making of <!--del_lnk--> felt hats. Animal skins were rinsed in an orange solution of the mercury compound <!--del_lnk--> mercuric nitrate, Hg(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&middot;2H<sub>2</sub>O. This process separated the fur from the pelt and matted it together. This solution and the vapors it produced were highly toxic. Its use resulted in widespread cases of <!--del_lnk--> mercury poisoning among hatters. Symptoms included <!--del_lnk--> tremors, <!--del_lnk--> emotional lability, <!--del_lnk--> insomnia, <!--del_lnk--> dementia and <!--del_lnk--> hallucinations. The <!--del_lnk--> United States Public Health Service banned the use of mercury in the felt industry in December 1941.

      <p>Elemental mercury is the main ingredient in <!--del_lnk--> dental amalgams. Controversy over the <!--del_lnk--> health effects from the use of mercury amalgams began shortly after its introduction into the western world, nearly 200 years ago. In 1843, The <!--del_lnk--> American Society of Dental Surgeons, concerned about mercury poisoning, required its members to sign a pledge that they would not use amalgam. In 1859, The <!--del_lnk--> American Dental Association was formed by dentists who believed amalgam was &quot;safe and effective.&quot; The ADA &quot;continues to believe that amalgam is a valuable, viable and safe choice for dental patients,&quot; as written in their statement on dental amalgam. In 1993, the <!--del_lnk--> United States Public Health Service reported that &quot;amalgam fillings release small amounts of mercury vapor,&quot; but in such a small amount that it &quot;has not been shown to cause any &hellip; adverse health effects.&quot; This position is not shared by all governments and there is an ongoing <!--del_lnk--> dental amalgam controversy. A recent review by an FDA appointed advisory panel, the panelists, in a 13-7 vote, rejected the current FDA report on amalgam safety stating the report&#39;s conclusions weren&#39;t reasonable, given the quantity and quality of information currently available. Panelists said remaining uncertainties about the risk of so-called silver fillings demanded further research, in particular, on the effects of mercury-laden fillings on children and the fetuses of pregnant women with fillings and the release of mercury vapor on insertion and removal of mercury fillings.<p><a id="Medicine" name="Medicine"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Medicine</span></h3>
      <p>Mercury and its compounds have been used in medicine for centuries, although they are much less common today than they once were, now that the toxic effects of mercury and its compounds are more widely known and understood.<p><!--del_lnk--> Mercury(I) chloride (also known as <!--del_lnk--> calomel or mercurous chloride) has traditionally been used as a <!--del_lnk--> diuretic, topical <!--del_lnk--> disinfectant, and <!--del_lnk--> laxative. <!--del_lnk--> Mercury(II) chloride (also known as mercuric chloride or corrosive sublimate) was once used to treat <!--del_lnk--> syphilis (along with other mercury compounds), although it is so toxic that sometimes the symptoms of its toxicity were confused with those of the syphilis it was believed to treat (Pimple 2004); it was also used as a disinfectant. <!--del_lnk--> Blue mass, a pill or syrup in which mercury is the main ingredient, was prescribed throughout the <!--del_lnk--> 1800s for numerous conditions including constipation, depression, child-bearing and toothaches. In the early 20th century, mercury was administered to children yearly as a laxative and dewormer, and it was used in teething powders for infants. The mercury containing organohalide <!--del_lnk--> Mercurochrome is still widely used but has been banned in some countries such as the U.S.<p>Some <!--del_lnk--> vaccines have contained the preservative <!--del_lnk--> Thimerosal (partly <!--del_lnk--> ethyl mercury) since the <!--del_lnk--> 1930s FDA report. It has been widely speculated that this mercury-based preservative can trigger <a href="../../wp/a/Autism.htm" title="Autism">autism</a> in children who are already genetically predisposed to it; however, medical evidence in recent studies has shown no evidence supporting any such link.<p>Mercury in the form of one of its common ores, <!--del_lnk--> cinnabar, remains an important component of <!--del_lnk--> Chinese, <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan, and <!--del_lnk--> Ayurvedic medicine. As problems may arise when these medicines are exported to countries that prohibit the use of mercury in medicines, in recent times, less toxic substitutes have been devised.<p>Today, the use of mercury in medicine has greatly declined in all respects, especially in developed countries. <!--del_lnk--> Thermometers and <!--del_lnk--> sphygmomanometers containing mercury were invented in the early 18th and late 19th centuries, respectively. In the early 21st century, their use is declining and has been banned in some countries, states and medical institutions. In <!--del_lnk--> 2002, the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Senate passed legislation to phase out the sale of <!--del_lnk--> non-prescription mercury thermometers. In <!--del_lnk--> 2003, <!--del_lnk--> Washington and <!--del_lnk--> Maine became the first states to ban mercury blood pressure devices. Mercury compounds are found in some <!--del_lnk--> over-the-counter drugs, including topical <!--del_lnk--> antiseptics, stimulant <!--del_lnk--> laxatives, <!--del_lnk--> diaper-rash <!--del_lnk--> ointment, <!--del_lnk--> eye drops, and <!--del_lnk--> nasal sprays.

      </div>
      <p>Mercury is an extremely rare element in the earth&#39;s crust, having an average crustal abundance by mass of only 0.08 parts per million. However, because it does not blend <!--del_lnk--> geochemically with those elements that comprise the majority of the crustal mass, mercury ores can be extraordinarily concentrated considering the element&#39;s abundance in ordinary rock. The richest mercury ores contain up to 2.5% mercury by mass, and even the leanest concentrated deposits are at least 0.1% mercury (12,000 times average crustal abundance). This makes mercury ore the most easily depleted of all metal ores. Depletion of mercury ores has been a major concern since the 1960s and it is now almost certain that the last mineable deposits were discovered in <a href="../../wp/a/Algeria.htm" title="Algeria">Algeria</a> in the mid-1970s. Since the early 1970s, total world production of mercury has fallen from 9,000 <!--del_lnk--> tons to 1,600 tons due to depletion of reserve.<p>It is found either as a native metal (rare) or in <!--del_lnk--> cinnabar, <!--del_lnk--> corderoite, <!--del_lnk--> livingstonite, and other <a href="../../wp/m/Mineral.htm" title="Mineral">minerals</a> with cinnabar (Hg<a href="../../wp/s/Sulfur.htm" title="Sulfur">S</a>) being the most common ore. Mercury ores usually occur in very young orogenic belts where rock of high density are forced to the crust of the Earth, often in hot springs or other <a href="../../wp/v/Volcano.htm" title="Volcano">volcanic</a> regions. Most present-day production occurs in <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>, <a href="../../wp/k/Kyrgyzstan.htm" title="Kyrgyzstan">Kyrgyzstan</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Tajikistan.htm" title="Tajikistan">Tajikistan</a>. Over 100,000 tons of mercury were mined from the region of <!--del_lnk--> Huancavelica, <a href="../../wp/p/Peru.htm" title="Peru">Peru</a>, over the course of three centuries following the discovery of deposits there in 1563; mercury from Huancavelica was crucial in the production of silver in colonial Spanish America.

      <p><a href="../../wp/f/Fish.htm" title="Fish">Fish</a> and <!--del_lnk--> shellfish have a natural tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often in the form of <!--del_lnk--> methylmercury, a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the <!--del_lnk--> food chain, such as <a href="../../wp/s/Shark.htm" title="Shark">shark</a>, <!--del_lnk--> swordfish, <!--del_lnk--> king mackerel, <!--del_lnk--> albacore tuna, and <!--del_lnk--> tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. This is because mercury is stored in the muscle tissues of fish, and when a predatory fish eats another fish, it assumes the entire body burden of mercury in the consumed fish. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the <!--del_lnk--> food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher, or more, than the species they consume. This process is called <!--del_lnk--> biomagnification. The complexities associated with mercury fate and transport are relatively succinctly described by USEPA in their 1997 Mercury Study Report to Congress. Because methylmercury and high levels of elemental mercury can be particularly toxic to unborn or young children, organizations such as the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. EPA and FDA recommend that women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant within the next one or two years, as well as young children avoid eating more than 6 ounces (one average meal) of fish per week. In the United States the FDA has an action level for methyl mercury in commercial marine and freshwater fish that is 1.0 parts per million (ppm), and in Canada the limit for the total of mercury content is 0.5 (ppm).<p><a id="A_common_warning" name="A_common_warning"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">A common warning</span></h4>

      <p>The effects of consuming fish high in mercury is in dispute with the University of Rochester&#39;s study of people in the Republic of the Seychelles. While there is no doubt high level exposure to methyl mercury is definitely toxic, low level exposure isn&#39;t. A recent Harvard Medical School study of mothers and their infants suggests that the nutritional benefits of fish outweigh the effects of mercury. In the HMS study, each additional weekly serving of fish consumed by the mother during pregnancy was associated with an increase in infant cognition.<p>What one Professor Emeritus of Engineering (University of Denver) says about mercury in fish:<blockquote>
       <p>Recently (December 2003), news reports stated that tuna fish contained &quot;large amounts of mercury&quot; in an alarming tone. What they really should have said is that tuna fish contains only extremely small, scarcely detectable, amounts of methyl mercury. The extrapolated threat appears to be to the nerves of developing fetuses. I wonder how many cases have been observed of fetal mercury damage by normal tuna fish. I suspect that the number is zero. The authorities probably have no idea of the magnitude of the hazard, only that a hazard could be possible. Perhaps we have homeopaths at work here! Generally, they deal in extrapolations of inexact data to minute concentrations, and probably do not know the rate at which organisms take up and excrete such tiny quantities. The problem is that methyl mercury could be a threat, but I have no confidence that the authorities know enough about it to protect the public, only to enjoy the creation of panic. Tuna fish, indeed, also contains many nutrients valuable to fetuses.</blockquote>

      <p>Historically, one of the largest releases was from the Colex plant, a Lithium isotope separation plant at Oak Ridge. The plant operated in the 1950&#39;s and 1960&#39;s. Records are incomplete and unclear, but govt commissions have estimated 2 million pounds of mercury are unaccounted for.<p>The primary sources of mercury to the environment are <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil_fuel.htm" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuel</a> burning (primarily <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a>) and solid waste <!--del_lnk--> incineration (Nriagu &amp; Pacyna, 1988). Power plants in the U.S., according to U.S. <!--del_lnk--> Environmental Protection Agency, are one of the main emitters of mercury &mdash; 48 tonnes a year<p>The United States <!--del_lnk--> Clean Air Act, passed in 1990, put mercury on a list of toxic pollutants which need to be controlled to the greatest possible extent. Thus, certain industries that emit mercury into the environment must install maximum achievable control technologies (MACT). However, a March 2005 EPA rule took power plants off the list of sources which must reduce mercury to the maximum extent. Instead, a <!--del_lnk--> cap and trade rule was issued, with most of the reductions in mercury pollution from power plants beginning in the year 2018. States were also given until November, 2006 to impose stricter controls, and several states are doing so. The rule was being subjected to legal challenges from several states in 2005.<p><a id="Mercury_and_aluminium" name="Mercury_and_aluminium"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Mercury and aluminium</span></h3>
      <p>Mercury readily combines with <a href="../../wp/a/Aluminium.htm" title="Aluminium">aluminium</a> to form an <!--del_lnk--> amalgam when the two pure metals come into contact. However, when the amalgam is exposed to air, the aluminium oxidizes, leaving behind mercury. The oxide flakes away, exposing more mercury amalgam, which repeats the process. This process continues until the supply of amalgam is exhausted, and since it releases mercury, a small amount of mercury can &ldquo;eat through&rdquo; a large amount of aluminium over time, by progressively forming amalgam and relinquishing the aluminium as oxide.<p>Aluminium in air is ordinarily protected by a molecule-thin layer of its own oxide (which is not porous to oxygen). Mercury coming into contact with this oxide does no harm. However, if any elemental aluminium is exposed (even by a recent scratch), the mercury may combine with it, starting the process described above, and potentially damaging a large part of the aluminium before it finally ends (Ornitz 1998).<p>For this reason, restrictions are placed on the use and handling of mercury in proximity with aluminium. In particular, mercury is not allowed aboard aircraft under most circumstances because of the risk of it forming amalgam with exposed aluminium parts in the aircraft.<p><a id="Reclamation_of_mercury_mines" name="Reclamation_of_mercury_mines"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Reclamation of mercury mines</span></h2>
      <p>Due to minimal surface disruption, mercury mines lend themselves to constructive re-use. For example, in 1976 the <!--del_lnk--> Santa Clara County, California purchased the <!--del_lnk--> historic Almaden Quicksilver Mine and proceeded to create a county park on the site, after conducting extensive safety and environmental analysis of the property.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_%28element%29&quot;</div>
