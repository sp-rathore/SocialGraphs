      <p><b>Marc Pugh</b> (born <!--del_lnk--> Bacup, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> on <!--del_lnk--> April 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1987) is a professional <!--del_lnk--> English <a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Football (soccer)">footballer</a> currently playing for <!--del_lnk--> Bury F.C in the English <!--del_lnk--> Football League 2. He plays mainly as an <!--del_lnk--> attacking midfielder but can play as a <!--del_lnk--> striker and on the <!--del_lnk--> wing. He has represented England in the North-West of England team and attended the All Saints High School in <!--del_lnk--> Rossendale.<p>

      <p>His footballing career began at the <!--del_lnk--> Football League Championship side <!--del_lnk--> Burnley F.C where at a young age, he started as a Centre of Excellence player, and gradually worked his way up through the ranks to become a footballing apprentice. He began as a first year apprentice which involved both playing for the youth and reserve teams and taking a &#39;Modern Apprenticeship In Sporting Excellence&#39; at college. This was spread out over three years and by the second year the club would either take them on as 3rd year apprentices or release them. Due to Marc&#39;s great goalscoring record (which led him to be named on the first team bench) they decided to keep him on for a third year.<p>As a 3rd year apprentice he scored 15 goals for the club&#39;s reserve and youth team. This led to him to be sent out on loan to <!--del_lnk--> Kidderminster Harriers, a <!--del_lnk--> Nationwide Conference team, for real footballing experience. Whilst at the Harriers, he scored one goal and made 10 appearances. Also, during a match he did a smart piece of skill which involved flicking the ball over an opponents head with his heel, then crossing the ball in for a teammate to score. The move was featured on <!--del_lnk--> Soccer AM&#39;s showboating section as showboat of the week. Also, during a reserve match, Marc had to play in <!--del_lnk--> goal after reserve keeper Mark Crossley was sent off. The Harriers lost the game 7-1, but Marc had a good game in the goal. As a result, he is high in the list of stand-in goalkeepers during matches.<p>During the course of the season, Marc learned that he would not get a professional contract at Burnley, and would be released at the end of the season. This was partly due to the fact that both <!--del_lnk--> Chris McCann and <!--del_lnk--> Kyle Lafferty had both already received first team contracts and they were only 2nd year apprentices.<p><a id="Professional_Career" name="Professional_Career"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Professional Career</span></h3>
      <p>Having just been released from Burnley, Marc started looking for a new club, and was eventually offered a place at <!--del_lnk--> League Two side <!--del_lnk--> Bury FC. At the time of Marc&#39;s arrival at Bury, the threat of relegation loomed over the club. On top of this, the club had lost several good players to <!--del_lnk--> Preston (including David Nugent and Simon Whaley). As a result, Bury&#39;s season had slumped and they were entangled in a relegation battle. Pugh ended up playing six games in the 05/06 season for the club (including 3 as a sub) and scored his first goal in the 1-1 draw against <!--del_lnk--> Lincoln City. As a result of his good performances (and helped by the fact that Bury had survived relegation), Bury manager <!--del_lnk--> Chris Casper offered him a one year deal at Gigg Lane; his first professional contract. Pugh will no doubt be looking forward to a more stable season in 06/07 in what will be his first professional season and will want to put in some good performances in order to gain a longer contract. His squad number is 31 for Bury in the 06/07 season as it was for the six games he had at the end of the season.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Pugh&quot;</div>
