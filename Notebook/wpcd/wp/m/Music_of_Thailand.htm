      <p>Thai music was part of an oral culture and developed no traditional system of notation. &quot;As an integrated, unique system the traditional music of Thailand is probably not more than six hundred years old.&quot; (Morton 1978, p.1) The classical or <!--del_lnk--> Bangkok period beginning 1782 may be considered &quot;a culmination of musical evolution that probably started, as nearly as can be ascertained from the references, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries with the rise of <!--del_lnk--> Ayuthaya as the capital,&quot; (ibid) in 1350. Music flourished for the next few centuries, in spite of occasional oppression from monarchs like <!--del_lnk--> Rama I and the burning of Ayuthaya, including its art collections and libraries, in 1767 the result of which is a loss of most knowledge necessary to reconstruct the history of Thai music before the Bangkok period.<p><a id="Genres" name="Genres"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Genres</span></h2>

      <p>The earliest Thai ensembles were called <!--del_lnk--> piphat, and they included <!--del_lnk--> woodwind and <!--del_lnk--> percussion instruments, originally in order to accompany traditional theatre and religious rituals. Another ensemble type, <!--del_lnk--> khruang sai, consists primarily of <!--del_lnk--> string instruments, while the <!--del_lnk--> mahori mixes strings with melodic percussion instruments and flute.<p><a id="Fundamentals" name="Fundamentals"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Fundamentals</span></h4>
      <p>&quot;Thai music is nonharmonic, melodic, or linear, and as is the case with all musics of this genre, its fundamental organization is <i>horizontal</i>...Thai music in its horizontal complex is made up of a main melody played simultaneously with variants of it which progress in relatively slower and faster rhythmic units.&quot; (ibid, p.21) This is known as <!--del_lnk--> heterophony or polyphonic stratification: instrumentalists improvise <!--del_lnk--> idiomatically around the central melody. <!--del_lnk--> Rhythmically and <!--del_lnk--> metrically Thai music is steady in tempo, regular in pulse, <!--del_lnk--> divisive, in <!--del_lnk--> simple duple meter, without <!--del_lnk--> swing, with little <!--del_lnk--> syncopation (p.3, 39), and with the emphasis on the final beat of a <!--del_lnk--> measure or group of <!--del_lnk--> pulses and <!--del_lnk--> phrase (p.41), as opposed to the first as in European-influenced music. The Thai scale includes seven equal notes, instead of a mixture of tones and semitones.<p><a id="Traditional_or_folk" name="Traditional_or_folk"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Traditional or folk</span></h3>

      <p><i>Luk thung</i>, or Thai country music, developed in the mid-<a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a> to reflect daily trials and tribulations of rural Thais. <!--del_lnk--> Ponsri Woranut and <!--del_lnk--> Suraphol Sombatcharoen were the genre&#39;s first big stars, incorporating influences from <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a> and, especially, American film <!--del_lnk--> soundtracks and <!--del_lnk--> country music. Many of the most popular artists have come from the central city of <!--del_lnk--> Suphanburi, including megastar <!--del_lnk--> Pumpuang Duangjan, who pioneered <!--del_lnk--> electronic luk thung. The first all <i>luk thung</i> radio station was launched in <!--del_lnk--> 1997.<p><a id="Mor_lam" name="Mor_lam"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Mor lam</span></h4>

      <p>Mor lam is the dominant folk music of Thailand&#39;s north-eastern <a href="../../wp/i/Isan.htm" title="Isan">Isan</a> region, which has a mainly Lao population. It has much in common with <i>luk thung</i>, such as its focus on the life of the rural poor. It is characterized by rapid-fire, rhythmic vocals and a <!--del_lnk--> funk feel to the percussion. The lead singer, also called a mor lam, is most often accompanied by the <!--del_lnk--> khaen.<p>There are about fifteen regional variations of <i>mor lam</i>, plus modern versions such as <!--del_lnk--> mor lam sing. Some conservatives have criticized these as the commercialization of traditional cultures.<p><a id="Kantrum" name="Kantrum"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Kantrum</span></h4>
      <p>The people of Isan are also known for <!--del_lnk--> kantrum, which is much less famous for mor lam. Kantrum is played by <a href="../../wp/c/Cambodia.htm" title="Cambodia">Cambodians</a> living near the border with Cambodia. It is a swift and very traditional <!--del_lnk--> dance music. In its purest form, <!--del_lnk--> cho-kantrum, singers, percussion and fiddles dominate the sound. A more modern form using electric instrumentation arose in the mid-<!--del_lnk--> 1980s. Later in the decade, <!--del_lnk--> Darkie became the genre&#39;s biggest star, and he crossed into mainstream markets in the later <!--del_lnk--> 1990s.<p><a id="Pop_and_rock" name="Pop_and_rock"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Pop and rock</span></h3>

      <p>By the <!--del_lnk--> 1930s, however, Western <!--del_lnk--> classical music, <!--del_lnk--> showtunes, <a href="../../wp/j/Jazz.htm" title="Jazz">jazz</a> and <!--del_lnk--> tango were popular. Soon, jazz grew to dominate Thai popular music, and <!--del_lnk--> Khru Eua Sunthornsanan soon set up the first Thai jazz band. The music he soon helped to invent along with influential band <!--del_lnk--> Suntharaporn was called <!--del_lnk--> pleng Thai sakorn, which incorporated Thai melodies with Western classical music. This music continued to evolve into <!--del_lnk--> luk grung, a romantic music that was popular with the upper-class. <!--del_lnk--> King Bhumibol is an accomplished jazz musician and <!--del_lnk--> composer.<p><a id="Pleng_phua_cheewit" name="Pleng_phua_cheewit"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Pleng phua cheewit</span></h4>
      <p>By the <!--del_lnk--> 1960s, Western rock was popular and Thai artists began imitating bands like <!--del_lnk--> Cliff Richard &amp; the Shadows; this music was called <!--del_lnk--> wong shadow, and it soon evolved into a form of Thai pop called <!--del_lnk--> string. The following decade saw <!--del_lnk--> Rewat Buddhinan beginning to use the <!--del_lnk--> Thai language in rock music. The 70s also saw the rise of protest songs called <!--del_lnk--> pleng phua cheewit (<i>songs for life</i>).<p>The earliest pleng phua cheewit band was called <!--del_lnk--> Caravan, and they soon emerged at the forefront of a movement for democracy. In <!--del_lnk--> 1976, police and rightwing activists attacked students at <!--del_lnk--> Thammasat University; Caravan, along with other bands and activists, fled for the rural hills. There, Caravan continued playing music for local farmers, and composed what is now their most famous song, &quot;Khon Gap Kwaii&quot;.<p>In the <!--del_lnk--> 1980s, pleng phua cheewit re-entered the mainsteam with a grant of amnesty to dissidents. Bands like <!--del_lnk--> Carabao became best-sellers and incorporated sternly <a href="../../wp/n/Nationalism.htm" title="Nationalism">nationalistic</a> elements in their lyrics. By the <!--del_lnk--> 1990s, pleng phua cheewit had fallen from the top of the Thai charts, though artists like <!--del_lnk--> Pongsit Kamphee continued to command a large audience.<p><a id="String" name="String"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">String</span></h4>

      <p>String pop took over mainstream listeners in Thailand in the 90s, and <!--del_lnk--> bubblegum pop stars like <!--del_lnk--> Tata Young, <!--del_lnk--> Bird McIntyre and <!--del_lnk--> Asanee-Wasan became best-sellers. Simultaneously, <!--del_lnk--> Britpop influenced <a href="../../wp/a/Alternative_rock.htm" title="Alternative rock">alternative rock</a> artists like <!--del_lnk--> Modern Dog, <!--del_lnk--> Loso, <!--del_lnk--> Crub and <!--del_lnk--> Proud became popular in late 1990s.
