      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> classical mechanics, <b>momentum</b> (<!--del_lnk--> pl. momenta; <!--del_lnk--> SI unit <!--del_lnk--> kg <!--del_lnk--> m/s) is the product of the <!--del_lnk--> mass and <!--del_lnk--> velocity of an object. For more accurate measures of momentum, see the section <!--del_lnk--> &quot;modern definitions of momentum&quot; on this page.<p>In general, the momentum of an object can be conceptually thought of as how difficult it is to stop the object, as determined by multiplying two factors: its <!--del_lnk--> inertia (the resistance of an <!--del_lnk--> object to being accelerated) and its velocity. As such, it is a natural consequence of <!--del_lnk--> Newton&#39;s first and second laws of motion. Having a lower speed or having less mass (how we measure inertia) results in having less momentum.<p>Momentum is a <!--del_lnk--> conserved quantity, meaning that the total momentum of any <!--del_lnk--> closed system (one not affected by external forces, and whose internal forces are not dissipative in nature) cannot be changed.<p>The concept of momentum in classical mechanics was originated by a number of great thinkers and experimentalists. <a href="../../wp/r/Ren%25C3%25A9_Descartes.htm" title="Ren&eacute; Descartes">Ren&eacute; Descartes</a> referred to <i>mass times velocity</i> as the <i>fundamental force of motion</i>. <!--del_lnk--> Galileo in his <!--del_lnk--> Two New Sciences used the term &quot;impeto&quot; (Italian), while <!--del_lnk--> Newton&#39;s Laws of Motion uses <i>motus</i> (Latin), which has been interpreted by subsequent scholars to mean momentum.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p>If an object is moving in any <!--del_lnk--> reference frame, then it has momentum in that frame. It is important to note that momentum is <!--del_lnk--> frame dependent. That is, the same object may have a certain momentum in one frame of reference, but a different amount in another frame.<p>The amount of momentum that an object has depends on two physical quantities: the <!--del_lnk--> mass and the <!--del_lnk--> velocity of the moving object in the <!--del_lnk--> frame of reference. In physics, the symbol for momentum is usually denoted by a small bold <i>p</i> (bold because it is a <!--del_lnk--> vector); so this can be written:<dl>
       <dd><img alt="\mathbf{p}= m \mathbf{v}" class="tex" src="../../images/278/27823.png" /></dl>
      <p>where:<dl>
       <dd><b>p</b> is the momentum<dd><i>m</i> is the mass<dd><b>v</b> the velocity</dl>
      <p>(using bold text for vectors).<p>The origin of the use of <b>p</b> for momentum is unclear. It has been suggested that, since <i>m</i> had already been used for &quot;mass&quot;, the <b>p</b> may be derived from the Latin petere (&quot;to go&quot;) or from &quot;progress&quot; (a term used by <a href="../../wp/g/Gottfried_Leibniz.htm" title="Leibniz">Leibniz</a>).<p>The velocity of an object at a particular instant is given by its speed and the direction of its motion at that instant. Because momentum depends on and includes the physical quantity of velocity, it too has a <!--del_lnk--> magnitude and a direction and is a <!--del_lnk--> vector quantity. For example the momentum of a 5-kg bowling ball would have to be described by the statement that it was moving westward at 2 m/s. It is insufficient to say that the ball has 10 kg m/s of momentum because momentum is not fully described unless its direction is given.<p><a id="Momentum_for_a_system" name="Momentum_for_a_system"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Momentum for a system</span></h2>

      <p>In the case of constant mass, and velocities much less than the speed of light, this definition results in the equation <img alt="\mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a}" class="tex" src="../../images/278/27828.png" />, commonly known as Newton&#39;s second law.<p>If a system is in equilibrium, then the change in momentum with respect to time is equal to 0:<dl>

      <p><a id="Conservation_of_momentum" name="Conservation_of_momentum"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Conservation of momentum</span></h2>
      <p>The principle of <b>conservation of momentum</b> states that the total momentum of a closed system of objects (which has no interactions with external agents) is constant. One of the consequences of this is that the <!--del_lnk--> centre of mass of any <!--del_lnk--> system of <!--del_lnk--> objects will always continue with the same velocity unless acted on by a force outside the system.<p>Conservation of momentum is a consequence of the <!--del_lnk--> homogeneity (shift <a href="../../wp/s/Symmetry.htm" title="Symmetry">symmetry</a>) of space.<p>In an isolated system (one where external forces are absent) the total momentum will be constant: this is implied by Newton&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> first law of motion. Newton&#39;s third law of motion, the <!--del_lnk--> law of reciprocal actions, which dictates that the forces acting between systems are equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign, is due to the conservation of momentum.<p>Since momentum is a vector quantity it has direction. Thus, when a gun is fired, although overall movement has increased compared to before the shot was fired, the momentum of the bullet in one direction is equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign, to the momentum of the gun in the other direction. These then sum to zero which is equal to the zero momentum that was present before either the gun or the bullet was moving.<p><a id="Conservation_of_momentum_and_collisions" name="Conservation_of_momentum_and_collisions"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Conservation of momentum and collisions</span></h3>
      <p>Momentum has the special property that, in a <!--del_lnk--> closed system, it is always conserved, even in <!--del_lnk--> collisions. <!--del_lnk--> Kinetic energy, on the other hand, is not conserved in collisions if they are inelastic. Since momentum is conserved it can be used to calculate unknown velocities following a collision.<p>A common problem in physics that requires the use of this fact is the collision of two particles. Since momentum is always conserved, the sum of the momenta before the collision must equal the sum of the momenta after the collision:<dl>
       <dd><img alt="m_1 \mathbf u_{1} + m_2 \mathbf u_{2} = m_1 \mathbf v_{1} + m_2 \mathbf v_{2} \," class="tex" src="../../images/503/50326.png" /></dl>
      <p>where:<dl>
       <dd><b>u</b> signifies vector velocity before the collision<dd><b>v</b> signifies vector velocity after the collision.</dl>
      <p>Usually, we either only know the velocities before or after a collision and would like to also find out the opposite. Correctly solving this problem means you have to know what kind of collision took place. There are two basic kinds of collisions, both of which conserve momentum:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Elastic collisions conserve kinetic energy as well as total momentum before and after collision.<li><!--del_lnk--> Inelastic collisions don&#39;t conserve kinetic energy, but total momentum before and after collision is conserved.</ul>
      <p><a id="Elastic_collisions" name="Elastic_collisions"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Elastic collisions</span></h4>
      <p>A collision between two <!--del_lnk--> pool or <!--del_lnk--> snooker balls is a good example of an almost totally elastic collision. In addition to momentum being conserved when the two balls collide, the sum of kinetic energy before a collision must equal the sum of kinetic energy after:<dl>
       <dd>
        <dl>
         <dd><img alt="\begin{matrix}\frac{1}{2}\end{matrix} m_1 v_{1,i}^2  + \begin{matrix}\frac{1}{2}\end{matrix} m_2 v_{2,i}^2  = \begin{matrix}\frac{1}{2}\end{matrix} m_1 v_{1,f}^2  + \begin{matrix}\frac{1}{2}\end{matrix} m_2 v_{2,f}^2 \," class="tex" src="../../images/503/50327.png" /></dl>
      </dl>
      <p>Since the 1/2 factor is common to all the terms, it can be taken out right away.<p><a id="Head-on_collision_.281_dimensional.29" name="Head-on_collision_.281_dimensional.29"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">Head-on collision (1 dimensional)</span></h5>

         <dd><img alt="v_{1,f} = \left( \frac{m_1 - m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right) v_{1,i} + \left( \frac{2 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right) v_{2,i} \," class="tex" src="../../images/503/50328.png" /></dl>

      </dl>
      <p>which can then easily be rearranged to<dl>

      </dl>
      <p>Now consider if mass of one body say m1 is far more than m2 (m1&gt;&gt;m2). In that case m1+m2 is approximately equal to m1. And m1-m2 is approximately equal to m1.<p>Put these values in the above equation to calculate the value of v2 after collsion. The expression changes to v2 final is 2*v1-v2. Its physical interpretation is in case of collison between two body one of which is very heavy, the lighter body moves with twice the velocity of the heavier body less its actual velocity but in opposite direction.<p><a id="Multi-dimensional_collisions" name="Multi-dimensional_collisions"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">Multi-dimensional collisions</span></h5>
      <p>In the case of objects colliding in more than one dimension, as in oblique collisions, the velocity is resolved into orthogonal components with one component perpendicular to the plane of collision and the other component or components in the plane of collision. The velocity components in the plane of collision remain unchanged, while the velocity perpendicular to the plane of collision is calculated in the same way as the one-dimensional case.<p>For example, in a two-dimensional collision, the momenta can be resolved into <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> components. We can then calculate each component separately, and combine them to produce a vector result. The magnitude of this vector is the final momentum of the isolated system.<p>See the <!--del_lnk--> elastic collision page for more details.<p><a id="Inelastic_collisions" name="Inelastic_collisions"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Inelastic collisions</span></h4>
      <p>A common example of a perfectly inelastic collision is when two snowballs collide and then <i>stick</i> together afterwards. This equation describes the conservation of momentum:<dl>
       <dd>
        <dl>
         <dd><img alt="m_1 \mathbf v_{1,i} + m_2 \mathbf v_{2,i} = \left( m_1 + m_2 \right) \mathbf v_f \," class="tex" src="../../images/503/50331.png" /></dl>
      </dl>
      <p>It can be shown that a perfectly inelastic collision is one in which the maximum amount of <!--del_lnk--> kinetic energy is converted into other forms. For instance, if both objects stick together after the collision and move with a final common velocity, one can always find a reference frame in which the objects are brought to rest by the collision and 100% of the kinetic energy is converted. This is true even in the relativistic case and utilized in <!--del_lnk--> particle accelerators to efficiently convert kinetic energy into new forms of <!--del_lnk--> mass-energy (i.e. to create massive particles).<p>See the <!--del_lnk--> inelastic collision page for more details.<p><a id="Modern_definitions_of_momentum" name="Modern_definitions_of_momentum"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Modern definitions of momentum</span></h2>

This leads to applications such as the <!--del_lnk--> solar sail.<p>Momentum is conserved in an electrodynamic system (it may change from momentum in the fields to mechanical momentum of moving parts).

This is a tensor field which has components related to the energy density and the momentum density.<p>The definition canonical momentum corresponding to the momentum operator of quantum mechanics when it interacts with the electromagnetic field is, using the <!--del_lnk--> principle of least coupling:<dl>
