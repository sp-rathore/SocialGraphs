      <p>A large number of ethnicities have inhabited Mongolia since prehistoric times. Most of these people were nomads who, from time to time, formed great confederations that rose to prominence. The first of these, the <!--del_lnk--> Xiongnu, were brought together to form a confederation by <!--del_lnk--> Modu Shanyu in 209 BC. They defeated the <!--del_lnk--> Donghu, who had previously been the dominant power in eastern Mongolia. The <!--del_lnk--> Xiongnu became the greatest enemy of <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> for the following three centuries; the <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Wall_of_China.htm" title="Great Wall of China">Great Wall of China</a> was built partly as defence against the <!--del_lnk--> Xiongnu. Marshal <!--del_lnk--> Meng Tian of the <!--del_lnk--> Qin Empire dispersed more than 300,000 soldiers along the <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Wall_of_China.htm" title="Great Wall">Great Wall</a> to prevent an expected invasion from the North. It is believed that after their decisive defeat by the Chinese in 428-431, some of the <!--del_lnk--> Xiongnu migrated West to become the <!--del_lnk--> Huns. After the <!--del_lnk--> Xiongnu migrated west, <!--del_lnk--> Rouran, a close relative of the <!--del_lnk--> Mongols, came to power before being defeated by the <!--del_lnk--> Gokturks, who then dominated Mongolia for centuries.<p><a id="Early_history" name="Early_history"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early history</span></h3>

By the <a href="../../wp/1/10th_century.htm" title="10th century">tenth century</a>, the country was populated predominantly by <!--del_lnk--> Mongols believed to be a branch of the <!--del_lnk--> Xianbei.

      <p>In the late <a href="../../wp/1/12th_century.htm" title="12th century">twelfth century</a>, a chieftain named Temujin united the Mongol tribes to the <!--del_lnk--> Naiman and <!--del_lnk--> Jurchen after a long struggle and took the name of <a href="../../wp/g/Genghis_Khan.htm" title="Genghis Khan">Genghis Khan</a>. Starting in 1206, Genghis Khan and his successors consolidated and expanded the <a href="../../wp/m/Mongol_Empire.htm" title="Mongol Empire">Mongol Empire</a> into the largest contiguous land <!--del_lnk--> empire in world history, going as far northwest as <!--del_lnk--> Kievan Rus. After Genghis Khan&#39;s death, the empire was divided into four kingdoms, or &quot;Khanates.&quot; One of these, the &quot;Great Khanate,&quot; comprised the Mongol homeland and <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, and its emperors were known as the <!--del_lnk--> Yuan Dynasty. Its founder, <!--del_lnk--> Kublai Khan, set up his centre of administration in present day <a href="../../wp/b/Beijing.htm" title="Beijing">Beijing</a>. After more than a century of power, the <!--del_lnk--> Yuan Dynasty was replaced by the <a href="../../wp/m/Ming_Dynasty.htm" title="Ming Dynasty">Ming Dynasty</a> in 1368, and the Mongol court fled north. The Ming armies pursued and defeated them in Mongolia, but did not conquer Mongolia.<p>During the next few centuries, Mongolia was split between the <!--del_lnk--> Oirad in the west and the <!--del_lnk--> Khalkha in the east. <!--del_lnk--> Altan Khan united the Mongols briefly in 1571. After failing to defeat the Chinese, he made peace with the <a href="../../wp/m/Ming_Dynasty.htm" title="Ming Dynasty">Ming Dynasty</a> and instead focused on <a href="../../wp/t/Tibet.htm" title="Tibet">Tibet</a>, eventually becoming a convert to <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan Buddhism.<p>During the <a href="../../wp/1/17th_century.htm" title="17th century">seventeenth century</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Manchus rose to prominence in the east, they conquered <!--del_lnk--> Inner Mongolia in 1636. <!--del_lnk--> Outer Mongolia submitted in 1691. For the next two hundred years Mongolia was ruled by the <a href="../../wp/q/Qing_Dynasty.htm" title="Qing Dynasty">Qing Dynasty</a>. During this time, the Manchus maintained their control over Mongolia with a series of alliances and intermarriages, as well as military and economic control. Several Emperors of the <a href="../../wp/q/Qing_Dynasty.htm" title="Qing Dynasty">Qing Dynasty</a> were born to Mongol mothers.<p>With the fall of the Qing Dynasty, Mongolia declared independence in 1911. The new country&#39;s territory was approximately that of the former Outer Mongolia. After the <!--del_lnk--> October Revolution in Russia, Chinese troops led by <!--del_lnk--> Xu Shuzheng occupied the capital in 1919. The Chinese rule did not last: notorious Russian adventurer &quot;bloody&quot; <!--del_lnk--> Baron Ungern who had fought with the &quot;Whites&quot; (Ataman Semyonov) against the Red army in Siberia, led his troops into Mongolia and forced a showdown with the Chinese in Ulaanbaatar. Ungern&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> cossacks triumphed, and he briefly in effect ruled Mongolia under the blessing of religious leader <!--del_lnk--> Bogd Khan. But Ungern&#39;s triumph was shortlived; he was chased out by the Red Army, which, while at it, liberated Mongolia from feudalism and insured its political alignment with the Russian Bolsheviks. In 1924, after the death of the religious leader <!--del_lnk--> Bogd Khan, the <!--del_lnk--> Mongolian People&#39;s Republic was proclaimed and was backed by the Soviets.<p><a id="Alignment_with_the_Soviet_Union" name="Alignment_with_the_Soviet_Union"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Alignment with the Soviet Union</span></h3>

      <p>The Mongolian People&#39;s Republic was aligned closely with the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>. Politicians who demanded a more capitalist course and who dissented against collective property, like Dogsomyn Bodoo or Horloogiyn Dandzan, quickly became unpopular. In 1928, <!--del_lnk--> Horloogiyn Choybalsan rose to power. Under his administration, forced <!--del_lnk--> collectivisation of livestock was instituted, and the destruction of <!--del_lnk--> Buddhist <!--del_lnk--> monasteries in 1937 left more than 10,000 lamas dead.<p>During the <!--del_lnk--> Soviet-Japanese Border War of 1939, the USSR defended Mongolia against <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>. Mongolian forces also took part in the Soviet offensive against Japanese forces in Inner Mongolia in August 1945 (see <!--del_lnk--> Operation August Storm). The (soviet) threat of Mongolian forces seizing parts of Inner Mongolia induced the <a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_China.htm" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a> to recognize Outer Mongolia&#39;s independence, provided that a referendum was held. The referendum took place on <!--del_lnk--> October 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1945, with (according to official numbers) 100% of the electorate voting for independence. After the establishment of the <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">People&#39;s Republic of China</a>, both countries re-recognized each other on <!--del_lnk--> October 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1949.<p>After Choybalsan died in <a href="../../wp/m/Moscow.htm" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> on <!--del_lnk--> January 26, <!--del_lnk--> 1952, <!--del_lnk--> Yumjaagiyn Tsedenbal took power. In 1956 and again in 1962, Choybalsan&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> personality cult was condemned. Mongolia continued to align itself closely with the Soviet Union, especially after the <!--del_lnk--> Sino-Soviet split of the late 1950s. While Tsedenbal was visiting Moscow in August 1984, his severe illness prompted the parliament to announce his retirement and replace him with <!--del_lnk--> Jambyn Batmonh.<p><a name="1990_Democratic_Revolution"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1990 Democratic Revolution</span></h3>
      <p>The introduction of <!--del_lnk--> perestroika and <!--del_lnk--> glasnost in the USSR by <a href="../../wp/m/Mikhail_Gorbachev.htm" title="Mikhail Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a> strongly influenced Mongolian politics even though Mongolia was a sovereign nation. The collapse of communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, combined with these two policies, were enough to lead to a peaceful democratic revolution in Mongolia in 1990. This, in turn, allowed Mongolia to begin engaging in economic and diplomatic relations with the Western world. The nation finished its transition from a communist state to a multi-party free-market democracy with the ratification of a new <!--del_lnk--> constitution in 1992.<p><a id="Government_and_politics" name="Government_and_politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Government and politics</span></h2>
      <p>Until <!--del_lnk--> June 27, <!--del_lnk--> 2004, the predominant party in Mongolia was the ex-communist <!--del_lnk--> Mongolian People&#39;s Revolutionary Party, or MPRP. The main opposition party was the <!--del_lnk--> Democratic Party or DP, which controlled a governing coalition from 1996 to 2000.<p>From 2000 to 2004, the MPRP was back in power, but results of the 2004 elections required the establishing of the first ever coalition government in Mongolia between the MPRP and MDC (Motherland Democratic Coalition). The coalition broke down in January 2006, the current government has been formed with the MPRP, some small parties and some DP defectors.<p><a id="President" name="President"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">President</span></h3>

      <p>Mongolia&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> president has a symbolic role. Mongolia&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Constitution provides three requirements for taking office as <!--del_lnk--> President: the individual must be a native-born Mongolian, who is at least 45 years of age, and who has resided in Mongolia for five years prior to taking office.

The legislative arm, the <!--del_lnk--> State Great Hural, has one chamber with 76 seats and is chaired by the speaker of the house.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> January 14, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, the parliament&#39;s thirty-nine members, mostly MPRP but including four Democratic Party members (<!--del_lnk--> Mendsaikhan Enkhsaikhan, <!--del_lnk--> Narantsatsralt, <!--del_lnk--> Mishig Sonompil, and <!--del_lnk--> J. Batkhuyag), overthrew Democrat <!--del_lnk--> Tsakhiagiyn Elbegdorj&#39;s grand coalition government. It has been claimed that this violated the <!--del_lnk--> Constitution, as the parliament exceeded its power. The decision to overthrow Elbegdorj&#39;s government was based on the MPRP Directing Board&#39;s decision, contrary to its three agreements with the Democratic Party. The action has been protested.

      <p>At 604,209&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mi&sup2; (1,565,000&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km&sup2;<!--del_lnk--> ), Mongolia is the world&#39;s nineteenth-largest country (after <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a>). It is significantly larger than the next-largest country, <a href="../../wp/p/Peru.htm" title="Peru">Peru</a>, and is nearly as large as the US state of <!--del_lnk--> Alaska.<p>The Mongolian heartland consists of relatively flat <!--del_lnk--> steppes. The southern portion of the country is taken up by the <!--del_lnk--> Gobi Desert, while the northern and western portions are mountainous. The highest point in Mongolia is Nayramadlin Orgil (Huyten Orgil) at 4,374&nbsp;m (14,350 <!--del_lnk--> feet). <!--del_lnk--> Uvs Nuur Lake, shared with <!--del_lnk--> Tuva Republic in <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>, is a natural <a href="../../wp/w/World_Heritage_Site.htm" title="World Heritage Site">World Heritage Site</a>.<p>Most of the country is hot in the summer and extremely cold in the winter, with January averages dropping as low as -30&ordm;C (-22&ordm;F). The country is also subject to occasional harsh climatic conditions known as <i><!--del_lnk--> zud</i> or <i>dzud</i>. Ulaanbaatar has the coldest average temperature of any national capital in the world.<p>Mongolia is high, cold, and windy. It has an extreme continental climate with long, cold winters and short summers, during which most of its annual precipitation falls. The country averages 257 cloudless days a year, and it is usually at the centre of a region of high atmospheric pressure. Precipitation is highest in the north (average of 20 to 35 centimeters per year) and lowest in the south, which receives 10 to 20 centimeters annually. The extreme south is the Gobi, some regions of which receive no precipitation at all in most years. The name &quot;Gobi&quot; is a Mongol term for a desert, depression, salt marsh, or steppe, but which usually refers to a category of arid rangeland with insufficient vegetation to support <!--del_lnk--> marmots but with enough to support camels. Mongols distinguish Gobi from desert proper, although the distinction is not always apparent to outsiders unfamiliar with the Mongolian landscape. Gobi rangelands are fragile and are easily destroyed by overgrazing, which results in expansion of the true desert, a stony waste where not even <!--del_lnk--> Bactrian camels can survive.<p><a id="Administrative_divisions" name="Administrative_divisions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Administrative divisions</span></h2>

The majority of the population outside urban areas participate in subsistence herding; livestock typically consists of sheep, goats, cattle, horses, and Bactrian camels. Agricultural crops include wheat, barley, vegetables, and other forage crops.<p>GDP per capita in 2005 was $1,900 <!--del_lnk--> . Although GDP has risen steadily since 2002 at the rate of 6.2% in an official 2005 estimate, the state is still working to overcome a sizable trade deficit. A massive ($11 billion) foreign debt to Russia was settled by the Mongolian government in 2004 with a $250 million payment; this reduced value was accepted due to Despite growth, the proportion of the population below the poverty line is estimated to be 36.1% in 2004, and both the unemployment rate and inflation rate are high at 6.7% and 10.9%, respectively <!--del_lnk--> .<p><a id="Industrial_sector" name="Industrial_sector"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Industrial sector</span></h3>
      <p>Industry currently accounts for 21.4% of GDP, approximately equal to the weight of the agriculture sector (20.4%). These industries include construction and construction materials, mining (coal, copper, molybdenum, fluorspar, tin, tungsten, and gold), oil, food and beverages, processing of animal products, and cashmere and natural fibre manufacturing. The industrial production growth rate is estimated to be 4.1% in 2002.
