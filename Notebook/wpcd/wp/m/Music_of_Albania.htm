      <p><a href="../../wp/a/Albania.htm" title="Albania">Albania</a> is a <!--del_lnk--> Southeast European nation that was ruled by <!--del_lnk--> Enver Hoxha&#39;s <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">communist</a> government for much of the later part of the <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a>; it is now a democratic country. Even before Hoxha&#39;s reign began, Albania was long controlled by the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> and other conquering powers, leading to a diversity of influences that is common in the much-fragmented Balkan region and resulting in a diverse and unique musical sound. Albanians (and the ethnic-Albanian <a href="../../wp/k/Kosovo.htm" title="Kosovo">Kosovars</a> of nearby <a href="../../wp/s/Serbia.htm" title="Serbia">Serbia</a>) are commonly divided into three groupings: the northern <!--del_lnk--> Ghegs and southern <!--del_lnk--> Labs and <!--del_lnk--> Tosks. <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkish</a> influence is strongest around the capital city, <!--del_lnk--> Tirana, while <!--del_lnk--> Shkod&euml;r has been long considered the centre for musical development in Albania.<p>Music has always been a potent means of national expression for Albanians. Under Hoxha&#39;s regime, this was channeled into songs of <!--del_lnk--> patriotic devotion to the party; since the arrival of <a href="../../wp/d/Democracy.htm" title="Democracy">democracy</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1991, lyrics have come to focus on long-suppressed traditions like <i><!--del_lnk--> gurbet</i> (seeking work outside of Albania) and support for various <!--del_lnk--> political parties, candidates and ideas. Pop musicians have developed too, long banned under the socialists, with <!--del_lnk--> Ardit Gjebrea being foremost among them. <!--del_lnk--> Albanian popular music (<i>k&euml;ng&euml; popullore</i>) is generally based on Italian models.<p>Folk music was encouraged to some degree under the socialist government, which promoted a quinquennial music festival at <!--del_lnk--> Gjirokast&euml;r provided that the musicians expressed frequent support for the party leaders. After the fall of socialism, <!--del_lnk--> Albanian Radio-Television launched a <!--del_lnk--> 1995 festival in <!--del_lnk--> Berat that has helped to continue musical traditions.<p>

      <p>Albania&#39;s political, military and cultural domination by outside elements has contributed to the country&#39;s modern music scene. Albanian music is a fusion of the musics of Southeastern Europe, especially that of the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, which ruled Albania for more than 500 years. However, the Albanian people kept themselves culturally apart from the Ottomans, with many living in rural and remote mountains.<p><a id="Folk_music" name="Folk_music"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Folk music</span></h2>
      <p>Albanian folk music falls into three sylistic groups, with other important <!--del_lnk--> music areas around <!--del_lnk--> Shkoder and <!--del_lnk--> Tirana; the major groupings are the <!--del_lnk--> Ghegs of the north and southern <!--del_lnk--> Labs and <!--del_lnk--> Tosks. The northern and southern traditions are contrasted by the &quot;rugged and heroic&quot; tone of the north and the &quot;relaxed, gentle and exceptionally beautiful&quot; form of the south. These disparate styles are unified by &quot;the intensity that both performers and listeners give to their music as a medium for patriotic expression and as a vehicle carrying the narrative of <!--del_lnk--> oral history&quot;, as well as certain characteristics like the use of obscure rhythms such as 3/8, 5/8 and 10/8.<p>Albanian folk songs can be divided into major groups, the heroic epics of the north, and the sweetly melodic <!--del_lnk--> lullabies, love songs, <!--del_lnk--> wedding music, <!--del_lnk--> work songs and other kinds of song. The music of various festivals and holidays is also an important part of Albanian folk song, especially those that celebrate <!--del_lnk--> St. Lazarus Day (<i>the llazore</i>), which inauguarates the springtime. Lullabies and <!--del_lnk--> laments are very important kinds of Albanian folk song, and are generally performed by solo women.<p><a id="Halay" name="Halay"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Halay</span></h3>
      <p>Halay is a famous dance in the Middle East. It is a symbol for the tempestuous way of life in its place of origin, Anatolia. It is a national dance in Armenia and Turkey. The traditional form of the Halay dance is played on the <!--del_lnk--> Zurna, supported by a <!--del_lnk--> Davul. The dancers form a circle or line, while holding each other with the little finger. From Anatolia the Halay has spread to many other Regions, like Armenia or the Balkans.<p><a id="Northern_Albania" name="Northern_Albania"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Northern Albania</span></h3>
      <p>The Ghegs from north of the <!--del_lnk--> Shkumbini River are known for a distinctive variety of sung epic poetry. Many of these are about <!--del_lnk--> Skanderbeg, a legendary <a href="../../wp/1/15th_century.htm" title="15th century">15th century</a> warrior who led the struggle against the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Turks</a>, and the &quot;constant Albanian themes of honour, hospitality, treachery and revenge&quot;. These traditions are a form of oral history for the Ghegs, and also &quot;preserve and inculcate moral codes and social values&quot;, necessary in a society that, until the early 20th century, relied on blood feuds as its &quot;primary means of law enforcement&quot;. Styles of epics include <i>k&euml;ng&euml; trimash</i> (<i>songs of bravery</i>), <i>k&euml;ng&euml; kreshnik&euml;sh</i>, <!--del_lnk--> ballads and <i>maje krahi</i> (<i>cries</i>). Major epics include <i><!--del_lnk--> Mujo and Halil</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Halil and Hajrije</i>.<p>The most traditional variety of epic poetry is called <i><!--del_lnk--> Rapsodi Kreshnike</i> (<i>Poems of Heroes</i>). These epic poems are sung, accompanied by a <i><!--del_lnk--> lahuta</i>, a one-stringed <!--del_lnk--> fiddle. It is rarely performed in modern Albania, but is found in the northern highlands.<p>Somewhat further south, around <!--del_lnk--> Dib&euml;r and <!--del_lnk--> K&euml;r&ccedil;ov&euml; in <!--del_lnk--> Macedonia, the lahuta is not used, replaced by the <!--del_lnk--> &ccedil;ifteli, a two-stringed instrument in which one string is used for the <!--del_lnk--> drone and one for the <!--del_lnk--> melody. Though men are the traditional performers, except for the <!--del_lnk--> Vajze t&euml; betuar, women have increasingly been taking part in epic balladry.<p>Along with the <!--del_lnk--> def, &ccedil;ifteli and sharki are used in a style of dance and pastoral songs. Homemade <!--del_lnk--> wind instruments are traditionally used by <!--del_lnk--> shepherds in northern Albania; these include the <!--del_lnk--> zumar&euml;, an unusual kind of clarinet. This shepherds&#39; music is &quot;melancholic and contemplative&quot; in tone. The songs called <i>maje-krahi</i> are another important part of North Albanian folk song; these were originally used by mountaineers to communicate over wide distances, but are now seen as songs. <i>Maje-krahi</i> songs require the full range of the voice and are full of &quot;melismatic nuances and falsetto cries&quot;.<p><a id="Southern_Albania" name="Southern_Albania"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Southern Albania</span></h3>
      <p>Southern Albanian music is soft and gentle, and polyphonic in nature. <!--del_lnk--> Vlor&euml; in the southwest has perhaps the most unique vocal traditions in the area, with four distinct parts (<i>taker</i>, <i>thrower</i>, <i>turner</i> and <i>drone</i>) that combine to create a complex and emotionally cathartic melody. Author Kim Burton has described the melodies as &quot;decorated with <!--del_lnk--> falsetto and <!--del_lnk--> vibrato, sometimes interrupted by wild and mournful cries&quot;. This polyphonic vocal music is full of power that &quot;stems from the tension between the immense emotional weight it carries, rooted in centuries of pride, poverty and oppression, and the strictly formal, almost ritualistic nature of its structure&quot;.<p>South Albania is also known for <!--del_lnk--> funeral laments with a chorus and one to two soloists with overlapping, mournful voices. There is a prominent folk love song tradition in the south, in which performers use free rhythm and consonant harmonies, elaborated with <!--del_lnk--> ornamentation and <!--del_lnk--> melisma.<p>The Tosk people are known for ensembles consisting of <!--del_lnk--> violins, <a href="../../wp/c/Clarinet.htm" title="Clarinet">clarinets</a>, <!--del_lnk--> llaut&euml; (a kind of <!--del_lnk--> lute) and <!--del_lnk--> def. <!--del_lnk--> Eli Fara, a popular &eacute;migr&eacute; performer, is from <!--del_lnk--> Kor&ccedil;&euml;, but the city of <!--del_lnk--> P&euml;rmet is the centre for southern musical innovation, producing artists like <!--del_lnk--> Remzi Lela and <!--del_lnk--> Laver Bariu. Lela is of special note, having founded a musical dynasty that continues with his descendents playing a part in most of the major music institutions in Tirana.<p>Southern instrumental music includes the sedate <!--del_lnk--> kaba, an ensemble-driven form driven by a clarinet or violin alongside accordions and llaut&euml;s. The kaba is an improvised and melancholic style with melodies that Kim Burton describes as &quot;both fresh and ancient&quot;, &quot;ornamented with swoops, glides and growls of an almost vocal quality&quot;, exemplifying the &quot;combination of passion with restraint that is the hallmark of Albanian culture.&quot;<p>The ethnic <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greek</a> inhabitants of <!--del_lnk--> Dropulli, whose music is very similar to the <!--del_lnk--> music of Epirus in Greece. These Greek-Albanians have a rougher and more aggressive sound than other forms of Albanian music, and lack the polyphonic complexity, but otherwise the same scales and rhythmic patterns as the rest of the country.<p><a id="Popular_music" name="Popular_music"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Popular music</span></h2>
      <p>The city of Shkod&euml;r has long been the cultural capital of Albania, and its music is considered the most sophisticated in the country. <!--del_lnk--> Bosnian <!--del_lnk--> sevdalinka is an important influence on music from the area, which is complex, with shifts through major and minor scales with an Turkish sound and a romantic and sophisticated tone. Traditional musicians from Shkod&euml;r include <!--del_lnk--> Bujar Qamili, <!--del_lnk--> Lu&ccedil;ija Miloti, <!--del_lnk--> Xhevdet Hafizi and <!--del_lnk--> Bik Ndoja.<p>Albania&#39;s capital, Tirana, is the home of popular music dominated by <!--del_lnk--> Romani influences and has been popularized at home and in emigrant communities internationally by <!--del_lnk--> Merita Halili, <!--del_lnk--> Parashqevi Simaku and <!--del_lnk--> Myslim Leli. In recent times, influences from <!--del_lnk--> Western Europe and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> have led to the creation of bands that play <!--del_lnk--> rock, <!--del_lnk--> pop and <a href="../../wp/h/Hip_hop_music.htm" title="Hip hop music">hip hop</a> among many other genres.<p>The most successful Albanian pop artistes are <!--del_lnk--> Giovanni and Sebastian. They have had over twenty number one singles in their homeland. Whilst success outside of this country has been limited, Giovanni has enjoyed success with such artists as Barbara Streisand and Robin Gibb. Sebastian has produced a number of films, the most famous of which is the Albanian spoken remake of The Towering Inferno.<p><a name="1930s_art_song"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1930s art song</span></h3>
      <p>The urban art songs of 1930s Albania can be traced back to the 19th century folk music of Albanian cities. These songs are a major part of Albania&#39;s music heritage, but have been little-studied by <!--del_lnk--> ethnomusicologists, who prefer to focus on the rural folk music that they see as being more authentically Albanian. Urban art songs are strongly influenced by the music of the Ottoman authorities who controlled Albania for a very long time, introducing elements of <!--del_lnk--> Turkish music, especially the Ottoman modal scales, to local folk styles. The northern part of Albania took more readily to Turkish music because both traditions use monophony, while the south of Albania has long been based on polyphony and a Greek modal system.<p>Out of this <!--del_lnk--> melting pot of local and imported styles came a kind of lyrical art song based in the cities of <!--del_lnk--> Shkodra, <!--del_lnk--> Elbasan, <!--del_lnk--> Berat and <!--del_lnk--> Kor&ccedil;a. Though similar traditions existed in other places, they were little recorded and remain largely unknown. By the end of the 19th century, Albanian <a href="../../wp/n/Nationalism.htm" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a> was inspiring many to attempt to remove the elements of Turkish music from Albanian culture, a desire that was intensified following independence in <!--del_lnk--> 1912; bands that formed during this era played a variety of European styles, including <!--del_lnk--> marches and <!--del_lnk--> waltzes. Urban song in the early 20th century could be divided into two styles: the historic or nationalistic style, and the lyrical style. The lyrical style included a wide array of lullabies and other forms, as well as love songs.<p>By the end of the 1930s, urban art song had been incorporated into classical music, while the singer <!--del_lnk--> Marie Kraja made a popular career out of art songs; she was one of Albania&#39;s first popular singers. The first recordings, however, of urban art song came as early as <!--del_lnk--> 1937, with the orchestral sounds of <!--del_lnk--> Tefta Tashko-Ko&ccedil;o.<p><a name="1950s_and_beyond"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1950s and beyond</span></h3>
      <p>Modern Albanian popular music uses instruments like the <!--del_lnk--> &ccedil;ifteli and <!--del_lnk--> sharki, which have been used in large bands since the <!--del_lnk--> Second World War to great popular acclaim; the same songs, accompanied by <a href="../../wp/c/Clarinet.htm" title="Clarinet">clarinet</a> and <!--del_lnk--> accordion, are performed at small weddings and celebrations.<p><a id="Albanian_music_in_Macedonia_and_Kosovo" name="Albanian_music_in_Macedonia_and_Kosovo"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Albanian music in Macedonia and Kosovo</span></h3>
      <p><a href="../../wp/k/Kosovo.htm" title="Kosovo">Kosovo</a> is an UN-Administrated part of <a href="../../wp/s/Serbia.htm" title="Serbia">Serbia</a> with predominantly <!--del_lnk--> Albanian residents. There are also many Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia, especially around <!--del_lnk--> Lake Presp and <!--del_lnk--> Lake Ohrid. Prior to the <!--del_lnk--> Kosovo War, there was a thriving music industry in Kosovo, as well as in Macedonia. The Macedonian band <!--del_lnk--> V&euml;llez&euml;rit Aliu became well- known for the traditional vocal duets accompanied by drum box, electric bass, synthesizer and clarinet or saxophone.<p>The Kosovar music industry was home to many famous musicians, often <!--del_lnk--> Roma, including <!--del_lnk--> Pristina&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Mazllum Shaqiri and the more romantic, more elaborate <!--del_lnk--> Qamil i Vog&euml;l of <!--del_lnk--> Djakovica.<p><a id="Classical_music" name="Classical_music"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Classical music</span></h2>
      <p>One pivotal composer in modern Albanian classical music was <!--del_lnk--> Mart Gjoka, who composed several vocal and instrumental music which uses elements of urban art song and the folk melodies of the northern highlands; Gjoka&#39;s work in the early <!--del_lnk--> 1920s marks the beginning of professional Albanian classical music. Later, the Albanian-American emigres <!--del_lnk--> Fan S. Noli and <!--del_lnk--> Murat Shendu achieved some renown, with Noli using urban folk songs in his <i><!--del_lnk--> Byzantine Overture</i> and is also known for a symphonic poem called <i><!--del_lnk--> Scanderberg</i>. Shehu spent much of his life in prison for his religious beliefs, but managed to compose <!--del_lnk--> melodramas like <i><!--del_lnk--> The Siege of Shkod&euml;r</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Red Scarf</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Rozafa</i>, which helped launch the field of <!--del_lnk--> Albanian opera. Other famous art composers include <!--del_lnk--> Thoma Nassi, <!--del_lnk--> Kristo Kono and <!--del_lnk--> Frano Ndoja. <!--del_lnk--> Preng Jakova became well-known for operas like <i><!--del_lnk--> Scanderbeg</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Mrika</i>, which were influenced by traditional <!--del_lnk--> Italian opera, the <!--del_lnk--> belcanto style and Albanian folk song. Undoubtedly the most famous Albanian composer, however, was <!--del_lnk--> Cesk Zadeja, known as the Father of Albanian classical music; he composed in many styles, from symphonies to ballets, beginning in <!--del_lnk--> 1956, and also helped found the <!--del_lnk--> Music Conservatory of Tirana, the <!--del_lnk--> Theatre of Opera and Ballet, and the <!--del_lnk--> Assembly of Songs and Dances.<p>Later in the 20th century, Albanian composers came to focus on ballets, opera and other styles; these included <!--del_lnk--> Tonin Harapi, <!--del_lnk--> Nikolla Zoraqi, <!--del_lnk--> Thoma Gaqi, <!--del_lnk--> Feim Ibrahimi and <!--del_lnk--> Shpetim Kushta. Since the fall of the Communist regime, new composers like <!--del_lnk--> Aleksander Peii, <!--del_lnk--> Sokol Shupo, <!--del_lnk--> Endri Sina and <!--del_lnk--> Vasil Tole have arisen, as have new music institutions like the <!--del_lnk--> Society of Music Professionals and the <!--del_lnk--> Society of New Albanian Music.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Albania&quot;</div>
