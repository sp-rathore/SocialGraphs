This critique achieved its most systematic (albeit unfinished) expression in his most famous work, <i>Capital: A Critique of Political Economy</i>, more commonly known as <i><a href="../../wp/d/Das_Kapital.htm" title="Das Kapital">Das Kapital</a></i> (1867).<p>Followers of Marx and Engels have drawn on this work to propose a grand, cohesive theoretical outlook dubbed <strong class="selflink">Marxism</strong>. Nevertheless, there have been numerous debates among Marxists over how to interpret Marx&#39;s writings and how to apply his concepts to current events and conditions. The legacy of Marx&#39;s thought is bitterly contested among proponents of numerous viewpoints who claim to be Marx&#39;s most accurate interpreters. There have been many academic theories, social movements, political parties and governments that lay claim to being founded on Marxist principles. Indeed, academic theorising on Marxism is so widespread that there are a number of different schools of Marxism in addition to the classical Marxism of Marx and Engels. Similarly, the use of Marxist theory in politics, including the social democratic movements in 20th century Europe, the Soviet Union and other <!--del_lnk--> Eastern bloc countries, Mao and other revolutionaries in agrarian developing countries have added new ideas to Marx and otherwise transmuted Marxism so much that it is difficult to define its core.<p>

      <p>Classical Marxism refers to the body of theory directly expounded by <a href="../../wp/k/Karl_Marx.htm" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Friedrich Engels. The term &#39;Classical Marxism&#39; is often used to distinguish between &quot;Marxism&quot; in general and &quot;what Marx believed&quot;; for example, shortly before he died in 1883, Marx wrote a letter to the French workers&#39; leader <!--del_lnk--> Jules Guesde, and to his own son-in-law <!--del_lnk--> Paul Lafargue, accusing them of &quot;revolutionary phrase-mongering&quot; and of denying the value of reformist struggles: &quot;if that is Marxism&quot; &mdash; paraphrasing what Marx wrote &mdash; &quot;then I am not a Marxist&quot;. As the American Marx scholar <!--del_lnk--> Hal Draper remarked, &quot;there are few thinkers in modern history whose thought has been so badly misrepresented, by Marxists and anti-Marxists alike.&quot;<p>Classical Marxism can also refer to the second era of Marxism (1889-1914) where an organization known as the <!--del_lnk--> Second International propagated for the expansion of socialism internationally.<p><a id="Karl_Marx_.26_Friedrich_Engels" name="Karl_Marx_.26_Friedrich_Engels"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Karl Marx &amp; Friedrich Engels</span></h3>

      <p><b>Friedrich Engels</b> (<!--del_lnk--> November 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1820, <!--del_lnk--> Wuppertal &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> August 5, <!--del_lnk--> 1895, <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>) was a <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th-century</a> <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">German</a> <a href="../../wp/p/Political_philosophy.htm" title="Political philosophy">political philosopher</a>. He developed <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">communist</a> theory alongside Marx.<p>The two first met in person in September 1844. They discovered that they had similar views on <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> and on <a href="../../wp/c/Capitalism.htm" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> and decided to work together, producing a number of works including <i>Die heilige Familie</i> (<i><!--del_lnk--> The Holy Family</i>). After the French authorities deported Marx from <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> in January 1845, Engels and Marx decided to move to <a href="../../wp/b/Belgium.htm" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>, which then permitted greater <!--del_lnk--> freedom of expression than some other countries in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>. Engels and Marx returned to <a href="../../wp/b/Brussels.htm" title="Brussels">Brussels</a> in January 1846, where they set up the Communist Correspondence Committee.<p>In 1847 Engels and Marx began writing a pamphlet together, based on Engels&#39; <i>The Principles of Communism</i>. They completed the 12,000-word pamphlet in six weeks, writing it in such a manner as to make communism understandable to a wide audience, and published it as <i><!--del_lnk--> The Communist Manifesto</i> in February 1848. In March, Belgium expelled both Engels and Marx. They moved to <a href="../../wp/c/Cologne.htm" title="Cologne">Cologne</a>, where they began to publish a radical newspaper, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i>. By 1849 both Engels and Marx had to leave Germany and moved to London. The Prussian authorities applied pressure on the British government to expel the two men, but <a href="../../wp/p/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> <!--del_lnk--> Lord John Russell refused. With only the money that Engels could raise, the Marx family lived in extreme poverty.<p>After Marx&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> death in 1883, Engels devoted much of the rest of his life to editing and translating Marx&#39;s writings. However, he also contributed significantly to <!--del_lnk--> feminist theory, seeing for instance the concept of <!--del_lnk--> monogamous <!--del_lnk--> marriage as having arisen because of the domination of man over women. In this sense, he ties communist theory to the family, arguing that men have dominated women just as the capitalist class has dominated workers. Engels died in London in 1895.<p><a id="Early_influences" name="Early_influences"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early influences</span></h3>
      <p>Classical Marxism was influenced by a number of different thinkers. These thinkers can roughly be divided into 3 groups:<ul>
       <li><b>German Philosophy</b> including: <a href="../../wp/i/Immanuel_Kant.htm" title="Immanuel Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Georg Hegel, <!--del_lnk--> Ludwig Feuerbach<li><b>English and Scottish Political Economy</b> including: <a href="../../wp/a/Adam_Smith.htm" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a> &amp; <!--del_lnk--> David Ricardo<li><b>French Socialism</b> including: <a href="../../wp/j/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau.htm" title="Jean-Jacques Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>; <!--del_lnk--> Charles Fourier; <!--del_lnk--> Henri de Saint-Simon; <!--del_lnk--> Pierre-Joseph Proudhon; <!--del_lnk--> Louis Blanc</ul>
      <p>Other influences include:<ul>
       <li>Antique materialism<li><!--del_lnk--> Giambattista Vico<li><!--del_lnk--> Lewis Morgan</ul>
      <p><a id="Main_ideas" name="Main_ideas"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Main ideas</span></h3>
      <p>The main ideas to come out of Marx and Engels collective works include:<ul>
       <li><b><!--del_lnk--> mode of production:</b> The mode of production is a specific combination of <!--del_lnk--> productive forces (including human <!--del_lnk--> labour power, tools, equipment, buildings and technologies, materials, and improved land) and social and technical <!--del_lnk--> relations of production (including the property, power and control relations governing society&#39;s productive assets, often codified in law, cooperative work relations and forms of association, relations between people and the objects of their work, and the relations between social classes).<li><b>base and <!--del_lnk--> superstructure:</b> The <i>base</i> refers to the <!--del_lnk--> means of production of society. The <i>superstructure</i> is formed on top of the base, and comprises that society&#39;s ideology, as well as its legal system, political system, and religions. For Marx, the base determines the superstructure.The relationship between superstructure and base is considered to be a <!--del_lnk--> dialectical one, not a distinction between actual entities &quot;in the world&quot;.<li><b><!--del_lnk--> class consciousness:</b> Class consciousness refers to the self-awareness of a <!--del_lnk--> social class and its capacity to act in its own rational interests.<li><b><!--del_lnk--> ideology:</b> Because the ruling class controls the society&#39;s means of production, the superstructure of society, including its ideology, will be determined according to what is in the ruling class&#39;s best interests. Therefore the ideology of a society is of enormous importance since it confuses the alienated groups and can create <!--del_lnk--> false consciousness such as commodity fetishism (perceiving labor as capital ~ a degradation of human life).<li><b><!--del_lnk--> historical materialism:</b> Historical materialism was first articulated by Marx, although he himself never used the term. It looks for the causes of developments and changes in human societies in the way in which humans collectively make the means to life, thus giving an emphasis, through economic analysis, to everything that co-exists with the economic base of society (e.g. social classes, political structures, ideologies).<li><b><a href="../../wp/p/Political_economy.htm" title="Political economy">political economy</a>:</b> The term political economy originally meant the study of the conditions under which production was organized in the nation-states of the new-born capitalist system. Political economy, then, studies the mechanism of human activity in organizing material, and the mechanism of distributing the surplus or deficit that is the result of that activity.Political economy studies the means of production, specifically capital, and how this manifests itself in economic activity.<li><b><!--del_lnk--> exploitation:</b> Marx refers to the exploitation of an entire segment or class of society by another. He sees it as being an inherent feature and key element of capitalism and free markets. The profit gained by the capitalist is the difference between the value of the product made by the worker and the actual wage that the worker receives; in other words, capitalism functions on the basis of paying workers less than the full value of their labour, in order to enable the capitalist class to turn a profit.<li><b><!--del_lnk--> alienation:</b> Marx refers to the alienation of people from aspects of their &quot;human nature&quot; (Gattungswesen, usually translated as &#39;species-essence&#39; or &#39;species-being&#39;). Alienation describes objective features of a person&#39;s situation in capitalism - it isn&#39;t necessary for them to believe or feel that they are alienated. He believes that alienation is a systematic result of capitalism.</ul>

      <p>Marx believed that the identity of a social class derived from its relationship to the means of production (as opposed to the notion that class is determined by wealth alone, i.e., lower class, middle class, upper class).<p>Marx describes several <!--del_lnk--> social classes in capitalist societies, including primarily:<ul>
       <li><b>the <!--del_lnk--> proletariat:</b> &quot;those individuals who sell their <!--del_lnk--> labour power, (and therefore add value to the products), and who, in the capitalist mode of production, do not own the means of production&quot;. According to Marx, the capitalist mode of production establishes the conditions that enable the <!--del_lnk--> bourgeoisie to <!--del_lnk--> exploit the proletariat due to the fact that the worker&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> labour power generates an <!--del_lnk--> added value greater than the worker&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> salary.<li><b>the <!--del_lnk--> bourgeoisie:</b> those who &quot;own the means of production&quot; and buy <!--del_lnk--> labour power from the proletariat, who are recompensed by a salary, thus <!--del_lnk--> exploiting the proletariat.</ul>
      <p>The bourgeoisie may be further subdivided into the very wealthy bourgeoisie and the <!--del_lnk--> petty bourgeoisie. The petty bourgeoisie are those who employ labour, but may also work themselves. These may be small proprietors, land-holding peasants, or trade workers. Marx predicted that the petty bourgeoisie would eventually be destroyed by the constant reinvention of the means of production and the result of this would be the forced movement of the vast majority of the petty bourgeoisie to the proletariat. Marx also identified the lumpenproletariat, a stratum of society completely disconnected from the means of production.<p><a id="Western_Marxism" name="Western_Marxism"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Western Marxism</span></h2>

      <p>Structural Marxism is an approach to <strong class="selflink">Marxism</strong> based on <!--del_lnk--> structuralism, primarily associated with the work of the French theorist <!--del_lnk--> Louis Althusser and his students. It was influential in France during the late 1960s and 1970s, and also came to influence philosophers, political theorists and sociologists outside of France during the 1970s.<p><a id="Neo-Marxism" name="Neo-Marxism"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Neo-Marxism</span></h4>
      <p>Neo-Marxism is a school of Marxism that began in the 20th century and hearkened back to the early writings of <a href="../../wp/k/Karl_Marx.htm" title="Marx">Marx</a> before the influence of <!--del_lnk--> Engels which focused on dialectical idealism rather than dialectical materialism. It thus rejected economic determinism being instead far more <!--del_lnk--> libertarian. Neo-Marxism adds <a href="../../wp/m/Max_Weber.htm" title="Max Weber">Max Weber</a>&#39;s broader understanding of <!--del_lnk--> social inequality, such as <!--del_lnk--> status and <!--del_lnk--> power, to orthodox Marxist thought.<p><a id="The_Frankfurt_School" name="The_Frankfurt_School"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The Frankfurt School</span></h4>
      <p>The Frankfurt School is a school of <!--del_lnk--> neo-Marxist <a href="../../wp/s/Sociology.htm" title="Sociology">social theory</a>, <!--del_lnk--> social research, and <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>. The grouping emerged at the <!--del_lnk--> Institute for Social Research (<i>Institut f&uuml;r Sozialforschung</i>) of the <!--del_lnk--> University of Frankfurt am Main in Germany. The term &quot;Frankfurt School&quot; is an informal term used to designate the thinkers affiliated with the Institute for Social Research or influenced by them: it is not the title of any institution, and the main thinkers of the Frankfurt School did not use the term to describe themselves.<p>The Frankfurt School gathered together dissident <strong class="selflink">Marxists</strong>, severe critics of <a href="../../wp/c/Capitalism.htm" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> who believed that some of <a href="../../wp/k/Karl_Marx.htm" title="Karl Marx">Marx</a>&#39;s alleged followers had come to parrot a narrow selection of Marx&#39;s ideas, usually in defense of orthodox <!--del_lnk--> Communist or <!--del_lnk--> Social-Democratic parties. Influenced especially by the failure of working-class revolutions in Western Europe after <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> and by the rise of <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">Nazism</a> in an economically, technologically, and culturally advanced nation (Germany), they took up the task of choosing what parts of Marx&#39;s thought might serve to clarify social conditions which Marx himself had never seen. They drew on other schools of thought to fill in Marx&#39;s perceived omissions.<p><a href="../../wp/m/Max_Weber.htm" title="Max Weber">Max Weber</a> exerted a major influence, as did <a href="../../wp/s/Sigmund_Freud.htm" title="Sigmund Freud">Sigmund Freud</a> (as in <!--del_lnk--> Herbert Marcuse&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Freudo-Marxist synthesis in the <!--del_lnk--> 1954 work <i>Eros and Civilization</i>). Their emphasis on the &quot;critical&quot; component of theory was derived significantly from their attempt to overcome the limits of <!--del_lnk--> positivism, crude <!--del_lnk--> materialism, and <!--del_lnk--> phenomenology by returning to <a href="../../wp/i/Immanuel_Kant.htm" title="Immanuel Kant">Kant</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> critical philosophy and its successors in German <!--del_lnk--> idealism, principally <!--del_lnk--> Hegel&#39;s philosophy, with its emphasis on <!--del_lnk--> negation and <!--del_lnk--> contradiction as inherent properties of <!--del_lnk--> reality.<p><a id="Cultural_Marxism" name="Cultural_Marxism"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Cultural Marxism</span></h4>
      <p>Cultural Marxism is a form of Marxism that adds an analysis of the role of the media, art, theatre, film and other cultural institutions in a society, often with an added emphasis on race and gender in addition to class. As a form of political analysis, Cultural Marxism gained strength in the 1920s, and was the model used by the <!--del_lnk--> Frankfurt School; and later by another group of intellectuals at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies in Birmingham, England.<p><a id="Analytical_Marxism" name="Analytical_Marxism"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Analytical Marxism</span></h4>
      <p>Analytical Marxism refers to a style of thinking about <strong class="selflink">Marxism</strong> that was prominent amongst English-speaking philosophers and social scientists during the 1980s. It was mainly associated with the <!--del_lnk--> September Group of academics, so called because they have biennial meetings in varying locations every other September to discuss common interests. The group also dubbed itself &quot;Non-Bullshit Marxism&quot; (Cohen 2000a). It was characterized, in the words of <!--del_lnk--> David Miller, by &quot;clear and rigorous thinking about questions that are usually blanketed by ideological fog&quot;. (Miller 1996)<p><a id="Marxist_humanism" name="Marxist_humanism"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Marxist humanism</span></h4>
      <p>Marxist humanism is a branch of <strong class="selflink">Marxism</strong> that primarily focuses on <!--del_lnk--> Marx&#39;s earlier writings, especially the <i><!--del_lnk--> Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844</i> in which Marx exposes his <!--del_lnk--> theory of alienation, as opposed to his later works, which are considered to be concerned more with his structural conception of <!--del_lnk--> capitalist society. It was opposed by <!--del_lnk--> Louis Althusser&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> antihumanism&quot;, who qualified it as a <!--del_lnk--> revisionist movement.<p>Marxist humanists contend that &lsquo;Marxism&rsquo; developed lopsided because Marx&rsquo;s early works were unknown till after the orthodox ideas were in vogue &mdash; the Manuscripts of 1844 were published only in 1932 &mdash; and it is necessary to understand Marx&rsquo;s philosophical foundations to understand his latter works properly.<p><a id="Key_Western_Marxists" name="Key_Western_Marxists"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Key Western Marxists</span></h3>

His main work <i>History and Class Consciousness</i> (written between 1919 and 1922 and first published in 1923), initiated the current of thought that came to be known as Western Marxism. The book is notable for contributing to debates concerning Marxism and its relation to <a href="../../wp/s/Sociology.htm" title="Sociology">sociology</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Politics.htm" title="Politics">politics</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>, and for reconstructing <!--del_lnk--> Marx&#39;s theory of alienation before many of the works of the <!--del_lnk--> Young Marx had been published.

He wrote in his <i>Ten Theses</i> (1950) that &quot;the first step in re-establishing a revolutionary theory and practice consists in breaking with that Marxism which claims to monopolize revolutionary initiative as well as theoretical and practical direction&quot; and that &quot;today, all attempts to re-establish the Marxist doctrine as a whole in its original function as a theory of the working classes social revolution are reactionary utopias.&quot; <p>Korsch was especially concerned that Marxist theory was losing its precision and validity - in the words of the day, becoming &quot;vulgarized&quot; - within the upper echelons of the various socialist organizations. His masterwork, <i>Marxism and Philosophy</i> is an attempt to re-establish the historic character of Marxism as the heir to <!--del_lnk--> Hegel.<p><a id="Antonio_Gramsci" name="Antonio_Gramsci"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Antonio Gramsci</span></h4>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Antonio Gramsci (<!--del_lnk--> January 22, <!--del_lnk--> 1891 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> April 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1937) was an <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italian</a> <!--del_lnk--> writer, <!--del_lnk--> politician and <!--del_lnk--> political theorist. He was a founding member and onetime leader of the <!--del_lnk--> Communist Party of Italy. Gramsci can be seen as one of the most important Marxist thinkers of the twentieth century, and in particular a key thinker in the development of <!--del_lnk--> Western Marxism. He wrote more than 30 notebooks and 3000 pages of history and analysis during his imprisonment. These writings, known as the <i>Prison Notebooks</i>, contain Gramsci&#39;s tracing of <!--del_lnk--> Italian history and <a href="../../wp/n/Nationalism.htm" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a>, as well as some ideas in <!--del_lnk--> Marxist theory, <!--del_lnk--> critical theory and educational theory associated with his name, such as:<ul>

      <p><a id="Louis_Althusser" name="Louis_Althusser"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Louis Althusser</span></h4>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Louis Althusser (<!--del_lnk--> October 16, <!--del_lnk--> 1918 - <!--del_lnk--> October 23, <!--del_lnk--> 1990) was a <!--del_lnk--> Marxist philosopher. His arguments were a response to multiple threats to the ideological foundations of orthodox Communism. These included both the influence of <a href="../../wp/e/Empiricism.htm" title="Empiricism">empiricism</a> which was beginning to influence <!--del_lnk--> Marxist sociology and economics, and growing interest in humanistic and democratic socialist orientations which were beginning to cause division in the European Communist Parties. Althusser is commonly referred to as a <!--del_lnk--> Structural Marxist, although his relationship to other schools of French <!--del_lnk--> structuralism is not a simple affiliation.<p>His essay <i>Marxism and Humanism</i> is a strong statement of anti-<!--del_lnk--> humanism in Marxist theory, condemning ideas like &quot;human potential&quot; and &quot;species-being,&quot; which are often put forth by Marxists, as outgrowths of a <!--del_lnk--> bourgeois ideology of &quot;humanity.&quot; His essay <i>Contradiction and Overdetermination</i> borrows the concept of <!--del_lnk--> overdetermination from <!--del_lnk--> psychoanalysis, in order to replace the idea of &quot;contradiction&quot; with a more complex model of multiple <!--del_lnk--> causality in political situations (an idea closely related to <!--del_lnk--> Antonio Gramsci&#39;s concept of <!--del_lnk--> hegemony).<p>Althusser is also widely known as a theorist of <!--del_lnk--> ideology, and his best-known essay is <i>Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses: Notes Toward an Investigation</i> . The essay establishes the concept of ideology, also based on <!--del_lnk--> Gramsci&#39;s theory of <!--del_lnk--> hegemony. Whereas hegemony is ultimately determined entirely by political forces, ideology draws on <a href="../../wp/s/Sigmund_Freud.htm" title="Sigmund Freud">Freud&#39;s</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Lacan&#39;s concepts of the unconscious and mirror-phase respectively, and describes the structures and systems that allow us to meaningfully have a concept of the self.<p><a id="Herbert_Marcuse" name="Herbert_Marcuse"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Herbert Marcuse</span></h4>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Herbert Marcuse (<!--del_lnk--> July 19, <!--del_lnk--> 1898 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> July 29, <!--del_lnk--> 1979) was a prominent <!--del_lnk--> German-<!--del_lnk--> American <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosopher</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Sociology.htm" title="Sociology">sociologist</a> of <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> descent, and a member of the <!--del_lnk--> Frankfurt School.<p>Marcuse&#39;s critiques of <!--del_lnk--> capitalist society (especially his <!--del_lnk--> 1955 synthesis of <a href="../../wp/k/Karl_Marx.htm" title="Karl Marx">Marx</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Sigmund_Freud.htm" title="Sigmund Freud">Freud</a>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Eros and Civilization</i>, and his <!--del_lnk--> 1964 book <i><!--del_lnk--> One-Dimensional Man</i>) resonated with the concerns of the leftist student movement in the <!--del_lnk--> 1960s.

      <p>Post-Marxism represents the theoretical work of <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosopher">philosophers</a> and <!--del_lnk--> social theorists who have built their theories upon those of Marx and Marxists but exceeded the limits of those theories in ways that puts them outside of Marxism. It begins with the basic tenets of Marxism but moves away from the Mode of Production as the starting point for analysis and includes factors other than class, such as gender, ethnicity etc, and a reflexive relationship between the base and superstructure.<p><a id="Marxist_Feminism" name="Marxist_Feminism"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Marxist Feminism</span></h2>
      <p>Marxist feminism is a sub-type of <!--del_lnk--> feminist theory which focuses on the dismantling of <a href="../../wp/c/Capitalism.htm" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> as a way to liberate women. Marxist feminism states that capitalism, which gives rise to economic inequality, dependence, political confusion and ultimately unhealthy social relations between men and women, is the root of women&#39;s oppression.<p>According to <!--del_lnk--> Marxist theory, in capitalist societies the individual is shaped by class relations; that is, people&#39;s capacities, needs and interests are seen to be determined by the mode of production that characterises the society they inhabit. Marxist feminists see gender inequality as determined ultimately by the capitalist mode of production. Gender oppression is class oppression and women&#39;s subordination is seen as a form of class oppression which is maintained (like <!--del_lnk--> racism) because it serves the interests of capital and the <!--del_lnk--> ruling class. Marxist feminists have extended traditional Marxist analysis by looking at domestic labour as well as wage work in order to support their position.<p><a id="Marxism_as_a_political_practice" name="Marxism_as_a_political_practice"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Marxism as a political practice</span></h2>

      <p>Since Marx&#39;s death in 1883, various groups around the world have appealed to Marxism as the theoretical basis for their politics and policies, which have often proved to be dramatically different and conflicting. One of the first major political splits occurred between the advocates of &#39;reformism&#39;, who argued that the transition to socialism could occur within existing <!--del_lnk--> bourgeois parliamentarian frameworks, and <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">communists</a>, who argued that the transition to a socialist society required a revolution and the dissolution of the capitalist state. The &#39;reformist&#39; tendency, later known as <!--del_lnk--> social democracy, came to be dominant in most of the parties affiliated to the <!--del_lnk--> Second International and these parties supported their own governments in the First World War. This issue caused the communists to break away, forming their own parties which became members of the <!--del_lnk--> Third International.<p>The following countries had governments at some point in the twentieth century who at least nominally adhered to Marxism (those in bold still do as of 2006): <a href="../../wp/a/Albania.htm" title="Albania">Albania</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Angola.htm" title="Angola">Angola</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Bulgaria.htm" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Chile.htm" title="Chile">Chile</a>, <b><a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a></b>, <b><a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuba">Cuba</a></b>, <!--del_lnk--> Czechoslovakia, <!--del_lnk--> East Germany, <a href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia.htm" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, <a href="../../wp/h/Hungary.htm" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>, <b><a href="../../wp/l/Laos.htm" title="Laos">Laos</a></b>, <b><a href="../../wp/m/Moldova.htm" title="Moldova">Moldova</a></b>, <a href="../../wp/m/Mongolia.htm" title="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Mozambique.htm" title="Mozambique">Mozambique</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/Nicaragua.htm" title="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>, <b><a href="../../wp/n/North_Korea.htm" title="North Korea">North Korea</a></b>, <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Poland</a>, <a href="../../wp/r/Romania.htm" title="Romania">Romania</a>, <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> USSR and <!--del_lnk--> its republics, <!--del_lnk--> South Yemen, <a href="../../wp/y/Yugoslavia.htm" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>, <b><a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a></b>.

      <p>The 1917 October Revolution, led by <a href="../../wp/v/Vladimir_Lenin.htm" title="Vladimir Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a>, was the first large scale attempt to put Marxist ideas about a workers&#39; state into practice. The new government faced counter-revolution, civil war and foreign intervention. Many, both inside and outside the revolution, worried that the revolution came too early in Russia&#39;s economic development as Marxism requires capitalism to have exhausted its mechanisms of growth before attaining socialism. Consequently, the major Socialist Party in the UK decried the revolution as anti-Marxist within twenty-four hours, according to <!--del_lnk--> Jonathan Wolff. Socialist revolution in <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> and other western countries failed, leaving the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> on its own. An intense period of debate and stopgap solutions ensued, <!--del_lnk--> war communism and the <!--del_lnk--> New Economic Policy (NEP). Lenin died and <a href="../../wp/j/Joseph_Stalin.htm" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> gradually assumed control, eliminating rivals and consolidating power as the Soviet Union faced the horrible challenges of the 1930s and its global crisis-tendencies. Amidst the geopolitical threats which defined the period and included the probability of invasion, he instituted a ruthless program of <!--del_lnk--> industrialisation which, while successful, was executed at great cost in human suffering, including millions of deaths, along with long-term environmental devastation.<p>Modern followers of <a href="../../wp/l/Leon_Trotsky.htm" title="Leon Trotsky">Leon Trotsky</a> maintain that as predicted by Lenin, Trotsky, and others already in the 1920s, Stalin&#39;s &quot;socialism in one country&quot; was unable to maintain itself, and according to some Marxist critics, the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">USSR</a> ceased to show the characteristics of a socialist state long before its formal dissolution.<p>Following <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Marxist ideology, often with Soviet military backing, spawned a rise in revolutionary communist parties all over the world. Some of these parties were eventually able to gain power, and establish their own version of a Marxist state. Such nations included the <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">People&#39;s Republic of China</a>, <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, <a href="../../wp/r/Romania.htm" title="Romania">Romania</a>, <!--del_lnk--> East Germany, <a href="../../wp/a/Albania.htm" title="Albania">Albania</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Cambodia.htm" title="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia.htm" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, <!--del_lnk--> South Yemen, <a href="../../wp/y/Yugoslavia.htm" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, and others. In some cases, these nations did not get along. The most notable examples were rifts that occurred between the Soviet Union and China, as well as Soviet Union and Yugoslavia (in 1948), whose leaders disagreed on certain elements of Marxism and how it should be implemented into society.<p>Many of these self-proclaimed Marxist nations (often styled <!--del_lnk--> People&#39;s Republics) eventually became authoritarian states, with stagnating economies. This caused some debate about whether or not these nations were in fact led by &quot;true Marxists&quot;. Critics of Marxism speculated that perhaps Marxist ideology itself was to blame for the nations&#39; various problems. Followers of the currents within Marxism which opposed Stalin, principally cohered around <a href="../../wp/l/Leon_Trotsky.htm" title="Leon Trotsky">Leon Trotsky</a>, tended to locate the failure at the level of the failure of <!--del_lnk--> world revolution: for communism to have succeeded, they argue, it needed to encompass all the international trading relationships that capitalism had previously developed.<p>The Chinese experience seems to be unique. Rather than falling under a single family&#39;s self-serving and dynastic interpretation of Marxism as happened in North Korea and before 1989 in Eastern Europe, the Chinese government - after the end of the struggles over the Mao legacy in 1980 and the ascent of Deng Xiaoping - seems to have solved the succession crises that have plagued self-proclaimed Leninist governments since the death of Lenin himself. Key to this success is another Leninism which is a NEP (<!--del_lnk--> New Economic Policy) writ very large; Lenin&#39;s own NEP of the 1920s was the &quot;permission&quot; given to markets including speculation to operate by the Party which retained final control. The Russian experience in <!--del_lnk--> Perestroika was that markets under socialism were so opaque as to be both inefficient and corrupt but especially after China&#39;s application to join the <!--del_lnk--> WTO this does not seem to apply universally.<p>The death of &quot;Marxism&quot; in China has been prematurely announced but since the Hong Kong handover in 1997, the Beijing leadership has clearly retained final say over both commercial and political affairs. Questions remain however as to whether the Chinese Party has opened its markets to such a degree as to be no longer classified as a true Marxist party. A sort of tacit consent, and a desire in China&#39;s case to escape the chaos of pre-1949 memory, probably plays a role.<p>In 1991 the Soviet Union collapsed and the new Russian state ceased to identify itself with Marxism. Other nations around the world followed suit. Since then, radical Marxism or Communism has generally ceased to be a prominent political force in global politics, and has largely been replaced by more moderate versions of democratic socialism&mdash;or, more commonly, by aggressively neoliberal capitalism. Marxism has also had to engage with the rise in the <!--del_lnk--> Environmental movement. A merging of Marxism, <a href="../../wp/s/Socialism.htm" title="Socialism">socialism</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Ecology.htm" title="Ecology">ecology</a> and <!--del_lnk--> environmentalism has been achieved, and is often referred to as <!--del_lnk--> Eco-socialism.<p><a id="Social_Democracy" name="Social_Democracy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Social Democracy</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Social democracy is a <!--del_lnk--> political ideology that emerged in the late <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th</a> and early <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a>. Many parties in the second half of the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a> described themselves as social democratic, such as the British <!--del_lnk--> Social Democratic Federation, and the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. In most cases these were revolutionary socialist or Marxist groups, who were not only seeking to introduce socialism, but also democracy in un-democratic countries.<p>The modern social democratic current came into being through a break within the socialist movement in the early <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a>, between two groups holding different views on the ideas of <a href="../../wp/k/Karl_Marx.htm" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>. Many related movements, including <!--del_lnk--> pacifism, <a href="../../wp/a/Anarchism.htm" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> syndicalism, arose at the same time (often by splitting from the main socialist movement, but also by emerging of new theories.) and had various quite different objections to <strong class="selflink">Marxism</strong>. The social democrats, who were the majority of socialists at this time, did not reject Marxism (and in fact claimed to uphold it), but wanted to <i>reform</i> it in certain ways and tone down their criticism of capitalism. They argued that socialism should be achieved through evolution rather than revolution. Such views were strongly opposed by the revolutionary socialists, who argued that any attempt to reform capitalism was doomed to fail, because the reformers would be gradually corrupted and eventually turn into capitalists themselves.<p>Despite their differences, the reformist and revolutionary branches of socialism remained united until the outbreak of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>. The war proved to be the final straw that pushed the tensions between them to breaking point. The reformist socialists supported their respective national governments in the war, a fact that was seen by the revolutionary socialists as outright treason against the <!--del_lnk--> working class (Since it betrayed the principle that the workers of all nations should unite in overthrowing capitalism, and the fact that usually the lowest classes are the ones sent into the war to fight, and die, putting the cause at the side). Bitter arguments ensued within socialist parties, as for example between <!--del_lnk--> Eduard Bernstein (reformist socialist) and <!--del_lnk--> Rosa Luxemburg (revolutionary socialist) within the <!--del_lnk--> SPD in Germany. Eventually, after the <a href="../../wp/r/Russian_Revolution_of_1917.htm" title="Russian Revolution of 1917">Russian Revolution of 1917</a>, most of the world&#39;s socialist parties fractured. The reformist socialists kept the name &quot;Social democrats&quot;, while the revolutionary socialists began calling themselves &quot;Communists&quot;, and soon formed the modern <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communist">Communist</a> movement. (See also <!--del_lnk--> Comintern)<p>Since the <!--del_lnk--> 1920s, doctrinal differences have been constantly growing between social democrats and Communists (who themselves are not unified on the way to achieve socialism).<p><a id="Socialism" name="Socialism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Socialism</span></h3>
      <p>Although there are still many Marxist revolutionary <!--del_lnk--> social movements and <!--del_lnk--> political parties around the world, since the <!--del_lnk--> collapse of the Soviet Union and its satellite states, very few countries have governments which describe themselves as Marxist.Although socialistic parties are in power in some Western nations, they long ago distanced themselves from their direct link to Marx and his ideas.<p>As of 2005, <a href="../../wp/l/Laos.htm" title="Laos">Laos</a>, <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, and the <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">People&#39;s Republic of China</a> - and to a certain extent <a href="../../wp/v/Venezuela.htm" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> had governments in power which describe themselves as <a href="../../wp/s/Socialism.htm" title="Socialism">socialist</a> in the Marxist sense. However, the <!--del_lnk--> private sector comprised more than 50% of the <!--del_lnk--> mainland Chinese economy by this time and the Vietnamese government had also partially liberalised its economy. The Laotian and Cuban states maintained strong control over the means of production.<p><!--del_lnk--> Alexander Lukashenko president of <a href="../../wp/b/Belarus.htm" title="Belarus">Belarus</a>, has been quoted as saying that his agrarian policy could be termed as Communist. He has also frequently reffered to the economy as being &#39;<!--del_lnk--> market socialism&#39;. Lukashenko is also an unapologetic admirer of the Soviet Union.<p><a href="../../wp/n/North_Korea.htm" title="North Korea">North Korea</a> is another contemporary socialist state, though the official ideology of the <!--del_lnk--> Korean Workers&#39; Party (originally led by <!--del_lnk--> Kim Il-sung and currently chaired by his son, <!--del_lnk--> Kim Jong-il), <!--del_lnk--> Juche, does not follow doctrinaire <!--del_lnk--> Marxism-Leninism as had been espoused by the leadership of the Soviet Union.<p><a href="../../wp/l/Libya.htm" title="Libya">Libya</a> is often thought of as a socialist state; it maintained ties with the Soviet Union and other Eastern bloc and Communist states during the Cold War.

      <p>A <b>Communist state</b> is a state which declares its allegiance to the principles of <!--del_lnk--> Marxism-Leninism. Communist states have a centrally <!--del_lnk--> planned economy, a rigid system based on collectively owned property, although some Communist states such as the <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">People&#39;s Republic of China</a> have allowed some controlled private investment in an effort to expand their economies. The governments of Communist Party states are dominated by a Communist party, either as a <!--del_lnk--> single-party state or a single list, which includes formally several parties, as was the case in the GDR; historically this power concentration has tended to produce <!--del_lnk--> totalitarian rule. Their governments have generally referred to their states as socialist states.<p>Communist governments have historically been characterized by state ownership of productive resources in a <!--del_lnk--> planned economy and sweeping campaigns of economic restructuring such as <!--del_lnk--> nationalization of industry and <!--del_lnk--> land reform (often focusing on <!--del_lnk--> collective farming or state farms.) While they promote collective <!--del_lnk--> ownership of the means of production, Communist governments have been characterized by a strong state apparatus in which decisions are made by the ruling Communist Party. Dissident communists have characterized the Soviet model as <!--del_lnk--> state socialism or <!--del_lnk--> state capitalism.<p><a id="Marxism-Leninism" name="Marxism-Leninism"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Marxism-Leninism</span></h4>
      <p>Marxism-Leninism, strictly speaking, refers to the version of <strong class="selflink">Marxism</strong> developed by <a href="../../wp/v/Vladimir_Lenin.htm" title="Vladimir Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> known as <!--del_lnk--> Leninism. However, in various contexts, different (and sometimes opposing) political groups have used the term &quot;Marxism-Leninism&quot; to describe the ideologies that they claimed to be upholding. The core ideological features of Marxism-Leninism are those of Marxism and Leninism, viz. belief in the necessity of a violent overthrow of <a href="../../wp/c/Capitalism.htm" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> through <!--del_lnk--> communist revolution, to be followed by a <!--del_lnk--> dictatorship of the proletariat as the first stage of moving towards <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">communism</a>, and the need for a <!--del_lnk--> vanguard party to lead the <!--del_lnk--> proletariat in this effort. It involves subscribing to the teachings and legacy of <a href="../../wp/k/Karl_Marx.htm" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Frederick Engels (Marxism), and that of Lenin, as carried forward by <a href="../../wp/j/Joseph_Stalin.htm" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>. Those who view themselves as Marxist-Leninists, however, vary with regards to the leaders and thinkers that they choose to uphold as progressive (and to what extent). <!--del_lnk--> Maoists tend to downplay the importance of all other thinkers in favour of <a href="../../wp/m/Mao_Zedong.htm" title="Mao Zedong">Mao Zedong</a>, whereas <!--del_lnk--> Hoxhaites repudiate Mao.<p>Leninism holds that <a href="../../wp/c/Capitalism.htm" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> can only be overthrown by revolutionary means; that is, any attempts to <i>reform</i> capitalism from within, such as <!--del_lnk--> Fabianism and non-revolutionary forms of <!--del_lnk--> democratic socialism, are doomed to fail. The goal of a Leninist party is to orchestrate the overthrow the existing government by force and seize power on behalf of the proletariat, and then implement a <!--del_lnk--> dictatorship of the proletariat. The party must then use the powers of government to educate the proletariat, so as to remove the various modes of <!--del_lnk--> false consciousness the <!--del_lnk--> bourgeois have instilled in them in order to make them more docile and easier to exploit economically, such as <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religion</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/Nationalism.htm" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a>.<p>The dictatorship of the proletariat is theoretically to be governed by a decentralized system of proletarian <!--del_lnk--> direct democracy, in which workers hold political power through local councils known as <!--del_lnk--> soviets <i>(see <!--del_lnk--> soviet democracy)</i>. (In practice, the Bolsheviks banned other political organizations and removed all real political power from the soviets shortly after the <!--del_lnk--> October Revolution as the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Civil War got underway, when it became clear that the <!--del_lnk--> Bolshevik Party lacked popular support in the nonindustrial areas outside the major cities of <a href="../../wp/s/Saint_Petersburg.htm" title="St. Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Moscow.htm" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>.)<p><a id="Trotskyism" name="Trotskyism"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Trotskyism</span></h4>
      <p>Trotskyism is the theory of <strong class="selflink">Marxism</strong> as advocated by <a href="../../wp/l/Leon_Trotsky.htm" title="Leon Trotsky">Leon Trotsky</a>. Trotsky considered himself a <!--del_lnk--> Bolshevik-<!--del_lnk--> Leninist, arguing for the establishment of a <!--del_lnk--> vanguard party. He considered himself an advocate of <strong class="selflink">orthodox Marxism</strong>. His politics differed sharply from those of <!--del_lnk--> Stalin or <!--del_lnk--> Mao, most importantly in declaring the need for an international &quot;<!--del_lnk--> permanent revolution&quot;. Numerous groups around the world continue to describe themselves as Trotskyist and see themselves as standing in this tradition, although they have diverse interpretations of the conclusions to be drawn from this.<p>Trotsky advocated <!--del_lnk--> proletarian revolution as set out in his theory of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> permanent revolution&quot;, and he argued that in countries where the <!--del_lnk--> bourgeois-<!--del_lnk--> democratic revolution had not triumphed already (in other words, in places that had not yet implemented a capitalist democracy, such as Russia before 1917), it was necessary that the proletariat make it permanent by carrying out the tasks of the social revolution (the &quot;socialist&quot; or &quot;communist&quot; revolution) at the same time, in an uninterrupted process. Trotsky believed that a new socialist state would not be able to hold out against the pressures of a hostile capitalist world unless socialist revolutions quickly took hold in other countries as well.<p>On the <!--del_lnk--> political spectrum of <strong class="selflink">Marxism</strong>, Trotskyists are considered to be on the left. They supported democratic rights in the USSR, opposed political deals with the imperialist powers, and advocated a spreading of the revolution throughout Europe and the East.<p>Trotsky developed the theory that the Russian workers&#39; state had become a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> bureaucratically degenerated workers&#39; state&quot;. Capitalist rule had not been restored, and nationalized industry and economic planning, instituted under Lenin, were still in effect. However, the state was controlled by a bureaucratic caste with interests hostile to those of the working class. Trotsky defended the Soviet Union against attack from imperialist powers and against internal <!--del_lnk--> counter-revolution, but called for a <!--del_lnk--> political revolution within the USSR to restore socialist democracy. He argued that if the working class did not take power away from the Stalinist bureaucracy, the bureaucracy would restore capitalism in order to enrich itself. In the view of many Trotskyists, this is exactly what has happened since the beginning of <!--del_lnk--> Glasnost and <!--del_lnk--> Perestroika in the USSR. Some argue that the adoption of <!--del_lnk--> market socialism by the <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">People&#39;s Republic of China</a> has also led to capitalist counter-revolution.<p><a id="Maoism" name="Maoism"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Maoism</span></h4>

Likewise, Maoist groups outside China have usually called themselves <!--del_lnk--> Marxist-Leninist rather than Maoist, a reflection of Mao&#39;s view that he did not change, but only developed, Marxism-Leninism. However, some Maoist groups, believing Mao&#39;s theories to have been sufficiently substantial additions to the basics of the <!--del_lnk--> Marxist <!--del_lnk--> canon, call themselves &quot;Marxist-Leninist-Maoist&quot; (MLM) or simply &quot;Maoist.&quot;<p>In the People&#39;s Republic of China, Mao Zedong Thought is part of the official doctrine of the <!--del_lnk--> Communist Party of China, but since the <!--del_lnk--> 1978 beginning of <!--del_lnk--> Deng Xiaoping&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> market economy-oriented reforms, the concept of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> socialism with Chinese characteristics&quot; has come to the forefront of Chinese politics, <!--del_lnk--> Chinese economic reform has taken hold, and the official definition and role of Mao&#39;s original <!--del_lnk--> ideology in the PRC has been radically altered and reduced (see <i><!--del_lnk--> History of China</i>).<p>Unlike the earlier forms of <!--del_lnk--> Marxism-Leninism in which the urban <!--del_lnk--> proletariat was seen as the main source of revolution, and the countryside was largely ignored, Mao focused on the peasantry as the main revolutionary force which, he said, could be <i>led</i> by the proletariat and its <!--del_lnk--> vanguard, the <!--del_lnk--> Communist Party of China. The model for this was of course the Chinese communist rural Protracted People&#39;s War of the 1920s and 1930s, which eventually brought the <!--del_lnk--> Communist Party of China to power. Furthermore, unlike other forms of Marxism-Leninism in which large-scale industrial development was seen as a positive force, Maoism made all-round rural development the priority. Mao felt that this strategy made sense during the early stages of socialism in a country in which most of the people were peasants. Unlike most other political ideologies, including other <!--del_lnk--> socialist and Marxist ones, Maoism contains an integral <!--del_lnk--> military doctrine and explicitly connects its political ideology with <!--del_lnk--> military strategy. In Maoist thought, &quot;political power comes from the barrel of the gun&quot; (one of Mao&#39;s quotes), and the <!--del_lnk--> peasantry can be mobilized to undertake a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> people&#39;s war&quot; of armed struggle involving <!--del_lnk--> guerrilla warfare in three stages.<p><a id="Other" name="Other"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other</span></h3>
      <p>Some <a href="../../wp/l/Libertarianism.htm" title="Libertarianism">libertarian</a> members of the <i><!--del_lnk--> laissez-faire</i> and <!--del_lnk--> individualist schools of thought believe the actions and principles of modern capitalist states or <!--del_lnk--> big governments can be understood as &quot;Marxist&quot;. This point of view ignores the overall vision and general intent of Marx and Engels&#39; <i><!--del_lnk--> Communist Manifesto</i>, for qualitative change to the economic system, and focuses on a few steps that Marx and Engels believed would occur, as workers emancipated themselves from the capitalist system, such as &quot;Free education for all children in public schools&quot;. A few such reforms have been implemented &mdash; not by Marxists but in the forms of <!--del_lnk--> Keynesianism, the <!--del_lnk--> welfare state, <!--del_lnk--> new liberalism, <!--del_lnk--> social democracy and other minor changes to the capitalist system, in most capitalist states.<p>To Marxists these reforms represent responses to political pressures from working-class political parties and unions, themselves responding to perceived abuses of the capitalist system. Further, in this view, many of these reforms reflect efforts to &quot;save&quot; or &quot;improve&quot; capitalism (without abolishing it) by coordinating economic actors and dealing with <!--del_lnk--> market failures. Further, although Marxism does see a role for a socialist &quot;vanguard&quot; government in representing the proletariat through a revolutionary period of indeterminate length, it sees an eventual lightening of that burden, a &quot;withering away of the state.&quot;<p><a id="Disputing_these_claims" name="Disputing_these_claims"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Disputing these claims</span></h3>
      <p>Many academics dispute the claim that the above political movements are Marxist. Communist governments have historically been characterized by state ownership of productive resources in a <!--del_lnk--> planned economy and sweeping campaigns of economic restructuring such as <!--del_lnk--> nationalization of industry and <!--del_lnk--> land reform (often focusing on <!--del_lnk--> collective farming or state farms.) While they promote collective <!--del_lnk--> ownership of the means of production, Communist governments have been characterized by a strong state apparatus in which decisions are made by the ruling Communist Party. Dissident communists have characterized the Soviet model as <!--del_lnk--> state socialism or <!--del_lnk--> state capitalism. Further, critics have often claimed that a Stalinist or Maoist system of government creates a <!--del_lnk--> new ruling class, usually called the <!--del_lnk--> nomenklatura.<p>However Marx defined &quot;communism&quot; as a classless, egalitarian and stateless society. Indeed, to Marx, the notion of a socialist state would have seemed oxymoronical, as he defined socialism as the phase reached when class society and the state had already been abolished. Once socialism had been established, society would develop new socialist relations over the course of several generations, reaching the stage known as communism when bourgeois relations had been abandoned. Such a development has yet to occur in any historical self-claimed Socialist state. Often it results in the creation of two distinct classes: those who are in government and therefore have power, and those who are not in government and do not have power &mdash; thus inspiring the term <!--del_lnk--> State capitalism. These statist regimes have generally followed a <!--del_lnk--> command economy model without making a transition to this hypothetical final stage.<p><a id="Criticisms" name="Criticisms"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Criticisms</span></h2>
      <p>Criticisms of Marxism are many and varied. They concern both the theory itself, and its later interpretations and implementations.<p>Criticisms of Marxism have come from the political Left as well as the political Right. <!--del_lnk--> Democratic socialists and <!--del_lnk--> social democrats reject the idea that socialism can be accomplished only through <!--del_lnk--> class conflict and violent revolution. <a href="../../wp/a/Anarchism.htm" title="Anarchism">Anarchists</a> reject the need for a <!--del_lnk--> transitory state phase. Some thinkers have rejected the fundamentals of Marxist theory, such as <!--del_lnk--> historical materialism and the <!--del_lnk--> labour theory of value, and gone on to criticize capitalism - and advocate socialism - using other arguments. Some contemporary supporters of Marxism argue that many aspects of Marxist thought are viable, but that the corpus also fails to deal effectively with certain aspects of economic, political or social theory.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism&quot;</div>
