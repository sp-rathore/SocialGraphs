      <p><b>Maldives</b>, officially the <b>Republic of Maldives</b>, is an <!--del_lnk--> island nation consisting of a <!--del_lnk--> group of atolls in the <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Ocean.htm" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>. The Maldives are located south of <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Lakshadweep islands, and about seven hundred kilometers (435&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mi) south-west of <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>. The twenty-six <!--del_lnk--> atolls encompass a <!--del_lnk--> territory featuring 1,192 islets, roughly two hundred of which are inhabited by people. The country&#39;s name may stand for &quot;Mountain Islands&quot; (<i>malai</i> in <a href="../../wp/t/Tamil_language.htm" title="Tamil language">Tamil</a>, meaning &quot;mountain&quot; and <i>teevu</i> in <a href="../../wp/t/Tamil_language.htm" title="Tamil language">Tamil</a> meaning &quot;island&quot;) or it may mean &quot;a thousand islands&quot;. Some scholars believe that the name &quot;Maldives&quot; derives from the <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> <i>maladvipa</i>, meaning &quot;garland of islands&quot;, or from &quot;mahila dvipa&quot;, meaning &quot;island of women&quot;. Others believe the name means &quot;palace&quot; (from <i>Mahal</i> in <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>).<p>Following the <!--del_lnk--> introduction of Islam in <!--del_lnk--> 1153, the islands later became a <!--del_lnk--> Portuguese (<!--del_lnk--> 1558), <!--del_lnk--> Dutch (<!--del_lnk--> 1654), and <!--del_lnk--> British (<!--del_lnk--> 1887) <!--del_lnk--> colonial possession. In <!--del_lnk--> 1965, Maldives obtained <!--del_lnk--> independence from <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">Britain</a> (originally under the name &quot;Maldive Islands&quot;), and in <!--del_lnk--> 1968 the <!--del_lnk--> Sultanate was replaced by a <!--del_lnk--> Republic. However, in 38 years, the Maldives have had only two Presidents, though political restrictions have loosened somewhat recently.<p>Maldives is the smallest <!--del_lnk--> Asian country in terms of population. It is also the smallest predominantly <!--del_lnk--> Muslim nation in the world.<p>

      <p>Western interest in the archaeological remains of early cultures on Maldives began with the work of H.C.P. Bell, a <!--del_lnk--> British commissioner of the Ceylon Civil Service. Bell was shipwrecked on the islands in <!--del_lnk--> 1879, and returned several times to investigate ancient Buddhist ruins. But by the <!--del_lnk--> fourth century AD, <!--del_lnk--> Theravada Buddhism came from <!--del_lnk--> Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka) and became the dominant religion of the people of Maldives. Some scholars believe that the name &quot;Maldives&quot; derives from the <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> <i>maladvipa</i>, meaning &quot;garland of islands&quot;.Also &quot;Mal&quot; is fish &quot;deeb&quot; is land is also a favored suggestion by many islanders.<p>
       <br /> In the mid-<!--del_lnk--> 1980s, the Maldivian government allowed the noted explorer and expert on early marine navigation, <!--del_lnk--> Thor Heyerdahl, to excavate ancient sites. Heyerdahl studied the ancient mounds, called <i>hawitta</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Dhivehi: &#x780;&#x7A6;&#x788;&#x7A8;&#x787;&#x7B0;&#x78C;&#x7A6;) by the Maldivians, found on many of the atolls. Some of his archaeological discoveries of stone figures and carvings from pre-Islamic civilizations are today exhibited in a side room of the small <!--del_lnk--> National Museum in Male&#39;.<p>Heyerdahl&#39;s research indicates that as early as <!--del_lnk--> 2000 BC, Maldives lay on the maritime trading routes of early <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">Egyptian</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Mesopotamian, and <!--del_lnk--> Indus Valley <a href="../../wp/c/Civilization.htm" title="Civilization">civilizations</a>. Heyerdahl believes that early sun-worshipping seafarers, called the Redin, first settled on the islands. This was evident then in many <a href="../../wp/m/Mosque.htm" title="Mosque">mosques</a> facing the sun and not <a href="../../wp/m/Mecca.htm" title="Mecca">Mecca</a>, lending credence to this theory. Because building space and materials were scarce, successive cultures constructed their places of worship on the foundations of previous buildings. Heyerdahl thus surmises that these sun-facing mosques were built on the ancient foundations of the Redin culture temples. Heyerdahl&#39;s early mosques have now in large part been converted to face Mecca, as Islam gained solidarity in Maldives, in the earlier half of the modern Republic.<p>According to Maldivian legend, a <!--del_lnk--> Sinhalese prince named Koimala was stranded with his bride &mdash; daughter of the king of <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> &mdash; in a Maldivian <!--del_lnk--> lagoon and stayed on to rule as the first <a href="../../wp/s/Sultan.htm" title="Sultan">sultan</a> from the <!--del_lnk--> House of Theemuge. Prior to that Mal&eacute; had belonged to a group of people today known as the <!--del_lnk--> Giravaaru who claim ancestry from ancient Tamils (Tamilas).<p>The Maldivians followed <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> before they converted to Islam and the conversion is explained in a controversial mythological story about the demon <!--del_lnk--> Rannamaari.<p>Over the centuries, the islands have been visited and their development influenced by <!--del_lnk--> sailors from countries on the <!--del_lnk--> Arabian Sea and the <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Ocean.htm" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> <!--del_lnk--> littorals. <!--del_lnk--> Mappila <!--del_lnk--> pirates from the <!--del_lnk--> Malabar Coast &mdash; present-day <a href="../../wp/k/Kerala.htm" title="Kerala">Kerala</a> state in India &mdash; harassed the islands.<p>Although governed as an independent <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islamic</a> <!--del_lnk--> sultanate for most of its history from <!--del_lnk--> 1153 to <!--del_lnk--> 1968, Maldives was a British protectorate from <!--del_lnk--> 1887 until <!--del_lnk--> July 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1965. In <!--del_lnk--> 1953, there was a brief, abortive attempt to form a <!--del_lnk--> republic, but the sultanate was re-imposed. In 1959, objecting to <!--del_lnk--> Nasir&#39;s changes, the inhabitants of the three southernmost atolls protested against the government. They formed the <!--del_lnk--> United Suvadive Republic and elected a president, <!--del_lnk--> Abdulla Afeef Didi.<p>After independence from Britain in 1965, the sultanate continued to operate for another three years. On <!--del_lnk--> November 11, <!--del_lnk--> 1968, it was abolished and replaced by a republic, and the country assumed its present name. Tourism and fishing are now being developed on the <!--del_lnk--> archipelago.<p>In November <!--del_lnk--> 1988, <a href="../../wp/t/Tamil_people.htm" title="Tamil people">Tamil</a> mercenaries from Sri Lanka invaded the Maldives. After an appeal by the Maldivian government for help, India launched a <!--del_lnk--> military campaign to throw the mercenaries out of Maldives. On the night of <!--del_lnk--> November 3, <!--del_lnk--> 1988, the <!--del_lnk--> Indian Air Force airlifted a parachute battalion group from <!--del_lnk--> Agra and flew them non-stop over 2,000 kilometres (1,240&nbsp;mi) to Maldives. The Indian <!--del_lnk--> paratroopers landed at <!--del_lnk--> Hulule and secured the airfield and restored the Government rule at Mal&eacute; within hours. The brief, bloodless operation, labelled <i><!--del_lnk--> Operation Cactus</i>, also involved the <!--del_lnk--> Indian Navy.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 26 December <!--del_lnk--> 2004 the <!--del_lnk--> Maldives were devastated by a <a href="../../wp/t/Tsunami.htm" title="Tsunami">tsunami</a> following the <a href="../../wp/2/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake.htm" title="2004 Indian Ocean earthquake">2004 Indian Ocean earthquake</a>. The absence of land mass against which <a href="../../wp/w/Wave.htm" title="Wave">waves</a> could be built up reduced the destructive impact, preventing the waves from reaching much more than 1.2 - 1.5 meters (4&ndash;5&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ft) in height <!--del_lnk--> . Despite this, the archipelago&#39;s low lying nature (one of the lowest lying countries on Earth) meant that nearly all of the country was swamped. At least seventy-five people perished, including six foreigners.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Current GDP per capita of Maldives registered a peak growth of 26.5% in the 1980s and stabilised around 11.5% in the 1990s.<p>Tourism and Fisheries form the two key components of Maldivian economy. The country&#39;s shipping, banking and manufacturing sectors are also growing at a considerable pace. Among the South Asian nations, Maldives has the second highest per-capita GDP at 3,900&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> USD (2002 figure). Major trading partners include <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Malaysia.htm" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>.<p><a id="Fisheries" name="Fisheries"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Fisheries</span></h3>
      <p>The Maldivian economy was entirely dependent on <a href="../../wp/f/Fishing.htm" title="Fishing">fishing</a> and other <a href="../../wp/o/Ocean.htm" title="Ocean">marine</a> products for many centuries. Fishing remains the main occupation of the people and the government gives special priority to the development of the fisheries sector.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> mechanization of the traditional fishing boat called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Dhoni&quot; in <!--del_lnk--> 1974 was a major milestone in the development of the fisheries industry and the country&#39;s economy in general. A fish canning plant was installed in the island of <!--del_lnk--> Felivaru in <!--del_lnk--> 1977, as a joint venture with a Japanese firm. In 1979, a Fisheries Advisory Board was set up with the mandate of advising the government on policy guidelines for the overall development of the fisheries sector. Manpower development programs were begun in the early <!--del_lnk--> 1980s, and fisheries education was incorporated into the school curriculum. Fish aggregating devices and navigational aids were located at various strategic points. Moreover, the opening up of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of Maldives for fisheries has further enhanced the growth of the fisheries sector. Today, fisheries contribute over fifteen percent of the <!--del_lnk--> GDP and engage about thirty percent of the country&#39;s work force. It is also the second-largest foreign exchange earner after <a href="#Tourism" title="">tourism</a>.<p><a id="Tourism" name="Tourism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Tourism</span></h3>

The code has been written and awaits action by the parliament.<p><a id="Maldives_and_the_Indian_Ocean_Commission" name="Maldives_and_the_Indian_Ocean_Commission"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Maldives and the Indian Ocean Commission</span></h3>
      <p>Since 1996, Maldives has been the official progress monitor of the <!--del_lnk--> Indian Ocean Commission. In 2002, Maldives applied for full membership, but was refused. The first reason they were rejected is that their geographical position is different from other member states. Maldives are considered in Asia instead of Africa. The other reason was more complicated. The official language spoken by the Commission was French with Creole used in friendly conversations. Maldives speak English and a language totally unrelated to the other members. It was proposed to change the language to English, which the people of Reunion, Comoros and Mayotte do not speak, and so the idea was dropped. The third reason was due to the difference in historic background. However, Maldives were given a more important role and semi-membership.<p><a id="Administrative_Divisions" name="Administrative_Divisions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Administrative Divisions</span></h2>

      <p>Maldives has twenty-six natural <!--del_lnk--> atolls which have been divided into twenty administrative atolls and one city. <!--del_lnk-->  The northern most atoll is <!--del_lnk--> Haa Alif Atoll and the southern most is <!--del_lnk--> Seenu Atoll. The smallest atoll is <!--del_lnk--> Gnaviyani Atoll with only one island (<!--del_lnk--> the largest island in Maldives). The largest atoll in both Maldives and the whole world is <!--del_lnk--> Gaafu Alif Atoll which is just south of the <!--del_lnk--> One and a Half Degree Channel.<p>Each atoll is administered by an Atoll Chief (Atholhu Veriyaa) appointed by the President (Maumoon Abdul Gayoom). Atoll chiefs administer as directed by the president. The Ministry of Atoll Administration and its Northern and Southern Regional Offices, Atoll Offices and Island Offices are collectively responsible to the President for Atolls Administration. The administrative head of each island is the Island <!--del_lnk--> Chief (Katheeb), appointed by the President. The Island Chief&#39;s immediate superior is the Atoll Chief.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>Maldives holds the record for being the flattest country in the world, with a maximum natural ground level of only 2.3&nbsp;m (7&frac12;&nbsp;ft), though in areas where construction exists this has been increased to several metres. Over the last century, <!--del_lnk--> sea levels have risen about twenty centimeters (8&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> in). The ocean is likely to continue rising and this threatens the existence of Maldives.<p>A <a href="../../wp/t/Tsunami.htm" title="Tsunami">tsunami</a> in the Indian Ocean caused by the <a href="../../wp/2/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake.htm" title="2004 Indian Ocean earthquake">2004 Indian Ocean earthquake</a> caused parts of Maldives to be covered by sea water and left many people homeless. After the disaster, <!--del_lnk--> cartographers are planning to redraw the maps of the islands due to alterations by the tsunami. The people and government are worried that Maldives could be wiped from the map eventually.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>The Maldivian ethnic identity is a blend of the cultures reflecting the peoples who settled on the islands, reinforced by religion and language. The earliest settlers were probably from Southern India. <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Aryan speakers followed them from Sri Lanka in the <a href="../../wp/4/4th_century.htm" title="4th century">fourth</a> and <a href="../../wp/5/5th_century.htm" title="5th century">fifth centuries</a>. In the <a href="../../wp/1/12th_century.htm" title="12th century">12th century</a>, sailors from the Malayan Archipelago, East <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Arab countries inhabited the islands, creating the present heterogeneous blend of ethnicity amongst Maldivians.<p>Originally Buddhist<!--del_lnk--> , Maldivians were converted to <!--del_lnk--> Sunni <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> in the mid-12th century. Islam is the official <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religion</a> of the entire population, as adherence to it is required for citizenship.<p>The official and common language is <!--del_lnk--> Dhivehi, an Indo-European language related to <!--del_lnk--> Sinhalese, the language of Sri Lanka. The written script is called <!--del_lnk--> Thaana and is written from right to left. <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> is used widely in <!--del_lnk--> commerce and increasingly as the medium of instruction in government <!--del_lnk--> schools.<p>Some social stratification along lines similar to the <!--del_lnk--> Indian caste system exists on the islands. It is not rigid, since rank is based on varied factors, including occupation, wealth, Islamic virtue, and family ties. Members of the social elite are concentrated in Mal&eacute;. Outside of the service industry, this is the only location where the foreign and domestic populations are likely to interact. The tourist resorts are not on islands where the natives live, and casual contacts between the two groups are discouraged.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldives&quot;</div>
