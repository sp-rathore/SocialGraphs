      <p><b>Mathematics</b> (<!--del_lnk--> colloquially, <b>maths</b>, or <b>math</b> in <a href="../../wp/a/American_English.htm" title="American English">American English</a>) is the body of knowledge centered on concepts such as <a href="../../wp/q/Quantity.htm" title="Quantity">quantity</a>, <!--del_lnk--> structure, <!--del_lnk--> space, and <!--del_lnk--> change, and the academic discipline which studies them; <!--del_lnk--> Benjamin Peirce called it &quot;the science that draws necessary conclusions&quot;. It evolved, through the use of <!--del_lnk--> abstraction and <a href="../../wp/l/Logic.htm" title="Logic">logical</a> <!--del_lnk--> reasoning, from <!--del_lnk--> counting, <!--del_lnk--> calculation, <a href="../../wp/m/Measurement.htm" title="Measurement">measurement</a>, and the study of the <!--del_lnk--> shapes and <a href="../../wp/m/Motion_%2528physics%2529.htm" title="Motion (physics)">motions</a> of physical objects. <!--del_lnk--> Mathematicians explore such concepts, aiming to formulate new <!--del_lnk--> conjectures and establish their truth by <!--del_lnk--> rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen <!--del_lnk--> axioms and <!--del_lnk--> definitions.<p>Knowledge and use of basic mathematics have always been an inherent and integral part of individual and group life. Refinements of the basic ideas are visible in ancient mathematical texts originating in <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">ancient Egypt</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Mesopotamia.htm" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Ancient India, and <!--del_lnk--> Ancient China, with increased rigour later introduced by the <!--del_lnk--> ancient Greeks.

The application of mathematics to such fields, often dubbed <a href="../../wp/a/Applied_mathematics.htm" title="Applied mathematics">applied mathematics</a>, inspires and makes use of new mathematical discoveries and has sometimes led to the development of entirely new disciplines. Mathematicians also engage in <!--del_lnk--> pure mathematics for its own sake without having any practical application in mind, although applications for what begins as pure mathematics are often discovered later.<p>

      <p>The word &quot;mathematics&quot; (Greek: &mu;&alpha;&theta;&eta;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#x3AC;) comes from the <!--del_lnk--> Greek &mu;&#x3AC;&theta;&eta;&mu;&alpha; (<i>m&aacute;th&#x113;ma</i>), which means <i>learning</i>, <i>study</i>, <i>science</i>, and additionally came to have the narrower and more technical meaning &quot;mathematical study&quot;, even in Classical times. Its adjective is &mu;&alpha;&theta;&eta;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#x3CC;&sigmaf; (<i>math&#x113;matik&oacute;s</i>), <i>related to learning</i>, or <i>studious</i>, which likewise further came to mean <i>mathematical</i>. In particular, <span class="polytonic" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&mu;&alpha;&theta;&eta;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#x1F74; &tau;&#x3AD;&chi;&nu;&eta;</span> (<i>math&#x113;matik&#x1E17; t&eacute;khn&#x113;</i>), in <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>ars mathematica</i>, meant <i>the mathematical art</i>. The apparent plural form in <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a>, like the <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a> plural form <i>les math&eacute;matiques</i> (and the less commonly used singular derivative <i>la math&eacute;matique</i>), goes back to the Latin neuter plural <i>mathematica</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Cicero), based on the Greek plural &tau;&alpha; &mu;&alpha;&theta;&eta;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#x3AC; (<i>ta math&#x113;matik&aacute;</i>), used by <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, and meaning roughly &quot;all things mathematical&quot;.<p>Despite the form and etymology, the word <i>mathematics</i>, like the names of arts and sciences in general, is used as a singular <!--del_lnk--> mass noun in English today. The colloquial English-language shortened forms perpetuate this singular/plural idiosyncrasy, as the word is shortened to <i>math</i> in <!--del_lnk--> North American English, while it is <i>maths</i> elsewhere (including <a href="../../wp/b/British_English.htm" title="British English">Britain</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Ireland, <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a> and other <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth countries).<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>The evolution of mathematics might be seen to be an ever-increasing series of <!--del_lnk--> abstractions, or alternatively an expansion of subject matter. The first abstraction was probably that of <a href="../../wp/n/Number.htm" title="Number">numbers</a>. The realization that two apples and two oranges have something in common was a breakthrough in human thought. In addition to recognizing how to <!--del_lnk--> count <i>physical</i> objects, <!--del_lnk--> prehistoric peoples also recognized how to count <i>abstract</i> quantities, like <a href="../../wp/t/Time.htm" title="Time">time</a> &mdash; <a href="../../wp/d/Day.htm" title="Day">days</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Season.htm" title="Season">seasons</a>, <!--del_lnk--> years. <a href="../../wp/a/Arithmetic.htm" title="Arithmetic">Arithmetic</a> (<!--del_lnk--> addition, <!--del_lnk--> subtraction, <!--del_lnk--> multiplication and <!--del_lnk--> division), naturally followed. Monolithic monuments testify to knowledge of <a href="../../wp/g/Geometry.htm" title="Geometry">geometry</a>.<p>Further steps need <a href="../../wp/w/Writing.htm" title="Writing">writing</a> or some other system for recording numbers such as <!--del_lnk--> tallies or the knotted strings called <!--del_lnk--> quipu used by the <!--del_lnk--> Inca empire to store numerical data. <!--del_lnk--> Numeral systems have been many and diverse.<p>From the beginnings of recorded history, the major disciplines within mathematics arose out of the need to do calculations relating to <!--del_lnk--> taxation and <!--del_lnk--> commerce, to understand the relationships among numbers, to <!--del_lnk--> measure land, and to predict <a href="../../wp/a/Astronomy.htm" title="Astronomy">astronomical events</a>. These needs can be roughly related to the broad subdivision of mathematics, into the studies of <i>quantity</i>, <i>structure</i>, <i>space</i>, and <i>change</i>.<p>Mathematics has since been greatly extended, and there has been a fruitful interaction between mathematics and science, to the benefit of both. Mathematical discoveries have been made throughout history and continue to be made today. According to Mikhail B. Sevryuk, in the January 2006 issue of the <!--del_lnk--> Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, &quot;The number of papers and books included in the <!--del_lnk--> Mathematical Reviews database since 1940 (the first year of operation of MR) is now more than 1.9 million, and more than 75 thousand items are added to the database each year. The overwhelming majority of works in this ocean contain new mathematical <!--del_lnk--> theorems and their <!--del_lnk--> proofs.&quot;<p>

      <p>Mathematics arises wherever there are difficult problems that involve quantity, structure, space, or change. At first these were found in <!--del_lnk--> commerce, <!--del_lnk--> land measurement and later <a href="../../wp/a/Astronomy.htm" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a>; nowadays, all sciences suggest problems studied by mathematicians, and many problems arise within mathematics itself. <a href="../../wp/i/Isaac_Newton.htm" title="Isaac Newton">Newton</a> was one of the <!--del_lnk--> infinitesimal calculus inventors, <!--del_lnk--> Feynman invented the <!--del_lnk--> Feynman path integral using a combination of reasoning and physical insight, and today&#39;s <a href="../../wp/s/String_theory.htm" title="String theory">string theory</a> also inspires new mathematics. Some mathematics is only relevant in the area that inspired it, and is applied to solve further problems in that area. But often mathematics inspired by one area proves useful in many areas, and joins the general stock of mathematical concepts. The remarkable fact that even the &quot;purest&quot; mathematics often turns out to have practical applications is what <!--del_lnk--> Eugene Wigner has called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.&quot;<p>As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization in mathematics. One major distinction is between <!--del_lnk--> pure mathematics and <a href="../../wp/a/Applied_mathematics.htm" title="Applied mathematics">applied mathematics</a>. Several areas of applied mathematics have merged with related traditions outside of mathematics and become disciplines in their own right, including <a href="../../wp/s/Statistics.htm" title="Statistics">statistics</a>, <!--del_lnk--> operations research, and <a href="../../wp/c/Computer_science.htm" title="Computer science">computer science</a>.<p>Many mathematicians talk about the <i>elegance</i> of mathematics, its intrinsic <a href="../../wp/a/Aesthetics.htm" title="Aesthetics">aesthetics</a> and inner <!--del_lnk--> beauty. <!--del_lnk--> Simplicity and <!--del_lnk--> generality are valued. There is beauty also in a clever proof, such as <a href="../../wp/e/Euclid.htm" title="Euclid">Euclid</a>&#39;s proof that there are infinitely many <a href="../../wp/p/Prime_number.htm" title="Prime number">prime numbers</a>, and in a numerical method that speeds calculation, such as the <!--del_lnk--> fast Fourier transform. <!--del_lnk--> G. H. Hardy in <i><!--del_lnk--> A Mathematician&#39;s Apology</i> expressed the belief that these aesthetic considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics.<p><a id="Notation.2C_language.2C_and_rigor" name="Notation.2C_language.2C_and_rigor"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Notation, language, and rigor</span></h2>

      <p>Most of the mathematical notation we use today was not invented until the <a href="../../wp/1/16th_century.htm" title="16th century">16th century</a>. Before that, mathematics was written out in words, a painstaking process that limited mathematical discovery. Modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional, but beginners often find it daunting. It is extremely compressed: a few symbols contain a great deal of information. Like musical notation, modern mathematical notation has a strict syntax and encodes information that would be difficult to write in any other way.<p>Mathematical <a href="../../wp/l/Language.htm" title="Language">language</a> also is hard for beginners. Words such as <i>or</i> and <i>only</i> have more precise meanings than in everyday speech. Also confusing to beginners, words such as <i><!--del_lnk--> open</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> field</i> have been given specialized mathematical meanings. <!--del_lnk--> Mathematical jargon includes technical terms such as <i><!--del_lnk--> homeomorphism</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> integrable</i>. It was said that <!--del_lnk--> Henri Poincar&eacute; was only elected to the <!--del_lnk--> Acad&eacute;mie fran&ccedil;aise so that he could tell them how to define <i><!--del_lnk--> automorphe</i> in their dictionary. But there is a reason for special notation and technical jargon: mathematics requires more precision than everyday speech. Mathematicians refer to this precision of language and logic as &quot;rigor&quot;.<p><!--del_lnk--> Rigor is fundamentally a matter of <!--del_lnk--> mathematical proof. Mathematicians want their theorems to follow from axioms by means of systematic reasoning. This is to avoid mistaken &quot;<!--del_lnk--> theorems&quot;, based on fallible intuitions, of which many instances have occurred in the history of the subject. The level of rigor expected in mathematics has varied over time: the Greeks expected detailed arguments, but at the time of <a href="../../wp/i/Isaac_Newton.htm" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a> the methods employed were less rigorous. Problems inherent in the definitions used by Newton would lead to a resurgence of careful analysis and formal proof in the 19th century. Today, mathematicians continue to argue among themselves about <!--del_lnk--> computer-assisted proofs. Since large computations are hard to verify, such proofs may not be sufficiently rigorous.<p><!--del_lnk--> Axioms in traditional thought were &quot;self-evident truths&quot;, but that conception is problematic. At a formal level, an axiom is just a string of <!--del_lnk--> symbols, which has an intrinsic meaning only in the context of all derivable formulas of an <!--del_lnk--> axiomatic system. It was the goal of <!--del_lnk--> Hilbert&#39;s program to put all of mathematics on a firm axiomatic basis, but according to <!--del_lnk--> G&ouml;del&#39;s incompleteness theorem every (sufficiently powerful) axiomatic system has <!--del_lnk--> undecidable formulas; and so a final <!--del_lnk--> axiomatization of mathematics is impossible. Nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be (as far as its formal content) nothing but <!--del_lnk--> set theory in some axiomatization, in the sense that every mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory.<p><a id="Mathematics_as_science" name="Mathematics_as_science"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Mathematics as science</span></h2>

      <p><a href="../../wp/c/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss.htm" title="Carl Friedrich Gauss">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a> referred to mathematics as &quot;the Queen of the Sciences&quot;. In the original Latin <i>Regina Scientiarum</i>, as well as in <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a> <i>K&ouml;nigin der Wissenschaften</i>, the word corresponding to <i>science</i> means (field of) knowledge. Indeed, this is also the original meaning in English, and there is no doubt that mathematics is in this sense a science. The specialization restricting the meaning to <i>natural</i> science is of later date. If one considers <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">science</a> to be strictly about the physical world, then mathematics, or at least <!--del_lnk--> pure mathematics, is not a science. <a href="../../wp/a/Albert_Einstein.htm" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> has stated that <i>&quot;as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.</i>&quot;<p>Many philosophers believe that mathematics is not experimentally <!--del_lnk--> falsifiable, and thus not a science according to the definition of <a href="../../wp/k/Karl_Popper.htm" title="Karl Popper">Karl Popper</a>. However, in the 1930s important work in mathematical logic showed that mathematics cannot be reduced to logic, and Karl Popper concluded that &quot;most mathematical theories are, like those of physics and biology, hypothetico-deductive: pure mathematics therefore turns out to be much closer to the natural sciences whose hypotheses are conjectures, than it seemed even recently.&quot; Other thinkers, notably <!--del_lnk--> Imre Lakatos, have applied a version of falsificationism to mathematics itself.<p>An alternative view is that certain scientific fields (such as <!--del_lnk--> theoretical physics) are mathematics with axioms that are intended to correspond to reality. In fact, the theoretical physicist, J. M. Ziman, proposed that science is <i>public knowledge</i> and thus includes mathematics. In any case, mathematics shares much in common with many fields in the physical sciences, notably the exploration of the logical consequences of assumptions. <!--del_lnk--> Intuition and <!--del_lnk--> experimentation also play a role in the formulation of <!--del_lnk--> conjectures in both mathematics and the (other) sciences. <!--del_lnk--> Experimental mathematics continues to grow in importance within mathematics, and computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and mathematics, weakening the objection that mathematics does not use the <!--del_lnk--> scientific method. In his 2002 book <i><!--del_lnk--> A New Kind of Science</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Stephen Wolfram argues that computational mathematics deserves to be explored empirically as a scientific field in its own right.<p>The opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied. While some in <a href="../../wp/a/Applied_mathematics.htm" title="Applied mathematics">applied mathematics</a> feel that they are scientists, those in pure mathematics often feel that they are working in an area more akin to <a href="../../wp/l/Logic.htm" title="Logic">logic</a> and that they are, hence, fundamentally <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosophers</a>. Many mathematicians feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of its aesthetic side, and its history in the traditional seven <!--del_lnk--> liberal arts; others feel that to ignore its connection to the sciences is to turn a blind eye to the fact that the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and <a href="../../wp/e/Engineering.htm" title="Engineering">engineering</a> has driven much development in mathematics. One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is <i>created</i> (as in art) or <i>discovered</i> (as in science). It is common to see <a href="../../wp/u/University.htm" title="University">universities</a> divided into sections that include a division of <i>Science and Mathematics</i>, indicating that the fields are seen as being allied but that they do not coincide. In practice, mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists at the gross level but separated at finer levels. This is one of many issues considered in the <!--del_lnk--> philosophy of mathematics.<p>Mathematical awards are generally kept separate from their equivalents in science. The most prestigious award in mathematics is the <!--del_lnk--> Fields&nbsp;Medal, established in 1936 and now awarded every 4 years. It is usually considered the equivalent of science&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Nobel prize. Another major international award, the <!--del_lnk--> Abel Prize, was introduced in 2003. Both of these are awarded for a particular body of work, either innovation in a new area of mathematics or resolution of an outstanding problem in an established field. A famous list of 23 such open problems, called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Hilbert&#39;s problems&quot;, was compiled in 1900 by German mathematician <a href="../../wp/d/David_Hilbert.htm" title="David Hilbert">David Hilbert</a>. This list achieved great celebrity among mathematicians, and at least nine of the problems have now been solved. A new list of seven important problems, titled the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Millennium Prize Problems&quot;, was published in 2000. Solution of each of these problems carries a $1 million reward, and only one (the <!--del_lnk--> Riemann hypothesis) is duplicated in Hilbert&#39;s problems.<p><a id="Fields_of_mathematics" name="Fields_of_mathematics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Fields of mathematics</span></h2>

These four needs can be roughly related to the broad subdivision of mathematics into the study of quantity, structure, space, and change (i.e., <a href="../../wp/a/Arithmetic.htm" title="Arithmetic">arithmetic</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Algebra.htm" title="Algebra">algebra</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Geometry.htm" title="Geometry">geometry</a>, and <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematical_analysis.htm" title="Mathematical analysis">analysis</a>). In addition to these main concerns, there are also subdivisions dedicated to exploring links from the heart of mathematics to other fields: to <!--del_lnk--> logic, to <!--del_lnk--> set theory (<!--del_lnk--> foundations), to the empirical mathematics of the various sciences (<a href="../../wp/a/Applied_mathematics.htm" title="Applied mathematics">applied mathematics</a>), and more recently to the rigorous study of <!--del_lnk--> uncertainty.<p><a id="Quantity" name="Quantity"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Quantity</span></h3>
      <p>The study of quantity starts with <a href="../../wp/n/Number.htm" title="Number">numbers</a>, first the familiar <!--del_lnk--> natural numbers and <!--del_lnk--> integers (&quot;whole numbers&quot;) and arithmetical operations on them, which are characterized in <a href="../../wp/a/Arithmetic.htm" title="Arithmetic">arithmetic</a>. The deeper properties of integers are studied in <!--del_lnk--> number theory, whence such popular results as <!--del_lnk--> Fermat&#39;s last theorem. Number theory also holds two widely-considered unsolved problems: the <!--del_lnk--> twin prime conjecture and <!--del_lnk--> Goldbach&#39;s conjecture.<p>As the number system is further developed, the integers are recognised as a <!--del_lnk--> subset of the <!--del_lnk--> rational numbers (&quot;fractions&quot;). These, in turn, are contained within the <!--del_lnk--> real numbers, which are used to represent continuous quantities. Real numbers are generalised to <!--del_lnk--> complex numbers. These are the first steps of a hierarchy of numbers that goes on to include <!--del_lnk--> quarternions and <!--del_lnk--> octonions. Consideration of the natural numbers also leads to the <!--del_lnk--> transfinite numbers, which formalise the concept of counting to infinite. Another area of study is size, which leads to the <!--del_lnk--> cardinal numbers and then to another conception of infinity: the <!--del_lnk--> aleph numbers, which allow meaningful comparison of the size of infinitely large sets.<dl>

      <p>Many mathematical objects, such as <a href="../../wp/s/Set.htm" title="Set">sets</a> of numbers and <!--del_lnk--> functions, exhibit internal structure. The structural properties of these objects are investigated in the study of <a href="../../wp/g/Group_%2528mathematics%2529.htm" title="Group (mathematics)">groups</a>, <!--del_lnk--> rings, <!--del_lnk--> fields and other abstract systems, which are themselves such objects. This is the field of <!--del_lnk--> abstract algebra. An important concept here is that of <!--del_lnk--> vectors, generalized to <!--del_lnk--> vector spaces, and studied in <a href="../../wp/l/Linear_algebra.htm" title="Linear algebra">linear algebra</a>. The study of vectors combines three of the fundamental areas of mathematics: quantity, structure, and space. <!--del_lnk--> Vector calculus expands the field into a fourth fundamental area, that of change.<dl>

      <p>Understanding and describing change is a common theme in the <!--del_lnk--> natural sciences, and <a href="../../wp/c/Calculus.htm" title="Calculus">calculus</a> was developed as a powerful tool to investigate it. <!--del_lnk--> Functions arise here, as a central concept describing a changing quantity.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Discrete mathematics is the common name for the fields of mathematics most generally useful in <!--del_lnk--> theoretical computer science. This includes <!--del_lnk--> computability theory, <!--del_lnk--> computational complexity theory, and <!--del_lnk--> information theory. Computability theory examines the limitations of various theoretical models of the computer, including the most powerful known model - the <!--del_lnk--> Turing machine. Complexity theory is the study of tractability by computer; some problems, although theoretically soluble by computer, are so expensive in terms of time or space that solving them is likely to remain practically unfeasible, even with rapid advance of computer hardware. Finally, information theory is concerned with the amount of data that can be stored on a given medium, and hence concepts such as <!--del_lnk--> compression and <!--del_lnk--> entropy.<p>As a relatively new field, discrete mathematics has a number of fundamental open problems. The most famous of these is the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> P=NP?&quot; problem, one of the <!--del_lnk--> Millennium Prize Problems.  It is widely believed that the answer to this problem is no. <dl>

      <p>Mathematics is not a closed intellectual system, in which everything has already been worked out. There is no shortage of open problems.<p><!--del_lnk--> Pseudomathematics is a form of mathematics-like activity undertaken outside <!--del_lnk--> academia, and occasionally by mathematicians themselves. It often consists of determined attacks on famous questions, consisting of proof-attempts made in an isolated way (that is, long papers not supported by previously published theory). The relationship to generally-accepted mathematics is similar to that between <!--del_lnk--> pseudoscience and real science. The misconceptions involved are normally based on:<ul>
       <li>misunderstanding of the implications of <!--del_lnk--> mathematical rigor;<li>attempts to circumvent the usual criteria for publication of <!--del_lnk--> mathematical papers in a <!--del_lnk--> learned journal after <!--del_lnk--> peer review, often in the belief that the journal is biased against the author;<li>lack of familiarity with, and therefore underestimation of, the existing literature.</ul>
      <p>The case of <!--del_lnk--> Kurt Heegner&#39;s work shows that the mathematical establishment is neither infallible, nor unwilling to admit error in assessing &#39;amateur&#39; work. And like <a href="../../wp/a/Astronomy.htm" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a>, mathematics owes much to amateur contributors such as <!--del_lnk--> Fermat and <!--del_lnk--> Mersenne.<p><a id="Relationship_between_mathematics_and_physical_reality" name="Relationship_between_mathematics_and_physical_reality"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Relationship between mathematics and physical reality</span></h3>
      <p>Mathematical concepts and theorems need not correspond to anything in the physical world. Insofar as a correspondence does exist, while mathematicians and physicists may select axioms and postulates that seem reasonable and intuitive, it is not necessary for the basic assumptions within an axiomatic system to be true in an empirical or physical sense.<p>Thus, while most systems of axioms are derived from our perceptions and experiments, they are not dependent on them. Nevertheless, mathematics remains extremely useful for solving real-world problems. This fact led Eugene Wigner to write an essay, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences</i>.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics&quot;</div>
