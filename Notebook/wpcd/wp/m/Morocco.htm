      <p>The area of modern Morocco has been inhabited since <!--del_lnk--> Neolithic times, at least 8000 BCE, as attested by signs of the <!--del_lnk--> Capsian culture, in a time when the <a href="../../wp/m/Maghreb.htm" title="Maghreb">Maghreb</a> was less arid than it is today. Many theorists believe the <a href="../../wp/b/Berber_languages.htm" title="Berber languages">Berber language</a> probably arrived at roughly the same time as agriculture (see <!--del_lnk--> Berber), and was adopted by the existing population as well as the immigrants that brought it. Modern genetic analyses have confirmed that various populations have contributed to the present-day population, including (in addition to the main Berber and Arab groups) <!--del_lnk--> Phoenicians, <!--del_lnk--> Sephardic <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jew">Jews</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> sub-Saharan <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africans</a>. The Berbers, often referred to in modern ethnic activist circles as &quot;Amazigh,&quot; are more commonly known as &quot;Berber&quot; or by their regional ethnic identity, such as <!--del_lnk--> Chleuh. In the classical period, Morocco was known as <!--del_lnk--> Mauretania, although this should not be confused with the modern country of <a href="../../wp/m/Mauritania.htm" title="Mauritania">Mauritania</a>.<p><a id="Roman_and_sub-Roman_Morocco" name="Roman_and_sub-Roman_Morocco"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Roman and sub-Roman Morocco</span></h3>
      <p>North Africa and Morocco were slowly drawn into the wider emerging <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> world by Phoenician trading colonies and settlements in the late Classical period. The arrival of Phoenicians heralded a long engagement with the wider Mediterranean, as this strategic region formed part of the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>, as <!--del_lnk--> Mauretania Tingitana. In the <a href="../../wp/5/5th_century.htm" title="5th century">fifth century</a>, as the Roman Empire declined, the region fell to the <!--del_lnk--> Vandals, <!--del_lnk--> Visigoths, and then <a href="../../wp/b/Byzantine_Empire.htm" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Greeks</a> in rapid succession. During this time, however, the high mountains of most of modern Morocco remained unsubdued, and stayed in the hands of their Berber inhabitants.<p><a id="Early_Islamic_Morocco" name="Early_Islamic_Morocco"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early Islamic Morocco</span></h3>
      <p>By the <a href="../../wp/7/7th_century.htm" title="7th century">seventh century</a>, Arab expansion was at its greatest. In 670 AD, that the first Arab invasions of the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Africa.htm" title="North Africa">North African</a> coastal plain took place under <!--del_lnk--> Uqba ibn Nafi, a general serving under the <!--del_lnk--> Umayyads of <a href="../../wp/d/Damascus.htm" title="Damascus">Damascus</a>. His army swept into what is now Morocco, which he called &quot;Maghreb al Aqsa&quot; or &quot;The Far West&quot;, in the year 683. The Arab invasion of Morocco faced strong resistance from local Berbers. After about a century of fierce battles with Berbers, the Arabs occupied Morocco.<p>The Arab-Muslim Calipahtes (i.e. <!--del_lnk--> Umayyads of <a href="../../wp/d/Damascus.htm" title="Damascus">Damascus</a> and the <a href="../../wp/a/Abbasid.htm" title="Abbasid">Abbasids</a> of <a href="../../wp/b/Baghdad.htm" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>) lost political influence over Morocco when the first Arab dynasty in the country, the <!--del_lnk--> Idrisid, cut ties with the <a href="../../wp/a/Abbasid.htm" title="Abbasid">Abbasid</a> Caliphate in <a href="../../wp/b/Baghdad.htm" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Umayyad rule in <!--del_lnk--> Al-Andalus. After the reign of the Idrisids, Arabs lost political control within Morocco. After adopting Islam, several Berber dynasties formed their own Islamic dynasties and reigned over the country. This situation lasted until the Arab <!--del_lnk--> Saadi dynasty took over in the 16th century.<p>What became modern Morocco in the seventh century, was the area invaded by the Arabs, who brought their customs, culture, and <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a>, to which most of the Berbers converted, forming states such as the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Nekor. The country soon broke away from the control of the distant <a href="../../wp/a/Abbasid.htm" title="Abbasid">Abbasid</a> caliphs in <a href="../../wp/b/Baghdad.htm" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> under <!--del_lnk--> Idris ibn Abdallah who founded the <!--del_lnk--> Idrisid Dynasty. The Idrisids established Fez as their capital and Morocco became a centre of learning and a major regional power.<p>Morocco would reach its height under a series of Berber origin dynasties that would replace the Arab Idrisids. First the <!--del_lnk--> Almoravids, then the <!--del_lnk--> Almohads would see Morocco rule most of Northwest Africa, as well as large sections of Islamic <!--del_lnk--> Iberia, or <!--del_lnk--> Al-Andalus. Under Islamic rule, Spanish cities such as Sevilla and Granada were places where the citizenry prospered under a tolerant rule which also focused on scholarly advances in science, mathematics, astronomy, geography as well as medicine.<p>However, Islamic rule in the <!--del_lnk--> Iberian Peninsula ended with the fall of <!--del_lnk--> Granada to the forces of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella. Under the Catholic Inquisition, troops pillaged Granada amongst other Islamic cities and persecuted its citizens, Muslims and Jewish. Rather than face persecution and possible execution, many Muslims and Jews fled to Morocco. The Inquisitors, eager to abolish any trace of <!--del_lnk--> Islamic culture, destroyed the libraries in Muslim Spain, where thousands of priceless texts were kept.<p>Smaller states of the region, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Berghouata and <!--del_lnk--> Banu Isam, were conquered. The empire collapsed, however, with a long running series of <!--del_lnk--> civil wars.<p><a id="Morocco_1666-1912" name="Morocco_1666-1912"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Morocco 1666-1912</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Alaouite Dynasty eventually gained control. Morocco was facing aggression from <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> and the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> that was sweeping westward. The Alaouites succeeded in stabilizing their position, and while the kingdom was smaller than previous ones in the region it remained quite wealthy. In 1684, they annexed <!--del_lnk--> Tangier.<p>Morocco was the first nation, in 1777, to recognize the fledgling <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> as an independent nation. In the beginning of the <!--del_lnk--> American Revolution, American merchant ships were subject to attack by the <!--del_lnk--> Barbary Pirates while sailing the <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic ocean. At this time, American envoys tried to obtain protection from European powers, but to no avail. On December 20, 1777, Morocco&#39;s Sultan declared that the American merchant ships would be under the protection of the sultanate and could thus enjoy safe passage.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Moroccan-American Treaty of Friendship stands as the U.S.&#39;s oldest non-broken friendship <!--del_lnk--> treaty. Signed by <a href="../../wp/j/John_Adams.htm" title="John Adams">John Adams</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Jefferson.htm" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, it has been in continuous effect since 1786. After the organization of the American government under the Constitution, President George Washington wrote a now venerated letter to the Sultan Sidi Mohamed strengthening the ties between the two countries. The United States legation (consulate) in Tangier is the first property the American government ever owned abroad. The building now houses the <!--del_lnk--> Tangier American Legation Museum.<p><a id="European_influence" name="European_influence"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">European influence</span></h3>

After the <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleonic_Wars.htm" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, Egypt and the North African <a href="../../wp/m/Maghreb.htm" title="Maghreb">maghreb</a> became increasingly ungovernable from <a href="../../wp/i/Istanbul.htm" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, the resort of pirates under local <!--del_lnk--> beys, and as Europe industrialized, an increasingly prized potential for colonization. The Maghreb had far greater proven wealth than the unknown rest of Africa and a location of strategic importance affecting the exit from the Mediterranean. For the first time, Morocco became a state of some interest in itself to the European Powers. <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> showed a strong interest in Morocco as early as 1830. Recognition by the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> in 1904 of France&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> sphere of influence in Morocco provoked a German reaction; the crisis of June 1905 was resolved at the <!--del_lnk--> Algeciras Conference, <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> in 1906, which formalized France&#39;s &quot;special position&quot; and entrusted policing of Morocco to France and Spain jointly. A <!--del_lnk--> second Moroccan crisis provoked by <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin.htm" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>, increased tensions between European powers. The <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Fez (signed on <!--del_lnk--> March 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1912) made Morocco a <!--del_lnk--> protectorate of France. By the same treaty, <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> assumed the role of protecting power over the northern and southern <a href="../../wp/s/Sahara.htm" title="Sahara">Saharan</a> zones on <!--del_lnk--> November 27 that year.<p>Many Moroccan soldiers (<!--del_lnk--> Goumieres) who served in the <!--del_lnk--> French army assisted European and American troops in both <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> and <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>.<p><a id="Resistance" name="Resistance"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Resistance</span></h3>
      <p>Nationalist political parties, which subsequently arose under the French protectorate, based their arguments for Moroccan independence on such World War II declarations as the <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic Charter (a joint U.S.-British statement that set forth, among other things, the right of all people to choose the form of government under which they live). A manifesto of the <!--del_lnk--> Istiqlal Party (Independence party in English) in 1944 was one of the earliest public demands for independence. That party subsequently provided most of the leadership for the nationalist movement.<p>France&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> exile of <!--del_lnk--> Sultan Mohammed V in 1953 to <a href="../../wp/m/Madagascar.htm" title="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> and his replacement by the unpopular <!--del_lnk--> Mohammed Ben Aarafa, whose reign was perceived as illegitimate, sparked active opposition to the French protectorate all over the country. The most notable occurred in <!--del_lnk--> Oujda where Moroccans attacked French and other European residents in the streets. Operations by the newly created &quot;Arm&eacute;e de Lib&eacute;ration&quot;, were launched on <!--del_lnk--> October 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1955. &quot;L&#39;Arm&eacute;e de Lib&eacute;ration&quot; was created by &quot;Comit&eacute; de Lib&eacute;ration du Maghreb Arabe&quot; (Arab Maghreb Liberation Committee) in <a href="../../wp/c/Cairo.htm" title="Cairo">Cairo</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> to constitute a resistance movement against occupation like the <!--del_lnk--> National Liberation Front in <a href="../../wp/a/Algeria.htm" title="Algeria">Algeria</a>. Its goal was the return of King Mohammed V and the liberation of <a href="../../wp/a/Algeria.htm" title="Algeria">Algeria</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Tunisia.htm" title="Tunisia">Tunisia</a> as well. France allowed Mohammed V to return in 1955, and the negotiations that led to Moroccan independence began the following year.<p>All those events helped increase the degree of <!--del_lnk--> solidarity between the people and the newly returned king. For this reason, the revolution that Morocco knew was called &quot;la r&eacute;volution du Roi et du Peuple&quot; (The revolution of the King and the People) and it is celebrated every <!--del_lnk--> August 20.<p><a id="Independence" name="Independence"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Independence</span></h3>
      <p>Morocco recovered its political <!--del_lnk--> independence from France on <!--del_lnk--> March 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1956 and on <!--del_lnk--> April 7 France officially relinquished its protectorate. Through agreements with Spain in 1956 and 1958, Moroccan control over certain Spanish-ruled areas was restored, though attempts to claim other Spanish colonial possessions through <!--del_lnk--> military action were less successful. The internationalized city of <!--del_lnk--> Tangier was reintegrated with the signing of the <!--del_lnk--> Tangier Protocol on <!--del_lnk--> October 29, <!--del_lnk--> 1956 (see <!--del_lnk--> Tangier Crisis). <!--del_lnk--> Hassan II became King of Morocco on <!--del_lnk--> March 3, <!--del_lnk--> 1961. His rule would be marked by political unrest and the ruthless government response led by the <!--del_lnk--> Makhzen earned the period the name the <!--del_lnk--> &quot;Years of Lead&quot;. The Spanish <!--del_lnk--> enclave of <!--del_lnk--> Ifni in the south became part of the new Morocco in 1969. Morocco annexed <a href="../../wp/w/Western_Sahara.htm" title="Western Sahara">Western Sahara</a> during the 1970s, but final resolution on the status of the territory remains unresolved. (See <!--del_lnk--> History of Western Sahara.)<p>Tentative political reform in the 1990s resulted in the establishment of a bicameral legislature in 1997. Morocco was granted <!--del_lnk--> Major non-NATO ally status in June 2004 and signed <!--del_lnk--> free trade agreements with the United States and the European Union.<p>In 2003, Morocco&#39;s largest city, <!--del_lnk--> Casablanca suffered from <!--del_lnk--> terrorist attacks. The attacks were targeted against Western and Jewish places and left 33 civilians dead and more than 100 people injured, mostly Moroccans.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> November 18 2006, Morocco celebrated the 51st anniversary of its <!--del_lnk--> independence.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>

      <p>Morocco&#39;s history after independence and under the reign of <!--del_lnk--> Hassan II was marked by the period of the so-called <i><!--del_lnk--> Years of Lead</i>. Politically motivated persecutions and executions by the <!--del_lnk--> Makhzen were common.<p>However, under the reign of <!--del_lnk--> Mohammed VI, and with the launch of <!--del_lnk--> Equity and Reconciliation Commission (IER) to investigate into the atrocities, Morocco is trying to reconciliate with the victims. Many new laws and codes concerning all aspects of life are being launched. The most notable event was the creation of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Mudawana</i>- a family code which was the first unique initiative of its kind in the Arab and Muslim world. The code gives women more rights. Other issues such as the abolition of <!--del_lnk--> capital punishment are being debated; the <!--del_lnk--> Moroccan parliament is due to vote on the issue in spring 2007.<p>Despite improvements under Mohammed VI, international organisations continue raising criticism against the human rights situation in Morocco in general (i.e. arrests of suspected Islamist extremists during 2004 and 2005 related to <!--del_lnk--> 2003 Casablanca bombings), and in Western Sahara in particular. <p><a id="Administrative_divisions" name="Administrative_divisions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Administrative divisions</span></h2>

      <p>At 172,402&nbsp;sq.mi (446,550&nbsp;sq.km), Morocco is the fifty-seventh largest country in the world (after <a href="../../wp/u/Uzbekistan.htm" title="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a>).

To the north, Morocco is bordered by and controls part of the <!--del_lnk--> Strait of Gibraltar, giving it power over the waterways in and out of the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> sea. The <!--del_lnk--> Rif mountains occupy the region bordering the Mediterranean from the north-west to the north-east. The <!--del_lnk--> Atlas Mountains run down the backbone of the country, from the south west to the north east. Most of the south east portion of the country is in the <!--del_lnk--> Sahara Desert and as such is generally sparsely populated and unproductive economically. Most of the population lives to the north of these mountains, while to the south is the desert.

Most Moroccans are <!--del_lnk--> Sunni Muslims of Arab, Berber, or mixed Arab-Berber stock. About three-quarters of all present-day Moroccans are of Berber descent, while Arabs form the second largest ethnic group. The Arabs invaded Morocco in the seventh century and established their culture there. <!--del_lnk--> Morocco&#39;s Jewish minority has decreased significantly and numbers about 7,000 (see <!--del_lnk--> Jewish exodus from Arab lands). Most of the 100,000 foreign residents are French or Spanish; many are teachers or technicians and more and more retirees, especially in <!--del_lnk--> Marrakech.<p>There is no significant <a href="../../wp/g/Genetics.htm" title="Genetics">genetic</a> difference between Moroccan Arabs and Moroccan non-Arabs (i.e. Berbers and Saharawis). Thus, it is likely that <!--del_lnk--> Arabization was mainly a cultural process without genetic replacement.. However, and according to the <!--del_lnk--> European Journal of Human Genetics, North-Western <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africans</a> were genetically closer to <!--del_lnk--> Iberians and to other <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europeans</a> than to <a href="../../wp/s/Sub-Saharan_Africa.htm" title="Sub-Saharan Africa">sub-Saharan Africans</a>..<p>Morocco&#39;s official language is <!--del_lnk--> classical Arabic. The country&#39;s distinctive Arabic dialect is called <!--del_lnk--> Moroccan Arabic. Approximately 12 million (40% of the population), mostly in <!--del_lnk--> rural areas, speak <!--del_lnk--> Berber &ndash; which exists in Morocco in three different dialects (<!--del_lnk--> Tarifit, <!--del_lnk--> Tashelhiyt, and <!--del_lnk--> Tamazight) &ndash; either as a first language or bilingually with the spoken Arabic dialect. <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a>, which remains Morocco&#39;s unofficial second language, is taught universally and still serves as Morocco&#39;s primary language of commerce and economics.

As a result of national education reforms entering into force in late 2002, English will be taught in all public schools from the fourth year on.<p>Most people live west of the <!--del_lnk--> Atlas Mountains, a range that insulates the country from the <!--del_lnk--> Sahara Desert. <!--del_lnk--> Casablanca is the centre of commerce and industry and the leading port; <a href="../../wp/r/Rabat.htm" title="Rabat">Rabat</a> is the seat of government; <!--del_lnk--> Tangier is the gateway to Morocco from <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> and also a major port; <!--del_lnk--> Fez is the cultural and religious centre; and the dominantly &quot;Berber&quot; <!--del_lnk--> Marrakech is a major tourist centre.<p><a href="../../wp/e/Education.htm" title="Education">Education</a> in Morocco is free and compulsory through primary school (age 15). Nevertheless, many children &ndash; particularly girls in rural areas &ndash; still do not attend school.
