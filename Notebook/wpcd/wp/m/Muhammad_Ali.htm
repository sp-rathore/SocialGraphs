      <p><b>Muhammad Ali</b> (born <b>Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr.</b> on <!--del_lnk--> January 17, <!--del_lnk--> 1942) is a retired <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">American</a> <!--del_lnk--> boxer. In 1999, Ali was crowned &quot;Sportsman of the Century&quot; by <!--del_lnk--> Sports Illustrated.

He was named after his father, Cassius Marcellus Clay, Sr., (who was named for the 19th century <!--del_lnk--> abolitionist and politician <!--del_lnk--> Cassius Clay). Ali later changed his name after joining the <!--del_lnk--> Nation of Islam and subsequently converted to orthodox <!--del_lnk--> Sunni Islam in 1975.<p>

      <p><a id="Early_boxing_career" name="Early_boxing_career"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early boxing career</span></h3>
      <p>Standing at 6&#39; 3&quot; (1.91 m), Ali had a highly unorthodox style for a heavyweight boxer. He carried his hands at his sides, rather than the normal boxing style of carrying the hands high to defend the face. Instead, he relied on his ability to avoid a punch. In Louisville, <!--del_lnk--> October 29, <!--del_lnk--> 1960, Cassius Clay won his first professional fight. He won a six-round decision over <!--del_lnk--> Tunney Hunsaker, who was the police chief of <!--del_lnk--> Fayetteville, West Virginia. From 1960 to 1963, the young fighter amassed a record of 19-0, with 15 knockouts. He defeated such boxers as Tony Esperti, Jim Robinson (who weighed 160 pounds when he fought Clay), Donnie Fleeman (who had broken ribs going into the fight but fought Clay anyway), Alonzo Johnson, George Logan, Willi Besmanoff, Lamar Clark (who had won his previous 40 bouts by knockout), <!--del_lnk--> Doug Jones, and <!--del_lnk--> Henry Cooper. Among Clay&#39;s victories were versus <!--del_lnk--> Sonny Banks (who knocked him down during the bout), Alejandro Lavorante, and the aged <!--del_lnk--> Archie Moore (a boxing legend who had fought over 200 previous fights, and who had been Clay&#39;s trainer prior to <!--del_lnk--> Angelo Dundee).<p>Clay then won a disputed 10 round decision over Doug Jones, who, despite being lighter than Clay, staggered Clay as soon as the fight started with a right hand, and beat Clay to the punch continually during the fight. The fight was named &quot;Fight of the Year&quot; for 1963. Clay&#39;s next fight was against Britain&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Henry Cooper, who knocked Clay down with a left hook near the end of the fourth round. The fight was stopped in the 5th round due to a deep cut on Cooper&#39;s face.<p>Despite these close calls against Doug Jones and Henry Cooper, he became the top contender for <!--del_lnk--> Sonny Liston&#39;s title. In spite of Clay&#39;s impressive record, he was not expected to beat the champ. The fight was to be held on <!--del_lnk--> February 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1964 in Lewiston, Maine. During the weigh-in on the previous day, the never-bashful Ali&mdash;who frequently taunted Liston during the buildup by dubbing him &quot;the big ugly bear&quot;, among other things&mdash;declared that he would &quot;float like a butterfly and sting like a bee,&quot; and, in summarizing his strategy for avoiding Liston&#39;s assaults, said, &quot;Your hands can&#39;t hit what your eyes can&#39;t see.&quot;<p><a id="First_title_fight" name="First_title_fight"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">First title fight</span></h4>

      </dl>
      <p>Clay, however, had a plan. Misreading Clay&#39;s exuberance as nervousness, Liston was over-confident, and was unprepared for any result but a quick stoppage. In the opening rounds, Clay&#39;s speed kept him away from Liston&#39;s powerful head and body shots, as he used his height advantage to effectively beat Liston to the punch with his <!--del_lnk--> jab. By the third, Clay was on top, and had opened a cut under Liston&#39;s eye. Liston regained some ground in the fourth, as Clay was blinded by a foreign substance. It is unknown whether this was something used to close Liston&#39;s cuts, or applied to Liston&#39;s gloves for a nefarious purpose. Partially-sighted, Clay passively sought to escape Liston&#39;s offensive. He was able to keep out of range until his sweat cleaned the ointment from his eyes, responding with a flurry of combinations near the end of the fifth round. By the sixth, he was looking for a finish and dominated Liston. Then Liston shocked the world when he didn&#39;t come out for the seventh round to continue the fight; he later claimed to have injured his shoulder. Clay overcame all odds to become heavyweight champion of the world.<p><a id="Cassius_Marcellus_Clay_Jr._changes_his_name_to_Muhammad_Ali" name="Cassius_Marcellus_Clay_Jr._changes_his_name_to_Muhammad_Ali"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. changes his name to Muhammad Ali</span></h3>

      <p>Following his ascension to champion, he also became famous for other reasons: he revealed that he was a member of the <!--del_lnk--> Nation of Islam (often called the <!--del_lnk--> Black Muslims at the time) and Malcolm X proved Clay with the name Cassius X, discarding his surname as a symbol of his ancestors&#39; enslavement, as had been done by other Nation members such as <a href="../../wp/m/Malcolm_X.htm" title="Malcolm X">Malcolm X</a>. Friday, March 6, 1964 Malcolm X took Cassius Clay on a guided tour of the United Nations building (for a second time). Malcolm X announced that Cassius Clay would be be granted his &quot;X.&quot; That same night Elijah Muhammad recorded a statement over the phone to be played over the radio that Cassius Clay would be renamed Muhammad (the original prophet of Islam) Ali (fourth rightly guided caliph). Only a few journalists (most notably <!--del_lnk--> Howard Cosell) accepted it at that time. The adoption of this name symbolized his new identity as a Black Muslim, and he retained the name even after he later became a Sunni Muslim.<p><a id="Vietnam_puts_a_pause_in_Ali.27s_career" name="Vietnam_puts_a_pause_in_Ali.27s_career"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Vietnam puts a pause in Ali&#39;s career</span></h3>
      <p>In 1964, Ali failed the Armed Forces qualifying test because his writing and spelling skills were subpar. However, in early 1966, the tests were revised and Ali was reclassified 1A. He refused to serve in the <!--del_lnk--> United States Army during the <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_War.htm" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a> as a <!--del_lnk--> conscientious objector, because &quot;War is against the teachings of the Holy Qur&#39;an. I&#39;m not trying to dodge the draft. We are not supposed to take part in no wars unless declared by Allah or The Messenger. We don&#39;t take part in Christian wars or wars of any unbelievers.&quot; Ali also famously said &quot;I ain&#39;t got no quarrel with those <!--del_lnk--> Vietcong&quot; and &quot;no Vietcong ever called me <!--del_lnk--> nigger.&quot;<p>Ali refused to respond to his name being read out as Cassius Clay, stating, as instructed by his Muslim mentors, that Clay was the name given to his slave ancestors by the white man. By refusing to respond to this name, Ali&#39;s personal life was filled with controversy. Ali was essentially banned from fighting in the United States and forced to accept bouts abroad for most of 1966.<p>From his rematch with Liston in May of 1965, to his final defense against <!--del_lnk--> Zora Folley in March of 1967, he defended his title nine times. Few other heavyweight champions in history have fought so much in such a short period.<p>Ali was scheduled to fight <!--del_lnk--> WBA champion <!--del_lnk--> Ernie Terrell in a unification bout in <a href="../../wp/t/Toronto.htm" title="Toronto">Toronto</a> on <!--del_lnk--> March 29, <!--del_lnk--> 1966, but Terrell backed out and Ali won a fifteen round decision against substitute opponent <!--del_lnk--> George Chuvalo. He then went to England and defeated <!--del_lnk--> Henry Cooper and <!--del_lnk--> Brian London by stoppage on cuts. Ali&#39;s next defense was against German southpaw <!--del_lnk--> Karl Mildenberger, the first German to fight for the title since <!--del_lnk--> Max Schmeling. In one of the tougher fights of his life, Ali stopped his opponent in round 12.<p>Ali returned to the United States in November 1966 to fight <!--del_lnk--> Cleveland &quot;Big Cat&quot; Williams in the <!--del_lnk--> Houston Astrodome. A year and a half before the fight, Williams had been shot in the stomach at point blank range by a Texas policeman. As a result, Cleveland Williams went into the fight missing one kidney, ten feet of his small intestine, and with a shriveled left leg from nerve damage from the bullet. Ali beat Williams in three rounds. Many boxing analysts consider this fight to be Ali&#39;s greatest performance from a technical point of view.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> February 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1967, Ali returned to a <!--del_lnk--> Houston boxing ring to fight <!--del_lnk--> Ernie Terrell, in what was to be one of the uglier fights in boxing. Terrell had angered Ali by calling him Clay, and the champion vowed to punish him for this insult, and during the fight Ali kept shouting at his opponent &quot;What&#39;s my name, Uncle Tom...what&#39;s my name&quot;. Terrell suffered fifteen rounds of brutal punishment, losing 13 of 15 rounds on two judges&#39; scorecards, but Ali was unable to knock him out. This caused many to question even more strongly Ali&#39;s &quot;phantom punch knockout&quot; over Liston. After the fight, Tex Maule wrote, &quot;It was a wonderful demonstration of boxing skill and a barbarous display of cruelty.&quot;<p>Ali&#39;s actions in refusing military service and aligning himself with the Nation of Islam, made him a lightning rod for controversy, turning the outspoken but popular former champion into one of that era&#39;s most recognizable and controversial figures. Appearing at rallies with Nation of Islam leader <!--del_lnk--> Elijah Muhammad and declaring his allegiance to him at a time when mainstream America viewed them with suspicion &mdash; if not actual hostility &mdash; made Ali a target of outrage, and suspicion as well. Ali seemed at times to even provoke such reactions, with viewpoints that wavered from support for civil rights to outright support of separatism.<p>Near the end of 1967, Ali was stripped of his title by the professional boxing commission and would not be allowed to fight professionally for more than three years. He was also convicted for refusing induction into the army. Over the course of those years in exile, Ali fought to appeal his conviction. He stayed in the public spotlight and supported himself by giving speeches primarily at rallies on college campuses that opposed the Vietnam War.<p>In 1970 Ali was allowed to fight again and in late 1971 the Supreme Court reversed his conviction.<p><a id="The_comeback" name="The_comeback"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The comeback</span></h3>
      <p>In 1970, Ali was finally able to get a boxing license. With the help of a State Senator, he was granted a license to box in Georgia because it was the only state in America without a boxing commission. In October of 1970, he returned to stop <!--del_lnk--> Jerry Quarry on a cut after three rounds. Shortly after the Quarry fight, the <!--del_lnk--> New York State Supreme Court ruled that Ali was unjustly denied a boxing license. Once again able to fight in New York, he fought <!--del_lnk--> Oscar Bonavena at Madison Square Garden in December of 1970. After a tough 14 rounds, Ali stopped Bonavena in the 15th, paving the way for a title fight against <!--del_lnk--> Joe Frazier.<p><a id="The_Fight_of_the_Century" name="The_Fight_of_the_Century"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"><i>The Fight of the Century</i></span></h3>

      <p>Ali and Frazier fought each other on <!--del_lnk--> March 8, <!--del_lnk--> 1971 at Madison Square Garden. This fight, known as <i>The Fight of the Century</i>, is one of the most famous and was one of the most eagerly anticipated bouts of all time, since it featured two skilled, undefeated fighters, both of whom had reasonable claims to the heavyweight crown. The fight lived up to the hype, and Frazier punctuated his victory by flooring Ali with a hard left hook in the final round and won on points. <!--del_lnk--> Frank Sinatra - unable to acquire a ringside seat - took photos of the match for <!--del_lnk--> Life Magazine. Legendary boxing announcer <!--del_lnk--> Don Dunphy and actor and boxing aficionado <!--del_lnk--> Burt Lancaster called the action for the broadcast, which reached millions of people.<p>Frazier eventually won the fight and retained the title with a unanimous decision, dealing Ali his first professional loss. Despite an impressive performance, Ali may have still been suffering from the effects of &quot;ring rust&quot; due to his long layoff. Additionally this match also made evident that over the course of 3 1/2 years in exile Ali had lost considerable amounts of speed and sharpness, assets that were once responsible for his dominance in the ring. From this point onward Ali was forced to show increased endurance as his speed continued to gradually slow over the years. He would take more punishment in the ring than ever before, proving his reputation as one of boxing&#39;s great fighters.<p>In 1973, after a string of victories over top Heavyweight opposition in a campaign to force a rematch with Frazier, Ali split two bouts with <!--del_lnk--> Ken Norton (in the bout that Ali lost to Norton, Ali suffered a broken jaw), before beating Frazier on points in their 1974 <!--del_lnk--> rematch, to earn another title shot.<p><a id="The_Rumble_in_the_Jungle" name="The_Rumble_in_the_Jungle"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"><i>The Rumble in the Jungle</i></span></h3>

      <p>Ali regained his title on October 30, 1974 by defeating champion <!--del_lnk--> George Foreman in their bizarre bout in Kinshasa, Zaire. Hyped as &quot;The Rumble In The Jungle&quot;, the fight was promoted by <!--del_lnk--> Don King, who had served time in prison for killing his partner in the numbers racket.<p>Almost no one, not even Ali&#39;s long-time supporter Howard Cosell, gave the former champion a chance of winning. Analysts pointed out that Joe Frazier and Ken Norton had given Ali four tough battles in the ring and won two of them while Foreman had destroyed both in the second round.<p>The fight became a political symbol - Ali was taken to represent Black consciousness and the fight against white power, Foreman taken to represent US arrogance. Ali was massively popular in Za&iuml;re and it is likely that the enthusiastic support of the crowd assisted him considerably in his victory.<p>In the fight, Ali took advantage of the young champion&#39;s one weakness: staying power. Foreman had won 37 of his 40 bouts by knockout, most within three rounds or less, with Foreman&#39;s eight previous bouts not going past the second round. Ali saw an opportunity to outlast Foreman, and capitalized on it.<p>Commentators expected Ali to box Foreman at distance using his superior speed and footwork but, instead, during the second round Ali retreated to the ropes inviting Foreman to hit him, while counterpunching and verbally taunting the younger man. Ali&#39;s plan was to enrage Foreman and absorb his best blows in order to exhaust him mentally and physically. While Foreman threw wide shots to Ali&#39;s body, Ali countered with stinging straight punches to Foreman&#39;s head. The champion threw hundreds of punches in seven rounds but with decreasing technique and effect. This was later termed &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The Rope-A-Dope&quot;.<p>By the end of the eighth round Foreman was clearly flagging and Ali made his move, turning Foreman off the ropes and executing a beautiful combination for the knockout. Foreman failed to make the count, and Ali had regained the title.<p><a id="Ali_becomes_a_Sunni_Muslim" name="Ali_becomes_a_Sunni_Muslim"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Ali becomes a Sunni Muslim</span></h3>
      <p>Ali converted from the <!--del_lnk--> Nation of Islam to orthodox <!--del_lnk--> Sunni Islam in 1975. In a 2004 autobiography, written with daughter Hana Yasmeen Ali, Muhammad Ali attributes his conversion to the shift towards Sunni Islam made by <!--del_lnk--> W.D. Muhammad after he gained control of the Nation of Islam upon the death of his father, <!--del_lnk--> Elijah Muhammad in 1975.<p><a id="Rocky" name="Rocky"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Rocky</i></span></h3>
      <p>On March 24, 1975, Ali fought <!--del_lnk--> Chuck Wepner in Cleveland, a fight that was to inspire the Academy Award winning movie &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Rocky&quot;. Ironically, however, it was Ali&#39;s opponent who provided the inspiration for history&#39;s most famous fictional pugilist. Wepner was a journeyman fighter who had been earning his living as a liquor salesman and security guard. Wepner had been dubbed &quot;The Bayonne Bleeder&quot; and, although he was ranked, he was considered hapless. Wepner, however, trained for two months and although he lost on a technical knock-out, he survived all 15 rounds and even managed to knock Ali down with a body shot. <!--del_lnk--> Sylvester Stallone saw the match on television and the concept of Rocky Balboa &mdash; an unknown club fighter who goes 15 rounds with the heavyweight champion &mdash; was born. Heavyweight champion <!--del_lnk--> Apollo Creed, the character portrayed by <!--del_lnk--> Carl Weathers, was loosely based on Ali.<p><a id="The_Thrilla_in_Manila" name="The_Thrilla_in_Manila"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"><i>The Thrilla in Manila</i></span></h3>

      <p>In 1975, Ali was again slated to fight Joe Frazier. The anticipation for the fight was enormous for the final clash between these two great heavyweights. Ali&#39;s frequent insults, slurs and poems increased the anticipation and excitement for the fight. After 14 grueling rounds, Frazier&#39;s trainer Eddie Futch refused to allow Frazier to continue. Frazier felt betrayed and never talked to Futch again. Ali was quoted after the fight as saying &quot;This must be what death feels like&quot;. <i><!--del_lnk--> Ring Magazine</i> called this bout 1975&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Fight of the Year, the fifth year an Ali fight had earned that distinction. This fight has been called the greatest fight of all time by many. Ali won many of the early rounds, but Frazier staged a comeback in the middle rounds. By the late rounds, however, Ali had re-asserted control, and the fight was stopped due to Frazier&#39;s eyes being closed.<p>Neither fighter was ever the same again. Frazier would permanently retire after two more fights, and a declining Ali would struggle with many opponents from then on, aided by some controversial victories.<p>1976 saw him knock out two largely unknown opponents, Belgian stonecutter <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Pierre Coopman and English boxer <!--del_lnk--> Richard Dunn. On <!--del_lnk--> April 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1976 Ali faced <!--del_lnk--> Jimmy Young in Landover, Maryland. Young seemed to out point Ali, who had come in at 230 lbs, the heaviest of his career to that point. At the end of the match, the judges, chosen by Don King, gave Ali a decision, causing many to call it one of the worst decisions in the history of boxing. In September, Ali faced <!--del_lnk--> Ken Norton in their third fight, held at <!--del_lnk--> Yankee Stadium. Although it was highly disputed by some observers, the champion won by unanimous decision.<p>In 1977 Ali&#39;s ring doctor, <!--del_lnk--> Freddie Pacheco, left Ali&#39;s entourage claiming that Ali was damaging himself by continuing to fight for too long, and that he did not wish to be held responsible. Pacheco had advised Ali to retire after beginning to see signs of Ali&#39;s reflexes slowing down.<p>Ali would retain his title until a February 1978 loss to 1976 Olympic champion <!--del_lnk--> Leon Spinks. In losing to the novice Spinks, Ali became the first heavyweight champion in the entire history of boxing to lose his title to a novice who had had only seven professional fights. In the September rematch in <!--del_lnk--> New Orleans at the <!--del_lnk--> Superdome, Spinks&#39; cornerman Georgie Benton walked out of the ring after the 6th round, later commenting that he did not think the fight was on the level. Ali was given a 15 round decision over the disoriented Spinks. Then on <!--del_lnk--> June 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1979, he announced his retirement and vacated the title.<p><a id="Final_comeback_and_retirement" name="Final_comeback_and_retirement"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Final comeback and retirement</span></h3>
      <p>That retirement was short-lived, however, and on <!--del_lnk--> October 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1980, he challenged <!--del_lnk--> Larry Holmes for the <!--del_lnk--> WBC&#39;s version of the world Heavyweight title. Looking to set another record, as the first boxer to win the Heavyweight title four times, Ali lost by technical knockout in round eleven, when Dundee would not let him come out for the round. The Holmes fight, promoted as &quot;The Last Hurrah&quot;, was a fight many fans and experts view with disdain, because it was a fight that saw a &quot;deteriorated version&quot; of Ali. Holmes was Ali&#39;s sparring partner when Holmes was a budding fighter; thus, some viewed the result of the fight as a symbolic &quot;passing of the torch.&quot; Holmes even admitted later that, although he dominated the fight, he held his punches back a bit out of sheer respect for his idol, and former employer. It was revealed after the fight that Ali had been examined at the Mayo Clinic, and the results were shocking. He had admitted to tingling in his hands, and slurring of his speech. The exam revealed he actually had a hole in the membrane of his brain. However, <!--del_lnk--> Don King withheld this report, and allowed the fight to go on.<p>Despite the apparent finality of his loss to Holmes and his increasingly suspect medical condition, Ali would fight one more time. On <!--del_lnk--> December 11, <!--del_lnk--> 1981, he fought rising contender and future world champion <!--del_lnk--> Trevor Berbick, in what was billed as &quot;The Drama in the Bahamas.&quot; Because Ali was widely viewed as a damaged fighter, few American venues expressed much interest in hosting the bout, and few fans expressed much interest in attending or watching it. Compared to the mega-fights Ali fought in widely known venues earlier in his career, the match took place in virtual obscurity, in Nassau. Although Ali performed marginally better against Berbick than he had against Holmes fourteen months earlier, he still lost a 10-round unanimous decision to Berbick, who at 27 was twelve years younger.<p>Following this loss, Ali retired permanently in 1981, with a career record of 56 wins (37 by knockout) and 5 losses, and as a three-time World Heavyweight Boxing Champion.<p><a id="Ali.27s_legacy" name="Ali.27s_legacy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Ali&#39;s legacy</span></h3>

      <p>Muhammad Ali defeated almost every top Heavyweight in his era, an era which has been called the Golden Age of Heavyweight boxing. Ali was named &quot;Fighter of the Year&quot; by <!--del_lnk--> Ring Magazine more times than any other fighter, and was involved in more Ring Magazine &quot;Fight of the Year&quot; bouts than any other fighter. He is an inductee into the <!--del_lnk--> International Boxing Hall of Fame and holds wins over seven other Hall of Fame inductees. He is also one of only three boxers to be named &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Sportsman of the Year&quot; by <!--del_lnk--> Sports Illustrated. He is regarded as one of the best <!--del_lnk--> pound for pound boxers in history. He was a masterful self-promoter, and his psychological tactics before, during, and after fights, were very effective. It was his supreme skill, however, that enabled him to scale the heights and sustain his position. It is widely believed that he was the most famous athlete who ever lived and at one point was the most famous person alive.<p><a id="In_retirement" name="In_retirement"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">In retirement</span></h3>
      <p>Ali was diagnosed with <!--del_lnk--> Parkinson&#39;s disease in the early 1980s, following which his motor functions began a slow decline. Although Ali&#39;s doctors disagreed during the 1980s and 1990s about whether his symptoms were caused by boxing and whether or not his condition was degenerative, he was ultimately diagnosed with <!--del_lnk--> Pugilistic Parkinson&#39;s syndrome. By late 2005 it was reported that Ali&#39;s condition was notably worsening. According to the documentary <i><!--del_lnk--> When We Were Kings</i>, when Ali was asked about whether he has any regrets about boxing due to his disability, he responded that if he didn&#39;t box he would still be a painter in Louisville, Kentucky.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Despite the disability, he remains a beloved and active public figure. In 1985, he served as a guest referee at the inaugural <!--del_lnk--> WrestleMania event. In 1987 he was selected by the California Bicentennial Foundation for the U.S. Constitution to personify the vitality of the US Constitution and Bill of Rights in various high profile activities. Ali rode on a float at the 1988 Tournament of Roses, launching the U.S. Constitution&#39;s 200th birthday commemoration. He also published an oral history, <i>Muhammad Ali:His Life and Times with Thomas Hauser</i>, in 1991. Ali received a <!--del_lnk--> Spirit of America Award calling him the most recognized American in the world. In 1995 the <!--del_lnk--> debut album of the band <!--del_lnk--> Ben Folds Five included a song about Ali and his retirement called &quot;Boxing&quot;. Ben Folds has said that his dad was a fan of Ali. In 1996, he had the honour of lighting the flame at the <!--del_lnk--> 1996 Summer Olympics in <a href="../../wp/a/Atlanta%252C_Georgia.htm" title="Atlanta, Georgia">Atlanta, Georgia</a>.<div class="thumb tright">
