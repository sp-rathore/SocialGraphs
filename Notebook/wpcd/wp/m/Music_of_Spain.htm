      <p><a id="Early_history" name="Early_history"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early history</span></h3>
      <p>In Spain several very different cultural streams came together in the first centuries of the <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christian</a> era: the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman</a> culture, which was dominant for several hundred years, and which brought with it the music and ideas of <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Ancient Greece</a>; early Christians, who had their own version of the Roman Rite; the <!--del_lnk--> Visigoths, a <!--del_lnk--> Germanic tribe that overran the <!--del_lnk--> Iberian peninsula in the <a href="../../wp/5/5th_century.htm" title="5th century">fifth century</a>; <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jew">Jews</a> of the <!--del_lnk--> diaspora; and eventually the <!--del_lnk--> Arabs, or the <!--del_lnk--> Moors as the group was sometimes known. Determining exactly which spices flavored the stew, and in what proportion, is difficult after almost two thousand years, but the result was a musical style and tradition considerably different from what developed in the rest of Europe.<p><!--del_lnk--> Isidore of Seville wrote about music in the <a href="../../wp/6/6th_century.htm" title="6th century">sixth century</a>. His influences were predominantly <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greek</a>, and yet he was an original thinker, and recorded some of the first information about the early music of the Christian church. He perhaps is most famous in music history for declaring that it was not possible to notate sounds&mdash;an assertion which reveals his ignorance of the notational system of ancient Greece, so that knowledge had to have been lost by the time he was writing.<p>Under the Moors, who were usually tolerant of other religions during the seven hundred years of their influence, both Christianity and <a href="../../wp/j/Judaism.htm" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>, with their associated music and ritual, flourished. <!--del_lnk--> Music notation developed in Spain as early as the <a href="../../wp/8/8th_century.htm" title="8th century">eighth century</a> (the so-called Visigothic <!--del_lnk--> neumes) to notate the chant and other sacred music of the Christian church, but this obscure notation has not yet been deciphered by scholars, and exists only in small fragments. The music of the Christian church in Spain was known as the music of the <!--del_lnk--> Mozarabic Rite, and developed in isolation, not subject to the enforced codification of <a href="../../wp/g/Gregorian_chant.htm" title="Gregorian chant">Gregorian chant</a> under the guidance of Rome around the time of Charlemagne. At the time of the <i>reconquista</i>, this music was almost entirely extirpated: once Rome had control over the Christians of the Iberian peninsula, the regular Roman rite was imposed, and locally developed sacred music was banned, burned, or otherwise eliminated. The style of Spanish popular songs of the time is presumed to be closely related to the style of Moorish music. Music of the King <!--del_lnk--> Alfonso X <!--del_lnk--> Cantigas de Santa Maria is considered likely to show influence from Islamic sources. Other important medieval sources include the <!--del_lnk--> Codex Calixtinum collection from <!--del_lnk--> Santiago de Compostela and the Codex <!--del_lnk--> Las Huelgas. The so-called <!--del_lnk--> Llibre Vermell de Montserrat (red book) is an important devotional collection from the fourteenth century.<p><a id="Renaissance_and_Baroque" name="Renaissance_and_Baroque"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Renaissance and Baroque</span></h3>
      <p>In the early <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance_music.htm" title="Renaissance music">Renaissance</a>, instrumental music was still influenced by <!--del_lnk--> Arabic music. <!--del_lnk--> Mateo Flecha el viejo and Castillian dramatist <!--del_lnk--> Juan del Encina rank among composers in the post <!--del_lnk--> Ars Nova period. Some renaissance songbooks are the <!--del_lnk--> Cancionero de Palacio, the <!--del_lnk--> Cancionero de Medinaceli (also known as <i>cancionero de <!--del_lnk--> Uppsala</i> as it is kept in <!--del_lnk--> Carolina Rediviva library), the <!--del_lnk--> Cancionero de la Colombina, and the later <!--del_lnk--> Cancionero de la Sablonara.<p>Early <a href="../../wp/1/16th_century.htm" title="16th century">16th century</a> <!--del_lnk--> polyphonic vocal style developed in Spain was closely related to the style of the <!--del_lnk--> Franco-Flemish composers. Melting of styles occurred during the period when Spain was part of the <a href="../../wp/h/Holy_Roman_Empire.htm" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>, under <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_V%252C_Holy_Roman_Emperor.htm" title="Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor">Charles V</a> (king of Spain from <!--del_lnk--> 1516 to <!--del_lnk--> 1556), since composers from the North both visited Spain, and native Spaniards travelled within the empire, which extended to the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>. Music for <!--del_lnk--> vihuela by <!--del_lnk--> Luis de Mil&aacute;n, <!--del_lnk--> Alonso Mudarra and <!--del_lnk--> Luis de Narv&aacute;ez stands as one of the main achievements of the period. The Aragonese <!--del_lnk--> Gaspar Sanz was the author of the first learning method for guitar. The great Spanish composers of the Renaissance included <!--del_lnk--> Francisco Guerrero and <!--del_lnk--> Crist&oacute;bal de Morales, both of whom spent a significant portion of their careers in Rome; and the great Spanish composer of the late Renaissance, who reached a level of polyphonic perfection and expressive intensity equal to <!--del_lnk--> Palestrina and <!--del_lnk--> Lassus, was <!--del_lnk--> Tom&aacute;s Luis de Victoria, who also spent much of his life in Rome. Most Spanish composers returned home late in their careers to spread their musical knowledge in their native land.<p><a name="18th_to_20th_centuries"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">18th to 20th centuries</span></h3>
      <p>By the end of the 17th century the &quot;classical&quot; musical culture of Spain was in decline, and was to remain that way until the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a>. Classicism in Spain, when it arrived, was inspired on Italian models, as in the works of <!--del_lnk--> Antonio Soler. Some outstanding Italian composers as <!--del_lnk--> Domenico Scarlatti or <!--del_lnk--> Luigi Boccherini were appointed at the Madrid court. The short-lived <!--del_lnk--> Juan Cris&oacute;stomo Arriaga is credited as the main beginner of Romantic sinfonism in Spain.<p><!--del_lnk--> Fernando Sor, <!--del_lnk--> Dionisio Aguado, <!--del_lnk--> Francisco T&aacute;rrega and <!--del_lnk--> Miguel Llobet are known as composers of guitar music. Fine literature for violin was created by <!--del_lnk--> Pablo Sarasate and <!--del_lnk--> Jesus de Monasterio.<p><!--del_lnk--> Zarzuela, a native form of light <a href="../../wp/o/Opera.htm" title="Opera">opera</a>, is a secular musical form which developed in the early <a href="../../wp/1/17th_century.htm" title="17th century">17th century</a>. Some beloved zarzuela composers are <!--del_lnk--> Ruperto Chap&iacute;, <!--del_lnk--> Federico Chueca and <!--del_lnk--> Tom&aacute;s Bret&oacute;n.<p>Musical creativity mainly moved into areas of folk and popular music until the nationalist revival of the late Romantic era. Spanish composers of this period include <!--del_lnk--> Isaac Alb&eacute;niz, <!--del_lnk--> Enrique Granados, <!--del_lnk--> Manuel de Falla, <!--del_lnk--> Jes&uacute;s Guridi, <!--del_lnk--> Ernesto Halffter, <!--del_lnk--> Federico Mompou and <!--del_lnk--> Joaquin Rodrigo.<p><a id="Pop_Music" name="Pop_Music"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Pop Music</span></h2>
      <p>Spanish <!--del_lnk--> pop radio flourished at the end of <!--del_lnk--> Francisco Franco&#39;s regime. By the late <!--del_lnk--> 1950s, a generation of performers were coming of age. At the same time American and British music, especially <!--del_lnk--> rock and roll, was having an impact on Spanish audiences. The <!--del_lnk--> Festival de la Canci&oacute;n De Benidorm was founded in <!--del_lnk--> 1959 in <!--del_lnk--> Benidorm, a seaside town attempting to boost local tourism. Inspired by the Italian <!--del_lnk--> Festival di San Remo, it was followed by a wave of similar <!--del_lnk--> music festivals in places like <a href="../../wp/b/Barcelona.htm" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Majorca and the <!--del_lnk--> Canary Islands. First major pop stars were all women, and they rose to fame through these music festivals. An injured <!--del_lnk--> Real Madrid player-turned-singer became the world-famous <!--del_lnk--> Julio Iglesias. During the <!--del_lnk--> 1960s and early <!--del_lnk--> 70s, tourism boomed, bringing yet more musical styles from the rest of the continent and abroad.<p><a id="Ye-Y.C3.A9" name="Ye-Y.C3.A9"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Ye-Y&eacute;</span></h3>
      <p>From the English pop-refrain words &quot;yeah-yeah&quot;,<i>ye-y&eacute;</i> was a French-coined term which Spanish language appropriated to refer to uptempo pop music. It mainly consisted of a fusion of American rock from the early 60s (such as <!--del_lnk--> twist) and British <!--del_lnk--> beat music. <!--del_lnk--> Concha Velasco, a singer and movie star, launched the scene with her <!--del_lnk--> 1965 hit &quot;La Chica Ye-Y&eacute;&quot;, though there had been hits earlier by female singers like <!--del_lnk--> Karina (<!--del_lnk--> 1963). The earliest stars were an imitation of French pop, at the time itself an imitation of American and British pop and rock. Dark passion and flamenco rhythms, however, made the sound distinctively Spanish. From this first generation of Spanish pop singers, <!--del_lnk--> Rosalia&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> 1965 hit &quot;Flamenco&quot; sounded most distinctively Spanish.<p><a id="Performers" name="Performers"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Performers</span></h3>

      <p>In addition to these, famous Spanish pop groups include <!--del_lnk--> Los Brincos, <!--del_lnk--> Los Bravos, <!--del_lnk--> &quot;C&aacute;novas, Adolfo, Rodrigo y Guzm&aacute;n&quot;, <!--del_lnk--> F&oacute;rmula V, <!--del_lnk--> Triana, <!--del_lnk--> Orquesta Mondrag&oacute;n, <!--del_lnk--> Loquillo y Los Trogloditas, <!--del_lnk--> Nacha Pop,<!--del_lnk--> El Canto Del Loco, <!--del_lnk--> Pereza, <!--del_lnk--> Pignoise, <!--del_lnk--> Sonblue, <!--del_lnk--> Falling Kids, <!--del_lnk--> Ketama, <!--del_lnk--> Los Secretos, <!--del_lnk--> Siniestro Total, <!--del_lnk--> Ob&uacute;s, <!--del_lnk--> Burning, <!--del_lnk--> Radio Futura, <!--del_lnk--> Mecano, <!--del_lnk--> H&eacute;roes del Silencio, <!--del_lnk--> El &Uacute;ltimo de la Fila, <!--del_lnk--> Bar&oacute;n Rojo, <!--del_lnk--> Estopa, <!--del_lnk--> Amaral, <!--del_lnk--> La Oreja de Van Gogh, <!--del_lnk--> Mojinos Escoc&iacute;os and <!--del_lnk--> Gigatron.<p>Also from Spain was the famous trio of singing clowns <!--del_lnk--> Gaby, Fof&oacute; y Miliki.<p><a id="Flamenco" name="Flamenco"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Flamenco</span></h2>
      <p>Flamenco is a mainly <!--del_lnk--> Gypsy art-form, strongly influenced by <!--del_lnk--> Andalusian traditional folk music. It consists of three forms: the song (<i>cante</i>), the dance (<i>baile</i>) and the <a href="../../wp/g/Guitar.htm" title="Guitar">guitar</a> (<i>guitarra</i>). First reference dates back to 1774, from Cadalso&#39;s &quot;Cartas Marruecas&quot;. Flamenco probably originated in <!--del_lnk--> C&aacute;diz, <!--del_lnk--> J&eacute;rez de la Frontera and <!--del_lnk--> Triana, and could be a descendant of musical forms left by <!--del_lnk--> Moorish during the <a href="../../wp/8/8th_century.htm" title="8th century">8th</a>-<a href="../../wp/1/14th_century.htm" title="14th century">14th century</a>. Influences from the <!--del_lnk--> Byzantine church music, <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> could also have been important in shaping the music. The word <i>flamenco</i> is most commonly considered derived from the Spanish word for <i><a href="../../wp/f/Flanders.htm" title="Flanders">Flemish</a></i>. Some claim that Spanish Jews in Flanders were allowed to perform their music without oppression, and Gypsies that had fought there with distinction in war on behalf of Spain were rewarded by being allowed to settle in Andalusia. Main stream scholars recognize all these early influences but consider flamenco as an earlier 19th century performance stage music as <!--del_lnk--> tango or <!--del_lnk--> fado.<p><a id="Regional_folk_music" name="Regional_folk_music"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Regional folk music</span></h2>
      <p>Spain&#39;s autonomous regions have own distinctive folk traditions. There is also a movement of <a href="../../wp/f/Folk_music.htm" title="Folk music">folk-based</a> <!--del_lnk--> singer-songwriters with politically active lyrics, paralleling similar developments across <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin America</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>. While the bulk of today&#39;s Spanish traditional music can only be related as far as early 19th century, only a handful of ritual religious music can be dated back to renaissance and middle age eras. So-called Iberian, Celtic, Roman, Greek or Phoenician music influence only exists in the minds of fanciful dilettanti.<p><a id="Andalusia" name="Andalusia"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Andalusia</span></h3>
      <p>Though Andalusia is best known for <!--del_lnk--> flamenco music (see below for more information), folk music features a strong musical tradition for <!--del_lnk--> gaita rociera (<!--del_lnk--> tabor pipe) in Western Andalusia and a distinct <!--del_lnk--> violin and plucked-strings band known as <!--del_lnk--> panda de verdiales in <!--del_lnk--> M&aacute;laga. The region has also produced <!--del_lnk--> singer-songwriters like <!--del_lnk--> Javier Ruibal and <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Cano, who revived a traditional music called <!--del_lnk--> copla. Catalan <!--del_lnk--> Kiko Veneno and <!--del_lnk--> Joaqu&iacute;n Sabina are popular performers in a distinctly Spanish-style <!--del_lnk--> rock music, while <!--del_lnk--> Sephardic musicians like <!--del_lnk--> Aurora Morena, <!--del_lnk--> Lu&iacute;s Delgado and <!--del_lnk--> Rosa Zaragoza keep alive-and-well Andalusian Sephardic music.<p><a id="Aragon" name="Aragon"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Aragon</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Aragon was inhabited by people of <!--del_lnk--> Iberian descent, primarily, though <!--del_lnk--> Celtic, <!--del_lnk--> Moorish and <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> influences remain. <!--del_lnk--> Jota, now popular across Spain, could have historical roots in the Southern part of Aragon. Jota instruments include the <!--del_lnk--> castanets, <!--del_lnk--> tambourines and <a href="../../wp/f/Flute.htm" title="Flute">flutes</a>. Aragonese music can be characterized by a dense <!--del_lnk--> percussive element, that some tried to attribute as an inheritance from <a href="../../wp/n/North_Africa.htm" title="North Africa">North African</a> <!--del_lnk--> Berbers. The <!--del_lnk--> guitarro, a unique kind of small <a href="../../wp/g/Guitar.htm" title="Guitar">guitar</a> also seen in Murcia, seems Aragonese in origin. Besides its music for stick-dances and <!--del_lnk--> dulzaina (<!--del_lnk--> shawm), Aragon has its own <!--del_lnk--> gaita de boto (<!--del_lnk--> bagpipes) and <!--del_lnk--> chiflo (<!--del_lnk--> tabor pipe). As in Basque country, Aragonese chiflo can be played along to a <!--del_lnk--> chicot&eacute;n string-drum (<!--del_lnk--> psalterium) rhythm.<p><a id="Asturias.2C_Cantabria_and_Galicia" name="Asturias.2C_Cantabria_and_Galicia"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Asturias, Cantabria and Galicia</span></h3>

      <p>Northwest Spain (Galicia, Asturias and Cantabria) is home to a distinct tradition of <!--del_lnk--> bagpipe music that some tried to connect to the 1970s commercial label of Celtic-derived culture. All the languages in this area are of Latin descent but local festivals celebrating the area&#39;s so-called &quot;Celtic&quot; influence are common, with <!--del_lnk--> Ortigueira&#39;s Festival del Mundo Celta being especially important. Drum and bagpipe groups are the most beloved kind of Galician folk music, and include popular bands like <!--del_lnk--> Milladoiro. Groups of pandereteiras are another traditional set of singing women that play tambourines. Bagpipe virtuoso <!--del_lnk--> Carlos N&uacute;&ntilde;ez is an especially popular performer; he has worked with Ireland&#39;s The <!--del_lnk--> Chieftains and <!--del_lnk--> Sin&eacute;ad O&#39;Connor, United States&#39; <!--del_lnk--> Ry Cooder and Cuba&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Vieja Trova Santiaguera.<p>Galician folk music includes characteristical <!--del_lnk--> alalas songs. Alalas, that may include instrumental interludes, are believed to be chant-based popular songs with a long history, perhaps closely related to <!--del_lnk--> Gregorian chanting. Though connected to <!--del_lnk--> jota, some whimsical dilettanti also point to a <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greek</a> origin, or <!--del_lnk--> Phoenician rowing songs.<p>Asturias is also home to popular musicians such as Jos&eacute; &Aacute;ngel <!--del_lnk--> Hevia (a virtuoso bagpiper), and famous Celtic group <!--del_lnk--> Llan de Cubel. Circle folk dances using a 6/8 tambourine rhythm are also a hallmark of this area. Vocal <!--del_lnk--> asturianadas show melismatic ornamentations similar to those of other parts of the Iberian Peninsula. There are many festivals, such as &quot;Folixa na Primavera&quot; (April, in <!--del_lnk--> Mieres), &quot;Intercelticu d&#39;<!--del_lnk--> Avil&eacute;s&quot; (July, in Avil&eacute;s), as well as many &quot;Celtic nights&quot; in Asturias.<p>As in the Basque Country, Cantabrian folk music features intrincate arch and stick dances but <!--del_lnk--> tabor pipes did not play such a predominant role.
