      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Union Pacific Railroad&#39;s M-10001 was a <!--del_lnk--> diesel-electric <!--del_lnk--> streamliner <a href="../../wp/t/Train.htm" title="Train">train</a> built in late <!--del_lnk--> 1934 by <!--del_lnk--> Pullman-Standard with an engine from <!--del_lnk--> General Motors&#39; <!--del_lnk--> Electro-Motive Division and <!--del_lnk--> General Electric <!--del_lnk--> generator and <!--del_lnk--> traction motors. It was the UP&#39;s second streamliner after the pioneering <!--del_lnk--> M-10000, the first equipped with a <!--del_lnk--> diesel engine and was a much larger train than its three-car predecessor. All cars were articulated&mdash;<!--del_lnk--> trucks were shared between each car. It was delivered on <!--del_lnk--> October 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1934 and was used for display, test and record-setting runs for the next two months before being returned to Pullman-Standard for an increase in its power and capacity, following which it was placed into service as the <i><!--del_lnk--> City of Portland</i> train.<p>

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> October 22, <!--del_lnk--> 1934, the M-10001, still in its original 900&nbsp;hp (670&nbsp;kW) incarnation, set an as-yet unbroken record from coast to coast of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, running from <!--del_lnk--> Oakland Pier to <a href="../../wp/g/Grand_Central_Terminal.htm" title="Grand Central Terminal">Grand Central Terminal</a> in 57 hours. When placed into service as the <i>City of Portland</i>, the train reduced the <a href="../../wp/c/Chicago.htm" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago, Illinois</a> to <!--del_lnk--> Portland, Oregon schedule from 58 hours to 40 hours without any upgrades to track or other facilities.<p><a id="Technical_details" name="Technical_details"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Technical details</span></h2>
      <p>When built, the M-10001 was a fully articulated six-car train, 376 ft (115 m) in length, comprising a 48 ft (15 m) turret-cab power car, a <!--del_lnk--> Railway Post Office/baggage car, three <!--del_lnk--> Pullman <!--del_lnk--> sleeping cars, and a rounded-tail coach/buffet/observation car. It was powered by a 900&nbsp;hp (670&nbsp;kW) <!--del_lnk--> V12 version of the Winton 201-A engine, driving the first two trucks of the train.<p>The rebuild lengthened the entire train to 455 feet (139 m) and seven cars. The power car had 12 ft (3.7 m) added to accommodate a larger, 1,000&nbsp;hp (750&nbsp;kW) <!--del_lnk--> V16 Winton <!--del_lnk--> diesel engine. The RPO/baggage car was lengthened by eight feet (2.4 m) to take a <!--del_lnk--> steam generator for train heating, and was followed by the addition of a diner/lounge car.<p>Both the 900&nbsp;hp and 1,200&nbsp;hp (670 and 890&nbsp;kW) Winton diesels were the first of that type to be installed in a production train.<p><a id="Service_life" name="Service_life"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Service life</span></h2>
      <p>The rebuilt train was re-delivered on <!--del_lnk--> May 23, <!--del_lnk--> 1935 and after some test runs was dedicated as the first <i>City of Portland</i> on <!--del_lnk--> June 5 at the <!--del_lnk--> Portland Rose Festival, entering service between <!--del_lnk--> Portland, Oregon and Chicago the following day. It remained in that service until June <!--del_lnk--> 1939, when it was replaced in service by the <!--del_lnk--> M-10002 trainset, reassigned from the <i><!--del_lnk--> City of Los Angeles</i>. In December, the diesel engine, generator, trucks, and the steam generator from the RPO/baggage car were removed and installed in a new carbody to become the third power unit on the CD-07 set for the <i><!--del_lnk--> City of Denver</i>, along with the former <!--del_lnk--> M-10003&#39;s two power cars. The remainder of the train was stored until <!--del_lnk--> August 13, <!--del_lnk--> 1941 when it was sold for scrap.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-10001&quot;</div>
