       <dd><i>This article is about a branch of mathematics. The words &quot;mathematical analysis&quot; are also used to mean: the process or result of modeling and analyzing a phenomenon using mathematical techniques in general.</i></dl>
      <p><b>Analysis</b> is a branch of <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> that depends upon the concepts of <!--del_lnk--> limits and <!--del_lnk--> convergence. It studies closely related topics such as <!--del_lnk--> continuity, <!--del_lnk--> integration, <!--del_lnk--> differentiability and <!--del_lnk--> transcendental functions. These topics are often studied in the context of <!--del_lnk--> real numbers, <!--del_lnk--> complex numbers, and their <!--del_lnk--> functions. However, they can also be defined and studied in any <!--del_lnk--> space of mathematical objects that is equipped with a definition of &quot;nearness&quot; (a <!--del_lnk--> topological space) or more specifically &quot;distance&quot; (a <!--del_lnk--> metric space). Mathematical analysis has its beginnings in the rigorous formulation of <a href="../../wp/c/Calculus.htm" title="Calculus">calculus</a>.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Greek mathematicians such as <!--del_lnk--> Eudoxus and <a href="../../wp/a/Archimedes.htm" title="Archimedes">Archimedes</a> made informal use of the concepts of limits and convergence when they used the <!--del_lnk--> method of exhaustion to compute the area and volume of regions and solids.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> India, the <a href="../../wp/1/12th_century.htm" title="12th century">12th century</a> mathematician <!--del_lnk--> Bhaskara conceived of <!--del_lnk--> differential calculus, and gave examples of the <!--del_lnk--> derivative and <!--del_lnk--> differential coefficient, along with a statement of what is now known as <!--del_lnk--> Rolle&#39;s theorem. In the <a href="../../wp/1/14th_century.htm" title="14th century">14th century</a>, mathematical analysis originated with <!--del_lnk--> Madhava in <!--del_lnk--> South India, who developed the fundamental ideas of the <!--del_lnk--> infinite series expansion of a function, the <!--del_lnk--> power series, the <!--del_lnk--> Taylor series, and the rational approximation of an infinite series. He developed the Taylor series of the <a href="../../wp/t/Trigonometric_function.htm" title="Trigonometric function">trigonometric functions</a> of <!--del_lnk--> sine, <!--del_lnk--> cosine, <!--del_lnk--> tangent and <!--del_lnk--> arctangent, and estimated the magnitude of the error terms created by truncating these series. He also developed infinite <!--del_lnk--> continued fractions, term by term <!--del_lnk--> integration, the Taylor series approximations of sine and cosine, and the power series of the <!--del_lnk--> radius, <!--del_lnk--> diameter, <!--del_lnk--> circumference, <a href="../../wp/p/Pi.htm" title="&Pi;">&pi;</a>, &pi;/4 and angle <!--del_lnk--> &theta;. His followers at the <!--del_lnk--> Kerala School further expanded his works, up to the <a href="../../wp/1/16th_century.htm" title="16th century">16th century</a>.<p>In Europe, during the latter half of the <a href="../../wp/1/17th_century.htm" title="17th century">17th century</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Isaac_Newton.htm" title="Isaac Newton">Newton</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/Gottfried_Leibniz.htm" title="Gottfried Leibniz">Leibniz</a> developed calculus, which grew, with the stimulus of applied work that continued through the <a href="../../wp/1/18th_century.htm" title="18th century">18th&nbsp;century</a>, into analysis topics such as the <!--del_lnk--> calculus of variations, <a href="../../wp/o/Ordinary_differential_equation.htm" title="Ordinary differential equation">ordinary</a> and <!--del_lnk--> partial differential equations, <!--del_lnk--> Fourier analysis, and <!--del_lnk--> generating functions. During this period, calculus techniques were applied to approximate <!--del_lnk--> discrete problems by continuous ones.<p>In the <a href="../../wp/1/18th_century.htm" title="18th century">18th century</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Euler introduced the concept of <!--del_lnk--> function and it became a subject of debate among mathematicians. In the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th&nbsp;century</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Cauchy was the first to put calculus on a firm logical foundation by introducing the concept of the <!--del_lnk--> Cauchy sequence. He also started the formal theory of <!--del_lnk--> complex analysis. <!--del_lnk--> Poisson, <!--del_lnk--> Liouville, <!--del_lnk--> Fourier and others studied partial differential equations and <!--del_lnk--> harmonic analysis.<p>In the middle of the century <!--del_lnk--> Riemann introduced his theory of <!--del_lnk--> integration. The last third of the 19th century saw the arithmetization of analysis by <!--del_lnk--> Weierstrass, who thought that geometric reasoning was inherently misleading, and introduced the &quot;epsilon-delta&quot; definition of <!--del_lnk--> limit. Then, mathematicians started worrying that they were assuming the existence of a <!--del_lnk--> continuum of <!--del_lnk--> real numbers without proof. <!--del_lnk--> Dedekind then constructed the real numbers by <!--del_lnk--> Dedekind cuts. Around that time, the attempts to refine the <!--del_lnk--> theorems of <!--del_lnk--> Riemann integration led to the study of the &quot;size&quot; of the set of <!--del_lnk--> discontinuities of real functions.<p>Also, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> monsters&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> nowhere continuous functions, continuous but nowhere differentiable functions, <!--del_lnk--> space-filling curves) began to be created. In this context, <!--del_lnk--> Jordan developed his theory of <!--del_lnk--> measure, <a href="../../wp/g/Georg_Cantor.htm" title="Georg Cantor">Cantor</a> developed what is now called <!--del_lnk--> naive set theory, and <!--del_lnk--> Baire proved the <!--del_lnk--> Baire category theorem. In the early <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a>, calculus was formalized using <!--del_lnk--> axiomatic set theory. <!--del_lnk--> Lebesgue solved the problem of measure, and <a href="../../wp/d/David_Hilbert.htm" title="David Hilbert">Hilbert</a> introduced <!--del_lnk--> Hilbert spaces to solve <!--del_lnk--> integral equations. The idea of <!--del_lnk--> normed vector space was in the air, and in the <!--del_lnk--> 1920s <!--del_lnk--> Banach created <!--del_lnk--> functional analysis.<p><a id="Subdivisions" name="Subdivisions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Subdivisions</span></h2>
      <p>Mathematical analysis includes the following subfields:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Real analysis, the <!--del_lnk--> rigorous study of <!--del_lnk--> derivatives and <!--del_lnk--> integrals of functions of real variables. This includes the study of <!--del_lnk--> sequences and their <!--del_lnk--> limits, <!--del_lnk--> series, and <!--del_lnk--> measures.<li><!--del_lnk--> Functional analysis studies spaces of functions and introduces concepts such as <!--del_lnk--> Banach spaces and <!--del_lnk--> Hilbert spaces.<li><!--del_lnk--> Harmonic analysis deals with <!--del_lnk--> Fourier series and their abstractions.<li><!--del_lnk--> Complex analysis, the study of functions from the <!--del_lnk--> complex plane to the complex plane which are complex differentiable.<li><!--del_lnk--> <i>p</i>-adic analysis, the study of analysis within the context of <!--del_lnk--> <i>p</i>-adic numbers, which differs in some interesting and surprising ways from its real and complex counterparts.<li><!--del_lnk--> Non-standard analysis, which investigates the <!--del_lnk--> hyperreal numbers and their functions and gives a <!--del_lnk--> rigorous treatment of <!--del_lnk--> infinitesimals and infinitely large numbers. It is normally classed as <!--del_lnk--> model theory.<li><!--del_lnk--> Numerical analysis, the study of algorithms for approximating the problems of continuous mathematics.</ul>
      <p><b>Classical analysis</b> would normally be understood as any work not using functional analysis techniques, and is sometimes also called <b>hard analysis</b>; it also naturally refers to the more traditional topics. The study of <a href="../../wp/d/Differential_equation.htm" title="Differential equation">differential equations</a> is now shared with other fields such as <!--del_lnk--> dynamical systems, though the overlap with &#39;straight&#39; analysis is large.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis&quot;</div>
