      <p>The <b>meteorological history of <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Katrina.htm" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a></b>, an extremely destructive <!--del_lnk--> Category 5 <a href="../../wp/t/Tropical_cyclone.htm" title="Tropical cyclone">hurricane</a>, began on <!--del_lnk--> August 23, <!--del_lnk--> 2005 when it originated as Tropical Depression Twelve near the <a href="../../wp/t/The_Bahamas.htm" title="Bahamas">Bahamas</a>. The next day, the tropical depression strengthened to a <!--del_lnk--> tropical storm, receiving the name <i><!--del_lnk--> Katrina</i>; then, it proceeded to make <!--del_lnk--> landfall on southern <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a> as a minimal hurricane.<p>After passing through Florida, Katrina weakened back to a tropical storm; however, the warm waters of the <a href="../../wp/g/Gulf_of_Mexico.htm" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> allowed it to <!--del_lnk--> rapidly intensify to the sixth strongest <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic hurricane in history. Afterwards, Katrina made <!--del_lnk--> landfall as a Category 3 storm near <!--del_lnk--> Buras-Triumph, Louisiana, and once more near the <!--del_lnk--> Mississippi/<!--del_lnk--> Louisiana border.<p>Following its landfall, Katrina progressed up through the central <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> and finally dissipated near the <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Lakes.htm" title="Great Lakes">Great Lakes</a>, when it was absorbed by a <!--del_lnk--> cold front.<p>

      <p>Tropical Depression Twelve formed over the southeastern <a href="../../wp/t/The_Bahamas.htm" title="Bahamas">Bahamas</a> at 5:00 p.m. <!--del_lnk--> EDT (2100 <!--del_lnk--> UTC) on <!--del_lnk--> August 23, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, partially from the remains of <!--del_lnk--> Tropical Depression Ten, which had dissipated due to the effects of a nearby upper <!--del_lnk--> tropospheric <!--del_lnk--> trough. While the normal standards for numbering tropical depressions in the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic</a> indicate that the old name/number is retained when a depression dissipates and regenerates, satellite data indicated that a second <!--del_lnk--> tropical wave combined with Tropical Depression Ten north of <a href="../../wp/p/Puerto_Rico.htm" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a> to form a new system, which was then designated as Tropical Depression Twelve. Simultaneously, the trough in the upper troposphere weakened, causing the <!--del_lnk--> wind shear in the area to relax, thereby allowing the new tropical depression to develop. In a later re-analysis, it was determined that the low-level circulation of Ten had completely detached and dissipated, with only the remnant mid-level circulation moving on and merging with the aforementioned second tropical wave. As a result, the criteria for keeping the same name and identity were not met.<p><a id="First_landfall" name="First_landfall"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">First landfall</span></h2>

      <p>As the atmospheric conditions surrounding Tropical Depression Twelve were favorable for <!--del_lnk--> tropical development, the system began to intensify and was upgraded to Tropical Storm <i><!--del_lnk--> Katrina</i> on the morning of <!--del_lnk--> August 24. A burst of <!--del_lnk--> convection allowed Katrina to become the fourth hurricane of the <!--del_lnk--> 2005 season on <!--del_lnk--> August 25, only two hours before it made landfall around 6:30 p.m. <!--del_lnk--> EST (2230 <!--del_lnk--> UTC) between <!--del_lnk--> Hallandale Beach and <!--del_lnk--> Aventura, <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a>. Katrina struck the peninsula with 80&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mph (130&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km/h) winds, and had a well-defined <a href="../../wp/e/Eye_%2528cyclone%2529.htm" title="Eye (cyclone)">eye</a> on <!--del_lnk--> Doppler radar, which remained intact throughout its passage over Florida. The storm weakened over land on <!--del_lnk--> August 26 to a tropical storm, but regained strength to hurricane status at 2:00 a.m. EDT (0600 UTC), approximately one hour after ending its passage through Florida and entering the <a href="../../wp/g/Gulf_of_Mexico.htm" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>. Parts of the <!--del_lnk--> Florida Keys experienced tropical storm winds throughout <!--del_lnk--> August 26, with the <!--del_lnk--> Dry Tortugas briefly experiencing hurricane-force winds.<p><a id="Gulf_of_Mexico" name="Gulf_of_Mexico"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Gulf of Mexico</span></h2>
      <p>The initial <!--del_lnk--> National Hurricane Centre forecasts predicted that Katrina would begin turning northward after landfall, eventually to hit the <!--del_lnk--> Florida Panhandle approximately three to four days later. Katrina, however, continued a westerly and west-southwesterly track, which eventually shifted the forecast track westward to New Orleans.<div class="thumb tleft">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Immediately after the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico, the low <!--del_lnk--> wind shear, good upper-level outflow, and the warm <!--del_lnk--> sea surface temperatures of the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf Loop Current caused Katrina to <!--del_lnk--> intensify rapidly. On <!--del_lnk--> August 27, the storm was upgraded to Category 3 intensity, becoming the third major hurricane of the season. An <!--del_lnk--> eyewall replacement cycle disrupted the intensification of maximum winds for about 18 hours, but almost doubled the radius of the storm. A second period of rapid intensification started by 7:00 p.m. CDT on <!--del_lnk--> August 27, and by 12:40 a.m. CDT on <!--del_lnk--> August 28, Katrina was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 145&nbsp;mph (233&nbsp;km/h). It became a Category 5 storm by 7:00 a.m. CDT, twelve hours after the beginning of the second round of rapid intensification, and reached its peak intensity at 1:00 p.m. CDT with maximum sustained winds of 175&nbsp;mph (280&nbsp;km/h), gusts of 215&nbsp;mph (344&nbsp;km/h) and a central pressure of 902&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mbar (26.64&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> inHg). The minimum pressure made Katrina, at the time, the fourth most intense <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic hurricane on record (Hurricanes <!--del_lnk--> Rita and <!--del_lnk--> Wilma would later surpass Katrina that same year).<p>By the afternoon of <!--del_lnk--> August 28, the storm was large enough that some areas of the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf Coast were already experiencing tropical storm-force winds. The centre of Katrina was about 180&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> statute miles (290&nbsp;km) from the mouth of the <a href="../../wp/m/Mississippi_River.htm" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</a>, but tropical storm-force winds extended 230&nbsp;mi (370&nbsp;km) from the centre of the storm, and hurricane-force winds extended about 105&nbsp;miles (170&nbsp;km) away. Overnight on <!--del_lnk--> August 29, and into the morning of the next day, Katrina quickly weakened (in terms of maximum sustained winds) as it began to enter another eyewall replacement cycle. The inner eyewall deteriorated before an outer eyewall had fully formed, playing an important role in the weakening. In 18&nbsp;hours, the hurricane&#39;s maximum sustained winds decreased from 170&nbsp;mph (280&nbsp;km/h) to 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h). However, storm surge remained high at landfall because large waves greater than 30&nbsp;ft (9.1&nbsp;m) in height were generated beforehand (with a <!--del_lnk--> buoy recording a 55&nbsp;ft/16.7&nbsp;m wave at sea), when Katrina was at Categories 4 and 5 in the <!--del_lnk--> Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The waves then combined with the storm surge of the large Category 3 hurricane.<div style="clear: both">

      <p>Katrina made its second landfall at 6:10 a.m. CDT on <!--del_lnk--> August 29 as a Category 3 hurricane with sustained winds of 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h) near <!--del_lnk--> Buras-Triumph, Louisiana. At landfall, hurricane-force winds extended 120&nbsp;miles (190&nbsp;km) and the storm&#39;s central pressure was 920&nbsp;mbar (27.17&nbsp;inHg). Because Katrina had just weakened from Category 4 and due to the shape of the coastline, sustained Category 4 winds likely existed on land while the eye was over water. At landfall, hurricane-force winds extended 120&nbsp;miles (190&nbsp;km) from the centre, the storm&#39;s pressure was 920&nbsp;mbar (27.17&nbsp;inHg), and its forward speed was 15&nbsp;mph (10&nbsp;km/h). Making its way up the eastern Louisiana coastline, most communities in <!--del_lnk--> Plaquemines, <!--del_lnk--> St. Bernard Parish, and <!--del_lnk--> Slidell in <!--del_lnk--> St. Tammany Parish were severely damaged by storm surge and the strong winds of the eyewall, which also grazed eastern New Orleans.<p>Original estimates indicated that Katrina had made this landfall as a Category 4 hurricane, with 135&nbsp;mph (220&nbsp;km/h) winds; however, as indicated above, the storm weakened just before landfall to Category 3 intensity. The reasons behind this weakening are not completely known yet; while the eyewall replacement cycle played a part, slightly-increasing <!--del_lnk--> shear, dropping sea surface temperatures, dry air on the western <!--del_lnk--> semicircle of the storm and interaction with the continental landmass also may have played a role in weakening the cyclone. This follows the trend of previous strong cyclones in the <a href="../../wp/g/Gulf_of_Mexico.htm" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>: all cyclones with <!--del_lnk--> minimum central pressures of 973&nbsp;mbar (28.73&nbsp;inHg) or less have weakened in the last 12&nbsp;hours before making <!--del_lnk--> landfall in the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf Coast of the United States.<p>A few hours later, after weakening slightly, Katrina made its third landfall near the Louisiana/Mississippi border with 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h) sustained winds and 928&nbsp;mbar (27.37&nbsp;inHg) pressure, still at Category 3 intensity. Its minimum pressures at its second landfall was 920&nbsp;mbar (27.17&nbsp;inHg), making Katrina the third strongest hurricane on record to make landfall on the United States, behind <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Camille.htm" title="Hurricane Camille">Hurricane Camille</a>&#39;s 909&nbsp;mbar (26.85&nbsp;inHg) reading in 1969, and the <!--del_lnk--> 1935 Labor Day Hurricane&#39;s 892&nbsp;mbar (26.35&nbsp;inHg) record.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Because the storm was so large, extremely-damaging eyewall winds and the strong northeastern quadrant of the storm pushed record <!--del_lnk--> storm surges onshore, smashing the entire Mississippi Gulf Coast, including towns in Mississippi such as <!--del_lnk--> Waveland, <!--del_lnk--> Bay St. Louis, <!--del_lnk--> Pass Christian, <!--del_lnk--> Long Beach, <!--del_lnk--> Gulfport, <!--del_lnk--> Biloxi, <!--del_lnk--> Ocean Springs, <!--del_lnk--> Gautier and <!--del_lnk--> Pascagoula, and, in Alabama, <!--del_lnk--> Bayou La Batre. The surges peaked at 28&nbsp;ft (8.5&nbsp;m) in <!--del_lnk--> Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, and at 13&nbsp;ft (4.0&nbsp;m) as far away as <!--del_lnk--> Mobile, Alabama, which saw its highest storm surge since <!--del_lnk--> 1917. Storm surge was particularly high due to the <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrology.htm" title="Hydrology">hydrology</a> of the region, the hurricane&#39;s extreme size, and the fact that it weakened only shortly before landfall. As Katrina moved inland diagonally over Mississippi, high winds cut a swath of damage that affected almost the entire state.<div style="clear: both">

      <p>Katrina maintained hurricane strength well into Mississippi, but weakened thereafter, losing hurricane strength more than 150&nbsp;mi (240&nbsp;km) inland, near <!--del_lnk--> Meridian, Mississippi. It was downgraded to a <a href="../../wp/t/Tropical_cyclone.htm" title="Tropical depression">tropical depression</a> near <!--del_lnk--> Clarksville, Tennessee and broke in half. One half continued to race northward, affecting the <!--del_lnk--> Central United States along its path, and was last distinguishable in the eastern <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Lakes.htm" title="Great Lakes">Great Lakes</a> region on <!--del_lnk--> August 31. On <!--del_lnk--> August 31, Katrina was absorbed by a frontal boundary and became a powerful extratropical low, causing 1.97-6.69&nbsp;in (50-170&nbsp;mm) of rain in 12 hours, as well as gale-force wind gusts from 31 to 61&nbsp;mph (50 to 98&nbsp;km/h) in southeastern <!--del_lnk--> Quebec and northern <!--del_lnk--> New Brunswick. In the region of <!--del_lnk--> Saguenay and <!--del_lnk--> Cote-Nord, rain caused breakdowns and failure in roads. The Cote-Nord region was isolated from rest of Quebec for at least 1 week. The other half of Katrina broke off in the eastern part of the <!--del_lnk--> Appalachians, primarily leading to a significant <!--del_lnk--> tornado outbreak in the area from central <!--del_lnk--> Georgia to central <!--del_lnk--> Pennsylvania, killing two people and causing millions of dollars in additional damage.<p>At 11:00 p.m. EDT on <!--del_lnk--> August 31, the centre of the remnant low of what was Katrina had been completely absorbed by a frontal boundary in southeastern <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>, with no discernible circulation.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorological_history_of_Hurricane_Katrina&quot;</div>
