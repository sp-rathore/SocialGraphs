      <p>Birmingham has a recorded history going back 1,000 years. In this time, it has grown from a tiny <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon farming village into a major industrial and commercial city.<p>The Birmingham area was occupied in <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman</a> times, with several military roads and a large <!--del_lnk--> fort. Birmingham started life as a small Anglo-Saxon <!--del_lnk--> hamlet in the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Early Middle Ages</a>. It was first recorded in written documents by the <a href="../../wp/d/Domesday_Book.htm" title="Domesday Book">Domesday Book</a> of 1086 as a small <!--del_lnk--> village, worth only 20 <!--del_lnk--> shillings.<p>In the 12th century, Birmingham was granted a charter to hold a <a href="../../wp/m/Market.htm" title="Market">market</a>, which in time became known as the <!--del_lnk--> Bull Ring. As a convenient location for trade, Birmingham soon developed into a small but thriving <!--del_lnk--> market town.<p>By the 16th century, Birmingham&#39;s access to supplies of <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a> ore and <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a> meant that <a href="../../wp/m/Metal.htm" title="Metal">metalworking</a> industries became established. In the 17th century Birmingham became an important manufacturing town with a reputation for producing <!--del_lnk--> small arms. Birmingham manufacturers supplied <a href="../../wp/o/Oliver_Cromwell.htm" title="Oliver Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>&#39;s forces with much of their <!--del_lnk--> weaponry during the <!--del_lnk--> English Civil War. Arms manufacture in Birmingham became a staple trade and was concentrated in the area known as the <!--del_lnk--> Gun Quarter.<p>During the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> (from the mid 18th century onwards), Birmingham grew rapidly into a major industrial centre. Unlike many other English industrial cities such as <a href="../../wp/m/Manchester.htm" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>, industry in Birmingham was based upon small <!--del_lnk--> workshops rather than large <!--del_lnk--> factories or <!--del_lnk--> mills.<table align="right" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">

      <p>From the 1760s onwards, a large network of <!--del_lnk--> canals were built across Birmingham and the <!--del_lnk--> Black Country, to transport raw materials and finished goods. By the 1820s an extensive canal system had been constructed; Birmingham is often described as having more miles of canals than <!--del_lnk--> Venice.<p><!--del_lnk--> Railways arrived in Birmingham in 1837, with the opening of the <!--del_lnk--> Grand Junction Railway and later the <!--del_lnk--> London and Birmingham Railway the railways soon linked Birmingham to every corner of Britain. <!--del_lnk--> New Street Station was opened as a joint station in 1854. And this was soon followed by the <!--del_lnk--> Great Western Railway&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Snow Hill station.<p>During the <!--del_lnk--> Victorian era, the population of Birmingham grew rapidly to well over half a million and Birmingham became the second largest population centre in England and the third in Britain after <a href="../../wp/g/Glasgow.htm" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> and then <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>. Birmingham&#39;s importance led to it being granted <a href="../../wp/c/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="City status in the United Kingdom">city status</a> in 1889 by <a href="../../wp/v/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a>.<p>The city built its own university in 1900, The <!--del_lnk--> University of Birmingham, which became the first of Britain&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Redbrick universities.<p>Birmingham was originally part of <!--del_lnk--> Warwickshire, however the city expanded in the late 19th and early 20th century, absorbing parts of <!--del_lnk--> Worcestershire to the south and <!--del_lnk--> Staffordshire to the west. The city absorbed <!--del_lnk--> Sutton Coldfield in 1974, and at the same time became part of the new <!--del_lnk--> West Midlands county.<p>Birmingham suffered heavy <!--del_lnk--> bomb damage during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> during the <!--del_lnk--> Birmingham Blitz, and partly as a result of this the city centre was extensively re-developed during the 1950s and 1960s, with many <!--del_lnk--> concrete office buildings, ring-roads, and now much-derided pedestrian subways. As a result, Birmingham gained a reputation for ugliness and was frequently described as a &quot;concrete jungle&quot;.<p>In recent years however, Birmingham has been transformed, the city centre has been extensively renovated and restored with the construction of new squares, the restoration of old streets, buildings and canals, the removal of the pedestrian subways, and the demolition and subsequent redevelopment of the <!--del_lnk--> Bull Ring shopping centre, which now includes the architecturally unique <!--del_lnk--> Selfridges building.<p>In the decades following World War II, the face of Birmingham changed dramatically, with large scale immigration from the <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth of Nations and beyond.<p>Birmingham&#39;s transition from an industrial centre to a tourism and services economy is best illustrated by the hosting of the first official <!--del_lnk--> summit of the <!--del_lnk--> G8 at the <!--del_lnk--> International Convention Centre (<!--del_lnk--> May 15 to <!--del_lnk--> May 17, <!--del_lnk--> 1998).<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>
      <p>Birmingham is situated just to the west of the geographical centre of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> on the <i>Birmingham Plateau</i> - an area of relatively high ground, ranging around 150-200 metres above sea level and crossed by Britain&#39;s main north-south <!--del_lnk--> watershed between the basins of the Rivers <a href="../../wp/r/River_Severn.htm" title="River Severn">Severn</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Trent.<p>To the south and west of the city lie the <!--del_lnk--> Lickey Hills, <!--del_lnk--> Clent Hills and <!--del_lnk--> Walton Hill, which reach 315 metres (1,033 ft) and have good views over the city.<p>Geologically Birmingham is dominated by the <i>Birmingham Fault</i> which runs diagonally through the city from the Lickey Hills in the south west, passing through <!--del_lnk--> Edgbaston, the <!--del_lnk--> Bull Ring and <!--del_lnk--> Erdington, to <!--del_lnk--> Sutton Coldfield in the north east. To the south and east of the fault the ground is largely softer <!--del_lnk--> Keuper <!--del_lnk--> Marl, interspersed with beds of <!--del_lnk--> Bunter pebbles and crossed by the valleys of the Rivers <!--del_lnk--> Tame, <!--del_lnk--> Rea and <!--del_lnk--> Cole and their tributaries. To the north and west of the fault, varying from 45-180 metres (150-600 ft) higher than the surrounding area and underlying much of the city centre, lies a long ridge of harder <!--del_lnk--> Keuper <!--del_lnk--> Sandstone.<p>Much of the area now occupied by the city was originally a northern reach of the ancient <!--del_lnk--> Forest of Arden, whose former presence can still be felt in the city&#39;s dense <!--del_lnk--> oak tree-cover and in the large number of districts (eg <!--del_lnk--> Moseley, <!--del_lnk--> Saltley, <!--del_lnk--> Hockley) with names ending in &quot;-ley&quot;, an <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon word meaning &quot;woodland clearing&quot;.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>

      <p>Although Birmingham grew to prominence as a <a href="../../wp/m/Manufacturing.htm" title="Manufacturing">manufacturing</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Engineering.htm" title="Engineering">engineering</a> centre, its economy today is dominated by the <!--del_lnk--> service sector, which in 2003 accounted for 78% of the city&#39;s economic output and 97% of its economic growth.<p>Birmingham is a major financial and administrative centre. The city&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> central business district has the largest concentration of administrative and private sector office-based employment in England outside <!--del_lnk--> Central London. Two of Britain&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> big four&quot; banks were founded in Birmingham - <!--del_lnk--> Lloyds Bank (now <!--del_lnk--> Lloyds TSB) in 1765 and the <!--del_lnk--> Midland Bank (now <!--del_lnk--> HSBC Bank plc) in 1836 - and today the city employs 108,000 in banking, finance and insurance - exceeded in the UK only by <!--del_lnk--> Westminster and the <!--del_lnk--> City of London. Birmingham has particular strengths in accountancy and commercial law, with the Birmingham Law Society having over 300 member firms.<p>Tourism is also an increasingly important part of the local economy. With major facilities such as the <!--del_lnk--> International Convention Centre and <!--del_lnk--> National Exhibition Centre the Birmingham area accounts for 42% of the UK conference and exhibition trade. The city&#39;s sporting and cultural venues attract large numbers of visitors, as does the nightlife district around <!--del_lnk--> Broad Street. In total the <!--del_lnk--> West Midlands County attracts 1.1 million international visitors and 4.2 million domestic overnight visitors per year, making it the UK&#39;s third most-visited county after <!--del_lnk--> Greater London and <!--del_lnk--> Devon.<p>With an annual turnover of &pound;2.2bn, Birmingham City Centre is the UK&#39;s second largest retail centre, with the country&#39;s busiest shopping centre - the <!--del_lnk--> Bull Ring with 36m visitors per year, and its third largest department store - <!--del_lnk--> House of Fraser (formerly <i>Rackhams</i>) on <!--del_lnk--> Corporation Street. Other major shopping areas include <!--del_lnk--> New Street, High Street, the Pavilions and <!--del_lnk--> Pallasades shopping centres and the upmarket <!--del_lnk--> Mailbox.<p>Birmingham&#39;s industrial heritage pre-dates the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, and up until the 20th century the city maintained a tradition of individual craftsmen, sometimes working independently in their own back yards or on piecework rates in rented workshops, alongside larger factories. During the Industrial Revolution many factories, foundries and businesses prospered in the city, including the areas known as the <!--del_lnk--> Gun Quarter and <!--del_lnk--> Jewellery Quarter. <!--del_lnk--> Pen manufacture in Birmingham helped revolutionise writing across the world with many companies based in and around the Jewellery Quarter. The <!--del_lnk--> Jewellery Quarter is still the largest concentration of dedicated jewellers in Europe, and one third of the jewellery manufactured in the UK is made within one mile of Birmingham city centre. Until 2003, <a href="../../wp/c/Coin.htm" title="Coin">coins</a> for circulation were manufactured in the Jewellery Quarter at the <!--del_lnk--> Birmingham Mint, the oldest independent <!--del_lnk--> mint in the world, which continues to produce <!--del_lnk--> commemorative coins and <!--del_lnk--> medals.<p><a href="../../wp/j/James_Watt.htm" title="James Watt">James Watt</a> improved the <a href="../../wp/s/Steam_engine.htm" title="Steam engine">steam engine</a> while working in the city, and historically the largest manufacturers in the city have been associated with the <!--del_lnk--> steam, <!--del_lnk--> electric and <!--del_lnk--> petrol transport and power industries. The city&#39;s workers designed and constructed <!--del_lnk--> railway <!--del_lnk--> carriages, <!--del_lnk--> steam engines, <!--del_lnk--> motorcycles, <!--del_lnk--> bicycles, <!--del_lnk--> automobiles and even &ndash; unusually for somewhere so far from the sea &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> ships, which were made as pre-fabricated sections, then assembled at the coast. Birmingham was home to two major car factories: <!--del_lnk--> MG Rover in <!--del_lnk--> Longbridge and <!--del_lnk--> Jaguar in <!--del_lnk--> Castle Bromwich. The MG Rover car works went into administration in 2005, resulting in the plant being mothballed and the loss of 6,000 jobs at the site, plus more in the <!--del_lnk--> supply chain. Things are looking more positive in 2006 with the <!--del_lnk--> Nanjing Automobile Group (MG Rover&#39;s main purchasers) hoping to restart production of MG cars at Longbridge by 2007. Another small sports car manufacturer has set up business in the Longbridge premises.<p>The city&#39;s products include motor vehicles, vehicle components and accessories, <a href="../../wp/w/Weapon.htm" title="Weapon">weapons</a>, electrical equipment, <!--del_lnk--> plastics, <!--del_lnk--> machine tools, <!--del_lnk--> chemicals, food, <a href="../../wp/j/Jewellery.htm" title="Jewellery">jewellery</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/Glass.htm" title="Glass">glass</a>. Scientific research (including research into <!--del_lnk--> nanotechnology at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Birmingham) is expanding in the city. Other famous <!--del_lnk--> brands from the city include <!--del_lnk--> Ariel Motorcycles, <!--del_lnk--> Bakelite, <!--del_lnk--> Bird&#39;s Custard, <!--del_lnk--> Brylcreem, <!--del_lnk--> BSA, <!--del_lnk--> Cadbury&#39;s chocolate, <!--del_lnk--> Chad Valley toys, <!--del_lnk--> Halfords, <!--del_lnk--> HP Sauce (but soon to be closed down by its American owners Heinz), <!--del_lnk--> Norton Motorcycles, <!--del_lnk--> Triumph Motorcycles, <!--del_lnk--> Typhoo Tea, <!--del_lnk--> Velocette Motorcycles and <!--del_lnk--> Valor, the list is extensive.<p>Although Birmingham has seen strong economic growth overall in recent years, with per capita GDP rising from 2% above the UK average in 1995 to 7% above in 2003, the benefits have not been felt evenly throughout the city. Many of the higher skilled jobs generated have gone to commuters from the surrounding area, and the two parliamentary consituencies with the highest unemployment rates in the UK - <!--del_lnk--> Ladywood and <!--del_lnk--> Sparkbrook and Small Heath - are both in inner-city Birmingham. Growth has also placed significant strain on the city&#39;s transport infrastructure, with many major roads and the central <!--del_lnk--> New Street railway station operating considerably over capacity during peak periods.<p><a id="Architecture" name="Architecture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Architecture</span></h2>

      <p>Although Birmingham has existed as a settlement for over a thousand years, today&#39;s city is overwhelmingly a product of the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, as the real growth of the city began with the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>. Consequently, relatively few buildings survive from its earlier history.<p>Traces of <!--del_lnk--> medieval Birmingham can be seen in the oldest churches, notably the original <!--del_lnk--> parish church, <!--del_lnk--> St Martin in the Bull Ring, where a church has stood since at least the 12th century. The current church (begun around 1290) was extensively re-built in the 1870s, retaining some original walls and foundations. A few other buildings from the medieval and <!--del_lnk--> Tudor periods survive, among them <i><!--del_lnk--> The Lad In The Lane</i> <!--del_lnk--> public house in <!--del_lnk--> Erdington,also <!--del_lnk--> <i>The Old Crown</i> <!--del_lnk--> public house in <!--del_lnk--> Digbeth, the 15th century <i>Saracen&#39;s Head</i> public house and Old Grammar School in <!--del_lnk--> Kings Norton and <!--del_lnk--> Blakesley Hall in <!--del_lnk--> Yardley.<p>The city grew rapidly from <!--del_lnk--> Georgian times and a number of buildings survive from this period. Among them are <!--del_lnk--> St Philip&#39;s Cathedral, originally built as a parish church, St Paul&#39;s Church in the largely <!--del_lnk--> Georgian <!--del_lnk--> St Paul&#39;s Square, <!--del_lnk--> Soho House in <!--del_lnk--> Handsworth, the home of <!--del_lnk--> Matthew Boulton, <!--del_lnk--> Perrott&#39;s Folly in <!--del_lnk--> Ladywood (which is said to have later inspired <a href="../../wp/j/J._R._R._Tolkien.htm" title="J. R. R. Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>), and the <!--del_lnk--> Town Hall.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Victorian era saw extensive building across the city. Major public buildings such as the Law Courts, the <!--del_lnk--> Council House (see picture) and the <!--del_lnk--> Museum &amp; Art Gallery were constructed, many under the auspices of <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Chamberlain&#39;s reforming mayoralty. <!--del_lnk--> Saint Chad&#39;s Cathedral, built in 1839 by <!--del_lnk--> Augustus Pugin, was the first <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic Cathedral to be built in the UK since the <!--del_lnk--> Reformation. The characteristic materials of Victorian Birmingham are <!--del_lnk--> red brick and terracotta, and many fine Victorian buildings have been retained on <!--del_lnk--> New Street and <!--del_lnk--> Corporation Street in the city centre. Across the city, the need to house the industrial workers gave rise to miles of redbrick streets and terraces, many of <!--del_lnk--> back-to-back houses, some of which were later to become inner-city <!--del_lnk--> slums.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Continued population growth in the <!--del_lnk--> interwar period, saw vast estates of <!--del_lnk--> semi-detached houses being built on <!--del_lnk--> greenfield land in outlying parts of the city such as <!--del_lnk--> Kingstanding and <!--del_lnk--> Weoley Castle, but the coming of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/The_Blitz.htm" title="The Blitz">the Blitz</a> claimed many lives and many beautiful buildings too. However, the destruction that took place in post-war Birmingham was also extensive: dozens of fine Victorian buildings like the intricate glass-roofed <!--del_lnk--> Birmingham New Street Station, and the old Central Library, were razed in the 1950s and 1960s and replaced with <!--del_lnk--> modernist <!--del_lnk--> concrete buildings. In inner-city areas too, much Victorian housing was <!--del_lnk--> redeveloped and existing communities were relocated to <!--del_lnk--> tower block <!--del_lnk--> estates like <!--del_lnk--> Castle Vale and <!--del_lnk--> Bromford.<p>The planning decisions of the post-war years were to have a profound effect on the image of Birmingham in subsequent decades, with the mix of <!--del_lnk--> ring roads, <!--del_lnk--> shopping malls and tower blocks often referred to as a &#39;<!--del_lnk--> concrete jungle&#39;. In more recent years, Birmingham has learnt from what many see as the mistakes of the 1960s and instituted the largest tower block demolition and renovation programmes anywhere in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>. There has been a lot of new building in the city centre in recent years, including the award-winning <!--del_lnk--> Future Systems&#39; <!--del_lnk--> Selfridges building, an irregularly-shaped structure covered in thousands of reflective discs (see picture), the <!--del_lnk--> Brindleyplace development and the <!--del_lnk--> Millennium Point science and technology centre.<p>Highrise development has slowed since the 1970s and mainly in recent years due to enforcements on the heights of buildings as they could affect aircraft from the International Airport. <!--del_lnk--> Beetham Tower, standing on Holloway Circus was originally going to be about 190 metres tall however, the <!--del_lnk--> CAA forced the Beetham organisation to reduce the height of the tower to 122 metres. Another tower that has been forced to be reduced in height is <!--del_lnk--> Arena Central Tower which is yet to be constructed. The tower was originally going to be 245 metres in height however after the attacks on the World Trade Centers in New York City, it was shortened to 180 metres. However, these rules are now being scrapped as it has been recognised that interest in highrise architecture for the city has been reduced. One of the latest towers that has been allowed to be increased in height is the Broad Street Tower which is set to be 134 metres and will most likely be approved due to the airport removing all objections to it.<p>Some fine architects hail from the city such as <!--del_lnk--> Glenn Howells and <!--del_lnk--> Ken Shuttleworth.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>

      <p>Birmingham was made a city in 1889. Stemming from this, the <!--del_lnk--> Diocese of Birmingham was created in 1905 and <!--del_lnk--> St Philip&#39;s was accordingly upgraded from church to cathedral status. The cathedral is surrounded by a churchyard which is a popular congregating area. The other cathedral in the city is <!--del_lnk--> Saint Chad&#39;s Cathedral, which is the seat of the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic Province of Birmingham. <!--del_lnk--> St Martin in the Bull Ring is a Grade II listed church in the centre of St Martin&#39;s Square in the Bullring Shopping Centre.<p>There is also a variety of non-Christian religions in the city. In the 1960s <!--del_lnk--> Central Mosque was constructed for the Muslim community of the city. It is one of the largest mosques in Europe.<p><a id="Leisure" name="Leisure"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Leisure</span></h3>
      <p>Two major developments have regenerated two parts of the city in recent years. <!--del_lnk--> Brindleyplace is a major canalside development which required the restoration of many old warehouses into restaurants and the construction of office buildings. The other development was the <!--del_lnk--> Birmingham Bull Ring which replaced an older shopping centre which had become disliked by the public.<p>Another modern shopping centre is <!--del_lnk--> The Mailbox which features many expensive designer stores as well as offices and apartments next to the canals.<p><!--del_lnk--> The Convention Quarter features many broadcasting companies and radio stations in the city centre. The area is modern and was developed around the same time as Brindleyplace. The <!--del_lnk--> National Sealife Centre is located alongside the canals next to the main square at Brindleyplace.<p>Outside of the city centre is <!--del_lnk--> Star City which is a major entertainment complex which houses a large cinema, casino and restaurant area.<p>Other areas of interest are:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Town Hall which is located next to Victoria Square and Chamberlain Square.<li><!--del_lnk--> Birmingham University<li><!--del_lnk--> National Exhibition Centre (The NEC) which is a major music and exhibition venue near the airport.</ul>

      <p>Due in part to its central location in <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, Birmingham is a major transport hub on the <!--del_lnk--> motorway, <a href="../../wp/r/Rail_transport.htm" title="Rail transport">rail</a>, and <a href="../../wp/c/Canal.htm" title="Canal">canal</a> networks.<p><a id="Roads" name="Roads"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Roads</span></h3>
      <p>Birmingham is served by a number of major roads, including the <!--del_lnk--> M5, <a href="../../wp/m/M6_motorway.htm" title="M6 motorway">M6</a>, <!--del_lnk--> M6 Toll, <!--del_lnk--> M40, and <!--del_lnk--> M42 motorways. Junction 6 of the M6 is also one of Birmingham&#39;s most famous landmarks, and probably the most famous motorway junction in the UK: <!--del_lnk--> Spaghetti Junction, officially called the Gravelly Hill Interchange. The city is also known for the numerous junctions with pedestrian tunnels within the city centre itself which have been redeveloped through demolition or reorganisation. One of the most significant of these redevelopments was <!--del_lnk--> Masshouse (also known as the &quot;<i>Concrete collar</i>&quot;) which saw the demolition of an entire elevated junction. Other projects include Snow Hill <!--del_lnk--> Queensway with St Chads Circus.<p>Birmingham also forms a major hub in the <!--del_lnk--> National Express coach network, which is based in Birmingham and operates services from <!--del_lnk--> Digbeth Coach Station. This is due to be redeveloped by 2008 after plans to build a replacement coach station next to Snow Hill Station on Great Charles Street Queensway were abandoned due to a breakdown in discussions between National Express and the City Council. A temporary coach station is due to be made at the former <!--del_lnk--> Volkswagen dealership on the opposite side of the road to the coach station. Birmingham also has a Megabus service to London.<p><a id="Airports_and_aviation" name="Airports_and_aviation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Airports and aviation</span></h3>
      <p>Birmingham is served by <!--del_lnk--> Birmingham International Airport, which has flights to <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>, the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> and <!--del_lnk--> South Asia. It is the fifth busiest airport in the UK, and handles (as of 2005) nine million passengers a year. The airport has published a master plan for its development up to 2030. The first major element is an extension to the main runway, targeted for completion in time for the <!--del_lnk--> 2012 London Olympics. The extension will increase the runway length to 3000 metres, as well as including a starter strip to provide a maximum takeoff run of 3150 metres.<p><a id="Local_transport" name="Local_transport"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Local transport</span></h3>
      <p>Local public transport is by <!--del_lnk--> bus, local train and <!--del_lnk--> tram (the <!--del_lnk--> Midland Metro <!--del_lnk--> light railway system between the city centre and <!--del_lnk--> Wolverhampton).<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Midland Metro tram system is due for expansion which will see it on major streets in the city centre such as <!--del_lnk--> Broad Street which has been partially funded by the developers of <!--del_lnk--> Arena Central at a cost of &pound;5 million.<p>The bus services in the city are run by Travel West Midlands (TWM) with the routes also adopted by smaller bus companies in different buses. Travel West Midlands are constantly introducing newer, more modern buses to replace older buses which have been frowned upon due to the pollution they create. Routes are sometimes reorganised with the most recent being the bus routes from <!--del_lnk--> Sutton Coldfield to the city centre.<p>The number 11A and 11C <!--del_lnk--> outer circle bus routes are the longest urban bus routes in Europe. In recent years, the council has tried to move bus stops out of the city centre (especially off Corporation Street) to ease congestion and move them to the boundaries of the city centre. In a notable attempt to move buses away from the city centre, the bus mall, a large area for buses to stop, was constructed next to the <!--del_lnk--> Bull Ring Shopping Centre however due to the complicated layout, the amount of buses travelling through was reduced as it caused a several accidents.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The city&#39;s main station, <!--del_lnk--> Birmingham New Street, is at the centre of the national rail network, whilst <!--del_lnk--> Birmingham International railway station serves <!--del_lnk--> Birmingham International Airport. Two other major stations are located in the city centre: <!--del_lnk--> Birmingham Snow Hill Station and <!--del_lnk--> Birmingham Moor Street railway station. The first railway station in the city centre was <!--del_lnk--> Curzon Street railway station which opened in 1838, however, its location on the edge of the city centre made it unsuccessful and it closed in 1966.<p>In 2005, the City Council launched a strategy to encourage <!--del_lnk--> cycling. The council developed the city-wide cycle route network by identifying and tackling hazardous locations for cyclists and creating better cycling facilities. They also took cyclists&#39; needs into account in all road maintenance and construction. In 1995, they set a target to increase cycle use in Birmingham from 1.5% to 5% by the year 2005.<p><a id="Canals" name="Canals"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Canals</span></h3>
      <p>Birmingham is also notable for its <!--del_lnk--> canal system; formerly the lifeblood of the city&#39;s industries, their use is now mainly for pleasure. There are 35 miles (60 kilometres) of canals in the city, most remaining navigable. The abundance of canals has led to the frequently made claim that &quot;Birmingham has more canals than <!--del_lnk--> Venice&quot;. Although this is in some sense correct (Venice has 26 miles (41 kilometres)), Birmingham is far larger , and the types of <!--del_lnk--> waterway are very different. Birmingham&#39;s canals are comparatively shallow artificial channels, while those in Venice are primarily reinforced natural channels between islands of the lagoon on which the city stands.<p><a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h2>

The <!--del_lnk--> Birmingham Conservatoire and <!--del_lnk--> Birmingham School of Acting, both now part of UCE, offer higher education in the arts. The conservatoire planning to move from their current location in Adrian Boult Hall to a site in the Eastside which was first intended for a large library.<p>A minority of the city&#39;s children receive <!--del_lnk--> private education. <!--del_lnk--> King Edward&#39;s School is perhaps the most prestigious <!--del_lnk--> independent school in the city. The seven schools of The King Edward VI Foundation are known nationally for setting the very highest academic standards and all of the schools consistently achieve top positions in national league tables.<p><!--del_lnk--> Matthew Boulton College is also located in the city.
