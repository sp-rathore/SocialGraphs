      <p>A grandson of President <a href="../../wp/w/William_Henry_Harrison.htm" title="William Henry Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a> and great-grandson of <!--del_lnk--> Benjamin Harrison V, Benjamin was born on <!--del_lnk--> August 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1833, in <!--del_lnk--> North Bend, <!--del_lnk--> Hamilton County, Ohio as the second of eight children of <!--del_lnk--> John Scott Harrison (later a U.S. <!--del_lnk--> Congressman from <!--del_lnk--> Ohio) and Elizabeth Ramsey Irwin. He attended <!--del_lnk--> Miami University, <!--del_lnk--> Oxford, Ohio, where he was a member of the <!--del_lnk--> fraternity <!--del_lnk--> Phi Delta Theta, (later in life, he joined <!--del_lnk--> Delta Chi) and graduated in 1852. He studied law in <!--del_lnk--> Cincinnati, Ohio, then moved to <!--del_lnk--> Indianapolis, Indiana in 1854. He was admitted to the <!--del_lnk--> bar and became reporter of the decisions of the <!--del_lnk--> Indiana Supreme Court.<p>Harrison served in the <!--del_lnk--> Union Army during the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a>, and was appointed Commander of the 70th Indiana Volunteer Infantry <!--del_lnk--> Regiment in August 1862. The unit performed reconnaissance duty and guarded railroads in Kentucky and Tennessee until <!--del_lnk--> Sherman&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Atlanta Campaign in 1864. Harrison was <!--del_lnk--> brevetted as a <!--del_lnk--> brigadier general, and commanded a <!--del_lnk--> Brigade at <!--del_lnk--> Resaca, <!--del_lnk--> Cassville, New Hope Church, Lost Mountain, <!--del_lnk--> Kennesaw Mountain, <!--del_lnk--> Marietta, Peach Tree Creek, and the Siege of Atlanta. Harrison was later transferred to the <!--del_lnk--> Army of the Cumberland and participated in the Siege of Nashville and the Grand Review in Washington D.C. before mustering out in 1865.<p>While in the field in October 1864, he was re-elected reporter of the Ohio State Supreme Court and served four years. He was an unsuccessful <!--del_lnk--> Republican candidate for <!--del_lnk--> governor of Indiana in 1876. He was appointed a member of the <!--del_lnk--> Mississippi River Commission, in 1879, and elected as a Republican to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Senate.htm" title="United States Senate">United States Senate</a>, where he served from <!--del_lnk--> March 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1881, to <!--del_lnk--> March 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1887. He was chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Transportation Routes to the Seaboard (<!--del_lnk--> 47th Congress) and U.S. Senate Committee on Territories (<!--del_lnk--> 48th and <!--del_lnk--> 49th Congresses).<p>Harrison was married twice. On <!--del_lnk--> October 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1853, he married <!--del_lnk--> Caroline Lavina Scott (1832-1892). They had two children who lived to adulthood, Russell Benjamin Harrison (1854-1936) and <!--del_lnk--> Mary Harrison McKee (1858-1930), as well as a daughter who died very shortly after birth in 1861. After Caroline Harrison&#39;s death of <a href="../../wp/t/Tuberculosis.htm" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> in 1892 while Harrison was in office, he married his wife&#39;s widowed niece and former secretary <!--del_lnk--> Mary Scott Lord Dimmick (1858-1948) on <!--del_lnk--> April 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1896. They had one daughter, <!--del_lnk--> Elizabeth Harrison (1897-1955).<p><a id="Presidency_1889-1893" name="Presidency_1889-1893"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Presidency 1889-1893</span></h2>

      <p>After beating <!--del_lnk--> John Sherman for the Republican presidential nomination, Harrison was elected President of the United States in 1888. In the <!--del_lnk--> Presidential election, Harrison received 100,000 fewer popular votes than incumbent President <a href="../../wp/g/Grover_Cleveland.htm" title="Grover Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a> but carried the <!--del_lnk--> Electoral College 233 to 168. Although Harrison had made no political bargains, his supporters had given innumerable pledges upon his behalf. When Boss <!--del_lnk--> Matthew Quay of <!--del_lnk--> Pennsylvania heard that Harrison ascribed his narrow victory to Providence, Quay exclaimed that Harrison would never know &quot;how close a number of men were compelled to approach...the penitentiary to make him President.&quot; He was inaugurated on <!--del_lnk--> March 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1889, and served through <!--del_lnk--> March 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1893. Harrison was also known as the &quot;centennial president&quot; because his inauguration was the 100th anniversary of the inauguration of <a href="../../wp/g/George_Washington.htm" title="George Washington">George Washington</a>.<p>For Harrison, <!--del_lnk--> Civil Service reform was a no-win situation. Congress was split so far apart on the issue that agreeing to any measure for one side would alienate the other. The issue became a popular <!--del_lnk--> political football of the time and was immortalized in a cartoon captioned &quot;What can I do when both parties insist on kicking?&quot;<p>Harrison was proud of the vigorous foreign policy which he helped shape. The first <!--del_lnk--> Pan-American Congress met in <a href="../../wp/w/Washington%252C_D.C..htm" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> in 1889, establishing an information centre which later became the <!--del_lnk--> Pan American Union. At the end of his administration, Harrison submitted to the Senate a treaty to annex <!--del_lnk--> Hawaii; to his disappointment, President Cleveland later withdrew it.<p>The most perplexing domestic problem Harrison faced was the <!--del_lnk--> tariff issue. The high tariff rates in effect had created a surplus of money in the Treasury. Low-tariff advocates argued that the surplus was hurting business. Republican leaders in Congress successfully met the challenge. Representative <a href="../../wp/w/William_McKinley.htm" title="William McKinley">William McKinley</a> and Senator <!--del_lnk--> Nelson W. Aldrich framed a still higher tariff bill; some rates were intentionally prohibitive.<p>Harrison tried to make the tariff more acceptable by writing in reciprocity provisions. To cope with the Treasury surplus, the tariff was removed from imported raw <a href="../../wp/s/Sugar.htm" title="Sugar">sugar</a>; sugar growers within the United States were given two cents per pound bounty on their production.<p>Long before the end of the Harrison Administration, the Treasury surplus had evaporated and prosperity seemed about to disappear. Congressional elections in 1890 went against the Republicans, and party leaders decided to abandon President Harrison, although he had cooperated with Congress on party legislation. Nevertheless, his party renominated him in 1892, but he was defeated by Cleveland. Just 2 weeks earlier, on <!--del_lnk--> October 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1892, Harrison&#39;s wife, Caroline died after a long battle with <a href="../../wp/t/Tuberculosis.htm" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>.<p><a id="Significant_events" name="Significant_events"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Significant events</span></h3>
