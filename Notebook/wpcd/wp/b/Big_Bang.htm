      <p>The Big Bang theory developed from observations of the structure of the universe and from theoretical considerations. Observers determined that most &quot;spiral nebulae&quot; were receding from Earth; but the observers themselves were unaware of the cosmological implications of this fact, or that the supposed nebulae were actually galaxies outside our own <a href="../../wp/m/Milky_Way.htm" title="Milky Way">Milky Way</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Georges Lema&icirc;tre, a Belgian Roman Catholic priest, independently derived the <!--del_lnk--> Friedmann-Lema&icirc;tre-Robertson-Walker equations from <a href="../../wp/a/Albert_Einstein.htm" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> equations of <!--del_lnk--> general relativity in 1927 and proposed, on the basis of the recession of spiral <!--del_lnk--> nebulae, that the universe began as a simple &quot;primeval <a href="../../wp/a/Atom.htm" title="Atom">atom</a>&quot;&mdash;what was later called the Big Bang.<p>Soon after, in 1929, <!--del_lnk--> Edwin Hubble provided an observational basis for Lema&icirc;tre&#39;s theory. He discovered that, seen from Earth, light from other galaxies is <a href="../../wp/r/Redshift.htm" title="Redshift">redshifted</a> proportionally to their distance from Earth. This fact is now known as <a href="../../wp/h/Hubble%2527s_law.htm" title="Hubble&#39;s law">Hubble&#39;s law</a>. Given the <!--del_lnk--> cosmological principle whereby the universe, when viewed on sufficiently large distance scales, has no preferred directions or preferred places, Hubble&#39;s law implied that the universe was expanding, contradicting the infinite and unchanging <!--del_lnk--> static universe scenario developed by Einstein.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>This idea allowed for two distinct possibilities. One possibility was <!--del_lnk--> Fred Hoyle&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> steady state model whereby new matter would be created as the universe seemed to expand. In this model, the universe is roughly the same at any point in time. The other was Lema&icirc;tre&#39;s Big Bang theory, advocated and developed by <!--del_lnk--> George Gamow. It was actually Hoyle who coined the name of Lema&icirc;tre&#39;s theory, referring to it sarcastically as &quot;this <i>big bang</i> idea&quot; during a program broadcast on <!--del_lnk--> March 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1949, by the <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a> <!--del_lnk--> Third Programme. Hoyle repeated the term in further broadcasts in early 1950, as part of a series of five lectures entitled <i>The Nature of Things</i>. The text of each lecture was published in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Listener</i> a week after the broadcast, the first time that the term &quot;big bang&quot; appeared in print. While Hoyle&#39;s &quot;steady state&quot; and Lema&icirc;tre&#39;s &quot;Big Bang&quot; were the two most popular models used to explain Hubble&#39;s observations, other ideas were also proposed. Some of these <!--del_lnk--> alternatives included the <!--del_lnk--> Milne model, <!--del_lnk--> Richard Tolman&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> oscillatory universe, and <!--del_lnk--> Fritz Zwicky&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> tired light hypothesis.<p>For a while, support was split between the &quot;steady state&quot; and &quot;Big Bang&quot; theories. However, the observational evidence eventually began to favour the latter. The discovery of the <a href="../../wp/c/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation.htm" title="Cosmic microwave background radiation">cosmic microwave background radiation</a> in 1964 secured its place as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the cosmos. Much of the current work in cosmology includes understanding how galaxies form in the context of the Big Bang, understanding what happened at the Big Bang and reconciling observations with the basic theory.<p>Huge advances in Big Bang cosmology were made in the late 1990s and the early 21st century as a result of major advances in <a href="../../wp/t/Telescope.htm" title="Telescope">telescope</a> technology in combination with large amounts of satellite data such as that from <!--del_lnk--> COBE, the <a href="../../wp/h/Hubble_Space_Telescope.htm" title="Hubble Space Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> and <!--del_lnk--> WMAP. Such data have allowed cosmologists to calculate many of the parameters of the Big Bang to a new level of precision and led to the unexpected discovery that the expansion of the universe appears to be accelerating.

      <p>Based on measurements of the expansion of the universe using <!--del_lnk--> Type 1a supernovae, measurements of temperature fluctuations in the <a href="../../wp/c/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation.htm" title="Cosmic microwave background radiation">cosmic microwave background</a>, and measurements of the <!--del_lnk--> correlation function of galaxies, the universe has a calculated <!--del_lnk--> age of <!--del_lnk--> 13.7 &plusmn; 0.2 billion years. The agreement of these three independent measurements is considered strong evidence for the so-called <!--del_lnk--> &Lambda;CDM model that describes the detailed nature of the contents of the universe.<p>The early universe was filled homogeneously and isotropically with an incredibly high <a href="../../wp/e/Energy.htm" title="Energy">energy</a> density and concomitantly huge <!--del_lnk--> temperatures and <!--del_lnk--> pressures. It expanded and cooled, going through <!--del_lnk--> phase transitions pertinent to elementary particles.<p>Approximately 10<sup>&minus;35</sup> seconds after the <!--del_lnk--> Planck epoch a phase transition caused the universe to experience <!--del_lnk--> exponential growth during a period called <a href="../../wp/c/Cosmic_inflation.htm" title="Cosmic inflation">cosmic inflation</a>. After inflation stopped, the material components of the universe were in the form of a <!--del_lnk--> quark-gluon plasma (also including all other particles&mdash;and perhaps experimentally produced recently as a quark-gluon liquid <!--del_lnk--> ) in which the constituent particles were all moving <!--del_lnk--> relativistically. As the universe continued growing in size, the temperature dropped. At a certain temperature, by an as-yet-unknown transition called <!--del_lnk--> baryogenesis, the quarks and gluons combined into <!--del_lnk--> baryons such as protons and neutrons, somehow producing the observed <!--del_lnk--> asymmetry between <a href="../../wp/m/Matter.htm" title="Matter">matter</a> and <!--del_lnk--> antimatter. Still lower temperatures led to further <!--del_lnk--> symmetry breaking phase transitions that put the <!--del_lnk--> forces of physics and <!--del_lnk--> elementary particles into their present form. Later, some protons and neutrons combined to form the universe&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> deuterium and <a href="../../wp/h/Helium.htm" title="Helium">helium</a> <!--del_lnk--> nuclei in a process called <!--del_lnk--> Big Bang nucleosynthesis. As the universe cooled, matter gradually stopped moving relativistically and its <!--del_lnk--> rest mass energy density came to <a href="../../wp/g/Gravitation.htm" title="Gravity">gravitationally</a> dominate that of <a href="../../wp/e/Electromagnetic_radiation.htm" title="Electromagnetic radiation">radiation</a>. After about 300,000 years the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a>); hence the radiation <!--del_lnk--> decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded. This relic radiation is the cosmic microwave background.<p>Over time, the slightly denser regions of the nearly uniformly distributed matter gravitationally attracted nearby matter and thus grew even denser, forming gas clouds, <a href="../../wp/s/Star.htm" title="Star">stars</a>, galaxies, and the other astronomical structures observable today. The details of this process depend on the amount and type of matter in the universe. The three possible types are known as <!--del_lnk--> cold dark matter, <!--del_lnk--> hot dark matter, and <!--del_lnk--> baryonic matter. The best measurements available (from <!--del_lnk--> WMAP) show that the dominant form of matter in the universe is cold dark matter. The other two types of matter make up less than 20% of the matter in the universe.<p>The universe today appears to be dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as <!--del_lnk--> dark energy. Approximately 70% of the total energy density of today&#39;s universe is in this form. This dark energy causes the <a href="../../wp/h/Hubble%2527s_law.htm" title="Hubble&#39;s law">expansion of the universe</a> to deviate from a linear velocity-distance relationship, observed as a faster than expected expansion at very large distances. Dark energy in its simplest formulation takes the form of a <!--del_lnk--> cosmological constant term in <!--del_lnk--> Einstein&#39;s field equations of general relativity, but its composition is unknown and, more generally, the details of its <!--del_lnk--> equation of state and relationship with the <!--del_lnk--> standard model of particle physics continue to be investigated both observationally and theoretically.<p>All these observations are encapsulated in the <!--del_lnk--> &Lambda;CDM model of cosmology, which is a <!--del_lnk--> mathematical model of the Big Bang with six free parameters. Mysteries appear as one looks closer to the beginning, when particle energies were higher than can yet be studied by experiment. There is no compelling physical model for the first 10<sup>&minus;33</sup> seconds of the universe, before the phase transition that <!--del_lnk--> grand unification theory predicts. At the &quot;first instant&quot;, Einstein&#39;s theory of gravitation predicts a <!--del_lnk--> gravitational singularity where densities become infinite. To resolve this <a href="../../wp/p/Physical_paradox.htm" title="Physical paradox">paradox</a>, a theory of <!--del_lnk--> quantum gravitation is needed. Understanding this period of the history of the universe is one of the greatest <!--del_lnk--> unsolved problems in physics.<p>See also: <b><!--del_lnk--> Timeline of the Big Bang</b><p><a id="Theoretical_underpinnings" name="Theoretical_underpinnings"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Theoretical underpinnings</span></h2>
      <p>As it stands today, the Big Bang is dependent on three assumptions:<ol>
       <li>The universality of <!--del_lnk--> physical laws<li>The <!--del_lnk--> cosmological principle<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Copernican principle</ol>
      <p>When first developed, these ideas were simply taken as postulates, but today there are efforts underway to test each of them. Tests of the universality of physical laws have found that the largest possible deviation of the <!--del_lnk--> fine structure constant over the age of the universe is of order 10<sup>-5</sup>. The <!--del_lnk--> isotropy of the universe that defines the Cosmological Principle has been tested to a level of 10<sup>-5</sup> and the universe has been measured to be homogeneous on the largest scales to the 10% level. There are efforts underway to test the Copernican Principle by means of looking at the interaction of <!--del_lnk--> galaxy groups and clusters with the CMB through the <!--del_lnk--> Sunyaev-Zel&#39;dovich effect to a level of 1% accuracy.<p>Using these assumptions, combined with <a href="../../wp/a/Albert_Einstein.htm" title="Einstein">Einstein</a>&#39;s theory of <!--del_lnk--> general relativity, one finds that <!--del_lnk--> spacetime should be described by a <!--del_lnk--> homogeneous and <!--del_lnk--> isotropic <!--del_lnk--> metric, which must therefore be a <!--del_lnk--> FRW metric. These metrics rely on a <!--del_lnk--> coordinate chart or grid being laid down over all <!--del_lnk--> spacetime, with which we can specify the location of points (e.g., galaxies, stars...) in the universe. The specific chart used is called a <!--del_lnk--> comoving coordinate system, since the grid is designed to expand along with the universe, and so objects that are carried along by the expansion of the universe remain at fixed points on the grid. While their <i>coordinate</i> distance (<!--del_lnk--> comoving distance) remains constant, the <i>physical</i> distance between two such comoving points expands proportionally with the <!--del_lnk--> scale factor of the universe. See also <a href="../../wp/m/Metric_expansion_of_space.htm" title="Metric expansion of space">metric expansion of space</a>.<p>As the universe can be described by such coordinates, the Big Bang is not an explosion of matter moving outward to fill an empty universe; <a href="../../wp/m/Metric_expansion_of_space.htm" title="Metric expansion of space">what is expanding is space itself</a>. It is this expansion that causes the physical distance between two comoving points to increase. Objects that are bound together (such as <a href="../../wp/a/Atom.htm" title="Atom">atoms</a>, people, <a href="../../wp/s/Star.htm" title="Star">stars</a>, the <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_System.htm" title="Solar system">solar system</a>, or <!--del_lnk--> galaxies) do not expand with spacetime&#39;s expansion because the forces that bind them together are strong compared with the Hubble expansion that is pulling them apart.<p>One can also define a <!--del_lnk--> conformal time <span class="texhtml">&eta;</span>, in which case the full spacetime metric takes the form of a static metric multiplied by an overall <!--del_lnk--> scale factor. The conformal time coordinate is quite useful since the <!--del_lnk--> comoving distance traveled by a light ray is equal to the conformal time interval of the trip. This enables one to understand the <!--del_lnk--> causal structure of spacetime. For example, the Big Bang occurred at a finite interval of conformal time <span class="texhtml">&eta;<sub>0</sub></span> to the past. Objects whose comoving distance is greater than <span class="texhtml"><i>c</i>&eta;<sub>0</sub></span> are too far away for light to have had time to travel to us since the Big Bang: therefore we cannot see all of the past universe and there is a <i>past horizon.</i> If the universe is <!--del_lnk--> accelerating, then there is only a finite amount of conformal time <span class="texhtml">&eta;<sub><i>F</i></sub></span> to the future (though this finite amount of conformal time corresponds to an infinite amount of clock or <!--del_lnk--> proper time). Objects located at comoving distances further than <span class="texhtml"><i>c</i>&eta;<sub><i>F</i></sub></span> can never be reached by a light ray emitted by us today, therefore we cannot influence all of the future universe and there is a <i>future horizon.</i> See also <!--del_lnk--> cosmological horizon.<p><a id="Observational_evidence" name="Observational_evidence"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Observational evidence</span></h2>
      <p>It is generally stated that there are three observational pillars that support the Big Bang theory of cosmology. These are the <a href="../../wp/h/Hubble%2527s_law.htm" title="Hubble&#39;s law">Hubble-type expansion</a> seen in the <a href="../../wp/r/Redshift.htm" title="Redshift">redshifts</a> of galaxies, the detailed measurements of the cosmic microwave background, and the abundance of light elements. (See <!--del_lnk--> Big Bang nucleosynthesis.) Additionally, the observed <!--del_lnk--> correlation function of <!--del_lnk--> large-scale structure of the cosmos fits well with standard Big Bang theory.<p><a id="Hubble.27s_law_expansion" name="Hubble.27s_law_expansion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Hubble&#39;s law expansion</span></h3>

      <p>Observations of distant galaxies and <!--del_lnk--> quasars show that these objects are <a href="../../wp/r/Redshift.htm" title="Redshift">redshifted</a>, meaning that the <a href="../../wp/l/Light.htm" title="Light">light</a> emitted from them has been shifted to longer wavelengths. This is seen by taking a <!--del_lnk--> frequency spectrum of the objects and then matching the <!--del_lnk--> spectroscopic pattern of <!--del_lnk--> emission lines or <!--del_lnk--> absorption lines corresponding to <a href="../../wp/a/Atom.htm" title="Atom">atoms</a> of the <a href="../../wp/c/Chemical_element.htm" title="Chemical element">chemical elements</a> interacting with the light. From this analysis, a <a href="../../wp/r/Redshift.htm" title="Redshift">redshift</a> corresponding to a <!--del_lnk--> Doppler shift for the radiation can be measured which is explained by a recessional <!--del_lnk--> velocity. When the recessional velocities are plotted against the distances to the objects, a linear relationship, known as <a href="../../wp/h/Hubble%2527s_law.htm" title="Hubble&#39;s law">Hubble&#39;s law</a>, is observed:<dl>

This type of universal expansion was developed mathematically in the context of <!--del_lnk--> general relativity well before Hubble made his analysis and observations, and it remains the cornerstone of the Big Bang theory as developed by <!--del_lnk--> Friedmann-Lema&icirc;tre-Robertson-Walker.<p><a id="Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation" name="Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cosmic microwave background radiation</span></h3>

      <p>The Big Bang theory predicted the existence of the <a href="../../wp/c/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation.htm" title="Cosmic microwave background radiation">cosmic microwave background radiation</a> or CMB which is composed of <!--del_lnk--> photons first emitted during <!--del_lnk--> baryogenesis. Because the early universe was in <!--del_lnk--> thermal equilibrium, the <!--del_lnk--> temperature of the radiation and the <a href="../../wp/p/Plasma_%2528physics%2529.htm" title="Plasma (physics)">plasma</a> were equal until the plasma <!--del_lnk--> recombined. Before atoms formed, radiation was constantly absorbed and re-emitted in a process called <!--del_lnk--> Compton scattering: the early universe was opaque to light. However, cooling due to the expansion of the universe allowed the temperature to eventually fall below 3,000&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> K at which point electrons and nuclei combined to form atoms and the primordial plasma turned into a neutral gas. This is known as photon <!--del_lnk--> decoupling. A universe with only neutral atoms allows radiation to travel largely unimpeded.<p>Because the early universe was in thermal equilibrium, the radiation from this time had a <!--del_lnk--> blackbody spectrum and freely streamed through space until today, becoming redshifted because of the Hubble expansion. This reduces the high temperature of the blackbody spectrum. The radiation should be observable at every point in the universe to come from all directions of space.<p>In 1964, <!--del_lnk--> Arno Penzias and <!--del_lnk--> Robert Wilson, while conducting a series of diagnostic observations using a new <!--del_lnk--> microwave receiver owned by <!--del_lnk--> Bell Laboratories, discovered the cosmic background radiation. Their discovery provided substantial confirmation of the general CMB predictions&mdash;the radiation was found to be isotropic and consistent with a blackbody spectrum of about 3&nbsp;K&mdash;and it pitched the balance of opinion in favour of the Big Bang hypothesis. Penzias and Wilson were awarded the <!--del_lnk--> Nobel Prize for their discovery.<p>In 1989, <!--del_lnk--> NASA launched the <!--del_lnk--> Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE), and the initial findings, released in 1990, were consistent with the Big Bang&#39;s predictions regarding the CMB. COBE found a residual temperature of 2.726&nbsp;K and determined that the CMB was isotropic to about one part in 10<sup>5</sup>. During the 1990s, CMB anisotropies were further investigated by a large number of ground-based experiments and the universe was shown to be almost geometrically flat by measuring the typical angular size (the size on the sky) of the anisotropies. (See <!--del_lnk--> shape of the universe.)<p>In early 2003, the results of the <!--del_lnk--> Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy satellite (WMAP) were released, yielding what were at the time the most accurate values for some of the cosmological parameters. (See <!--del_lnk--> cosmic microwave background radiation experiments.) This satellite also disproved several specific <a href="../../wp/c/Cosmic_inflation.htm" title="Cosmic inflation">cosmic inflation</a> models, but the results were consistent with the inflation theory in general.<p><a id="Abundance_of_primordial_elements" name="Abundance_of_primordial_elements"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Abundance of primordial elements</span></h3>

      <p>Detailed observations of the <!--del_lnk--> morphology and <!--del_lnk--> distribution of galaxies and <!--del_lnk--> quasars provide strong evidence for the Big Bang. A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed about a billion years after the Big Bang, and since then larger structures have been forming, such as <!--del_lnk--> galaxy clusters and <!--del_lnk--> superclusters. Populations of stars have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are observed as they were in the early universe) appear very different from nearby galaxies (observed in a more recent state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of <!--del_lnk--> star formation, galaxy and quasar distributions, and larger structures agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the universe and are helping to complete details of the theory.<p><a id="Features.2C_issues_and_problems" name="Features.2C_issues_and_problems"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Features, issues and problems</span></h2>
      <p>While currently there are very few researchers who doubt the Big Bang occurred, in the past the community was divided between supporters of the Big Bang and supporters of <!--del_lnk--> alternative cosmological models. Throughout the historical development of the subject, problems with the Big Bang theory were posed in the context of a scientific controversy regarding which model could best describe the <!--del_lnk--> cosmological observations (see <a href="#History" title="">history section above</a>). With the overwhelming <!--del_lnk--> consensus in the community today supporting the Big Bang model, many of these problems are remembered as being mainly of historical interest; the solutions to them have been obtained either through modifications to the theory or as the result of better observations. Other issues, such as the <!--del_lnk--> cuspy halo problem and the <!--del_lnk--> dwarf galaxy problem of <!--del_lnk--> cold dark matter, are not considered to be fatal as they can be addressed through further refinements of the theory.<p>The Big Bang model admits very exotic physical phenomena that include <!--del_lnk--> dark matter, <!--del_lnk--> dark energy, and <a href="../../wp/c/Cosmic_inflation.htm" title="Cosmic inflation">cosmic inflation</a> which rely on conditions and physics that have not yet been observed in terrestrial laboratory experiments. While explanations for such phenomena remain at the <!--del_lnk--> frontiers of inquiry in physics, independent observations of <!--del_lnk--> Big Bang nucleosynthesis, the <!--del_lnk--> cosmic microwave background, <!--del_lnk--> large scale structure and Type Ia <!--del_lnk--> supernovae strongly suggest the phenomena are important and real cosmological features of our universe. The <a href="../../wp/g/Gravitation.htm" title="Gravity">gravitational</a> effects of these features are understood observationally and theoretically but they have not yet been successfully incorporated into the <!--del_lnk--> Standard Model of <!--del_lnk--> particle physics. Though some aspects of the theory remain inadequately explained by fundamental physics, almost all cosmologists accept that the close agreement between Big Bang theory and observation have firmly established all the basic parts of the theory.<p>The following is a short list of Big Bang &quot;problems&quot; and puzzles:<p><a id="Horizon_problem" name="Horizon_problem"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Horizon problem</span></h3>

      <p>The <b>horizon problem</b> results from the premise that information cannot travel <!--del_lnk--> faster than light, and hence two regions of space which are separated by a greater distance than the speed of light multiplied by the age of the universe cannot be in <!--del_lnk--> causal contact. The observed isotropy of the <!--del_lnk--> cosmic microwave background (CMB) is problematic in this regard, because the <!--del_lnk--> horizon size at that time corresponds to a size that is about 2 degrees on the sky. If the universe has had the same expansion history since the <!--del_lnk--> Planck epoch, there is no mechanism to cause these regions to have the same temperature.<p>A resolution to this apparent inconsistency is offered by <!--del_lnk--> inflationary theory in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at a time 10<sup>-35</sup> seconds after the Planck epoch. During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and regions in causal contact expand so as to be beyond each other&#39;s horizons. <!--del_lnk--> Heisenberg&#39;s uncertainty principle predicts that during the inflationary phase there would be <!--del_lnk--> quantum thermal fluctuations, which would be magnified to cosmic scale. These fluctuations serve as the seeds of all current structure in the universe. After inflation, the universe expands according to <a href="../../wp/h/Hubble%2527s_law.htm" title="Hubble&#39;s law">Hubble&#39;s law</a>, and regions that were out of causal contact come back into the horizon. This explains the observed isotropy of the CMB. Inflation predicts that the <!--del_lnk--> primordial fluctuations are nearly <!--del_lnk--> scale invariant and <!--del_lnk--> Gaussian which has been accurately confirmed by measurements of the CMB.<p><a id="Flatness_problem" name="Flatness_problem"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Flatness problem</span></h3>

      <p>The <b>flatness problem</b> is an observational problem that results from considerations of the <!--del_lnk--> geometry associated with a <!--del_lnk--> Friedmann-Lema&icirc;tre-Robertson-Walker metric. In general, the universe can have three different kinds of geometries: <!--del_lnk--> hyperbolic geometry, <a href="../../wp/e/Euclidean_geometry.htm" title="Euclidean geometry">Euclidean geometry</a>, or <!--del_lnk--> elliptic geometry. The geometry is determined by the total energy density of the universe (as measured by means of the <!--del_lnk--> stress-energy tensor): hyperbolic results from a density less than the <!--del_lnk--> critical density, elliptic from a density greater than the critical density, and Euclidean from exactly the critical density. The universe is required to be within one part in 10<sup>15</sup> of the critical density in its earliest stages. Any greater deviation would have caused either a <!--del_lnk--> Heat Death or a <!--del_lnk--> Big Crunch, and the universe would not exist as it does today.<p>A possible resolution to this problem is again offered by <!--del_lnk--> inflationary theory. During the inflationary period, spacetime expanded to such an extent that any residual <!--del_lnk--> curvature associated with it would have been smoothed out to a high degree of precision. Thus, it is believed that inflation drove the universe to be very nearly spatially flat.<p><a id="Magnetic_monopoles" name="Magnetic_monopoles"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Magnetic monopoles</span></h3>
      <p>The <b><!--del_lnk--> magnetic monopole</b> objection was raised in the late 1970s. <!--del_lnk--> Grand unification theories predicted <!--del_lnk--> point defects in space that would manifest as <!--del_lnk--> magnetic monopoles with a density much higher than was consistent with observations, given that searches have never found any monopoles. This problem is also resolvable by <a href="../../wp/c/Cosmic_inflation.htm" title="Cosmic inflation">cosmic inflation</a>, which removes all point defects from the observable universe in the same way that it drives the geometry to flatness.<p><a id="Baryon_asymmetry" name="Baryon_asymmetry"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Baryon asymmetry</span></h3>
      <p>It is not yet understood why the universe has more <a href="../../wp/m/Matter.htm" title="Matter">matter</a> than <!--del_lnk--> antimatter. It is generally assumed that when the universe was young and very hot, it was in statistical equilibrium and contained equal numbers of <!--del_lnk--> baryons and anti-baryons. However, observations suggest that the universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of matter. An unknown process called <b><!--del_lnk--> baryogenesis</b> created the asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the Sakharov conditions, which were laid out by <!--del_lnk--> Andrei Sakharov, must be satisfied. They require that <!--del_lnk--> baryon number be not conserved, that <!--del_lnk--> C-symmetry and <!--del_lnk--> CP-symmetry be violated, and that the universe depart from <!--del_lnk--> thermodynamic equilibrium. All these conditions occur in the <!--del_lnk--> Standard Model, but the effect is not strong enough to explain the present baryon asymmetry.  Experiments taking place at <!--del_lnk--> CERN near Geneva seek to trap enough <!--del_lnk--> anti-hydrogen to compare its spectrum with hydrogen.

      <p>During the 1970s and 1980s, various observations (notably of <!--del_lnk--> galactic rotation curves) showed that there was not sufficient visible matter in the universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the universe is not normal or <!--del_lnk--> baryonic matter but rather <b><!--del_lnk--> dark matter</b>. In addition, assuming that the universe was mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe is far less lumpy and contains far less <!--del_lnk--> deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter was initially controversial, it is now a widely accepted part of standard cosmology due to observations of the anisotropies in the CMB, <!--del_lnk--> galaxy cluster velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, <!--del_lnk--> gravitational lensing studies, and <!--del_lnk--> x-ray measurements from galaxy clusters. In August 2006, dark matter was definitively observed through measurements of colliding galaxies in the <!--del_lnk--> Bullet Cluster. This and other detections of dark matter are only sensitive to its gravitational signature; no dark matter particles have yet been observed in laboratories. However, there are many <!--del_lnk--> particle physics candidates for dark matter, and several projects to detect them directly are underway.<p><a id="Dark_energy" name="Dark_energy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Dark energy</span></h3>

      <p>In the 1990s, detailed measurements of the <!--del_lnk--> mass density of the universe revealed a value that was 30% that of the <!--del_lnk--> critical density. Since the universe is very nearly spatially flat, as is indicated by measurements of the <!--del_lnk--> cosmic microwave background, about 70% of the energy density of the universe was left unaccounted for. This mystery now appears to be connected to another one: Independent measurements of <!--del_lnk--> Type Ia supernovae have revealed that the expansion of the universe is undergoing a non-linear <!--del_lnk--> acceleration. To explain this acceleration, <!--del_lnk--> general relativity requires that much of the universe consist of an energy component with large <!--del_lnk--> negative pressure. This <b><!--del_lnk--> dark energy</b> is now thought to make up the missing 70%. Its nature remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Possible candidates include a scalar <!--del_lnk--> cosmological constant and <!--del_lnk--> quintessence. Observations to help understand this are ongoing.

      <p>Before observations of dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios for the future of the universe. If the mass <!--del_lnk--> density of the universe is above the <!--del_lnk--> critical density, then the universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state that was similar to that in which it started&mdash;a <!--del_lnk--> Big Crunch. Alternatively, if the density in the universe is equal to or below the critical density, the expansion would slow down, but never stop. Star formation would cease as the universe grows less dense. The average temperature of the universe would asymptotically approach <a href="../../wp/a/Absolute_zero.htm" title="Absolute zero">absolute zero</a>&mdash;a <!--del_lnk--> Big Freeze. <a href="../../wp/b/Black_hole.htm" title="Black Hole">Black holes</a> would <a href="../../wp/h/Hawking_radiation.htm" title="Hawking radiation">evaporate</a>. The <a href="../../wp/e/Entropy.htm" title="Entropy">entropy</a> of the universe would increase to the point where no organized form of energy could be extracted from it, a scenario known as <!--del_lnk--> heat death. Moreover, if <!--del_lnk--> proton decay exists, then hydrogen, the predominant form of baryonic matter in the universe today, would disappear, leaving only radiation.<p>Modern observations of <!--del_lnk--> accelerated expansion imply that more and more of the currently visible universe will pass beyond our <!--del_lnk--> event horizon and out of contact with us. The eventual result is not known. The <!--del_lnk--> &Lambda;CDM model of the universe contains <!--del_lnk--> dark energy in the form of a <!--del_lnk--> cosmological constant.

Little is known about the earliest universe, when <a href="../../wp/c/Cosmic_inflation.htm" title="Cosmic inflation">inflation</a> is hypothesized to have occurred. There may also be parts of the universe well beyond what can be observed in principle. In the case of inflation this is required: exponential expansion has pushed large regions of space beyond our observable horizon.

Some people believe that the Big Bang theory is inconsistent with traditional views of creation such as that in <!--del_lnk--> Genesis, for example, while others, like astronomer <!--del_lnk--> Hugh Ross, believe that the Big Bang theory lends support to the idea of creation <!--del_lnk--> ex nihilo.<p>Initially, many scientists rejected the Big Bang theory because they thought it was religious in nature.

Parallels with the <!--del_lnk--> Big Crunch and an <!--del_lnk--> oscillating universe have also been suggested: &quot;On the day when We will roll up the heavens like the rolling up of the scroll for writings, as We originated the first creation, (so) We shall reproduce it; a promise (binding on Us); surely We will bring it about.&quot; (Ch:21,Ver:104).<li>Certain <!--del_lnk--> theistic branches of <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, such as in <!--del_lnk--> Vaishnavism, conceive of a creation event with similarities to the Big Bang. For example in the third book of the <!--del_lnk--> Bhagavata Purana (primarily, chapters 10 and 26), describes a primordial state which bursts forth as the Great <!--del_lnk--> Vishnu glances over it, transforming into the active state of the sum-total of matter (&quot;<!--del_lnk--> prakriti&quot;). Other forms of Hinduism assert a universe without beginning or end.<li><a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> has a concept of universes that have no initial creation event, but instead go through infinitely repeated cycles of expansion, stability, destruction, and quiescence. The Big Bang, however, is not seen to be in conflict with this since there are ways to conceive an eternal creation and destruction of universes within the paradigm. A number of popular <!--del_lnk--> Zen philosophers were intrigued, in particular, by the concept of the <!--del_lnk--> oscillatory universe.</ul>
