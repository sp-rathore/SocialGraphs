      <p><a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spanish</a> seaman <!--del_lnk--> Juan D&iacute;az de Sol&iacute;s was the first European to reach the <!--del_lnk--> R&iacute;o de la Plata, in 1516, but his expedition was cut short by an attack in which he was killed by the native <!--del_lnk--> Charr&uacute;a or <!--del_lnk--> Guaran&iacute; tribe.<p>The city was first founded as <i>Ciudad de Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora Santa Mar&iacute;a del Buen Ayre</i> (literally &quot;City of Our Lady of the Good Air&quot;) on <!--del_lnk--> February 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1536 by a Spanish gold-seeking expedition under <!--del_lnk--> Pedro de Mendoza. The name was chosen by Mendoza&#39;s chaplain, who was a devout follower of the <i>Virgine de Bonaria</i> (&quot;Our Lady of the Fair Winds&quot;) of <!--del_lnk--> Cagliari, <!--del_lnk--> Sardinia. The location of Mendoza&#39;s city was in today&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> San Telmo district, south of the city centre.<p>More attacks by the indigenous peoples forced the settlers away and in 1541 the site was abandoned. A second (and permanent) settlement was established in 1580 by <!--del_lnk--> Juan de Garay, who sailed down the <!--del_lnk--> Paran&aacute; River from <a href="../../wp/a/Asunci%25C3%25B3n.htm" title="Asunci&oacute;n">Asunci&oacute;n</a> (now the capital of <a href="../../wp/p/Paraguay.htm" title="Paraguay">Paraguay</a>).<p>From its earliest days, the success of Buenos Aires depended on trade. During most of the 17th and 18th centuries, Spain insisted that all trade to Europe initially pass through <!--del_lnk--> Lima, Peru so that taxes could be collected. This scheme frustrated the traders of Buenos Aires, and a thriving contraband industry developed. Unsurprisingly, this also instilled a deep resentment in <i>porte&ntilde;os</i> towards Spanish authorities.<p>Sensing this instability, <!--del_lnk--> Charles III of Spain progressively eased the trade restrictions and finally declared Buenos Aires an open port in the late 1700s. Those placating actions did not have the desired effect, and the <i>porte&ntilde;os</i>, some of them versed in the ideology of the <!--del_lnk--> French revolution, became even more desirous of independence from Spain.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>During the <!--del_lnk--> British invasions of the R&iacute;o de la Plata British forces invaded Buenos Aires twice in 1806&ndash;1807 but were repulsed by local militias. Ultimately, on <!--del_lnk--> May 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1810, while Spain endured the <!--del_lnk--> Peninsular War and after a week of mostly pacific deliberations, the <i><!--del_lnk--> criollo</i> citizens of Buenos Aires successfully ousted the Spanish Viceroy and established a provisional government. That date is now celebrated as a national holiday (<!--del_lnk--> May Revolution Day). Formal independence from Spain was declared only in 1816.<p>Historically, Buenos Aires has been Argentina&#39;s main centre for liberal and free-trade ideas, while many of the provinces, especially to the Northwest, advocated a more conservative-Catholic approach to political and social issues. Many tensions within Argentine history, starting with the centralist-federalist conflicts of the 19th century, can be traced back to these contrasting views.<p>In the 19th century the city suffered naval <!--del_lnk--> blockades on two occasions: first by the <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a>, from 1838 to 1840, and then a joint Anglo-French blockade from 1845 to 1848. Both blockades failed to surrender the city, and the foreign powers eventually desisted from their demands.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>During most of the 19th century, the political status of the city remained a sensitive subject. Meant by many to be the nation&#39;s capital, it was already capital of <!--del_lnk--> Buenos Aires Province, and for seven years from 1853 to 1860, it was the capital of the seceded <!--del_lnk--> State of Buenos Aires. The issue was debated more than once on the battlefield, until the matter was finally settled in <!--del_lnk--> 1880 when the city was <!--del_lnk--> declared national capital, separated from the province of the same name, and became the seat of the federal government, with its Mayor appointed by the President. Today, the <!--del_lnk--> Casa Rosada is the seat of national government and the office of the <!--del_lnk--> President of the Republic.<p>Railroad construction near the end of the 19th century increased the economic power of Buenos Aires as raw materials flowed into its factories, and the town became a metropolitan and multicultural city that ranked itself with the major European capitals. For example, the <!--del_lnk--> Teatro Col&oacute;n was one of the world&#39;s top opera venues. The city&#39;s main avenues were built in those years, and the dawn of the 20th century saw the construction of South America&#39;s then-tallest buildings and first <!--del_lnk--> subway network.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>By the 1920s Buenos Aires was a favoured destination for immigrants from Europe, as well as from the poorer provinces and neighbouring countries, and large <!--del_lnk--> shanty towns (<i><!--del_lnk--> villas miseria</i>) started growing around the city&#39;s industrial areas, leading to extensive social problems.<p>Buenos Aires was the cradle of <!--del_lnk--> Peronism: the now-mythical demonstration of <!--del_lnk--> October 17, <!--del_lnk--> 1945 took place in <!--del_lnk--> Plaza de Mayo. Industrial workers of the Greater Buenos Aires industrial belt have been Peronism&#39;s main support base ever since, and Plaza de Mayo became the site for demonstrations and many of the country&#39;s political events.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> June 16, <!--del_lnk--> 1955, the military uprising that would depose President <!--del_lnk--> Per&oacute;n three months later (see <i><!--del_lnk--> Revoluci&oacute;n Libertadora</i>) had the Plaza de Mayo area bombed, killing 364 civilians (see <i><!--del_lnk--> Bombing of Plaza de Mayo</i>). This was the only time the city was attacked from the air.<p>In the 1970s, the city suffered from the fighting between left-wing revolutionary movements (<!--del_lnk--> Montoneros, <!--del_lnk--> E.R.P. and <!--del_lnk--> F.A.R.) and right-wing paramilitary group <!--del_lnk--> Triple A, supported by <!--del_lnk--> Isabel Per&oacute;n, who became president of Argentina in 1974, after Juan Per&oacute;n&#39;s death.<p>The military <!--del_lnk--> coup of 1976, led by <!--del_lnk--> Jorge Rafael Videla, only escalated this conflict; the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Dirty War&quot; produced between 10,000 and 30,000 <i><!--del_lnk--> desaparecidos</i>, people kidnapped and killed by the military during the years of the junta. By some estimates upwards of 100,000 people were held in illegal detention centers and concentration camps during those years. The silent marches of their mothers (<!--del_lnk--> Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo) are a well-known image of Argentine suffering during those times.<p>The city was visited by <a href="../../wp/p/Pope_John_Paul_II.htm" title="Pope John Paul II">Pope John Paul II</a> on two occasions: in 1982, due to the outbreak of the <!--del_lnk--> Falklands-Malvinas War, and a second visit in 1987, which gathered crowds never seen before in the city.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> March 17, <!--del_lnk--> 1992 a bomb exploded in the <!--del_lnk--> Israeli Embassy killing 29 and injuring 242. Another explosion, on <!--del_lnk--> July 18, <!--del_lnk--> 1994, destroyed a building housing several <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jew">Jewish</a> organizations killing 85 and injuring many more (<i>see <!--del_lnk--> AMIA bombing</i>).<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1996, under the <!--del_lnk--> 1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution, the city gained autonomous status, and held its first mayoral elections (its formal title changed to &quot;Chief of Government&quot;). The winner was (later President) <!--del_lnk--> Fernando de la R&uacute;a.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> December 30, <!--del_lnk--> 2004, a fire at <!--del_lnk--> Rep&uacute;blica Cromagnon concert hall killed almost 200 people, the greatest non-natural tragedy in Argentine history. Due to his responsibility over the non-enforcement of safety regulations, and (allegedly) also because of his precarious political standing, Mayor <!--del_lnk--> An&iacute;bal Ibarra was <!--del_lnk--> impeached by the legislature, and deposed on <!--del_lnk--> 6 March <!--del_lnk--> 2006. His deputy, <!--del_lnk--> Jorge Telerman, who had been the acting mayor since December 2005, was invested with the office.<p><a id="Government_and_politics" name="Government_and_politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Government and politics</span></h2>

      <p>Buenos Aires is the financial, industrial, commercial, and cultural hub of Argentina. Its port is one of the busiest in the world. Tax collection related to it has caused many political problems in the past <!--del_lnk--> [*]; navigable rivers by way of the Rio de la Plata connect the port to north-east Argentina, <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="../../wp/u/Uruguay.htm" title="Uruguay">Uruguay</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Paraguay.htm" title="Paraguay">Paraguay</a>. As a result, it serves as the distribution hub for a vast area of the south-eastern region of the continent.<p>To the west of Buenos Aires is the <i><!--del_lnk--> Pampa H&uacute;meda</i>, the most productive agricultural region of Argentina (as opposed to the dry southern <!--del_lnk--> Pampa, mostly used for cattle farms). Meat, dairy, grain, tobacco, wool and hide products are processed or manufactured in the Buenos Aires area. Other leading industries are automobile manufacturing, oil refining, metalworking, machine building, and the production of textiles, chemicals, clothing, and beverages.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

      <p>The <i><!--del_lnk--> lunfardo</i> <!--del_lnk--> argot originated within the prison population, and in time it spread to all <i>porte&ntilde;os</i>. Lunfardo uses words from Italian dialects, from <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazilian</a> <a href="../../wp/p/Portuguese_language.htm" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a>, from African and Caribbean origin and even from English; and employs humorous tricks such as inverting the syllables within a word (see <!--del_lnk--> vesre). Today, lunfardo is mostly heard on tango lyrics; the slang of the younger generations has been evolving away from it.<p>In the early 20th century, Argentina absorbed millions of immigrants, many of them Italians, who spoke mostly in their local dialects (mainly <!--del_lnk--> Neapolitan, <!--del_lnk--> Sicilian and <a href="../../wp/g/Genoa.htm" title="Genoa">Genoan</a>). Their adoption of <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_language.htm" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a> was gradual, creating a <!--del_lnk--> pidgin of <!--del_lnk--> Italian dialects and Spanish called <!--del_lnk--> cocoliche, widely heard in the beginning of the 20th century; its usage declined around the <!--del_lnk--> 1950s, and today survives mostly as comic relief.<p>As many Spanish immigrants were from <!--del_lnk--> Galicia, to the extent that Spaniards are still generically called <i>gallegos</i> (Galicians), <!--del_lnk--> Galician language, cuisine and culture had a major presence in the city for most of the 20th century. In recent years, descendants of Galician immigrants have led a mini-boom in <!--del_lnk--> Celtic music (which also highlighted the <!--del_lnk--> Welsh traditions of Patagonia).<p><!--del_lnk--> Yiddish was commonly heard in Buenos Aires, especially in the <!--del_lnk--> Balvanera garment neighbourhood and in <!--del_lnk--> Villa Crespo, until the 1960s. <!--del_lnk--> Korean and <a href="../../wp/c/Chinese_language.htm" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a> have become significant since the 1970s.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Tango music was born in the suburbs, notably in the brothels of the <i>Jun&iacute;n y Lavalle</i> district and in the <i>arrabales</i> (poorer suburbs). Its sensual dance moves were not seen as respectable until adopted by the <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Parisian</a> high society in the 1920s, and then all over the world. In Buenos Aires, tango dancing schools (known as <i>academias</i>) were usually men-only establishments.<p>Starting in the 1920s, the Buenos Aires style of <!--del_lnk--> tango music evolved into an elaborated genre. In its heyday, tango had many famous orchestras such as those led by <!--del_lnk--> An&iacute;bal Troilo and <!--del_lnk--> Juan D&#39;Arienzo, and singers such as <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Gardel and <!--del_lnk--> Edmundo Rivero. Tango enjoyed a resurgence in global popularity later in the century due almost exclusively to <!--del_lnk--> Astor Piazzolla and his development of the <!--del_lnk--> tango nuevo style.<p>Buenos Aires holds an annual &quot;Tango Day&quot; each <!--del_lnk--> December 11.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> San Telmo, Sundays are devoted to tango shows on the streets and antiques trade in the <!--del_lnk--> bazaars around Dorrego Square.

      <p>Buenos Aires used to be relatively congestion-free for a city of its size. Toll <!--del_lnk--> freeways opened in the late 1970s by then-mayor <!--del_lnk--> Osvaldo Cacciatore provided fast access to the downtown area, increasing the number of cars coming into the city. During Cacciatore&#39;s tenure, the streets of the downtown financial district (roughly one square kilometre in size) were declared off-limits to private cars during daytime. Main avenues of the city include the 140-m-wide <!--del_lnk--> 9 de Julio Avenue, the over-35-km-long <!--del_lnk--> Rivadavia Avenue, and the cultural-centred <!--del_lnk--> Corrientes Avenue.<p>Following the <!--del_lnk--> economic mini-boom of the 1990s, more people started <!--del_lnk--> commuting by car, and congestion increased. Most major avenues are <!--del_lnk--> gridlocked at peak hours. Another source of congestion is the flight of many people to the country on weekends.<p>Black-and-yellow taxis roam the streets at all hours. Some of these are unlicensed (controls are not fully enforced), so visitors are advised to phone a reputable radio-link company. Low-fare limo services, known as <i>remises</i>, have become more popular in recent years.<p><a id="Rail_transport" name="Rail_transport"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Rail transport</span></h3>
