      <p>William Henry Gates III was born in <a href="../../wp/s/Seattle%252C_Washington.htm" title="Seattle, Washington">Seattle, Washington</a> to <!--del_lnk--> William H. Gates, Jr. (now <i>Sr.</i>) and <!--del_lnk--> Mary Maxwell Gates. His family was wealthy; his father was a prominent lawyer, his mother served on the board of directors for First Interstate Bank and The United Way, and her father, J. W. Maxwell, was a <!--del_lnk--> national bank president. Gates has one older sister, Kristi (Kristianne), and one younger sister, Libby. He was the fourth of his name in his family, but was known as William Gates III or &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Trey&quot; because his father had dropped his own &quot;III&quot; suffix. According to the 1993 biography <i>Hard Drive</i>, Maxwell set up a million-dollar <!--del_lnk--> trust fund for Gates the year he was born. Gates vehemently denied this in a 1994 interview with <i><!--del_lnk--> Playboy</i>, and the 1993 biography <i>Gates</i> calls the trust fund claim one of the &quot;fictions&quot; surrounding Gates&#39; fortune.<p>Gates excelled in elementary school, particularly in <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> and the <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">sciences</a>. At thirteen he enrolled in the <!--del_lnk--> Lakeside School, Seattle&#39;s most exclusive preparatory school where tuition in 1967 was $5,000 (Harvard tuition that year was $1,760). When he was in the eighth grade, Lakeside obtained an <!--del_lnk--> ASR-33 <!--del_lnk--> teletype <!--del_lnk--> terminal and a donation of computer time on a <!--del_lnk--> General Electric computer from a &quot;Mothers Club&quot; rummage sale. Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in <!--del_lnk--> BASIC and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted he and other students sought time on other systems, including <!--del_lnk--> DEC <!--del_lnk--> PDP <!--del_lnk--> minicomputers. One of these systems was a <!--del_lnk--> PDP-10 belonging to Computer Centre Corporation, which banned the Lakeside students for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the <!--del_lnk--> operating system to obtain free computer time.<p>At the end of the ban, the Lakeside students (Gates, <!--del_lnk--> Paul Allen, <!--del_lnk--> Ric Weiland, and Kent Evans) offered to fix the bugs in CCC&#39;s software in exchange for free computer time. Rather than use the system via teletype, Gates went to CCC&#39;s offices and studied <!--del_lnk--> source code for various programs that ran on the system, not only in BASIC but <!--del_lnk--> FORTRAN, <!--del_lnk--> LISP, and <!--del_lnk--> machine language as well. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970, when it went out of business. The following year Information Sciences Inc. hired the Lakeside students to write a <!--del_lnk--> payroll program in <!--del_lnk--> COBOL, providing them not only computer time but <!--del_lnk--> royalties as well. Gates also formed a venture with Allen, called <!--del_lnk--> Traf-O-Data, to make <!--del_lnk--> traffic counters based on the <!--del_lnk--> Intel 8008 processor.<p>According to a press inquiry, Bill Gates stated that he scored 1590 on his <!--del_lnk--> SATs. He enrolled at <!--del_lnk--> Harvard University in the fall of 1973 without a definite study plan. While at Harvard he met his future <a href="../../wp/b/Business.htm" title="Business">business</a> partner, <!--del_lnk--> Steve Ballmer.<p><a id="Microsoft" name="Microsoft"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Microsoft</span></h2>

      <p>After reading the January 1975 issue of <i><!--del_lnk--> Popular Electronics</i> that demonstrated the <!--del_lnk--> Altair 8800, Gates contacted <!--del_lnk--> MITS (Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems), the creators of the new microcomputer, to inform them that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform. In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS&#39;s interest. MITS president <!--del_lnk--> Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a demo, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair <!--del_lnk--> emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration, held at MITS&#39;s offices in Albuquerque, was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as <!--del_lnk--> Altair BASIC. Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with Allen at MITS, and they dubbed their <!--del_lnk--> partnership Micro-Soft.<p><a id="Anti-piracy_efforts" name="Anti-piracy_efforts"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Anti-piracy efforts</span></h3>
      <p>In February 1976, Gates published his often-quoted &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Open Letter to Hobbyists&quot;. In the letter, Gates claimed that most users were using &quot;stolen&quot; <!--del_lnk--> pirated copies of Altair BASIC and that no hobbyist could afford to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software without payment. This letter was unpopular with many amateur programmers, not just those few using copies of the software.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1980 <!--del_lnk--> IBM approached Microsoft to make the BASIC interpreter for its upcoming personal computer, the <!--del_lnk--> IBM PC. When IBM&#39;s representatives mentioned that they needed an <!--del_lnk--> operating system, Bill Gates referred them to <!--del_lnk--> Digital Research, makers of the widely used <!--del_lnk--> CP/M operating system. Despite at least two rounds of negotiation, IBM and DRI did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates, and Gates told him about <!--del_lnk--> 86-DOS (QDOS), an operating system similar to CP/M that <!--del_lnk--> Seattle Computer Products had made for hardware similar to the PC. Gates asked Sams whether he wanted to talk to SCP or let Gates arrange the deal, and Sams left the negotiations to Gates. Microsoft made a deal with SCP to become the exclusive licensing agent for 86-DOS, but did not mention that IBM was a potential customer. After adapting the operating system for the PC, Microsoft delivered it to IBM as <!--del_lnk--> PC-DOS in exchange for a one-time fee. Gates never understood why DRI had walked away from the deal, and in later years he claimed that DRI founder <!--del_lnk--> Gary Kildall capriciously &quot;went flying&quot; during an IBM appointment, a characterization that Kildall and other DR employees would deny.<p>Later, after <!--del_lnk--> Compaq successfully cloned the IBM <!--del_lnk--> BIOS, the market saw a flood of IBM PC clones. Microsoft was quick to license DOS to other manufacturers, calling it <!--del_lnk--> MS-DOS (for Microsoft <a href="../../wp/f/Floppy_disk.htm" title="Floppy disk">Disk</a> <!--del_lnk--> Operating System). By marketing MS-DOS aggressively to manufacturers of IBM-PC clones, Microsoft went from a small player to one of the major software vendors in the home computer industry. Microsoft continued to develop operating systems as well as <!--del_lnk--> software applications.<p><a id="Windows" name="Windows"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Windows</span></h3>
      <p>In the early 1980s Microsoft introduced its own version of the <!--del_lnk--> graphical user interface (GUI), based on ideas pioneered by the <!--del_lnk--> Xerox corporation, and further pioneered and developed by Apple. Microsoft released &quot;<a href="../../wp/m/Microsoft_Windows.htm" title="Microsoft Windows">Windows</a>&quot; as an addition and alternative to their DOS command line, and to compete with other systems on the market that employed a GUI. By the early 1990s, Windows had pushed other DOS-based GUIs like <!--del_lnk--> GEM and <!--del_lnk--> GEOS out of the market. The release of <!--del_lnk--> Windows 3.0 in 1990 was a tremendous success, selling around 10 million copies in the first two years and cementing Microsoft&#39;s dominance in operating systems sales.<p>By continuing to ensure, by various means, that most computers came with Microsoft software pre-installed, the Microsoft corporation eventually became the largest software company in the world, earning Gates enough money that <!--del_lnk--> Forbes Magazine named him the wealthiest person in the world for several years. Gates served as the <!--del_lnk--> CEO of the company until 2000, when <!--del_lnk--> Steve Ballmer took the position, and continues to serve as chairman of the board as of November 2006. Microsoft has thousands of patents, and Gates has nine patents to his name.<p><a id="Bill_Gates.27_role" name="Bill_Gates.27_role"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Bill Gates&#39; role</span></h3>

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Since Microsoft&#39;s founding in 1975 and as of 2006, Gates has had primary responsibility for Microsoft&#39;s product strategy. He has aggressively broadened the company&#39;s range of products, and wherever Microsoft has achieved a dominant position he has vigorously defended it. Many decisions that have led to <!--del_lnk--> antitrust litigation over Microsoft&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> business practices have had Gates&#39; approval. In the 1998 <i><!--del_lnk--> United States v. Microsoft</i> case, Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued over the definitions of words such as: <i>compete</i>, <i>concerned</i>, <i>ask</i>, and <i>we</i>. BusinessWeek reported:<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
       <p>Early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying &#39;I don&#39;t recall&#39; so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle. Worse, many of the technology chief&#39;s denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e-mail Gates both sent and received.</blockquote>
      <p>Despite denials by Bill Gates, the judge ruled that Microsoft had committed monopolization and tying, blocking competition, in violation of the <!--del_lnk--> Sherman Act.<p>Gates meets regularly with Microsoft&#39;s senior managers and <!--del_lnk--> program managers. By all accounts he can be extremely confrontational during these meetings, particularly when he believes that managers have not thought out their business strategy or have placed the company&#39;s future at risk. He has been described shouting at length at employees before letting them continue, with such remarks as &quot;That&#39;s the stupidest thing I&#39;ve ever heard!&quot; and &quot;Why don&#39;t you just give up your options and join the <!--del_lnk--> Peace Corps?&quot; However, he often backs down when the targets of his outbursts respond frankly and directly. When he is not impressed with the technical hurdles managers claim to be facing, he sometimes quips, &quot;Do you want me to do it over the weekend?&quot;<p>Gates&#39; role at Microsoft for most of its history has been primarily a management and executive role. However, he was an active software developer in the early years, particularly on the company&#39;s <a href="../../wp/p/Programming_language.htm" title="Programming language">programming language</a> products. He has not officially been on a development team since working on the <!--del_lnk--> TRS-80 Model 100 line, but he wrote code as late as 1989 that shipped in the company&#39;s products. On <!--del_lnk--> June 15, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, Gates announced that he would transition out of his day-to-day role over the next two years to dedicate more time to philanthropy. He appointed <!--del_lnk--> Ray Ozzie as the new Chief Software Architect and planned to remain as chairman, advising the company on key projects. One of his last initiatives before announcing his departure was the creation of a <!--del_lnk--> robotics software group at Microsoft.<p><a id="Personal_life" name="Personal_life"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Personal life</span></h2>

They have three children: Jennifer Katharine Gates (1996), Rory John Gates (1999) and Phoebe Adele Gates (2002). <!--del_lnk--> Bill Gates&#39; house is one of the most expensive houses in the world, and is a modern 21st century <!--del_lnk--> earth-sheltered home in the side of a hill overlooking <!--del_lnk--> Lake Washington in <!--del_lnk--> Medina, Washington. According to <!--del_lnk--> King County public records, <!--del_lnk--> as of 2006, the total assessed value of the property (land and house) is $125 million, and the annual property tax is just under $1 million.

      <p>Gates has been number one on the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Forbes 400&quot; list from 1993 through to 2006 and number one on <i>Forbes</i> list of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The World&#39;s Richest People&quot; from 1995-2006 with 50 billion US dollars. In 1999, Gates&#39; wealth briefly surpassed $100 billion making him the world&#39;s first <!--del_lnk--> centibillionaire (as measured in U.S. dollars). Since 2000 the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in Microsoft&#39;s stock price after the <!--del_lnk--> dot-com bubble and the multi-billion dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In May 2006, Gates said in an interview that he wished that he were not the richest man in the world, stating that he disliked the attention it brought.<p>Gates has several investments outside Microsoft. He founded <!--del_lnk--> Corbis, a digital imaging company, in <!--del_lnk--> 1989. In 2004 he became a <!--del_lnk--> director of <!--del_lnk--> Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company headed by longtime friend <!--del_lnk--> Warren Buffett. He is a client of <!--del_lnk--> Cascade Investment Group, a <!--del_lnk--> wealth management firm with diverse holdings.<p><a id="Philanthropy" name="Philanthropy"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Philanthropy</span></h3>
      <p>In 2000, Gates founded the <!--del_lnk--> Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, a charitable organization, with his wife. The foundation&#39;s grants have provided funds for college <!--del_lnk--> scholarships for under-represented minorities, <a href="../../wp/a/AIDS.htm" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> prevention, diseases prevalent in <!--del_lnk--> third world countries, and other causes. In 2000, the Gates Foundation endowed the <a href="../../wp/u/University_of_Cambridge.htm" title="University of Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> with $210 million for the <!--del_lnk--> Gates Cambridge Scholarships. The Foundation has also pledged over $7 billion to its various causes, including $1 billion to the <!--del_lnk--> United Negro College Fund. According to a 2004 <i>Forbes</i> magazine article, Gates gave away over $29 billion to charities from 2000 onwards. These donations are usually cited as sparking a substantial change in attitudes towards philanthropy among the very rich, with philanthropy becoming the norm.<p>On June 16, 2006, Bill Gates announced that he would move to a part-time role with Microsoft (leaving day-to-day operations management) in 2008 to begin a full-time career in <!--del_lnk--> philanthropy, but would remain as <!--del_lnk--> chairman.
