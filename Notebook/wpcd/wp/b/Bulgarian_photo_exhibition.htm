<h2>Bulgarian Youngsters Inspire Photography Exhibition</h2><p><strong>16/02/2007</strong></p>
<p>An exhibition of photographs by young people in Bulgaria will be on display at Cambridge&rsquo;s Michaelhouse centre from 19 February - 3 March. The project, a partnership between Bulgarian and UK community groups, showcases the work of youngsters supported by SOS Children in Bulgaria.</p><p>&ldquo;Be with us, because we are with you&rdquo; is a collaboration between Manchester-based community artist and photographer Charlotte Barnes and members of &lsquo;Reverso&rsquo;, a non-governmental organisation providing outdoor adventure activities to children in Sofia, Bulgaria.</p><img src="../../wp/b/Bulgaria_photo_exhibition.jpg" width="493" height="343" alt="Photo taken by a youth supported by SOS Children's Villages Bulgaria" class="left" /><p>Reverso and Charlotte&rsquo;s partnership, with the help of photography students from Manchester Metropolitan and New Bulgaria Universities, gave youngsters supported by SOS Children&rsquo;s Villages in Bulgaria the opportunity to enjoy a day of activities at the charity&rsquo;s centre in Dren, as well as five days of workshops exploring communication through photography. Armed with disposable cameras, the youths were invited to document any and every aspect of their lives. </p><p>The fruits of the project were celebrated with an exhibition in the garden of the National Theatre in Bulgaria&rsquo;s capital, Sofia, as well as being exhibited in Manchester before coming to Cambridge. </p><p>Charlotte Barnes says: &ldquo;The project was an overwhelming experience.  We were all touched by the young people we met, the dedication they showed to the project and the honesty in the photographs they produced. Through the work they created, it became very clear to us the importance of SOS Children&rsquo;s Villages in their lives.&rdquo;</p><p>For more information about the exhibition, please contact us here at SOS Children on 01223 365589 or <a href="mailto:">info@soschildren.org</a> or visit the Young Person's Photography Project website: <strong>www.yppp.co.uk/reverso.php</strong></p><p><strong>Relevant Countries:</strong> <a href="../../wp/b/Bulgaria_A.htm">Bulgaria</a>.</p>
