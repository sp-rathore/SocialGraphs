<h2>SOS Children in Benin</h2>
<img src="../../wp/j/Jwp_map_benin_en1.gif" width="220" height="400" alt="Sponsorship Locations in Benin" class="left" /><p>Benin in north-west Africa has one of Africa's rare democratic systems and is relatively economically stable. However, infant and maternal mortality are high, as is female illiteracy. Poverty and illness are widespread. </p><p>The acute need for care facilities for orphaned and abandoned children led to the charity's construction of its first community in 1987 at Abomey-Calavi, about 17 km from the country's largest city, Cotonou. Six family houses were built, together with a nursery school and a primary school. The charity added five more family houses in 1990 and the village is now home to over 100 children. </p><p>Both the nursery school and the primary school provide children from the neighbourhood, as well as the village, with a sound education. Because of the lack of schools in Benin, a secondary school was built in 2002, which has capacity for over 400 pupils and specialist facilities for teaching arts and music. </p><p>Benin's second SOS Children's community came about as the result of a particular problem with children being abandoned because of traditional beliefs. SOS Children's Village Natitingou opened in 1999. Natitingou is the capital of the province Atacorta in the north-west of Benin. The village is on a hill on the edge of the town on the main road to Djougou, in a sparsely populated, predominantly poor area. It has ten family houses which are home to 100 children. There is a kindergarten for 50 children and also a primary school, both of which take in children from the local community as well as the SOS families. </p><p>A third village in the city of Dassa-Zoum&eacute;, about 125 miles from Cotonou in the centre of the country opened in 2006.  There are twelve family houses for 120 children, a nursery school for 50 children in two classes, a primary school for 210 children in six classes and a social centre which will give support and help to prevent abandonment to 12,000 people each year in the local communities. The main focus of the social centre is a community AIDS awareness project, as AIDS infection rates in Dassa-Zoum&eacute; are among the highest in the country.</p><p>See also <a href="../../wp/a/Aids_Benin_Africa.htm">Aids   Orphan Projects in Benin, Africa</a></p><h3>Local Contacts</h3>
