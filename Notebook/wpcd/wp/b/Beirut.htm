It is sometimes referred to by its <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a> name, <i>Beyrouth</i>. There are wide-ranging estimates of Beirut&#39;s population, from as low as 938,940 people, to 1,303,129 people, to as high as 2,012,000. The lack of an exact figure is due to the fact that no &quot;comprehensive&quot; population census has been taken in Lebanon since 1932.<p>Beirut has regained its title as the commercial centre of the region. Beirut had undergone major reconstruction in recent years and has hosted the <!--del_lnk--> Francophonie and the Arab League summits in 2002. The city had been set to host the <!--del_lnk--> Jeux de la Francophonie (Francophone Games) in 2009. Beirut has suffered setbacks in recent years, and many question if the city still retains the necessary ingredients for the rebirth it had planned.<p>Beirut was considered as a possible candidate for the <!--del_lnk--> 2024 Summer Olympics games. The massive $1.2 billion Sannine Zenith project would have made Lebanon capable of holding the games.<p>The city is home to numerous international organizations. The <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> <!--del_lnk--> Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) is headquartered in Downtown Beirut while the <!--del_lnk--> International Labour Organization (ILO) and <!--del_lnk--> UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) both have regional offices in Beirut covering the <!--del_lnk--> Arab world. The <!--del_lnk--> Arab Air Carriers Organization (AACO) is also headquartered in Beirut.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> Travel and Leisure magazine&#39;s &#39;World Best Awards 2006&#39; Beirut was ranked the 9th (out of 10) city in the world, falling just short of <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a> and coming ahead of <!--del_lnk--> San Francisco.<p>Beirut has both developed and less developed neighborhoods. Its most famous <!--del_lnk--> religiously mixed neighborhoods are Zarif and Verdun; <!--del_lnk--> Saifi Village is its most prominent and expensive residential one (a bit too expensive, maybe, as approximately half the residential units still remain unsold). Its most prominent Christian neighborhoods are <!--del_lnk--> Achrafieh and <!--del_lnk--> Gemmayzih, which has lately become a &#39;hot&#39; neighbourhood, full of trendy restaurants and cafes, and hip bars.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p>Originally named <i>B&ecirc;r&#x16B;t</i> &quot;The Wells&quot; by the <!--del_lnk--> Phoenicians, Beirut history goes back to more than 5000 years. Excavations in the Downtown of Beirut have unearthed layers of Phoenician, Hellenistic, Roman, Arab and Ottoman civilizations. The first historical reference to Beirut dates from the <!--del_lnk--> 14th century BC, when it is mentioned in the <!--del_lnk--> cuneiform tablets of the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Amarna letters.&quot; <!--del_lnk--> Ammunira of <i>Biruta</i>-(Beirut) sent 3 letters to the pharaoh of Egypt. Biruta is also referenced in the letters from <!--del_lnk--> Rib-Hadda of <!--del_lnk--> Byblos. The most ancient settlement was on an island in the river that progressively silted up. The city was known in antiquity as <i>Berytus</i> (see also <!--del_lnk--> List of traditional Greek place names); this name was taken in 1934 for the archaeological journal published by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at the <!--del_lnk--> American University of Beirut.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 140 BC, the city was taken and destroyed by <!--del_lnk--> Diodotus Tryphon in his contest with <!--del_lnk--> Antiochus VII Sidetes for the throne of the <!--del_lnk--> Seleucid monarchy. Beirut was soon rebuilt on a more regularized <!--del_lnk--> Hellenistic plan, renamed <i>Laodicea in Phoenicia</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Greek: &Lambda;&alpha;&omicron;&delta;&iota;&kappa;&epsilon;&iota;&alpha; &#x3AE; &tau;&omicron;&upsilon; &Phi;&omicron;&iota;&nu;&#x3AF;&kappa;&eta;) or <i>Laodicea in Canaan</i>, in honour of a Seleucid <!--del_lnk--> Laodice. The modern city overlies the ancient one and little archaeology had been accomplished until after the end of the civil war in <!--del_lnk--> 1991; now large sites in the devastated city centre have been opened to archaeological exploration. A dig in 1994 established that one of Beirut&#39;s modern streets, Souk Tawile, still follows the lines of an ancient Hellenistic/Roman one.<p>Mid-<!--del_lnk--> first century BC <a href="../../wp/c/Coin.htm" title="Coins">coins</a> of Berytus bear the head of <!--del_lnk--> Tyche, goddess of fortune; on the reverse, the city&#39;s symbol appears: a dolphin entwines an anchor. This symbol was taken up by the early printer <!--del_lnk--> Aldus Manutius in 15th century <!--del_lnk--> Venice.<p>Under the Romans it was enriched by the dynasty of <!--del_lnk--> Herod the Great, then made a <!--del_lnk--> colonia, <i>Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix</i>, in the late <!--del_lnk--> 1st century AD. Beirut&#39;s school of law was widely known at the time. Two of Rome&#39;s most famous jurists, <!--del_lnk--> Papinian and <!--del_lnk--> Ulpian, both natives of Phoenicia, taught at the law school under the <!--del_lnk--> Severan emperors. When <!--del_lnk--> Justinian assembled his <i><!--del_lnk--> Pandects</i> in the 6th century, a large part of the corpus of laws were derived from these two jurists, and Justinian recognized the school as one of the three official law schools of the empire (533). Within a few years, as the result of a disastrous earthquake (551), the students were transferred to <!--del_lnk--> Sidon.<p>Beirut passed to the <!--del_lnk--> Arabs in 635. As a trading centre of the eastern <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> Beirut was overshadowed by <!--del_lnk--> Akka during the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>. From 1110 to 1291 it was in the hands of <a href="../../wp/c/Crusades.htm" title="Crusades">Crusader</a> lords. No matter who was its nominal overlord, whether Turk or <!--del_lnk--> Mamluk, Beirut was ruled locally by <!--del_lnk--> Druze emirs. One of these, <!--del_lnk--> Fakr ed-Din Maan II, fortified it early in the <a href="../../wp/1/17th_century.htm" title="17th century">17th century</a>, but the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottomans</a> retook it in 1763 and thenceforth, with the help of <a href="../../wp/d/Damascus.htm" title="Damascus">Damascus</a>, Beirut successfully broke Akka&#39;s monopoly on Syrian maritime trade and for a few years supplanted it as the main trading centre in the region. During the succeeding epoch of rebellion against Ottoman hegemony at Akka under <!--del_lnk--> Jezzar and <!--del_lnk--> Abdullah pashas, Beirut declined to a small town (population about 10,000), fought over among the Druze, the Turks and the pashas. After <!--del_lnk--> Ibrahim Pasha captured Akka in 1832, Beirut began its early modern revival. In 1888 Beirut was made capital of a <!--del_lnk--> vilayet in Syria, including the <!--del_lnk--> sanjaks Latakia, <!--del_lnk--> Tripoli, Beirut, Akka and Bekaa. Beirut became a very cosmopolitan city and had close links with <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. Beirut became a centre of <!--del_lnk--> missionary activity, which was generally very unsuccessful in conversions (a massacre of Christians in 1860 was the occasion for further European interventions), but did build an impressive education system. This include the Syrian Protestant College, which was established by American missionaries and eventually became the <!--del_lnk--> American University of Beirut (AUB). Beirut became the centre of Arab intellectual activity in the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a>. Provided with water from a British company and gas from a French one, the city thrived on exporting <!--del_lnk--> silk grown on nearby <!--del_lnk--> Mount Lebanon. After French engineers established a modern harbour (1894) and a rail link across <a href="../../wp/l/Lebanon.htm" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a> to <a href="../../wp/d/Damascus.htm" title="Damascus">Damascus</a>, and then to <!--del_lnk--> Aleppo (1907), much of the trade was carried by <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> ships to <a href="../../wp/m/Marseille.htm" title="Marseille">Marseille</a>, and soon French influence in the area exceeded that of any other European power. In 1911 the population mix was reported in the <i><a href="../../wp/e/Encyclop%25C3%25A6dia_Britannica.htm" title="Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica">Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</a></i> as Muslims, 36,000; Christians, 77,000; Jews, 2500; Druze, 400; foreigners, 4100. After the collapse of the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> following the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">First World War</a>, Beirut, along with all of Lebanon was placed under the <!--del_lnk--> French Mandate.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Lebanon achieved independence in 1943 and Beirut became its capital city. Beirut remained the intellectual capital of the Arab world and a major commercial and tourist centre until <!--del_lnk--> 1975 when a brutal <!--del_lnk--> civil war broke out in Lebanon. During most of the war, the city was divided between the largely Muslim west part and the Christian east. The central area of the city, previously the focus of much of the commercial and cultural activities, became a no-man&#39;s land. Many of the city&#39;s best and brightest inhabitants fled to other countries. In <!--del_lnk--> 1983 French and US <!--del_lnk--> barracks were bombed, killing 302.<p>Since the end of the war in <!--del_lnk--> 1989, the people of Lebanon have been rebuilding Beirut, and by the start of the <!--del_lnk--> 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict the city had somewhat regained its status as a <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">tourist</a>, cultural, and intellectual center in the Middle East, as well as a centre for commerce, fashion, and media. However, many would say the city has lost its premier status, due to competition from places like <a href="../../wp/d/Dubai.htm" title="Dubai">Dubai</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Cyprus.htm" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> in the fields of tourism, business, fashion, commerce, and banking. Reconstruction of <!--del_lnk--> downtown Beirut has been largely driven by <!--del_lnk--> Solidere, a development company established in 1994 by Hariri. Beirut is home to the international designer <!--del_lnk--> Elie Saab, jeweller Robert Moawad, and to some of the most popular and successful <!--del_lnk--> satellite television stations, such as LBC, Future TV, New TV and others. The city was host to the Asian Basketball Championship and the Asian Football Championship. Beirut also successfully hosted the <!--del_lnk--> Miss Europe pageant eight times, 1960-1964, 1999, 2001-2002.<p>The assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> Rafic Hariri, in 2005 in Beirut shook the entire country. The last Syrian troops withdrew from Beirut on <!--del_lnk--> April 26, <!--del_lnk--> 2005.<p><a id="Religion" name="Religion"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h2>

      <p>Beirut is one of the most religiously diverse cities of the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, with <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Muslims</a> (<!--del_lnk--> Sunni and <!--del_lnk--> Shi&#39;ite), <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christians</a> (<!--del_lnk--> Maronite Catholics, <a href="../../wp/e/Eastern_Orthodox_Church.htm" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Greek Orthodox</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Greek Catholics, <!--del_lnk--> Armenian Orthodox, <!--del_lnk--> Armenian Catholics, <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholics, <!--del_lnk--> Syriacs, <!--del_lnk--> Copts, <!--del_lnk--> Methodists, <!--del_lnk--> Protestants), <!--del_lnk--> Druze and atheists all having a significant presence. However, most of the <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jew">Jews</a> of Beirut emigrated to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> when the Lebanese Civil War started in 1975, though there are also populations of Lebanese Jews in France and Brazil, one of the more famous ones being <!--del_lnk--> Edmond Safra. Many of the denominations are actually tiny minorities or, like the Jews, almost non-existent (estimates place the Jewish population at less than 30). The Armenian Catholics, Roman Catholics, Syriacs, and Copts all number in the thousands and have a negligible prescence when compared to the other religions. For all intents and purposes, Lebanon really only has 8 major religions (Sunni Muslims, Shiite Muslims, Druze, Maronite Catholics, Greek Orthodox, Greek Catholic, Armenian Orthodox, Armenian Catholics, and Protestants). There is no counting of atheist people or non believers in Lebanon because of the predominance of religion in public life and in the governmental and administrative sphere.<p>Beirut was torn apart during the <!--del_lnk--> Lebanese Civil War and was divided between the Muslim West Beirut and the Christian East. The city today has been reunited and rebuilt, and its Christian-Muslim balance remains, even if it is a precarious balance. Tensions remain high between the various groups. Some say these tensions always existed, and the 1975-1990 <!--del_lnk--> Lebanese Civil War brought those tensions out into the open. Today, there is still much tension, especially between the Sunni and Shiite Muslims.<p>The patron god of Beirut in Phoenician mythology is Baal-Berit, also god of the sea.<p><a id="Colleges_and_universities" name="Colleges_and_universities"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Colleges and universities</span></h2>

      <p>Backed by the <!--del_lnk--> Mount Lebanon mountains, Beirut is situated on a spur where the narrow coastal plain projects into the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>. Beirut&#39;s coast is rather diverse; rocky beaches, sandy shores, and cliffs are situated beside one another.
