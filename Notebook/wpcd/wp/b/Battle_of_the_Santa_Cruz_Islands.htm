      <p>The <b>Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands</b>, <!--del_lnk--> October 26, <!--del_lnk--> 1942, sometimes referred to as the <b>Battle of Santa Cruz</b> or in Japanese sources as the <b>Battle of the South Pacific</b> (&#x5357;&#x592A;&#x5E73;&#x6D0B;&#x6D77;&#x6226;), was the fourth <a href="../../wp/a/Aircraft_carrier.htm" title="Aircraft carrier">carrier</a> battle of the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific campaign of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> and the fourth major engagement fought between the <!--del_lnk--> United States Navy and the <a href="../../wp/i/Imperial_Japanese_Navy.htm" title="Imperial Japanese Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> during the lengthy <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Guadalcanal in the <!--del_lnk--> Solomon Islands campaign. In similar fashion to the battles of <!--del_lnk--> Coral Sea, <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Midway.htm" title="Battle of Midway">Midway</a>, and the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_the_Eastern_Solomons.htm" title="Battle of the Eastern Solomons">Eastern Solomons</a>, the ships of the two adversaries were rarely in direct <!--del_lnk--> visual range of each other. Instead, almost all attacks by both sides were mounted by carrier or land-based <!--del_lnk--> aircraft.<p>In an attempt to drive <!--del_lnk--> Allied forces from <!--del_lnk--> Guadalcanal and nearby islands, and end the stalemate which had existed since September 1942, the <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Japanese Army planned a major ground offensive on Guadalcanal for October 20-25, 1942. In support of this offensive, and with the hope of engaging Allied naval forces, Japanese carriers and other large warships moved into a position near the southern <a href="../../wp/s/Solomon_Islands.htm" title="Solomon Islands">Solomon Islands</a>. From this location, the Japanese naval forces hoped to engage and decisively defeat any Allied (primarily U.S.) naval forces, especially carrier forces, that responded to the ground offensive. However, Allied naval forces also hoped to meet the Japanese naval forces in battle, with the same objectives of breaking the stalemate and decisively defeating their adversary.<p>The Japanese ground offensive was defeated by Allied ground forces on October 20-25 in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle for Henderson Field. Nevertheless, the naval warships and aircraft from the two adversaries confronted each other on the morning of October 26, 1942, just north of the <!--del_lnk--> Santa Cruz Islands. After an exchange of carrier <!--del_lnk--> air attacks, Allied <!--del_lnk--> surface ships were forced to retreat from the battle area with the loss of one carrier sunk and another heavily damaged. However, the participating Japanese carrier forces also retreated due to high aircraft and <!--del_lnk--> aircrew losses, and significant damage to two carriers. Although an apparent tactical victory for the Japanese in terms of ships sunk and damaged, the loss of many irreplaceable, veteran aircrews by the Japanese provided a long-term strategic advantage for the Allies, whose aircrew losses in the battle were relatively low, partially due to search and rescue efforts.<p>

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> August 7, 1942, Allied forces landed on <!--del_lnk--> Guadalcanal, <!--del_lnk--> Tulagi, and <!--del_lnk--> Florida Islands in the <a href="../../wp/s/Solomon_Islands.htm" title="Solomon Islands">Solomon Islands</a> with the immediate objective of denying the use of the islands to the Japanese, who would otherwise have been able to use the islands as <!--del_lnk--> bases from which to threaten <!--del_lnk--> supply routes between the U.S. and <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>. The Allies also sought to use the islands as the starting point for a <!--del_lnk--> campaign which could eventually isolate the major Japanese base at <!--del_lnk--> Rabaul while also supporting the Allied campaings in <!--del_lnk--> New Guinea and <!--del_lnk--> New Britain. The landings initiated the six-month-long <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Guadalcanal.<p>After the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_the_Eastern_Solomons.htm" title="Battle of the Eastern Solomons">Battle of the Eastern Solomons</a>, in which the U.S. aircraft carrier <!--del_lnk--> <i>Enterprise</i> was heavily damaged and forced to travel to <!--del_lnk--> Pearl Harbour, <!--del_lnk--> Hawaii for a month of major repairs, three U.S. carrier <!--del_lnk--> task forces remained in the South Pacific area. The task forces included the U.S. carriers <!--del_lnk--> <i>Wasp</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Saratoga</i>, and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Hornet</i> plus their respective <!--del_lnk--> air groups and supporting surface warships, including <!--del_lnk--> battleships, <!--del_lnk--> cruisers, and <!--del_lnk--> destroyers, and were primarily stationed between the Solomons and <!--del_lnk--> New Hebrides (<a href="../../wp/v/Vanuatu.htm" title="Vanuatu">Vanuatu</a>) islands. At this location, the U.S. carriers were charged with guarding the line of communication between the major Allied bases at <a href="../../wp/n/New_Caledonia.htm" title="New Caledonia">New Caledonia</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Espiritu Santo, supporting the Allied ground forces at Guadalcanal and Tulagi against any Japanese counteroffensives, covering the movement of supply ships to Guadalcanal, and last, but not least, engaging and destroying any Japanese <!--del_lnk--> warships, especially carriers, that came within range.<p>The area of ocean in which the U.S. carrier task forces operated was known as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Torpedo Junction&quot; by U.S. forces due to the high concentration of Japanese <!--del_lnk--> submarines in the area. On <!--del_lnk--> August 31, <i>Saratoga</i> was torpedoed by Japanese submarine <!--del_lnk--> <i>I-26</i> and was out of action for three months for repairs. On <!--del_lnk--> September 14, while supporting a major reinforcement and resupply convoy to Guadalcanal, and almost engaging Japanese carriers <!--del_lnk--> <i>Sh&#x14D;kaku</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Zuikaku</i> (who withdrew just before the two adversaries came into range of each other&#39;s aircraft), <i>Wasp</i> was hit by three torpedoes fired by Japanese submarine <!--del_lnk--> <i>I-19</i>. With power knocked out due to damage from the torpedo explosions, <i>Wasp</i>&rsquo;s <!--del_lnk--> damage-control teams were unable to contain the ensuing large fires, and she was abandoned and <!--del_lnk--> scuttled.<p>Although the U.S. now had only one operational carrier (<i>Hornet</i>) in the South Pacific, the Allies still maintained <!--del_lnk--> air superiority over the southern Solomon Islands due to their aircraft based at <!--del_lnk--> Henderson Field on Guadalcanal. However, at night, when aircraft weren&#39;t able to operate effectively, the Japanese were able to operate their ships around Guadalcanal almost at will. Thus, a <!--del_lnk--> stalemate in the battle for Guadalcanal developed, with the Allies delivering supplies and reinforcements to Guadalcanal during the day, and the Japanese delivering supplies and reinforcements by warship (called the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Tokyo Express&quot; by the Allies) at night with neither side able to deliver enough troops to the island to secure a decisive advantage. By mid-October, both sides had roughly an equal number of troops on the island. The stalemate was briefly interrupted by two large-ship naval actions. On the night of October 11&ndash;12, a U.S. warship force intercepted and defeated a Japanese warship force that was enroute to bombard Henderson Field in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Cape Esperance. But, just two nights later a Japanese force that included battleships <!--del_lnk--> <i>Haruna</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Kong&#x14D;</i> successfully bombarded Henderson Field, destroying most of the U.S. aircraft and inflicting severe damage on the field&#39;s facilities. Although still marginally operational, it would take several weeks for the airfield to recover from the damage and replace the destroyed aircraft.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>At this time, the U.S. made two moves to try to break the stalemate in the battle for Guadalcanal. First, repairs to <i>Enterprise</i> were expedited so that she could return to the South Pacific as soon as possible. On October 10, <i>Enterprise</i> received her new air groups, on October 16, she left Pearl Harbour, and, on October 23, she arrived back in the South Pacific and rendezvoused with <i>Hornet</i> and the rest of the Allied South Pacific naval forces on <!--del_lnk--> October 24, 273&nbsp;miles (505&nbsp;km) northeast of <!--del_lnk--> Espiritu Santo.<p>Second, on October 18, <!--del_lnk--> Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Chester Nimitz, Allied Commander in Chief of Pacific Forces, replaced <!--del_lnk--> Vice Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Robert L. Ghormley, as Commander, South Pacific Area (this position commanded Allied forces involved in the Solomon Islands campaign) with Vice Admiral <!--del_lnk--> William Halsey, Jr. Nimitz felt that Ghormley had become too myopic and pessimistic to effectively lead Allied forces involved in the struggle for Guadalcanal. Halsey was reportedly respected throughout the U.S. naval fleet as a &quot;fighter.&quot; Upon assuming command, Halsey immediately began making plans to draw the Japanese naval forces into a battle, writing to Nimitz, &quot;I had to begin throwing punches almost immediately.&quot;<p>The Japanese Combined Fleet was also seeking to draw Allied naval forces into what was hoped to be a decisive battle. Two fleet carriers, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Hiy&#x14D;</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Juny&#x14D;</i>, plus one light carrier, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Zuih&#x14D;</i>, arrived at the main Japanese naval base at <!--del_lnk--> Truk from Japan in early October and joined <i>Sh&#x14D;kaku</i> and <i>Zuikaku.</i> With five carriers fully staffed with air groups, plus their numerous battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, the Japanese Combined Fleet, directed by Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Isoroku Yamamoto, was confident that they could make-up for their defeat at the Battle of Midway. Apart from a couple of air raids on Henderson Field in October, the Japanese carriers and their supporting warships stayed out of the battle for Guadalcanal in the northern Solomon Island&#39;s area, waiting for a chance to approach and engage the U.S. carrier fleet. With the Japanese <!--del_lnk--> Army&#39;s next planned major ground attack on Allied forces on Guadalcanal set for October 20&ndash;25, Yamamoto&#39;s warships began to position themselves towards the southern Solomons to not only support their army&#39;s offensive, but to be ready to engage any Allied (primarily U.S.) ships, especially carriers, that approached to support the Allied ground forces&#39; defenses on Guadalcanal. The Japanese believed that U.S. Navy forces were likely to be in the Solomons Island area for they had read a report from the <!--del_lnk--> United Press dated <!--del_lnk--> October 20 that stated that the United States Navy was preparing for a major sea and air battle in the South Pacific.<p><a id="Battle" name="Battle"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Battle</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Prelude" name="Prelude"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Prelude</span></h3>
      <p>From October 20&ndash;25, Japanese land forces on Guadalcanal attempted to capture Henderson Field with a large-scale attack against U.S. troops defending the airfield. However, the attack was decisively defeated with heavy casualties for the Japanese during the <!--del_lnk--> Battle for Henderson Field.<p>Incorrectly believing that the Japanese army troops had succeeded in capturing Henderson Field, a force of Japanese warships approached Guadalcanal on the morning of <!--del_lnk--> October 25 to provide further support for the army offensive. Aircraft from Henderson Field attacked the convoy throughout the day, sinking the <!--del_lnk--> light cruiser <!--del_lnk--> <i>Yura</i> and damaging the destroyer <!--del_lnk--> <i>Akizuki</i>.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Despite the failure of the Japanese ground offensive and the loss of <i>Yura.</i> The rest of the Combined Fleet continued to maneuver near the southern Solomon Islands on October 25 with the hope of encountering Allied naval forces in battle. The Japanese naval forces now included four carriers, for <i>Hiy&#x14D;</i> had suffered an accidental, damaging fire on October 22 that forced her to return to Truk for repairs. The Japanese naval forces were divided into three groups: The &quot;Advanced&quot; force contained <i>Juny&#x14D;</i>, plus two battleships, four <!--del_lnk--> heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, and 10 destroyers, and was commanded by Vice Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Nobutake Kondo in heavy cruiser <!--del_lnk--> <i>Atago</i>; the &quot;Main Body&quot; consisted of <i>Sh&#x14D;kaku</i>, <i>Zuikaku</i>, and <i>Zuih&#x14D;</i> plus one heavy cruiser and eight destroyers, and was commanded by Vice Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Chuichi Nagumo in <i>Sh&#x14D;kaku</i>; the &quot;Vanguard&quot; force contained two battleships, three heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, and seven destroyers, and was commanded by Rear Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Hiroaki Abe in battleship <!--del_lnk--> <i>Hiei</i>. In addition to commanding the Advanced force, Kondo acted as the overall commander of the three forces.<p>On the U.S. side, the <i>Hornet</i> and <i>Enterprise</i> task groups, under the overall command of Rear Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Kinkaid swept around to the north of the Santa Cruz Islands on October 25 searching for the Japanese naval forces. The U.S. warships were deployed as two separate carrier groups, each centered on either <i>Hornet</i> or <i>Enterprise</i>, and separated from each other by about 10&nbsp;miles (20&nbsp;km). A U.S. <!--del_lnk--> PBY Catalina based in the Santa Cruz Islands located the Japanese Main body carriers at <!--del_lnk--> 11:03. However, the Japanese carriers were about 355&nbsp;miles (655&nbsp;km) from the U.S. force, just beyond carrier aircraft range. Kinkaid, hoping to close the range to be able to execute an attack that day, steamed towards the Japanese carriers at top speed, and, at 14:25, launched a strike force of 23 aircraft. But, the Japanese, knowing that they had been spotted by U.S. aircraft and not knowing where the U.S. carriers were, turned to the north to stay out of range of the U.S. carriers&#39; aircraft. Thus, the U.S. strike force returned to their carriers without finding or attacking the Japanese warships.<p><a id="Carrier_action_on_October_26_-_1st_strikes" name="Carrier_action_on_October_26_-_1st_strikes"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Carrier action on October 26 - 1st strikes</span></h3>
      <p>At 02:50 on October 26, the Japanese naval forces reversed direction and the naval forces of the two adversaries closed the distance until they were only 200&nbsp;miles (370&nbsp;km) away from each other by 05:00. At this time, both sides launched search aircraft and prepared their remaining aircraft to attack as soon as the other side&#39;s ships were located. Although a <a href="../../wp/r/Radar.htm" title="Radar">radar</a>-equipped U.S. Catalina sighted the Japanese carriers at 03:10, the report didn&#39;t reach Kinkaid until 05:12. Therefore, believing that the Japanese ships had probably changed position during the last two hours, he decided to withhold launching a strike force until he received more current information on the location of the Japanese ships.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>At 06:45, a U.S. scout aircraft sighted the carriers of Nagumo&#39;s Main body. At 06:58, a Japanese scout aircraft reported the location of <i>Hornet</i>&rsquo;s task force. Both sides now raced to be the first to attack the other. The Japanese were first to get their strike force launched, with 64 aircraft, including 21 <!--del_lnk--> &quot;Val&quot; <!--del_lnk--> dive bombers, 20 <!--del_lnk--> &quot;Kate&quot; <!--del_lnk--> torpedo bombers, 21 <!--del_lnk--> Zero <!--del_lnk--> fighters, and two &quot;Kate&quot; <!--del_lnk--> command and control aircraft on the way towards <i>Hornet</i> by 07:40. At this same time (07:40), two U.S. <!--del_lnk--> SBD Dauntless scout aircraft, responding to the earlier sighting of the Japanese carriers, arrived and dove on <i>Zuih&#x14D;</i>. With the Japanese <!--del_lnk--> combat air patrol (CAP) busy chasing other U.S. scout aircraft away, the two U.S. aircraft were able to approach and drop both of their bombs on <i>Zuih&#x14D;</i>, causing heavy damage and preventing the carrier&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> flight deck from being able to land aircraft.<p>Meanwhile, Kondo ordered Abe&#39;s Vanguard force to race ahead to try to intercept and engage the U.S. warships. Kondo also brought his own Advanced force forward at maximum speed so that <i>Juny&#x14D;</i>&rsquo;s aircraft could join in the attacks on the U.S. ships. At 08:10, <i>Sh&#x14D;kaku</i> launched a second wave of strike aircraft, consisting of 19 Vals and eight Zeros and, at 08:40, <i>Zuikaku</i> launched 16 Kates. Thus, by 09:10 the Japanese had 110 aircraft on the way to attack the U.S. carriers.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The U.S. strike aircraft were running about 20 minutes behind the Japanese. Believing that a speedy attack was more important than a massed attack, the U.S. aircraft proceeded in small groups towards the Japanese ships instead of forming into one large strike force. The first group, consisting of 15 SBD dive bombers, six <!--del_lnk--> TBF Avenger torpedo bombers, and eight <!--del_lnk--> F4F Wildcat fighters from <i>Hornet</i>, was on its way by about 08:00. A second group, consisting of three SBDs, seven TBFs, and eight Wildcats from <i>Enterprise</i> was off by 08:10. A third group, which included nine SBDs, eight TBFs, and seven Wildcats from <i>Hornet</i>, was on its way by 08:20.<p>At 08:30, the opposing aircraft strike formations began passing within sight of each other. Nine Zeros from <i>Zuih&#x14D;</i> broke off from their formation and attacked the <i>Enterprise</i> group of aircraft. In the resulting engagement, four Zeros, three Wildcats, and two TBFs were shot down, with another two TBFs forced to return to <i>Enterprise</i> with heavy damage.<p>At 08:50, the lead U.S. attack formation from <i>Hornet</i> spotted four ships from Abe&#39;s Vanguard force. Pressing on, the U.S. aircraft sighted the Japanese carriers and prepared to attack. Three Zeros from <i>Zuih&#x14D;</i> attacked the formation&#39;s Wildcats, drawing them away from the bombers they were assigned to protect. Thus, the dive bombers in the first group initiated their attacks without fighter escort. Twenty Zeros from the Japanese carrier CAP attacked the SBD formation and shot-down four of them. The remaining 11 SBDs commenced their attack dives on <i>Sh&#x14D;kaku</i> at 09:27, hitting her with three to six bombs, ruining her flight deck, and causing serious damage to the interior of the ship. The final SBD of the 11 lost track of the <i>Sh&#x14D;kaku</i> and instead dropped its bomb near the Japanese destroyer <!--del_lnk--> <i>Teruzuki</i>, causing minor damage. The six TBFs in the first strike force, having become separated from their strike group, missed finding the Japanese carriers and eventually turned-back towards <i>Hornet</i>. On the way back, they attacked the Japanese heavy cruiser <!--del_lnk--> <i>Tone</i>, missing with all of their torpedoes.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The TBFs of the second U.S. attack formation from <i>Enterprise</i> were unable to locate the Japanese carriers, and instead attacked the Japanese heavy cruiser <!--del_lnk--> <i>Suzuya</i> from Abe&#39;s Vanguard force, but caused no damage. At about the same time, the third U.S. attack formation, from <i>Hornet</i>, found Abe&#39;s ships and attacked the Japanese heavy cruiser <!--del_lnk--> <i>Chikuma</i>, hitting her with two 1,000 pound bombs and causing heavy damage. The three <i>Enterprise</i> SBDs then arrived and also attacked <i>Chikuma</i>, causing more damage with one bomb hit and two near-misses. Finally, the eight TBFs from the third strike group arrived and attacked the smoking <i>Chikuma</i>, scoring one more hit. <i>Chikuma</i>, escorted by two destroyers, withdrew from the battle and headed towards Truk for repairs.<p>The U.S. carrier forces received word from their outbound strike aircraft at 08:30 that Japanese attack aircraft were headed their way. At 08:52, the Japanese strike force commander sighted the <i>Hornet</i> task force (the <i>Enterprise</i> task force was hidden by a rain <!--del_lnk--> squall) and deployed his aircraft for attack. At 08:55, the U.S. carriers detected the approaching Japanese aircraft on radar, about 35&nbsp;miles (65&nbsp;km) away, and began to vector the 37 Wildcat fighters of their CAP to engage the incoming Japanese aircraft. However, communication problems, mistakes by the U.S. fighter control directors, and primitive control procedures prevented all but a few of the U.S. fighters from engaging the Japanese aircraft before they began their attacks on <i>Hornet</i>. Although the U.S. CAP was able to shoot down several Vals, most of the Japanese aircraft commenced their attacks relatively unmolested by U.S. fighters.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>At 09:09, the <!--del_lnk--> anti-aircraft guns of <i>Hornet</i> and her escorting warships opened fire as the 20 untouched Japanese Kates and remaining 16 Vals commenced their attacks on the carrier. At 09:12, a Val placed its 250-kilogram, semi-armor-piercing bomb dead centre on <i>Hornet</i>&rsquo;s flight deck, across from the island, which penetrated three decks before exploding, killing 60 men. Moments later, a 242-kilogram &quot;land&quot; bomb struck the flight deck, detonating on impact and creating an 11-foot hole as well as killing 30 men. A minute or so later, a third bomb hit <i>Hornet</i> near where the first bomb hit, penetrating three decks before exploding, causing severe damage but no direct loss of life. At 09:14, a diving Val was hit and damaged by anti-aircraft fire directly over <i>Hornet</i>. The Val&#39;s pilot, in an apparently spontaneous, <!--del_lnk--> kamikaze-style attack, then purposely crashed his aircraft into <i>Hornet</i>&rsquo;s <!--del_lnk--> stack, spreading burning aviation fuel over the signal deck.<p>At the same time that the Vals were attacking, the Japanese Kate torpedo bombers were also attacking <i>Hornet</i> from two different directions. In spite of suffering heavy losses from anti-aircraft fire, the Kates planted two torpedoes in <i>Hornet</i> between 09:13 and 09:17, knocking-out her engines. As <i>Hornet</i> glided to a stop, a damaged Val approached and purposely crashed into the carrier&#39;s side, starting a fire near the ship&#39;s main supply of aviation fuel. At 09:20, the surviving Japanese aircraft departed, leaving <i>Hornet</i> dead in the water and burning. Twenty Five Japanese and six U.S. aircraft were destroyed in this first attack on <i>Hornet</i>.<p>With the assistance of firehoses from three escorting destroyers, the fires on <i>Hornet</i> were under control by 10:00. Wounded personnel were evacuated from the carrier and an attempt was made by the U.S. cruiser <!--del_lnk--> <i>Northampton</i> to tow <i>Hornet</i> away from the battle area. However, the effort to rig the towline took some time and more attack waves of Japanese aircraft were inbound.<p><a id="Carrier_action_on_October_26_-_post-first_strike_actions" name="Carrier_action_on_October_26_-_post-first_strike_actions"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Carrier action on October 26 - post-first strike actions</span></h3>
      <p>Starting at 09:30, <i>Enterprise</i> landed many of the damaged and fuel-depleted CAP fighters and returning scout aircraft from both carriers. However, with her flight deck full, and the second wave of Japanese aircraft inbound, which was detected on radar at 09:30, <i>Enterprise</i> ceased landing operations at 10:00. Fuel-depleted aircraft then began <!--del_lnk--> ditching in the ocean as the carrier&#39;s escorting destroyers rescued the aircrews. One of the ditching aircraft, a damaged TBF from <i>Enterprise</i>&rsquo;s strike force that had been attacked earlier by <i>Zuih&#x14D;</i> Zeros, crashed into the water near the U.S. destroyer <!--del_lnk--> <i>Porter</i>. As the destroyer rescued the TBF&#39;s crew, the torpedo from the TBF began running in a wild circle and struck <i>Porter</i> and exploded, causing heavy damage and killing 15 crewmen. After the task force commander ordered the destroyer scuttled, the crew was rescued by the U.S. destroyer <!--del_lnk--> <i>Shaw</i> which then sank <i>Porter</i> with gunfire.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>As the first wave of Japanese strike aircraft began returning to their carriers from their attack on <i>Hornet</i>, one of them spotted the <i>Enterprise</i> task force and reported the carrier&#39;s position. Thus, the second Japanese aircraft strike wave, believing <i>Hornet</i> to be sinking, directed their attacks on the <i>Enterprise</i> task force, beginning at 10:08. Again, the U.S. CAP had trouble intercepting the Japanese aircraft before they attacked <i>Enterprise</i>, shooting down only two of the 19 Vals as they began their dives on the carrier. Attacking through the intense anti-aircraft fire put-up by <i>Enterprise</i> and her escorting warships, the Vals hit the carrier with two 250-kilogram bombs and near-missed with another, causing heavy damage to the carrier and jamming her forward <!--del_lnk--> elevator in the &quot;up&quot; position. Twelve of the 19 Vals were lost in this attack.<p>Twenty-minutes later, the 16 <i>Zuikaku</i> Kates arrived and split-up to attack <i>Enterprise</i>. One group of Kates was attacked by two CAP Wildcats which shot down three of them and damaged a fourth. On fire, the fourth damaged Kate purposely crashed into the U.S. destroyer <!--del_lnk--> <i>Smith</i>, setting the ship on fire and killing 57 of her crew. The destroyer steered into the spraying <!--del_lnk--> wake of the U.S. battleship <!--del_lnk--> <i>South Dakota</i> to help put-out the fires and then resumed her station, firing her remaining anti-aircraft guns at the still attacking Kates.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The remaining Kates attacked <i>Enterprise</i>, <i>South Dakota</i>, and U.S. cruiser <!--del_lnk--> <i>Portland</i>, but all of their torpedoes missed or were <!--del_lnk--> duds, causing no damage. The engagement was over at 10:53 with nine of the 16 attacking Kates shot down. After suppressing most of the onboard fires, at 11:15 <i>Enterprise</i> reopened her flight deck to begin landing returning aircraft from the morning U.S. strikes on the Japanese warship forces. However, only a few aircraft landed before the next wave of Japanese strike aircraft arrived and began their attacks on <i>Enterprise</i>, forcing a suspension of landing operations.<p>Between 09:05 and 09:14, <i>Juny&#x14D;</i> had arrived within 280&nbsp;miles (520&nbsp;km) of the U.S. carriers and launched a strike of 17 Vals and 12 Zeros. As the Japanese Main body and Advanced force maneuvered to try to join formations, <i>Juny&#x14D;</i> readied follow-on strikes. At 11:21, the <i>Juny&#x14D;</i> Vals arrived and dove on the <i>Enterprise</i> task force. The Vals scored one near miss on <i>Enterprise</i>, causing more damage, and one hit each on <i>South Dakota</i> and U.S. cruiser <!--del_lnk--> <i>San Juan</i>, causing moderate damage to both ships. Eleven of the 17 Vals were destroyed in this attack.<p>At 11:35, Kinkaid decided to withdraw <i>Enterprise</i> and her screening ships from the battle, due to <i>Hornet</i> being out of action, the heavy damage that <i>Enterprise</i> had received, and believing (correctly), that the Japanese had one to two undamaged carriers in the area. He directed <i>Hornet</i>&rsquo;s task force to follow as soon as they were able. Between 11:39 and 13:22, <i>Enterprise</i> recovered 57 aircraft as she headed away from the battle. The remaining airborne U.S. aircraft ditched in the ocean and their aircrews were rescued by escorting warships.<p>Between 11:40 and 14:00, <i>Zuikaku</i> and <i>Juny&#x14D;</i> recovered the few aircraft that returned from the morning strikes on <i>Hornet</i> and <i>Enterprise</i> and prepared follow-on strikes. At 13:00, Kondo&#39;s Advanced force and Abe&#39;s Vanguard force warships together headed directly towards the last reported position of the U.S. carrier task forces and increased speed to try intercept them for a warship gunfire battle. <i>Zuih&#x14D;</i> and <i>Sh&#x14D;kaku</i>, with Nagumo still on board, retreated from the battle area,  leaving Rear Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Kakuji Kakuta in charge of the <i>Zuikaku</i> and <i>Juny&#x14D;</i> battle forces. At 13:06, <i>Juny&#x14D;</i> launched her second strike of seven Kates and eight Zeros, and <i>Zuikaku</i> launched her third strike of seven Kates, two Vals, and five Zeros. At 15:35, <i>Juny&#x14D;</i> launched the last Japanese strike force of the day, consisting of four Kates and six Zeros.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>After several technical problems, U.S. cruiser <i>Northampton</i> finally began slowly towing <i>Hornet</i> out of the battle area at 14:45. Also, <i>Hornet</i>&rsquo;s crew was on the verge of restoring partial power to the ship. However, at 15:20, <i>Juny&#x14D;</i>&rsquo;s second strike arrived and attacked the almost stationary carrier. At 15:23, one torpedo struck <i>Hornet</i>, destroying the repairs to the power system, causing heavy flooding, and a 14-degree list. With no power to pump-out the water, <i>Hornet</i> was given-up for lost and the crew abandoned ship. The third strike from <i>Zuikaku</i> attacked <i>Hornet</i> during this time, hitting the sinking ship with one more bomb. All of the <i>Hornet</i>&rsquo;s crewmen were off by 16:27. The last Japanese strike of the day dropped one more bomb on the sinking hulk at 17:20.<p>U.S destroyers <!--del_lnk--> <i>Mustin</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Anderson</i> were ordered to scuttle <i>Hornet</i> with gunfire and torpedoes while the rest of the U.S. warships retired towards the southeast to get out of range of Kondo&#39;s and Abe&#39;s oncoming warships. With advancing Japanese destroyers only 20&nbsp;minutes away, the two U.S. destroyers abandoned <i>Hornet</i>&rsquo;s burning hulk at 20:40. The rest of the warships of Kondo&#39;s and Abe&#39;s forces arrived at <i>Hornet</i>&rsquo;s location by 22:20 and decided that she was too damaged to try to capture. Thus, they finished the job of scuttling her with torpedoes by 01:35 on October 27. Several night attacks by radar-equipped Catalinas on <i>Juny&#x14D;</i> and <i>Teruzuki</i>, knowledge of the head-start the U.S. warships had in their retreat from the area, plus a critical fuel situation apparently caused the Japanese to reconsider further pursuit of the U.S. warships. After refueling near the northern Solomon Islands, the ships returned to their main base at Truk on October 30. During the U.S. retreat from the battle area towards Espiritu Santo and New Caledonia, <i>South Dakota</i> collided with U.S. destroyer <!--del_lnk--> <i>Mahan</i>, heavily damaging the destroyer.<p><a id="Aftermath" name="Aftermath"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Aftermath</span></h2>

      <p>The loss of <i>Hornet</i> was a severe blow for Allied forces in the South Pacific, leaving just one operational, albeit damaged, Allied carrier in the entire Pacific theatre. <i>Enterprise</i>, however, received temporary repairs at New Caledonia and, although still somewhat damaged, returned to the southern Solomons area just two weeks later to support Allied forces during the <a href="../../wp/n/Naval_Battle_of_Guadalcanal.htm" title="Naval Battle of Guadalcanal">Naval Battle of Guadalcanal</a>, playing an important role in what turned out to be the decisive naval engagement in the overall battle for Guadalcanal.<p>Although a tactical victory for the Japanese in terms of ships sunk, it came at a high cost for Japanese naval forces. Both damaged carriers were forced to return to Japan for extensive repairs and refitting. After repair, <i>Zuih&#x14D;</i> returned to Truk in late January, 1943. <i>Sh&#x14D;kaku</i> was under repair until March, 1943 and didn&#39;t return to the front until July, 1943, when she was reunited with <i>Zuikaku</i> at Truk.<p>The most significant losses for the Japanese Navy, however, were in aircrew. The U.S. lost 24 aircrew members in the battle. The Japanese, on the other hand, lost 148 aircrew members including two dive bomber group leaders, three torpedo squadron leaders, and 18 other section or flight leaders. The Japanese lost so many aircrew members that undamaged <i>Zuikaku</i> and <i>Hiy&#x14D;</i> were also forced to return to Japan due to a scarcity of trained aircrew to man their air groups.

      <p>With its carrier aircrew ranks decimated, and with no quick way to replace them, Japan lost its strategic opportunity to defeat Allied naval forces in a single, decisive battle before the industrial might of the U.S. placed that goal out of reach. Although they returned to Truk by summer, 1943, the Japanese carriers played no further offensive role in the decisive Solomon Islands campaign. <!--del_lnk--> Historian <!--del_lnk--> Eric Hammel sums up the significance of the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands this way:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">
