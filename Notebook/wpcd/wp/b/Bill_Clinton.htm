      <p><b>William Jefferson Blythe III</b> was born in <!--del_lnk--> Hope, Arkansas, and raised in <!--del_lnk--> Hot Springs, Arkansas. He was named after his father, <!--del_lnk--> William Jefferson Blythe, Jr., a traveling salesman who died in a car accident three months before he was born. His mother, born <!--del_lnk--> Virginia Dell Cassidy (1923&ndash;1994), remarried in 1950 to <!--del_lnk--> Roger Clinton. Roger Clinton owned an automobile dealership business with his brother, Raymond. The young Billy, as he was called, was raised by his mother and stepfather, assuming his last name &quot;Clinton&quot; throughout elementary school but not formally changing it until he was 14. Clinton grew up in a traditional, albeit blended, family; however, according to Clinton, his stepfather was a gambler and an <!--del_lnk--> alcoholic who regularly abused Clinton&#39;s mother and sometimes Clinton&#39;s half-brother <!--del_lnk--> Roger, Jr.<p>Bill Clinton as a child went to St. John&#39;s Catholic School and Ramble Elementary School. While at <!--del_lnk--> Hot Springs High School, Clinton was an excellent student and a talented <!--del_lnk--> saxophonist. He considered dedicating his life to music, but a visit to the <!--del_lnk--> White House to meet then-President <a href="../../wp/j/John_F._Kennedy.htm" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> following his election as a <!--del_lnk--> Boys Nation Senator led him to pursue a career in politics. Clinton was a member of Youth Order of <!--del_lnk--> DeMolay but never actually became a <!--del_lnk--> Freemason. <!--del_lnk--> <p>Clinton received a <!--del_lnk--> Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service (B.S.F.S.) degree from the <!--del_lnk--> Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at <!--del_lnk--> Georgetown University in <!--del_lnk--> Washington D.C., where he became a brother of <!--del_lnk--> Alpha Phi Omega, worked for Senator <!--del_lnk--> J. William Fulbright, was elected to <!--del_lnk--> Phi Beta Kappa and won a <!--del_lnk--> Rhodes Scholarship to <!--del_lnk--> University College, Oxford. While at Oxford, he played <!--del_lnk--> rugby union as a <!--del_lnk--> lock, and later in life he played for the Little Rock Rugby club in Arkansas. There he also participated in the <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_War.htm" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a> <!--del_lnk--> protest movement. After Oxford, Clinton obtained a <!--del_lnk--> Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from <!--del_lnk--> Yale Law School in 1973. While at Yale, he began dating classmate <!--del_lnk--> Hillary Rodham. They married in 1975 and their only child, <!--del_lnk--> Chelsea, was born in 1980. Clinton is a member of <!--del_lnk--> Kappa Kappa Psi National Honorary Band Fraternity, Inc.<p><a id="Arkansas_political_career" name="Arkansas_political_career"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Arkansas political career</span></h2>

      <p>In 1974, his first year as a <!--del_lnk--> University of Arkansas law professor, Clinton ran for the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_House_of_Representatives.htm" title="United States House of Representatives">House of Representatives</a>. The incumbent, <!--del_lnk--> John Paul Hammerschmidt, defeated Clinton with 52% of the vote. In 1976, Clinton was elected <!--del_lnk--> Attorney General of <!--del_lnk--> Arkansas without opposition in the general election.<p>In 1978, Bill Clinton was first elected <!--del_lnk--> Governor of Arkansas, the youngest to be elected governor since 1938. His first term was fraught with difficulties, including an unpopular motor vehicle tax and popular anger over the escape of <a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuba">Cuban</a> prisoners (from the <!--del_lnk--> Mariel boatlift) detained in <!--del_lnk--> Fort Chaffee in 1980.<p>In the 1980 election, Clinton was defeated in his bid for a second term by <!--del_lnk--> Republican challenger <!--del_lnk--> Frank D. White. As he once joked, he was the youngest ex-governor in the nation&#39;s history. But in 1982, Clinton won his old job back, and over the next decade he helped Arkansas transform its economy. He became a leading figure among the New Democrats, a branch of the Democratic Party that called for welfare reform and smaller government, a policy supported by both Democrats and Republicans alike.<p>Clinton&#39;s approach mollified conservative criticism during his terms as governor. However, personal and business transactions made by the Clintons during this period became the basis of the <!--del_lnk--> Whitewater investigation, which dogged his later presidential Administration. After very extensive investigation over several years, no indictments were made against the Clintons related to the years in Arkansas.<p><a id="Campaign_for_the_Democratic_Nomination" name="Campaign_for_the_Democratic_Nomination"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Campaign for the Democratic Nomination</span></h3>
      <p>There was some media speculation in 1987 that Clinton would enter the race for <!--del_lnk--> 1988 Democratic presidential nomination after <!--del_lnk--> then-New York Governor <!--del_lnk--> Mario Cuomo declined to run and Democratic frontrunner <!--del_lnk--> Gary Hart bowed out due to revelations about marital infidelity. Often referred to as the &quot;Boy Governor&quot; at the time because of his youthful appearance, Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas Governor and postpone his presidential ambitions until 1992. Presenting himself as a moderate and a member of the <!--del_lnk--> New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party, he headed the moderate <!--del_lnk--> Democratic Leadership Council in 1990 and 1991.<p>In 1992, Clinton was the early favorite of <!--del_lnk--> Democratic Party insiders and elected officials for the presidential nomination; therefore, he was able to rack up scores of <!--del_lnk--> superdelegates even before the first nominating contests were conducted. In spite of this, Clinton began his 1992 presidential quest on a sour note by finishing near the back of the pack in the <!--del_lnk--> Iowa caucus, which was largely uncontested due to the presence of favorite-son Senator <!--del_lnk--> Tom Harkin, who was the easy winner. Clinton&rsquo;s real trouble, however, began during <!--del_lnk--> New Hampshire Primary campaign, when revelations of a possible extramarital affair with <!--del_lnk--> Gennifer Flowers began to surface. Clinton and his wife Hillary decided to go on <!--del_lnk--> 60 Minutes following the <!--del_lnk--> Super Bowl to rebut those charges of infidelity, which had started to take their toll, as Clinton had fallen way behind former <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts Senator <!--del_lnk--> Paul Tsongas in the New Hampshire polls. In fact, his campaign was beginning to unravel. Their TV appearance was a calculated risk, but it seemed to pay off as Clinton regained some of his lost footing. He still finished second to Tsongas in the New Hampshire Primary, but the media viewed it as a moral victory for Clinton, since he came within single digits of winning after trailing badly in the polls. Clinton shrewdly labeled himself &ldquo;The Comeback Kid&rdquo; on election night to help foster this perception and came out of New Hampshire on a roll. Tsongas, on the other hand, picked up little or no momentum from his victory.<p>Clinton used his new-found momentum to storm through the Southern primaries, including the big prizes of <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Texas, and build up a sizable delegate lead over his opponents in the race for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. However, there were still some doubts as to whether he could secure the nomination, as former <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a> Governor <!--del_lnk--> Jerry Brown was scoring victories in other parts of the country and Clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside of his native South. With no major Southern state remaining on the primary calendar, Clinton set his sights on the delegate-rich New York Primary, which was to be his proving ground. Much to the surprise of some, Clinton scored a resounding victory in <!--del_lnk--> New York. It was a watershed moment for him, as he had finally broken through and shed his image as a regional candidate and as centrist Democrat whose standing with Northern liberals was questionable. Having been transformed into the consensus candidate, he took on an air of inevitability and was able to cruise to the nomination, topping it off with a victory on Brown&rsquo;s home turf in the California Primary.<p><a id="Presidential_election" name="Presidential_election"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Presidential election</span></h3>
      <p>Clinton won the <!--del_lnk--> 1992 Presidential election (43.0% of the vote) against Republican George H. W. Bush (37.4% of the vote) and billionaire populist <!--del_lnk--> H. Ross Perot, who ran as an independent (18.9% of the vote) on a platform focusing on domestic issues; a large part of his success was Bush&#39;s steep decline in public approval. Previously described as &quot;unbeatable&quot; because of his approval ratings in the 80% range during the <!--del_lnk--> Persian Gulf conflict, Bush saw his public approval rating drop to just over 40% by election time.<p>Additionally, Bush reneged on his promise (<!--del_lnk--> &quot;Read My Lips: No New Taxes!&quot;) not to raise taxes when he compromised with Democrats in an attempt to lower the Federal deficits. This hurt him among conservatives. Clinton capitalized on Bush&#39;s policy switch, repeatedly condemning the President for making a promise he failed to keep.<p>Finally, Bush&#39;s coalition was in disarray. Conservatives had been united by anti-<a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">communism</a>, but with the end of the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>, old rivalries re-emerged. The <!--del_lnk--> Republican Convention of 1992 was dominated by evangelical Christians, alarming some moderate voters who thought the Republican Party had been taken over by religious conservatives. All this worked in Clinton&#39;s favour. Clinton could point to his moderate, &#39;New Democrat&#39; record as governor of Arkansas. Liberal Democrats were impressed by Clinton&#39;s academic credentials, his 1960s-era protest record, and support for social causes such as a woman&#39;s right to choose. Many Democrats who had supported <a href="../../wp/r/Ronald_Reagan.htm" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> and Bush in previous elections switched their allegiance to the more moderate Clinton.<p>His election ended an era of Republican rule, including 12 consecutive years in the <!--del_lnk--> White House and 20 of the previous 24 years. That election also brought the Democrats full control of the political branches of the federal government, including both houses of Congress as well as the presidency, for the first time since 1980.<p><a id="Presidency.2C_1993-2001" name="Presidency.2C_1993-2001"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Presidency, 1993-2001</span></h2>

      <p>Clinton&#39;s presidency included the longest period of economic growth in America&#39;s history. Clinton made cutting the deficit a top priority of his presidency. He supported and signed the <!--del_lnk--> Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. The <!--del_lnk--> Clinton Administration had a domestic agenda that included successful passage of the <!--del_lnk--> Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and the <!--del_lnk--> North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Clinton was unsuccessful in his attempt at a universal health care reform program, known as the <!--del_lnk--> Clinton health care plan. The <!--del_lnk--> foreign policy of the Clinton administration dealt with conflicts in <a href="../../wp/b/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina.htm" title="Bosnia and Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, <a href="../../wp/h/Haiti.htm" title="Haiti">Haiti</a>, and most notably the <!--del_lnk--> Kosovo War.<p><a id="Investigation_and_impeachment" name="Investigation_and_impeachment"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Investigation and impeachment</span></h2>

      <p>In 1998, as a result of allegations that he had lied during grand jury testimony regarding his sexual relationship with <!--del_lnk--> Monica Lewinsky, a young female White House intern, Clinton was the second U.S. president to be <!--del_lnk--> impeached by the House of Representatives (the other being <a href="../../wp/a/Andrew_Johnson.htm" title="Andrew Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>). The House held no serious impeachment hearings before the 1998 mid-term elections: Republican candidates rarely mentioned the issue of impeachment, but Democrats generally came out strongly against impeachment. In spite of the allegations against the President, his party picked up seats in the Congress. The Republican leadership called a <!--del_lnk--> lame duck session in December 1998 to hold impeachment proceedings.<p>Although the <!--del_lnk--> House Judiciary Committee hearings were perfunctory and ended in a straight party line vote, the debate on the Floor of the House was lively. The two charges that were passed in the House (largely on the basis of Republican support but with a handful of Democratic votes as well) were for <!--del_lnk--> perjury and <!--del_lnk--> obstruction of justice. The perjury charge arose from Clinton&#39;s testimony about his relationship to <!--del_lnk--> Monica Lewinsky during a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by former Arkansas-state employee <!--del_lnk--> Paula Jones. The obstruction charge was based on his actions during the subsequent investigation of that testimony.<p><a id="Impeachment_trial_in_the_Senate" name="Impeachment_trial_in_the_Senate"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Impeachment trial in the Senate</span></h3>

      <p>The Senate refused to convene to hold an impeachment trial before the end of the old term, so the trial was held over until the next Congress. Clinton was represented by Washington powerhouse law firm <!--del_lnk--> Williams &amp; Connolly.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> February 12, the Senate concluded a 21-day trial with the vote on both counts falling short of the Constitutional requirement of a two-thirds majority to convict and remove an office holder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with all of the votes to convict being cast by Republicans. On the perjury charge 55 senators voted to acquit, including 10 Republicans, and 45 voted to convict; on the obstruction charge the Senate voted 50-50. Clinton, like the only other president to be impeached, <a href="../../wp/a/Andrew_Johnson.htm" title="Andrew Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>, served the remainder of his term.<p><a id="Other_controversies" name="Other_controversies"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Other controversies</span></h2>

Clinton issued 140 pardons on his last day in office (<!--del_lnk--> January 20, <!--del_lnk--> 2001). It is common practice for Presidents to grant a number of pardons shortly before leaving office, but Clinton&#39;s last day list was more numerous than those of many previous presidents. Most of the controversy surrounded <!--del_lnk--> Marc Rich and allegations that Hillary Clinton&#39;s brother, <!--del_lnk--> Hugh Rodham, accepted payments in return for influencing the president&#39;s decision-making regarding the pardons. <!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Willey_and_Broaddrick_allegations" name="Willey_and_Broaddrick_allegations"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Willey and Broaddrick allegations</span></h3>

      </div>
      <p>While Clinton&#39;s job approval rating varied over the course of his first term, ranging from a low of 36 percent in mid-1993 to a high of 64 percent in late-1993 and early-1994, his job approval rating consistently ranged from the high 50s to the high 60s in his second term. Clinton&#39;s approval rating reached its highest point at 73 percent approval in the aftermath of the impeachment proceedings in 1998 and 1999. A CNN/USA TODAY/Gallup poll conducted as he was leaving office, revealed deeply contradictory attitudes regarding Clinton. Although his approval rating at 68 percent was higher than that of any other departing president since polling began more than seventy years earlier, only 45 percent said they would miss him. While 55 percent thought he &quot;would have something worthwhile to contribute and should remain active in public life&quot;, and 47 percent rated him as either outstanding or above average as a president, 68 percent thought he would be remembered for his &quot;involvement in personal scandal&quot; rather than his accomplishments as president, and 58 percent answered &quot;No&quot; to the question &quot;Do you generally think Bill Clinton is honest and trustworthy?&quot; 47 percent of the respondents identified themselves as being Clinton supporters.<p>In May 2006 a CNN poll comparing Clinton&#39;s job performance with that of his successor, George W. Bush, found a majority of respondents said Clinton outperformed Bush on every single issue in question.<p><a id="Public_image" name="Public_image"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Public image</span></h2>

      <p>As the first <!--del_lnk--> Baby Boomer president, Clinton was the first president in a half century not shaped by World War II. With his sound-bite-ready dialogue and pioneering use of pop culture in his campaigning, such as playing his saxophone on <i><!--del_lnk--> The Arsenio Hall Show</i>, Clinton was sometimes described as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> MTV president&quot;. Until his inauguration as president, he had earned substantially less money than his wife, and had the smallest net worth of any president in modern history, according to <i><!--del_lnk--> My Life</i>, Clinton&#39;s autobiography. Clinton, a charismatic speaker, tended to draw huge crowds during public speeches throughout his terms in office. Clinton was also very popular among <!--del_lnk--> African-Americans and made improving race relations a major theme of his presidency.<p><!--del_lnk--> Nobel Prize-winning author <!--del_lnk--> Toni Morrison in 1998 called Clinton &quot;the first Black president,&quot; saying &quot;Clinton displays almost every trope of <!--del_lnk--> blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, <!--del_lnk--> McDonald&#39;s-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas,&quot; and, despite his career accomplishments, comparing Clinton&#39;s scrutinized sex life to the stereotyping and <!--del_lnk--> double standards that blacks typically endure.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Like other former American presidents, Clinton has engaged in a career as a <!--del_lnk--> public speaker on a variety of issues. In his speaking engagements around the world, he continues to comment on aspects of contemporary politics. One notable theme is his advocacy of multilateral solutions to problems facing the world. Clinton&#39;s close relationship with the <!--del_lnk--> African American community has been highlighted in his post-Presidential career with the opening of his personal office in the <!--del_lnk--> Harlem section of <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a>. He assisted his wife, <!--del_lnk--> Hillary Clinton, in her campaign for office as <!--del_lnk--> Senator from <!--del_lnk--> New York.<p>Clinton&#39;s autobiography, <i><!--del_lnk--> My Life</i>, was released in June 2004.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> July 26, <!--del_lnk--> 2004, Clinton spoke for the fifth consecutive time to the <!--del_lnk--> Democratic National Convention, using the opportunity to praise candidate <!--del_lnk--> John Kerry. Many Democrats believed that Clinton&#39;s speech was one of the best in Convention history. In it, he criticized President George W. Bush&#39;s depiction of Kerry, saying that &quot;strength and wisdom are not opposing values.&quot;<p>He dedicated his <!--del_lnk--> presidential library, which is the largest in the nation, the <!--del_lnk--> William J. Clinton Presidential Centre, in <!--del_lnk--> Little Rock, Arkansas on <!--del_lnk--> November 18, <!--del_lnk--> 2004. Under rainy skies, Clinton received words of praise from former presidents <a href="../../wp/j/Jimmy_Carter.htm" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/George_H._W._Bush.htm" title="George H.

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> September 9, <!--del_lnk--> 2004, Clinton had an episode of <!--del_lnk--> angina and was evaluated at <!--del_lnk--> Northern Westchester Hospital. It was determined that he had not suffered a <!--del_lnk--> coronary infarction, and he was sent home, returning the following day for <!--del_lnk--> angiography, which disclosed multiple vessel <!--del_lnk--> coronary artery disease. He was transferred to <!--del_lnk--> Columbia Presbyterian Medical Centre in New York City, where he underwent a successful quadruple <!--del_lnk--> coronary artery bypass surgery on <!--del_lnk--> September 6, <!--del_lnk--> 2004. The medical team claimed that, had he not had surgery, he would likely have suffered a massive <a href="../../wp/m/Myocardial_infarction.htm" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a> within a few months. On <!--del_lnk--> March 10, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, he underwent a follow-up surgery to remove scar tissue and fluid from his left chest cavity, a result of his open-heart surgery.<div class="thumb tright">
