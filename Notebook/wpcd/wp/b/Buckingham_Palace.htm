      <p><b>Buckingham Palace</b> is the official <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> residence of the <!--del_lnk--> British monarch. The Palace is a setting for state occasions and royal entertaining, a base for many officially visiting <!--del_lnk--> Heads of State, and a major tourist attraction. It has been a rallying point for British people at times of national rejoicing, crisis or grief. &quot;Buckingham Palace&quot; or simply &quot;The Palace&quot; commonly refers to the source of Press statements issued by the offices of the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Household.<p>In the Middle Ages, Buckingham Palace&#39;s site formed part of the Manor of Ebury. It had several royal owners from <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_the_Confessor.htm" title="Edward the Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a> onwards and was also the object of much property speculation. (A loophole in the lease of <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_I_of_England.htm" title="Charles I of England">Charles I</a> allowed the area to revert back to royal hands in the 18th century.) Precursors of Buckingham Palace were Blake House, Goring House, and Arlington House.<p>Originally known as Buckingham House, the building forming the core of today&#39;s palace was a large <!--del_lnk--> townhouse built for the <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Buckingham in 1703 and acquired by <a href="../../wp/g/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="George III of the United Kingdom">King George III</a> in 1762 as a private <!--del_lnk--> residence. It was enlarged over the next 75 years, principally by <!--del_lnk--> architects <!--del_lnk--> John Nash and <!--del_lnk--> Edward Blore, forming three wings around a central courtyard. Buckingham Palace finally became the official royal palace of the British monarch on the accession of <a href="../../wp/v/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a> in 1837. The last major structural additions were made in the late 19th and early 20th century, when the large east wing facing <!--del_lnk--> The Mall was added, and the former State entrance, <!--del_lnk--> Marble Arch, was removed to its present position near <!--del_lnk--> Speakers&#39; Corner in <a href="../../wp/h/Hyde_Park%252C_London.htm" title="Hyde Park, London">Hyde Park</a>. The east front was refaced in <!--del_lnk--> Portland stone in 1913 as a backdrop to the <!--del_lnk--> Victoria Memorial, creating the present-day public face of Buckingham Palace, including the famous balcony.<p>The original early 19th-century interior designs, many of which still survive, included widespread use of brightly coloured <!--del_lnk--> scagliola and blue and pink <!--del_lnk--> lapis, on the advice of Sir <!--del_lnk--> Charles Long. <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Edward VII of the United Kingdom">King Edward VII</a> oversaw a partial redecoration in a <!--del_lnk--> Belle epoque cream and gold colour scheme. Many smaller reception rooms are furnished in the <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">Chinese</a> <!--del_lnk--> regency style with furniture and fittings brought from the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Pavilion at <a href="../../wp/b/Brighton.htm" title="Brighton">Brighton</a> and from <!--del_lnk--> Carlton House following the death of <a href="../../wp/g/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="George IV of the United Kingdom">King George IV</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Buckingham Palace Gardens are the largest private gardens in London, originally landscaped by <!--del_lnk--> Capability Brown, but redesigned by <!--del_lnk--> William Townsend Aiton of <!--del_lnk--> Kew Gardens and John Nash. The artificial lake was completed in 1828 and is supplied with water from the <!--del_lnk--> Serpentine, a lake in <a href="../../wp/h/Hyde_Park%252C_London.htm" title="Hyde Park, London">Hyde Park</a>.<p>The State Rooms form the nucleus of the working Palace and are used regularly by The Queen and members of the royal family for official and state entertaining. Buckingham Palace is one of the world&#39;s most familiar buildings and more than 50,000 people visit the palace each year as guests to banquets, lunches, dinners, receptions and the royal garden parties.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>it to the monks of <a href="../../wp/w/Westminster_Abbey.htm" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>. <p>In 1531 <!--del_lnk--> King Henry VIII acquired from <!--del_lnk--> Eton College the Hospital of St James (later <!--del_lnk--> St James&#39;s Palace), and in 1536 he received the Manor of Ebury from Westminster Abbey. These transfers brought the site of Buckingham Palace back into royal hands for the first time since William the Conqueror had given it away almost 500 years earlier.<p>Various owners leased it from royal landlords and the <!--del_lnk--> freehold was the subject of frenzied speculation in the 17th century. By then, the old village Garden at S. James&#39;s&quot;, suggesting it may have been a place of debauchery.<p>Eventually, in the late 17th century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon Sir Hugh Audley by the great heiress Mary Davies.<p><a id="First_houses_on_the_site" name="First_houses_on_the_site"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">First houses on the site</span></h3>
      <p>Possibly the first house erected within the site was that of a Sir William Blake, around 1624. The next owner was <!--del_lnk--> Lord Goring, who from 1633 extended Blake&#39;s house and developed much of today&#39;s garden, then known as Goring Great Garden. He did not, however, manage to obtain freehold interest in the mulberry garden. Unbeknown to Goring, in 1640 the document &quot;failed to pass the great seal before <!--del_lnk--> King Charles I fled London, which it needed to do for legal execution&quot;. (It was this critical omission that helped the British royal family regain the freehold under <!--del_lnk--> King George III.)<p>The improvident Goring defaulted on his rents; <!--del_lnk--> Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington obtained and was occupying the mansion, now known as Goring House, when it burnt down in 1674. Arlington House rose on the site &mdash; the southern wing of today&#39;s palace &mdash; the next year, and its freehold was sold on in 1702.<p>The house which forms the architectural core of the present palace was built for the first <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Buckingham and Normanby in 1703 to the design of <!--del_lnk--> William Winde. The style chosen was of a large, three-floored central block with two smaller flanking service wings.<p>Buckingham House was eventually sold by Buckingham&#39;s descendant, Sir Charles Sheffield, in 1762 to King <!--del_lnk--> George III for <!--del_lnk--> &pound;21,000. (Like his grandfather, George II, George III refused to sell the mulberry garden interest, so that Sheffield had been unable to purchase the full freehold of the site.) The house was originally intended as a private retreat for the royal family, and in particular for <!--del_lnk--> Queen Charlotte, and was known as The Queen&#39;s House. <!--del_lnk--> St. James&#39;s Palace remained the official and ceremonial royal residence; indeed, the tradition continues to date of foreign <!--del_lnk--> ambassadors being formally accredited to &quot;the <!--del_lnk--> Court of St. James&#39;s&quot;, even though it is at Buckingham Palace that they present their credentials and staff to the Queen upon their appointment.<p><a id="House_to_palace" name="House_to_palace"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">House to palace</span></h3>

      </div>
      <p>Queen Charlotte died in 1818 and <a href="../../wp/g/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="George III of the United Kingdom">George III</a> in 1820. The <!--del_lnk--> spendthrift <a href="../../wp/g/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="George IV of the United Kingdom">King George IV</a> decided to enlarge Buckingham House to use in conjunction with St James&#39;s Palace as had his father, but by 1826 he had decided to convert the house to a fully equipped royal palace. He commissioned <!--del_lnk--> John Nash to realise his vision. The palace that arose formed three sides of an open <!--del_lnk--> cour d&#39;honneur, with the former Buckingham House as the <!--del_lnk--> corps de logis. The new work was faced in <!--del_lnk--> Bath stone, with exquisite detailing in the <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> <a href="../../wp/n/Neoclassicism.htm" title="Neoclassicism">neoclassical</a> style. This is the palace much as it is today, but without the great east front (facing <!--del_lnk--> The Mall) which now encloses the quadrangle. On the future site of the present east front, between the two projecting wings, was a colossal triumphal arch of <!--del_lnk--> Racaccione <!--del_lnk--> marble, modelled on the <!--del_lnk--> Arch of Constantine in <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a>. This arch, which had cost <a href="../../wp/p/Pound_sterling.htm" title="Pound sterling">&pound;</a>34,450 to build, served as the state entrance. George IV had intended it to be crowned by a <!--del_lnk--> bronze equestrian statue of himself, but he died before its completion, and when <a href="../../wp/p/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">Parliament</a> reluctantly paid the bill for it, they decided to put it in <a href="../../wp/h/Hyde_Park%252C_London.htm" title="Hyde Park, London">Hyde Park</a>, where it remains today. The interiors of the palace were to be of unparalleled splendour. George IV was advised on the interior design by Sir <!--del_lnk--> Charles Long, who advocated the widespread use of brightly coloured <!--del_lnk--> scagliola and blue and pink <!--del_lnk--> lapis, with sculptured plaster panels set in the ceilings. George IV died in 1830, and the colourful and heavily gilded present <!--del_lnk--> state and semi-state rooms were not completed until the reign of <a href="../../wp/w/William_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="William IV of the United Kingdom">King William IV</a>.<div class="thumb tleft">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>By the time of George IV&#39;s death, the escalating cost of the still unfinished palace was causing concern in both parliament and the press. William IV dismissed Nash as architect and employed <!--del_lnk--> Edward Blore, who suited admirably the more restrained tastes of the new king. A less idealistic but more businesslike architect than Nash, Blore retained Nash&#39;s contributions and completed the palace in a similar, if more solid and less picturesque, vein. The final cost to the nation of rebuilding Buckingham Palace was more than &pound;719,000.<p>Though William IV and <!--del_lnk--> Queen Adelaide held receptions and courts in the state rooms, they never lived in the palace, preferring to remain at <!--del_lnk--> Clarence House, the more modest London <!--del_lnk--> mansion they had commissioned to be built before their succession. Moreover, when the <a href="../../wp/p/Palace_of_Westminster.htm" title="Palace of Westminster">Houses of Parliament</a> burned down in 1834, the King offered the incomplete palace to the nation as a replacement seat of government. (The offer was declined and the old <a href="../../wp/p/Palace_of_Westminster.htm" title="Palace of Westminster">Palace of Westminster</a> rebuilt.)<p>Many of the smaller reception rooms were furnished during William IV&#39;s reign &mdash; as they remain today &mdash; in the Chinese Regency style, utilising many of the fireplaces, decorations, and furniture brought from George IV&#39;s palaces, the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Pavilion at <a href="../../wp/b/Brighton.htm" title="Brighton">Brighton</a> and from <!--del_lnk--> Carlton House, following his death.<p><a id="Garden_and_precincts" name="Garden_and_precincts"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Garden and precincts</span></h3>
      <p>At the backof the palace is the large park-like <!--del_lnk--> garden, the largest private garden in London. The landscape design was by <!--del_lnk--> Capability Brown but the garden was redesigned at the time of the palace rebuilding by <!--del_lnk--> William Townsend Aiton of <!--del_lnk--> Kew Gardens and John Nash. The great manmade lake was completed in 1828 and is supplied with water by the <!--del_lnk--> Serpentine Lake in <a href="../../wp/h/Hyde_Park%252C_London.htm" title="Hyde Park, London">Hyde Park</a>.<div class="thumb tleft">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Like the palace, the <!--del_lnk--> Buckingham Palace Gardens are rich in works of art. One of the most notable is the <!--del_lnk--> Waterloo Vase, the great urn commissioned by <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleon_I_of_France.htm" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> to commemorate his expected victories, which in 1815 was presented unfinished to <a href="../../wp/g/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="George IV of the United Kingdom">the Prince Regent</a> by <!--del_lnk--> Ferdinand, Grand Duke of Tuscany. The king had the vase completed by the sculptor <!--del_lnk--> Richard Westmacott, intending it to be the focal point of the new Waterloo chamber at Windsor Castle. But at 15ft high and weighing 15 tons, no floor could bear the weight, and it was presented to the <a href="../../wp/n/National_Gallery%252C_London.htm" title="National Gallery, London">National Gallery</a>. The gallery finally returned the <!--del_lnk--> white elephant to the sovereign in 1906. <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Edward VII of the United Kingdom">Edward VII</a> then solved the problem by placing the vase outside in the garden where it now remains. Also in the gardens is a small summerhouse attributed to <!--del_lnk--> William Kent, circa 1740.<p>In June 2002 the Queen invited the public into her garden for entertainment for the first time during her reign. As part of her <!--del_lnk--> Golden Jubilee Weekend thousands of Britons were invited to apply for tickets to <!--del_lnk--> Party at the Palace where the guitarist <!--del_lnk--> Brian May of the band <a href="../../wp/q/Queen_%2528band%2529.htm" title="Queen (band)">Queen</a> performed his <i><!--del_lnk--> God Save The Queen</i> guitar solo on top of Buckingham Palace. This concert was preceded the previous evening by a <!--del_lnk--> Prom at the Palace. During the Queen&#39;s 80th birthday celebrations in 2006 the garden was the scene of <!--del_lnk--> Children&#39;s Party at the Palace for an audience of 2,000 children.<p>The garden is the setting for the many garden parties held by the Queen each summer. However, guests, while numerous and from all stations in life, are usually those who hold a public position, or are in some way of national interest.<p>Next to the palace is the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Mews, also designed by Nash, where the royal carriages, including the <!--del_lnk--> Gold State Coach, are housed. This <a href="../../wp/r/Rococo.htm" title="Rococo">rococo</a> gilt coach, designed by Sir <!--del_lnk--> William Chambers in 1760, has painted panels by <!--del_lnk--> G. B. Cipriani. It was first used for the State Opening of Parliament by George III in 1762 and is used by the monarch only for <!--del_lnk--> coronations or jubilee celebrations. Also housed in the mews are the carriage horses used in the royal ceremonial processions which take place in London.<p><a id="Home_of_the_monarch" name="Home_of_the_monarch"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Home of the monarch</span></h2>

      <p>Buckingham Palace finally became the principal Royal residence in 1837 on the accession of <a href="../../wp/v/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a>. While the State Rooms were a riot of gilt and colour, the necessities of the new palace were somewhat less luxurious. It was reported the chimneys smoked so much that the fires had to be allowed to die, and consequently the court shivered in icy magnificence. Ventilation was so bad that the interior smelled, and when a decision was taken to install gas lamps there was a serious worry about the build up of gas on the lower floors. It was also said that the staff were lax and lazy and the palace was dirty. Following the Queen&#39;s marriage in 1840, her husband, <!--del_lnk--> Prince Albert, concerned himself with a reorganization of the household offices and staff, and with the design faults of the palace. The problems were rectified, the builders finally leaving the palace in 1840.<p>By 1847, the couple had found the palace too small for Court life and their growing family, and consequently the new wing, designed by <!--del_lnk--> Edward Blore, was built, enclosing the central quadrangle. This large east wing, facing <!--del_lnk--> The Mall is today the &#39;public face&#39; of Buckingham Palace and contains the balcony from which the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Family acknowledge the crowds on momentous occasions and annually following <!--del_lnk--> Trooping the Colour. The <!--del_lnk--> ballroom wing and a further suite of state rooms were also built in this period, designed by Nash&#39;s student Sir <!--del_lnk--> James Pennethorne.<p>Before Prince Albert&#39;s demise, Queen Victoria was known to love music and dancing, and the greatest contemporary musicians entertained at Buckingham Palace. <a href="../../wp/f/Felix_Mendelssohn.htm" title="Felix Mendelssohn">Felix Mendelssohn</a> is known to have played there on three occasions. <!--del_lnk--> Johann Strauss II and his <!--del_lnk--> orchestra played there when in England. Strauss&#39; &#39;Alice Polka&#39; was first performed at the palace in 1849 in honour of the Queen&#39;s daughter, <!--del_lnk--> Princess Alice. Under Victoria, Buckingham Palace was frequently the scene of lavish costume balls, in addition to the routine royal ceremonies, investitures and presentations.<p>When widowed in 1861, the griefstricken Queen withdrew from public life and left Buckingham Palace to live at <a href="../../wp/w/Windsor_Castle.htm" title="Windsor Castle">Windsor Castle</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Balmoral Castle, and <!--del_lnk--> Osborne House. For many years the palace was seldom used, and even neglected. Eventually public opinion forced her to return to London, though even then she preferred to live elsewhere whenever possible. Court functions were still held at Windsor Castle rather than at the palace, presided over by the sombre Queen habitually dressed in mourning black.<p><a id="Interior" name="Interior"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Interior</span></h3>

      <p>The principal rooms of the Palace are contained on the <i><!--del_lnk--> piano nobile</i> behind the west-facing garden facade at the rear of the Palace. The centre of this ornate suite of State Rooms is the Music Room, its large bow the dominant feature of the facade. Flanking the Music Room are the Blue and the White <!--del_lnk--> Drawing rooms. At the centre of the suite, serving as a corridor to link the state rooms, is the Picture Gallery, which is top lit and 55 yards (50 m) long. The Gallery is hung with works by <!--del_lnk--> Rembrandt, <a href="../../wp/a/Anthony_van_Dyck.htm" title="Anthony van Dyck">van Dyck</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Peter_Paul_Rubens.htm" title="Peter Paul Rubens">Rubens</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Vermeer, among many others. Other rooms leading from the Picture Gallery are the <!--del_lnk--> Throne Room and the Green Drawing Room. The Green Drawing room serves as a huge anteroom to the Throne Room, and is part of the ceremonial route to the Throne from the Guard Room at the top of the Grand Staircase. The Guard Room contains a white marble statue of Prince Albert, in Roman costume set in a <!--del_lnk--> tribune lined with tapestries. These very formal rooms are used only for ceremonial and official entertaining.<p>Directly underneath the State Apartments is a suite of slightly less grand rooms known as the semi-state apartments. Opening from the marble hall, these rooms are used for less-formal entertaining, such as luncheon parties and private audiences. Some of the rooms are named and decorated for particular visitors, such as the &#39;1844 Room&#39;, which was decorated in that year for the State visit of <!--del_lnk--> Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Nicholas I of <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>. At the centre of this suite is the Bow Room, through which thousands of guests pass annually to the Queen&#39;s Garden Parties in the Gardens beyond. The Queen uses privately a smaller suite of rooms in the North wing.<p>Between 1847 and 1850, when Blore was building the new east wing, the Brighton Pavilion was once again plundered of its fittings. As a result many of the rooms in the new wing have a distinctly oriental atmosphere. The red and blue Chinese Luncheon Room is made up from parts of the Brighton banqueting and music rooms, but has a chimney piece, also from Brighton, in design more Indian than Chinese. The Yellow Drawing Room has 18th century wall paper, which was supplied in 1817 for the Brighton Saloon, and the chimney piece in this room is a European vision of what the Chinese equivalent would look like, complete with nodding <!--del_lnk--> mandarins in <!--del_lnk--> niches and fearsome winged <!--del_lnk--> dragons.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>At the centre of this wing is the famous balcony, with behind its glass doors the Centre Room. This is a Chinese-style saloon enhanced by Queen Mary in the late 1920s, although the <!--del_lnk--> lacquer doors were brought from Brighton in 1873. Running the length of the <i>piano nobile</i> of the east wing is an immense gallery, modestly known as the Principal Corridor. It has mirrored doors, and mirrored cross walls reflecting <!--del_lnk--> porcelain pagodas and other oriental furniture from Brighton. The Chinese Luncheon Room and Yellow Drawing Room are situated at each end of this gallery, with the Centre Room obviously placed in the centre.<p>Visiting <!--del_lnk--> heads of state today, when staying at the palace, occupy a suite of rooms known as the <!--del_lnk--> Belgian suite, which is on the ground floor of the North-facing garden front. These rooms, with corridors enhanced by <!--del_lnk--> saucer domes, were first decorated for Prince Albert&#39;s uncle <!--del_lnk--> L&eacute;opold I, first King of the Belgians.

      <p>During the current reign court <!--del_lnk--> ceremony has undergone a radical change, and entry to the palace is no longer the prerogative of just the upper class.<p>There has been a progressive relaxation of the dress code governing formal <!--del_lnk--> court uniform and dress. In previous reigns, men not wearing military <!--del_lnk--> uniform wore knee <!--del_lnk--> breeches of an 18th-century design. Women&#39;s evening dress included obligatory trains and <!--del_lnk--> tiaras and/or feathers in their hair. After <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, when Queen Mary wished to follow <a href="../../wp/f/Fashion.htm" title="Fashion">fashion</a> by raising her skirts a few inches from the ground, she requested a Lady-in-Waiting to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the King&#39;s reaction. King George V was horrified and Queen Mary&#39;s hemline remained unfashionably low. Subsequently, <a href="../../wp/g/George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="George VI of the United Kingdom">King George VI</a> and Queen Elizabeth allowed daytime skirts to rise.<p>In 1924 <!--del_lnk--> Labour <a href="../../wp/p/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> <!--del_lnk--> Ramsay MacDonald was the first man to be received by a monarch inside the palace wearing a lounge suit; however, this was a one-off concession. Prescribed evening court dress remained obligatory until World War II.<p>Today there is no official dress code. Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear service uniform or morning coats, and in the evening, depending on the formality of the occasion, <!--del_lnk--> black tie or <!--del_lnk--> white tie. If the occasion is &#39;white tie&#39; then women, if they possess one, wear a tiara.<p>One of the first major changes was in 1958 when the Queen abolished the presentation parties for <!--del_lnk--> debutantes. These court presentations of <!--del_lnk--> aristocratic girls to the monarch took place in the <!--del_lnk--> Throne Room. Debutantes wore full court dress, with three tall ostrich feathers in their hair. They entered, curtsied, performed a choreographed backwards walk and a further curtsey, while manoeuvring a dress train of prescribed length. The ceremony corresponded to the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> court drawing rooms&quot; of earlier reigns, and Queen Elizabeth II replaced the presentations with large and frequent palace garden parties for an invited cross-section of British society. The late <!--del_lnk--> Princess Margaret is reputed to have remarked of the debutante presentations: &quot;We had to put a stop to it, every tart in London was getting in&quot; . Today, the Throne Room is used for the reception of formal addresses such as those given to the Queen on her Jubilees. It is here on the throne <!--del_lnk--> dais that royal wedding portraits and family photographs are taken.<p><!--del_lnk--> Investitures, which include the conferring of <!--del_lnk--> knighthoods by dubbing with a sword, and other awards take place in the palace&#39;s Victorian Ballroom, built in 1854. At 123 <!--del_lnk--> ft by 60 ft (37 m by 20 m), this is the largest room in the palace. It has replaced the <!--del_lnk--> Throne Room in importance and use. During investitures the Queen stands on the throne dais beneath a giant, domed velvet canopy, known as a shamiana or a <!--del_lnk--> baldachin, used at the coronation <!--del_lnk--> Durbar in <a href="../../wp/d/Delhi.htm" title="Delhi">Delhi</a> in 1911. A military band plays in the musicians&#39; gallery, as the recipients of awards approach the Queen and receive their <!--del_lnk--> honours, watched by their families and friends. <a href="../../wp/t/The_Beatles.htm" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> were among the first non-establishment artists to be awarded honours at the palace.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>State <!--del_lnk--> banquets also take place in the Ballroom. These formal dinners take place on the first evening of a state visit by a visiting Head of State. On these occasions, often over 150 guests in formal &quot;white tie and decorations&quot; including tiaras for women, dine off gold plate. The largest and most formal reception at Buckingham Palace takes place every November, when the Queen entertains members of the foreign diplomatic corps resident in London. On this occasion all the state rooms are in use, as the entire Royal Family proceed through them, beginning their procession through the great north doors of the Picture Gallery. As Nash had envisaged, all the large, double-mirrored doors stand open, reflecting the numerous crystal chandeliers and sconces, causing a deliberate optical illusion of space and light.<p>Smaller ceremonies such as the reception of new ambassadors take place in the &#39;1844 Room&#39;. Here too the Queen holds small lunch parties, and often meetings of the <a href="../../wp/p/Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Privy Council of the United Kingdom">Privy Council</a>. Larger lunch parties often take place in the curved and domed Music Room, or the State Dining Room. On all formal occasions the ceremonies are attended by the <!--del_lnk--> Yeomen of the Guard in their anachronistic uniforms, and other officers of the court such as the <!--del_lnk--> Lord Chamberlain.<p>Since the bombing of the palace chapel in World War II, royal christenings have sometimes taken place in the Music Room. The Queen&#39;s first three children were all baptised here, in a special gold font. <!--del_lnk--> Prince William was christened in the Music Room; however, his brother, Prince Harry, was christened at <!--del_lnk--> St George&#39;s Chapel, Windsor.<p>The largest functions of the year are the garden parties for up to 8,000 invitees, taking tea and sandwiches outdoors in a series of marquees. The guests first assemble, then as a military band plays the <!--del_lnk--> National Anthem, the Queen emerges from the Bow Room, and slowly walks through the guests, greeting those previously selected for the honour, to her own more private tea tent. If the guests at these functions do not actually have the opportunity to meet the Queen, they at least have the consolation of being able to admire the gardens.<p><a id="Modern_history" name="Modern_history"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Modern history</span></h2>

      <p>In 1901 the accession of <!--del_lnk--> Edward VII saw new life breathed into the palace. The new King and his wife <!--del_lnk--> Queen Alexandra had always been at the forefront of London high society, and their friends, known as &quot;the <!--del_lnk--> Marlborough House Set&quot;, were considered to be the most eminent and fashionable of the age. Buckingham Palace&mdash;the Ballroom, Grand Entrance, Marble Hall, Grand Staircase, vestibules and galleries redecorated in the <!--del_lnk--> Belle epoque cream and gold colour scheme they retain today&mdash;once again became the focal point of the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> and a setting for entertaining on a majestic scale. Many people feel King Edward&#39;s heavy redecoration of the palace does not complement Nash&#39;s original work. However, it has been allowed to remain for one hundred years.<p>The last major building work took place during the reign of <a href="../../wp/g/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="George V of the United Kingdom">King George V</a> when, in 1913, <!--del_lnk--> Sir Aston Webb redesigned Blore&#39;s 1850 East Front to resemble in part <!--del_lnk--> Giacomo Leoni&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Lyme Park in <!--del_lnk--> Cheshire. This new, refaced principal facade (of <!--del_lnk--> Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the <!--del_lnk--> Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. George V&#39;s wife <!--del_lnk--> Queen Mary was a <!--del_lnk--> connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble <!--del_lnk--> Empire-style chimneypieces by <!--del_lnk--> Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden facade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room. This room, 69 <!--del_lnk--> feet (21 <!--del_lnk--> m) long, previously known as the South Drawing Room, has one of Nash&#39;s finest ceilings, coffered with huge gilt <!--del_lnk--> console brackets, and is referred to by the author and historian <!--del_lnk--> Olwen Hedley in her book <i>Buckingham Palace</i> as the most beautiful in the palace, grander and more lavish than either the <!--del_lnk--> Throne Room or the Ballroom, which was built to take over the Blue Drawing Room&#39;s original function.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The last major extension to the palace was in 1850. In 1999 it was stated  that the palace contained 19 state rooms, 52 principal bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices, and 78 bathrooms. While this may seem large, it is small compared with the <!--del_lnk--> Tsar&#39;s palaces in <a href="../../wp/s/Saint_Petersburg.htm" title="Saint Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a> and at <!--del_lnk--> Tsarskoe Selo, the <!--del_lnk--> Papal Palace in <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Palace of Madrid, or indeed the former <!--del_lnk--> Palace of Whitehall, and tiny compared to the <!--del_lnk--> Forbidden City and <!--del_lnk--> Potala Palace. The relative smallness of the palace may be best appreciated from within, looking out over the inner quadrangle. A minor extension was made in 1938, in which the north-west pavilion, designed by Nash, was converted into a swimming pool.<p>During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> the Palace, then the home of King George V and Queen Mary, escaped unscathed. Its more valuable contents were evacuated to Windsor but the Royal family remained <i>in situ</i>. The largest change to court life at this time was that the Government persuaded the King to ostentatiously and publicly lock the wine cellars and refrain from alcohol for the duration of the war, to set a good example to the supposedly inebriated lower classes. The lower classes continued to imbibe and the King was left reputedly furious at his enforced abstinence. Edward VIII later told a biographer that his father had a furtive glass of port each evening, while the Queen secretly laced her fruit cup with <!--del_lnk--> champagne. The King&#39;s children were photographed at this time serving tea to wounded officers in the adjacent Royal Mews.<p>During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> the Palace fared worse: it was bombed no less than seven times, and was a deliberate target, as it was thought by the <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">Nazis</a> that the destruction of Buckingham Palace would demoralise the nation. One bomb fell in the palace quadrangle while King George VI and Queen Elizabeth were in residence, but while many windows were blown in, no serious damage was reported. However, war time coverage of such incidents was severely restricted. The most serious and publicised bombing was the destruction of the Palace chapel in 1940: coverage of this event was played in cinemas all over England to show the common suffering of rich and poor. The King and Queen were filmed inspecting their bombed home, the smiling Queen immaculate in a hat and matching coat. It was at this time the Queen famously declared: &quot;I&#39;m glad we have been bombed. Now I can look the East End in the face&quot;. The Royal family were seen as sharing their subjects&#39; hardship, as <!--del_lnk--> The Sunday Graphic reported:-<dl>

        <dl>
         <dd><i>By the Editor: The King and Queen have endured the ordeal which has come to their subjects.

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> September 15, 1940 an RAF pilot, <!--del_lnk--> Ray Holmes, rammed a German plane attempting to bomb the palace. Holmes had run out of ammunition and made the quick choice to ram it. Both planes crashed and their pilots survived. This incident was captured on film. The plane&#39;s engine was later exhibited at the Imperial War Museum in London. Following the war the British pilot became a <!--del_lnk--> King&#39;s Messenger. He died at the age of 90 in 2005.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> VE Day (<!--del_lnk--> May 8, <!--del_lnk--> 1945), the Palace was the centre of British celebrations, with the King, Queen and the Princess Elizabeth, the future Queen, and <!--del_lnk--> Princess Margaret appearing on the balcony, with the palace&#39;s blacked-out windows behind them, to the cheers from a vast crowd in <!--del_lnk--> the Mall.<p><a id="Security" name="Security"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Security</span></h4>
      <p>Today though Royal security is high, it is better known for a series of high-profile intrusions, both at the Palace and elsewhere. The famous armed <!--del_lnk--> sentries on <!--del_lnk--> guard at the front of the palace are commonly thought to be ceremonial, but they have always had a security role. The palace also contains its own <!--del_lnk--> police station, and the Royal Family have their own protection officers at all times. The <!--del_lnk--> Foot Guards <!--del_lnk--> battalion at <!--del_lnk--> Wellington Barracks is only 300 yards (275 m) away.

      <p>A notorious incident occurred in 1982, when <!--del_lnk--> Michael Fagan gained access to the Queen&#39;s bedroom while she was asleep. In 2003 a reporter for the <i><!--del_lnk--> Daily Mirror</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Ryan Parry, spent two months working as a <!--del_lnk--> footman inside Buckingham Palace. One of the references he supplied was fake, and it appears this was not checked properly. The incident coincided with a visit to the UK by <a href="../../wp/g/George_W._Bush.htm" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>, who stayed at the Palace, and the <i>Mirror</i> published clandestine photographs of Bush&#39;s bedroom, along with the Queen&#39;s breakfast table and the <!--del_lnk--> Duke of York&#39;s room.  The Palace took the <i>Mirror</i> to court for invasion of privacy, and the newspaper handed over its materials, and paid some of the Queen&#39;s costs in an <!--del_lnk--> out-of-court settlement in November 2003.<p>Most lapses of security have been outside the palace: In 1974, <!--del_lnk--> Ian Ball attempted to kidnap <!--del_lnk--> the Princess Royal at gunpoint in <!--del_lnk--> the Mall while she was returning to the palace, wounding several people in the process. In 1981, three <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">German</a> tourists camped in the <!--del_lnk--> gardens of the palace, after climbing over the heavily barbwired wall, purportedly believing the area to be <a href="../../wp/h/Hyde_Park%252C_London.htm" title="Hyde Park, London">Hyde Park</a>. In 1993, anti-nuclear protestors also scaled the palace walls and held a sit down protest on the palace lawn. Most notably, in 1994, a naked <!--del_lnk--> paraglider landed on the roof of the building. In 1995 a student, <!--del_lnk--> John Gillard, was able to deliberately ram the gates of the palace, knocking one of the great <!--del_lnk--> wrought iron gates weighing 3,300 pounds (1.5 tonnes) off its hinges. In 1997, an absconded mentally ill patient was found wandering the palace grounds, which ordered another security review.<p>Most recently, in <!--del_lnk--> 2004, <!--del_lnk--> a protester advocating the legal rights of <!--del_lnk--> single fathers, received wide press coverage when he climbed onto a ledge near the ceremonial balcony on the east front dressed as <a href="../../wp/b/Batman.htm" title="Batman">Batman</a>. In the same incident, a second protester, dressed as <!--del_lnk--> Robin, was apprehended before he managed to climb onto the building; <!--del_lnk--> he returned the following November dressed as <!--del_lnk--> Father Christmas to chain himself to a lamp on one of the main gateposts.<p>Historically, there have been many other lapses. Probably the most incredible was in 1837, when a 12-year-old boy known to history as <!--del_lnk--> The boy Cotton managed to live for a year undetected inside the palace. Hiding in chimneys and blackening the beds he slept in, he was finally apprehended in December 1838, causing questions on royal security to be asked in Parliament.  Of the eight <!--del_lnk--> assassination attempts made on Queen Victoria, at least three occurred in the vicinity of the palace gates. In the early 20th century the front of the palace became a favoured venue for <!--del_lnk--> suffragettes, who would chain themselves to the gilded iron railings. Over the years numerous intruders have been apprehended in the palace grounds, including one who wished to propose marriage to Princess Anne, and who was declared insane.<p><a id="The_Palace_in_the_21st_century" name="The_Palace_in_the_21st_century"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The Palace in the 21st century</span></h4>

      <p>Today, Buckingham Palace is not only the home of the Queen and Prince Philip but also the London residence of the <!--del_lnk--> Duke of York and the <!--del_lnk--> Earl and Countess of Wessex. The palace also houses the office of the monarchy and its associated functions.<p>In addition to being the weekday home of the Queen and the <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Edinburgh, the palace is the workplace of 450 people. Every year some 50,000 people are entertained at garden parties, receptions, audiences, and banquets. The forecourt of Buckingham Palace is used for <!--del_lnk--> Changing of the Guard, a major ceremony and tourist attraction (daily during the summer months; every other day during the winter).<p>The palace is not the private property of the Queen; Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace and their art collections belong to the nation. The priceless furnishings, paintings, fittings and other artefacts, many by <!--del_lnk--> Faberg&eacute;, from Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle are known collectively as the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Collection; owned by the nation, they can be viewed by the public when the palace and castle are open to the public at various times of the year. The <!--del_lnk--> Queen&#39;s Gallery near the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Mews is open all year and displays a changing selection of items from the collection. The rooms containing the Queen&#39;s Gallery are on the site of the former chapel, which was damaged by one of the seven bombs to fall on the Palace during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p><!--del_lnk--> The Mall, the ceremonial approach road to the palace, extends from <!--del_lnk--> Admiralty Arch, up the Mall, around the <!--del_lnk--> Victoria Memorial to the Palace <!--del_lnk--> forecourt. The tarmac&#39;s reddish colour recalls the red carpets of former times. Devised as a memorial to Queen Victoria, this route is used by the cavalcades and motorcades of all visiting heads of state, and by the Royal Family on state occasions such as the annual <!--del_lnk--> State Opening of Parliament. The processions pass through Admiralty Arch and into the Mall, which is always closed for the occasion.<p>The Summer Opening of the Palace <!--del_lnk--> State Rooms to the public was a huge change to tradition in the 1990s. The money raised in entry fees was originally put towards the rebuilding of <a href="../../wp/w/Windsor_Castle.htm" title="Windsor Castle">Windsor Castle</a> following the fire that destroyed many of its State Rooms. Each Summer, during August and September, the West Wing of the Palace is opened to the public. A staff of about 200, mainly students, is employed to run the Opening in such areas as &#39;Queue&#39;, &#39;Visitor Entrance&#39;, &#39;Security&#39;, &#39;Baggage&#39;, &#39;State Rooms&#39;, &#39;Access&#39; and &#39;Garden&#39;. The visitor route for 2006 onwards is currently being updated for reasons of presentation and security.<p><a id="Big_Royal_Dig_graphic_reconstructions_of_Buckingham_Palace_history" name="Big_Royal_Dig_graphic_reconstructions_of_Buckingham_Palace_history"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Big Royal Dig graphic reconstructions of Buckingham Palace history</span></h2>
      <p>As part of the Queen&#39;s 80th birthday celebrations, the Big Royal Dig carried out by the <!--del_lnk--> Time Team of archaeologists (see <!--del_lnk--> Buckingham Palace Gardens for full findings) from 25th-28th August 2006 produced some spectacular graphic reconstructions of Buckingham Palace history.<p><!--del_lnk--> Graphic Reconstruction 1 shows the familiar East Front of Buckingham Palace removed (in the background of the picture). The processional arch designed by architect <!--del_lnk--> John Nash, which was resited at <!--del_lnk--> Marble Arch in London, has been digitally replaced in its <!--del_lnk--> original site. (There is no truth in the frequently heard claim that it was removed as being too small for Queen Victoria&#39;s carriage: the Gold State Coach can pass through the arch, as was seen in the coronation procession of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.)<p><!--del_lnk--> Graphic Reconstruction 2 combines architect John Nash&#39;s Palace building with the original Buckingham House wing. (The more familiar East Front of the Palace is out of frame on the right of shot.)<p>Unfortunately, the Big Royal Dig did not succeed in unearthing traces of three prior residences erected on the Palace site, namely Buckingham House (1703), Arlington House (1674) and Goring House (1633).<div class="thumb tright">
