      <p>This shark is called the <i>basking</i> shark because it is most often observed when feeding at the surface and looks like it is <!--del_lnk--> basking. It is also called bone shark, elephant shark, hoe mother, sun-fish and sailfish. It is the only member of the family Cetorhinidae. It was first described and named <i>Cetorhinus maximus</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Gunnerus in 1765 from a specimen found in <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a>. The genus name <i>Cetorhinus</i> comes from the greek, <i>ketos</i> which means marine monster or whale and <i>rhinos</i> meaning nose, the species name <i>maximus</i> is from Latin and means &quot;great&quot;. It was later described as <i>Squalus isodus</i> by Macri in 1819, <i>Squalus elephas</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Lesueur in 1822 <i>Squalus rashleighanus</i> by Couch in 1838, <i>Squalus cetaceus</i> by Gronow in 1854, <i>Cetorhinus blainvillei</i> by Capello in 1869, <i>Selachus pennantii</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Cornish in 1885, <i>Cetorhinus maximus infanuncula</i> by Deinse &amp; Adriani 1953 and finally as <i>Cetorhinus maximus normani</i> by Siccardi 1961. <p><a id="Distribution_and_habitat" name="Distribution_and_habitat"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
      <p>The basking shark is a coastal-pelagic shark found worldwide in boreal to warm-temperate waters around the continental shelves. It prefers waters between 8 and 14&deg;&nbsp;C (46 and 57&deg;&nbsp;F). It is often seen close to land and will enter enclosed bays. The shark will follow concentrations of <!--del_lnk--> plankton in the water column and is therefore often visible on the surface. They are a highly migratory species leading to seasonal appearances in certain areas of the range.<p><a id="Anatomy_and_appearance" name="Anatomy_and_appearance"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Anatomy and appearance</span></h2>

      <p>The basking shark is one of the largest known sharks, second only to the <a href="../../wp/w/Whale_shark.htm" title="Whale shark">whale shark</a>. The largest specimen accurately measured was trapped in a herring net in the <!--del_lnk--> Bay of Fundy, <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a> in 1851. Its total length was 12.27&nbsp;metres (40&nbsp;ft 3&nbsp;in), and weighed an estimated 16&nbsp;tons. There are reports from <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a> of three basking sharks over 12&nbsp;m (the largest being 13.7&nbsp;m), but those are considered dubious since few if any sharks anywhere near such size have been caught in the area since. Normally the basking shark reaches a length of between 6&nbsp;metres (20&nbsp;feet) and a little over 8&nbsp;m (28&nbsp;ft). Some specimens surpass 9 or even 10&nbsp;m, but after years of hard fishing, specimens of this size have become exceedingly rare. These sharks possess the typical <!--del_lnk--> lamniform body plan and have been mistaken for <a href="../../wp/g/Great_white_shark.htm" title="Great white shark">great white sharks</a>. The two species can be easily distinguished, however, by the basking shark&#39;s cavernous jaw (up to 1&nbsp;m in width, held wide open whilst feeding), longer and more obvious <!--del_lnk--> gill slits (which nearly encircle the head and are accompanied by well-developed <!--del_lnk--> gill raker), smaller eyes, and smaller average girth. Great whites possess large, dagger-like teeth, whilst those of the basking shark are much smaller (5&ndash;6&nbsp;mm) and hooked; only the first 3&ndash;4 rows of the upper jaw and 6&ndash;7 rows of the lower jaw are functional. There are also several behavioural differences between the two (see <a href="#Behaviour" title="">Behaviour</a>).<p>Other distinctive characteristics of the basking shark include a strongly keeled caudal peduncle, highly textured skin covered in <!--del_lnk--> placoid scales and a layer of mucus, a pointed snout (which is distinctly hooked in younger specimens), and a lunate <!--del_lnk--> caudal fin. In large individuals the dorsal may flop over when above the surface. Coloration is highly variable (and likely dependent on observation conditions and the condition of the animal itself): commonly, the coloring is dark brown to black or blue dorsally fading to a dull white ventrally. The sharks are often noticeably scarred, possibly through encounters with <!--del_lnk--> lampreys or <a href="../../wp/c/Cookiecutter_shark.htm" title="Cookiecutter shark">cookiecutter sharks</a>. The basking shark&#39;s liver, which may account for 25% of the its body weight, runs the entire length of the abdominal cavity and is thought to play a role in <!--del_lnk--> buoyancy regulation and long-term energy storage.<p>In females, only the right <!--del_lnk--> ovary appears to be functional: if so, this is a unique characteristic among sharks.<p><a id="Diet" name="Diet"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Diet</span></h2>
      <p>The basking shark is a passive <!--del_lnk--> filter feeder, eating <!--del_lnk--> zooplankton, small fish and invertebrates from the water at a rate of up to 2,000&nbsp;tons of water per hour. Unlike the <!--del_lnk--> megamouth shark and <a href="../../wp/w/Whale_shark.htm" title="Whale shark">whale shark</a>, basking sharks do not appear to actively seek their quarry, but do possess large <!--del_lnk--> olfactory bulbs that may guide them in the right direction. Contrary to the other large filter feeders it relies only on the water that is pushed through the gills by swimming while the megamouth shark and whale shark can suck or pump water through its gills.<p><a id="Behaviour" name="Behaviour"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Behaviour</span></h2>

      <p>Although basking sharks are often sighted close to land and in enclosed bays during warmer months, they are highly <!--del_lnk--> migratory and seem to disappear entirely during autumn and winter (when the plankton is scarce at the surface). During this time they remain at the bottom in deep water where it is hypothisized they may <!--del_lnk--> hibernate and lose their gill rakers.<p>They feed at or close to the surface with their mouths wide open and gill rakers erect. They are slow-moving sharks (feeding at about 2&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> knots) and do not attempt to evade approaching boats (unlike great whites). They are harmless to humans if left alone and will not be attracted to <!--del_lnk--> chum.<p>Basking sharks are social animals and form schools segregated by sex, usually in small numbers (3&ndash;4) but reportedly up to 100 individuals. Their social behaviour is thought to follow visual cues, as although the basking shark&#39;s eyes are small, they are fully developed; the sharks have been known to visually inspect boats, possibly mistaking them for conspecifics. Females are thought to seek out shallow water to give birth.<p>These sharks have few predators, but <a href="../../wp/o/Orca.htm" title="Orca">orcas</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Tiger_shark.htm" title="Tiger shark">tiger sharks</a> are known to feed on them, and the aforementioned <!--del_lnk--> lampreys are often seen attached to them, although it is unlikely that they are able to cut through the shark&#39;s thick skin.<p>Even though the basking shark is large and slow it can <!--del_lnk--> breach the surface and has been reported jumping fully out of the water. This behaviour could be an attempt to dislodge parasites or comensals. There are doubts as to the accuracy of these observations - since the basking shark has a recorded top swimming speed of 4&nbsp;mph and has not been observed to jump under the stress of harpooning.<p><a id="Reproduction" name="Reproduction"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Reproduction</span></h2>
      <p>Basking sharks are <!--del_lnk--> ovoviviparous: the developing embryos first rely on a <!--del_lnk--> yolk sac, and as there is no <!--del_lnk--> placental connection, they later feed on unfertilized <!--del_lnk--> ova produced by the mother (a behaviour known as <!--del_lnk--> oophagy). <!--del_lnk--> Gestation is thought to span over a year (but perhaps 2 or 3 years), with a small though unknown number of young born fully developed at 1.5&ndash;2&nbsp;m (5&ndash;6.5&nbsp;ft). Only one pregnant female is known to have been caught; it was carrying 6 unborn young. Mating is thought to occur in early summer and birthing in late summer, following the female&#39;s movement into shallow coastal waters.<p>The onset of maturity in basking sharks is not known but is thought to be between the age of 6 and 13 and at a length of between 4.6 and 6&nbsp;m. Breeding frequency is also unknown, but is thought to be 2 to 4 years.<p>The seemingly useless teeth of basking sharks may play a role in courtship behaviour, possibly as a means for the male to keep hold of the female during mating.<p><a id="Importance_to_humans" name="Importance_to_humans"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Importance to humans</span></h2>
      <p>Historically, the basking shark has been a staple of fisheries because of its slow swimming speed, unaggressive nature and previously abundant numbers. Commercially it was put to many uses: the flesh for food and fishmeal, the hide for <!--del_lnk--> leather, and its large <!--del_lnk--> liver (which has a high squalene content) for <!--del_lnk--> oil. It is currently fished mainly for its fins (for <!--del_lnk--> shark fin soup). Parts (such as <!--del_lnk--> cartilage) are also used in <!--del_lnk--> traditional Chinese medicine and as an <!--del_lnk--> aphrodisiac in <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>, further adding to demand.<p>As a result of rapidly declining numbers, the basking shark has been protected and trade in its products restricted in many countries. It is fully protected in the <!--del_lnk--> UK, <a href="../../wp/m/Malta.htm" title="Malta">Malta</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a> and <!--del_lnk--> US Gulf and <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic waters</a>. Targeted fishing for basking sharks is illegal in <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>.<p>It is tolerant of boats and divers approaching it and may even circle divers, making it an important draw for dive tourism in areas where it is common.<p><a id="Basking_sharks_and_cryptozoology" name="Basking_sharks_and_cryptozoology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Basking sharks and cryptozoology</span></h2>
