      <p>There is <!--del_lnk--> significant evidence that birds evolved from <a href="../../wp/t/Theropoda.htm" title="Theropoda">theropod</a> <!--del_lnk--> dinosaurs, specifically, that birds are members of <!--del_lnk--> Maniraptora, a group of theropods which includes <!--del_lnk--> dromaeosaurs and <!--del_lnk--> oviraptorids, among others. As more non-avian theropods that are closely related to birds are discovered, the formerly clear distinction between non-birds and birds becomes less so. Recent discoveries in northeast the <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">People&#39;s Republic of China</a> (<!--del_lnk--> Liaoning Province), demonstrating that many small <!--del_lnk--> theropod dinosaurs had feathers, contribute to this ambiguity.<p>The basal bird <i><a href="../../wp/a/Archaeopteryx.htm" title="Archaeopteryx">Archaeopteryx</a></i>, from the <a href="../../wp/j/Jurassic.htm" title="Jurassic">Jurassic</a>, is well-known as one of the first &quot;missing links&quot; to be found in support of <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">evolution</a> in the late <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a>, though it is not considered a direct ancestor of modern birds. <i><!--del_lnk--> Confuciusornis</i> is another early bird; it lived in the <!--del_lnk--> Early Cretaceous. Both may be predated by <i><!--del_lnk--> Protoavis texensis</i>, though the fragmentary nature of this fossil leaves it open to considerable doubt if this was a bird ancestor. Other <!--del_lnk--> Mesozoic birds include the <!--del_lnk--> Enantiornithes, <!--del_lnk--> Yanornis, <i><!--del_lnk--> Ichthyornis</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Gansus</i> and the <!--del_lnk--> Hesperornithiformes, a group of flightless divers resembling <!--del_lnk--> grebes and <!--del_lnk--> loons.<p>The recently discovered dromaeosaur <i><!--del_lnk--> Cryptovolans</i> was capable of powered flight, possessed a sternal <!--del_lnk--> keel and had ribs with <!--del_lnk--> uncinate processes. In fact, <i><!--del_lnk--> Cryptovolans</i> makes a better &quot;bird&quot; than <i><a href="../../wp/a/Archaeopteryx.htm" title="Archaeopteryx">Archaeopteryx</a></i> which is missing some of these modern bird features. Because of this, some paleontologists have suggested that <!--del_lnk--> dromaeosaurs are actually basal birds whose larger members are secondarily flightless, i.e. that dromaeosaurs evolved from birds and not the other way around. Evidence for this theory is currently inconclusive, but digs continue to unearth fossils (especially in China) of the strange feathered dromaeosaurs. At any rate, it is fairly certain that avian flight existed in the mid-Jurassic and was &quot;tried out&quot; in several lineages and variants by the mid-Cretaceous.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Although <a href="../../wp/o/Ornithischia.htm" title="Ornithischia">ornithischian</a> (bird-hipped) dinosaurs share the same <!--del_lnk--> hip structure as birds, birds actually originated from the <a href="../../wp/s/Saurischia.htm" title="Saurischia">saurischian</a> (lizard-hipped) dinosaurs (if the dinosaurian origin theory is correct), and thus arrived at their hip structure condition <!--del_lnk--> independently. In fact, the bird-like hip structure also developed a third time among a peculiar group of theropods, the <!--del_lnk--> Therizinosauridae.<p>An alternate theory to the dinosaurian origin of birds, espoused by a few scientists (most notably Lary Martin and Alan Feduccia), states that birds (including <!--del_lnk--> maniraptoran &quot;dinosaurs&quot;) evolved from early archosaurs like <i><!--del_lnk--> Longisquama</i>, a theory which is contested by most other scientists in paleontology, and by experts in feather development and evolution such as R.O. Prum. See the <i><!--del_lnk--> Longisquama</i> article for more on this alternative.<p>Modern birds are classified in Neornithes, which are now known to have evolved into some basic lineages by the end of the Cretaceous (see <i><!--del_lnk--> Vegavis</i>). The Neornithes are split into the Paleognathae and Neognathae. The paleognaths include the <!--del_lnk--> tinamous (found only in Central and South America) and the <!--del_lnk--> ratites. The ratites are large flightless birds, and include ostriches, cassowaries, kiwis and emus (though some scientists suspect that the ratites represent an artificial grouping of birds which have independently lost the ability to fly in a number of unrelated lineages). The basal divergence from the remaining Neognathes was that of the Galloanseri, the superorder containing the <!--del_lnk--> Anseriformes (<!--del_lnk--> ducks, <a href="../../wp/g/Goose.htm" title="Goose">geese</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Swan.htm" title="Swan">swans</a>), and the <!--del_lnk--> Galliformes (the <!--del_lnk--> pheasants, <!--del_lnk--> grouse, and their allies). See the chart for more information.<p>The classification of birds is a contentious issue. <!--del_lnk--> Sibley &amp; Ahlquist&#39;s <i>Phylogeny and Classification of Birds</i> (1990) is a landmark work on the classification of birds (although frequently debated and constantly revised). A preponderance of evidence seems to suggest that the modern bird orders constitute accurate <!--del_lnk--> taxa. However, scientists are not in agreement as to the relationships between the orders; evidence from modern bird anatomy, fossils and DNA have all been brought to bear on the problem but no strong consensus has emerged. More recently, new fossil and molecular evidence is providing an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird orders.

      <p>Birds have a <!--del_lnk--> body plan that shows so many unusual adaptations (mostly aiding <!--del_lnk--> flight) that birds have earned their own unique <a href="../../wp/s/Scientific_classification.htm" title="Scientific classification">class</a> in the <a href="../../wp/v/Vertebrate.htm" title="Vertebrate">vertebrate</a> <!--del_lnk--> phylum.<p>Unlike mammals, birds don&#39;t urinate. Their kidneys extract nitrogenous wastes from the bloodstream, but instead of excreting it as urea dissolved in urine as we do, they excrete it in the form of uric acid. Uric acid has a very low solubility in water, so it emerges as a white paste. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird&#39;s cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose hole for birds: their wastes come out of it, they have sex by putting their cloacas together, and females lay eggs out of it.<p>Birds have one of the most complex lung system of all organisms. Air enters the bird and immediately 75% of the air bypasses the lungs and flows directally into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. When the bird exhales the air from the postirior air sac is forced into the lungs thus birds receive a supply of air during both inhalation and exhalation. The gas exchange then takes place in the capillaries.<p>The nervous system relative to the birds size is actually quite large. The most developed part of the brain is the one that controls the flight related function while the cerebellum coordinates movement and the cerebrum controls behaviour patterns, navigation, mating and nest building. A birds eyes are developed for taking off, spotting landmarks, hunting and feeding. Birds with eyes on the side of their head have a wide vision field while birds with eyes on the front of their heads like owls have binocular vision and can measure depth.<p><a id="Nesting" name="Nesting"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Nesting</span></h2>

Non-passerines typically have white eggs, except in some ground-nesting groups such as the <!--del_lnk--> Charadriiformes, <!--del_lnk--> sandgrouse and <!--del_lnk--> nightjars, where camouflage is necessary, and some <!--del_lnk--> parasitic <!--del_lnk--> cuckoos which have to match the passerine host&#39;s egg. Most passerines, in contrast, lay coloured eggs, even if, like the <!--del_lnk--> tits they are hole-nesters.<p>The brown or red <!--del_lnk--> protoporphyrin markings on passerine eggs reduce brittleness and are a substitute for calcium when that element is in short supply. The colour of individual eggs is genetically influenced, and appears to be inherited through the mother only, suggesting that the <!--del_lnk--> gene responsible for pigmentation is on the sex determining W chromosome (female birds are WZ, males ZZ).<p>The eggs are laid in a <!--del_lnk--> nest, which may be anything from a bare cliff ledge or ground scrape to elaboratey decorated structures such as those of the <!--del_lnk--> oropendolas.<p><a id="Social_systems_and_parental_care" name="Social_systems_and_parental_care"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Social systems and parental care</span></h3>
      <p>The three mating systems that predominate among birds are polyandry, polygyny, and monogamy. <!--del_lnk--> Monogamy is seen in approximately 91% of all bird species. <!--del_lnk--> Polygyny constitutes 2% of all birds and <!--del_lnk--> polyandry is seen in less than 1%. Monogamous species of males and females pair for the breeding season. In some cases, the individuals may pair for life.<p>One reason for the high rate of monogamy among birds is the fact that male birds are just as adept at parental care as females. In most groups of animals, male parental care is rare, but in birds it is quite common; in fact, it is more extensive in birds than in any other vertebrate class. In birds, male care can be seen as important or essential to female fitness. &quot;In one form of monogamy such as with obligate monogamy a female cannot rear a litter without the aid of a male&quot; .<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The parental behaviour most closely associated with monogamy is male <!--del_lnk--> incubation. Interestingly, male incubation is the most confining male parental behaviour. It takes time and also may require physiological changes that interfere with continued mating. This extreme loss of mating opportunities leads to a reduction in reproductive success among incubating males. &quot;This information then suggests that sexual selection may be less intense in taxa where males incubate, hypothetically because males allocate more effort to parental care and less to mating&quot; . In other words, in bird species in which male incubation is common, females tend to select mates on the basis of parental behaviors rather than physical appearance.<p><a id="Birds_and_humans" name="Birds_and_humans"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Birds and humans</span></h2>

      <p>Birds are an important food source for <a href="../../wp/h/Human.htm" title="Human">humans</a>. The most commonly eaten species is the domestic <a href="../../wp/c/Chicken.htm" title="Chicken">chicken</a> and its <!--del_lnk--> eggs, although <a href="../../wp/g/Goose.htm" title="Goose">geese</a>, <!--del_lnk--> pheasants, <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey_%2528bird%2529.htm" title="Turkey (bird)">turkeys</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> ducks are also widely eaten. Other birds that have been utilized for food include <a href="../../wp/e/Emu.htm" title="Emu">emus</a>, <a href="../../wp/o/Ostrich.htm" title="Ostrich">ostriches</a>, <a href="../../wp/d/Dove.htm" title="Dove">pigeons</a>, <!--del_lnk--> grouse, <!--del_lnk--> quails, <a href="../../wp/d/Dove.htm" title="Dove">doves</a>, <!--del_lnk--> woodcocks, <!--del_lnk--> songbirds, and others, including small <!--del_lnk--> passerines such as <!--del_lnk--> finches. Birds grown for human consumption are referred to as <a href="../../wp/p/Poultry.htm" title="Poultry">poultry</a>.<p>At one time <a href="../../wp/s/Swan.htm" title="Swan">swans</a> and <a href="../../wp/f/Flamingo.htm" title="Flamingo">flamingos</a> were delicacies of the rich and powerful, although these are generally protected now.<p>Besides meat and eggs, birds provide other items useful to humans, including <a href="../../wp/f/Feather.htm" title="Feather">feathers</a> for bedding and decoration, <!--del_lnk--> guano-derived phosphorus and nitrogen used in fertilizer and gunpowder, and the central ingredient of <!--del_lnk--> bird&#39;s nest soup.<p>Humans have caused the disappearance of some bird species. The <a href="../../wp/p/Passenger_Pigeon.htm" title="Passenger Pigeon">Passenger Pigeon</a> and <a href="../../wp/d/Dodo.htm" title="Dodo">Dodo</a> were <!--del_lnk--> hunted to extinction, and many others have become endangered or extinct through <!--del_lnk--> habitat destruction (e.g. by <!--del_lnk--> deforestation or intensive <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>).<p>Some species have come to depend on human activities for food and are widespread to the point of being pests. For example, the common pigeon or <a href="../../wp/r/Rock_Pigeon.htm" title="Rock Pigeon">Rock Pigeon</a> (<i>Columba livia</i>) thrives in urban areas around the world. In North America, introduced <a href="../../wp/h/House_Sparrow.htm" title="House Sparrow">House Sparrows</a>, <!--del_lnk--> European Starlings, and <!--del_lnk--> House Finches are similarly widespread.<p>Other birds have long been used by humans to perform tasks. For example, <!--del_lnk--> homing pigeons were used to carry messages before the advent of modern instant communications methods (many are still kept for sport). <a href="../../wp/f/Falcon.htm" title="Falcon">Falcons</a> are still used for hunting, while <a href="../../wp/c/Cormorant.htm" title="Cormorant">cormorants</a> are employed by fishermen. <a href="../../wp/c/Chicken.htm" title="Chicken">Chickens</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Pigeon.htm" title="Pigeon">pigeons</a> are popular as experimental subjects, and are often used in <a href="../../wp/b/Biology.htm" title="Biology">biology</a> and <!--del_lnk--> comparative psychology research. As birds are very sensitive to toxins, the <!--del_lnk--> Canary was used in <!--del_lnk--> coal mines to indicate the presence of poisonous gases, allowing miners sufficient time to escape without injury.<p>Colorful, particularly tropical, birds (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> parrots, and <!--del_lnk--> mynas) are often kept as <!--del_lnk--> pets although this practice has led to the illegal <!--del_lnk--> trafficking of some endangered species; <!--del_lnk--> CITES, an international agreement adopted in 1963, has considerably reduced trafficking in the bird species it protects.<p>Bird diseases that can be contracted by humans include <!--del_lnk--> psittacosis, <!--del_lnk--> salmonellosis, <!--del_lnk--> campylobacteriosis, Newcastle&#39;s disease, mycobacteriosis (avian <a href="../../wp/t/Tuberculosis.htm" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>), <!--del_lnk--> avian influenza, <!--del_lnk--> giardiasis, and <!--del_lnk--> cryptosporidiosis.<p><a id="Threats_to_birds" name="Threats_to_birds"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Threats to birds</span></h2>
      <p>According to Worldwatch Institute, bird populations are declining worldwide, with 1,200 species facing extinction in the next century.  Among the biggest cited reasons are habitat loss, predation by nonnative species, oil spills and pesticide use, hunting and fishing, and climate change.<p><a id="Trivia" name="Trivia"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Trivia</span></h2>
