      <p><b>The British Broadcasting Corporation</b>, usually known as the <b>BBC</b>, is the largest <a href="../../wp/b/Broadcasting.htm" title="Broadcasting">broadcasting</a> corporation in the world in terms of audience numbers, employing 26,000 staff in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> alone and with a budget of more than <a href="../../wp/p/Pound_sterling.htm" title="Pound sterling">GB&pound;</a>4 billion (<a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">US$</a>7.9 billion.)<p>Founded in 1922 as the <!--del_lnk--> British Broadcasting Company Ltd, it was subsequently granted a <!--del_lnk--> Royal Charter and made a <!--del_lnk--> state-owned but independent corporation in 1927. The corporation produces programmes and information services, broadcasting on <a href="../../wp/t/Television.htm" title="Television">television</a>, <a href="../../wp/r/Radio.htm" title="Radio">radio</a>, and the <a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">Internet</a>. The stated mission of the BBC is &quot;to inform, educate and entertain&quot;, and the <!--del_lnk--> motto of the BBC is <i>Nation Shall Speak Peace Unto Nation.</i><p>The BBC is a <!--del_lnk--> quasi-autonomous <!--del_lnk--> Public Corporation operating as a <!--del_lnk--> public service broadcaster. The Corporation is run by the <!--del_lnk--> BBC Trust; however, the BBC is, per its charter, to be &quot;free from both political and commercial influence and answers only to its viewers and listeners&quot;.<p>Its domestic programming and broadcasts are primarily funded by levying <!--del_lnk--> television licence fees (under the <!--del_lnk--> Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949), although money is also raised through commercial activities such as sale of merchandise and programming. The <!--del_lnk--> BBC World Service, however, is funded by the <!--del_lnk--> Foreign and Commonwealth Office. In order to justify the <!--del_lnk--> licence fee the BBC is expected to produce a number of high-rating shows in addition to programmes that commercial broadcasters would not normally broadcast.<p>Quite often domestic audiences affectionately refer to the BBC as <i>the Beeb</i> (coined by <!--del_lnk--> Kenny Everett). <i>Auntie</i> was a nickname used during the early years, said to originate in the somewhat old fashioned <i>Auntie knows best</i> attitude back when <!--del_lnk--> John Reith was in charge. The two terms have been used together as <i>Auntie Beeb</i>.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p>The original <i><!--del_lnk--> British Broadcasting Company</i> was founded in 1922 by a group of <!--del_lnk--> telecommunications companies (including <!--del_lnk--> subsidiaries of <!--del_lnk--> General Electric and <a href="../../wp/a/AT%2526T.htm" title="AT&amp;T">AT&amp;T</a>) to broadcast experimental radio services. The first transmission was on <!--del_lnk--> 14 November of that year, from station 2LO, located at Marconi House, London.<p>The Company, with John Reith as general manager, became the <i>British Broadcasting Corporation</i> in 1927 when it was granted a <!--del_lnk--> Royal Charter of incorporation and ceased to be privately owned. It started experimental television broadcasting in 1932 using an entirely mechanical 30 line system developed by <a href="../../wp/j/John_Logie_Baird.htm" title="John Logie Baird">John Logie Baird</a>. It became a regular service (known as the <!--del_lnk--> BBC Television Service) in 1936 alternating between a Baird mechanical 240 line system and the all electronic 405 line EMI system. The superiority of the electronic system saw the mechanical system dropped later that year. Television broadcasting was suspended from <!--del_lnk--> 1 September <!--del_lnk--> 1939 to <!--del_lnk--> 7 June <!--del_lnk--> 1946 during the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">Second World War</a>. A widely reported <!--del_lnk--> urban myth is that, upon resumption of service, announcer <!--del_lnk--> Leslie Mitchell started by saying, &quot;As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted...&quot; In fact, the first person to appear when transmission resumed was <!--del_lnk--> Jasmine Bligh and the words said were &quot;Good afternoon, everybody. How are you? Do you remember me, Jasmine Bligh...?&quot;<p>The <!--del_lnk--> European Broadcasting Union was formed on 12 February, 1950, in Torquay with the BBC among the 23 founding broadcasting organisations.<p>Competition to the BBC was introduced in 1955 with the commercially and independently operated <!--del_lnk--> ITV. As a result of the <!--del_lnk--> Pilkington Committee report of 1962, in which the BBC was lauded and ITV was very heavily criticised for not providing enough quality programming, the BBC was awarded a second TV channel, <!--del_lnk--> BBC2, in 1964, renaming the existing channel <!--del_lnk--> BBC1. BBC2 used the higher resolution 625 line standard which had been standardised across Europe. BBC2 was broadcast in colour from <!--del_lnk--> 1 July <!--del_lnk--> 1967, and was joined by BBC 1 and ITV on <!--del_lnk--> 15 November <!--del_lnk--> 1969. The 405 line transmissions were continued for compatibility with older television receivers for some years.<p>In 1974 the BBC&#39;s teletext service, <!--del_lnk--> Ceefax, was introduced but was not finally transmitted in vision as such until April 1980. In 1978 the BBC went on strike just before the Christmas of that year, thus blocking out the transmission of both channels and amalgamating all four radio stations into one.<p>Since the <!--del_lnk--> deregulation of the UK television and radio market in the 1980s, the BBC has faced increased competition from the commercial sector (and from the advertiser-funded public service broadcaster <!--del_lnk--> Channel 4), especially on <!--del_lnk--> satellite television, <!--del_lnk--> cable television, and <!--del_lnk--> digital television services.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> BBC Research Department has played a major part in the development of broadcasting and recording techniques. In the early days it carried out essential research into acoustics and programme level and noise measurement.<p>The 2004 <!--del_lnk--> Hutton Inquiry, and the subsequent Report raised questions about the BBC&#39;s journalistic standards and its impartiality. This led to resignations of senior management members at the time including the then Director General, Greg Dyke. In January 2007, the BBC released minutes of the Board meeting which led to Greg Dyke&#39;s resignation. Many commentators have considered the discussions documented in the minutes to have made Dyke&#39;s ability to remain in position untenable and tantamount to a dismissal.<p>Unlike the other departments of the BBC, BBC World Service is funded by the <!--del_lnk--> Foreign and Commonwealth Office.<p>The Foreign and Commonwealth Office, more commonly known as the Foreign Office or the FCO, is the British government department responsible for promoting the interests of the United Kingdom abroad.<p><a id="Corporation" name="Corporation"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Corporation</span></h2>

      <p>The BBC is a <!--del_lnk--> quasi-autonomous <!--del_lnk--> Public Corporation operating as a <!--del_lnk--> public service broadcaster incorporated under a Royal Charter that is reviewed every 10 years. Until 2007 The Corporation was run by a board of governors appointed by The Queen or King on the advice of <!--del_lnk--> the government for a term of four years but on 1 January 2007 the Board of Governors was replaced with the <!--del_lnk--> BBC Trust. The BBC is required by its charter to be free from both political and commercial influence and to answer only to its viewers and listeners.<p>The most recent Charter came into effect on 1 January, 2007. It has created a number of important changes to the Corporation&#39;s management and purpose:<ul>
       <li>Abolition of the Board of Governors, and their replacement by the <!--del_lnk--> BBC Trust.<li>A redefinition of the BBC&#39;s &quot;public services&quot; (which are considered its prime function): <ul>
         <li>sustaining citizenship and civil society;<li>promoting education and learning;<li>stimulating creativity and cultural excellence;<li>representing the UK, its nations, regions and communities;<li>bringing the UK to the world and the world to the UK;<li>helping to deliver to the public the benefit of emerging communications technologies and services, and taking a leading role in the switchover to digital television.</ul>
       <li>The BBC must display at least one of the following characteristics in all content: high quality, originality, innovation, to be challenging and to be engaging.<li>The BBC must demonstrate that it provides <i>public value</i> in all its major activities.</ul>

      <p>The BBC Trust came into effect on 1 January 2007, replacing the Board of Governors.<blockquote>
       <p>The BBC Trust works on behalf of licence fee payers: it ensures the BBC provides high quality output and good value for all UK citizens and it protects the independence of the BBC. &mdash; BBC Trust</blockquote>
      <p>The Trust sets the overall strategic direction for the corporation and assess the performance of the BBC Executive Board. The Trust has twelve trustees, currently:<ul>

      <p>The original trustees, three former governors and eight new members, were announced by <!--del_lnk--> Tessa Jowell, <!--del_lnk--> Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, in October 2006.. Michael Grade, then Chairman of the Governors, was to become Chairman of the Trust at the time of the announcement, but due to his move to <!--del_lnk--> ITV, Chitra Bharucha became the Acting Chair, with Sir Michael Lyons taking over as Chairman from 1 May 2007.<p><a id="Executive_Board" name="Executive_Board"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Executive Board</span></h4>
      <p>The Executive Board oversees the effective delivery of the corporation&#39;s objectives and obligations within a framework set by the BBC Trust, and is headed by the Director-General, <!--del_lnk--> Mark Thompson. In December 2006, Thompson announced the final appointments to the new Executive Board, consisting of ten directors from the different operations of the group, and five non-executive directors, appointed to provide independent and professional advice to the Executive Board.

      <p>The Board of Governors regulated the group from incorporation in 1927 until 31 December 2006, when the Board was replaced by the BBC Trust. The governors as of the dissolution of the Board were:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Anthony Salz (Acting Chairman)<li><!--del_lnk--> Professor Ranjit Sondhi (National Governor for the English regions)<li><!--del_lnk--> Professor Fabian Monds (National Governor for Northern Ireland)<li><!--del_lnk--> Professor Merfyn Jones (National Governor for Wales)<li><!--del_lnk--> Jeremy Peat (National Governor for Scotland)<li><!--del_lnk--> Deborah Bull<li><!--del_lnk--> Baroness Deech<li><!--del_lnk--> Dermot Gleeson<li><!--del_lnk--> Angela Sarkis<li><!--del_lnk--> Richard Tait</ul>
      <p><a id="Finance" name="Finance"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Finance</span></h3>
      <p>The BBC has the largest budget of any UK broadcaster with an operating expenditure of &pound;4 billion in 2005 compared to &pound;3.2 billion for <!--del_lnk--> British Sky Broadcasting, &pound;1.7 billion for <!--del_lnk--> ITV and &pound;79 million (in 2006) for <!--del_lnk--> GCap Media (the largest commercial radio broadcaster).<p><a id="Revenue" name="Revenue"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Revenue</span></h4>

      <p>The principal means of funding the BBC is through the television licence, costing &pound;11.37 a month if paid by <!--del_lnk--> direct debit (as of February 2007). Such a licence is required to operate a broadcast <a href="../../wp/t/Television.htm" title="Television">television</a> receiver within the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">UK</a>. The cost of a television licence is set by the government and enforced by the criminal law. The revenue is collected privately and is paid into the central government Consolidated fund, a process defined in the Communications Act 2003. Funds are then allocated by the DCMS and Treasury and approved by Parliament via the Appropriation Act(s). Additional revenues are paid by the Department for Work and Pensions to compensate for subsidised licences for over-75&#39;s. As the state controls BBC&#39;s funding, it is sometimes referred as a &quot;state&quot; broadcaster.<p>Income from commercial enterprises and from overseas sales of its catalogue of programmes has substantially increased over recent years. with <!--del_lnk--> BBC Worldwide contributing some &pound;145million in cash to the BBC&#39;s core public service business.<p>According to the BBC&#39;s 2005-2006 Annual Report, its income can be broken down as follows:<ul>
       <li>&pound;3,100.6 m licence fees collected from consumers.<li>&pound;620.0 m from BBC Commercial Businesses.<li>&pound;260.2 m from the World Service, of which &pound;239.1 m is from grants (primarily funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office), &pound;15.8 m from subscriptions, and &pound;5.3 m from other sources.<li>&pound;24.2 m from other income, such as providing content to overseas broadcasters and concert ticket sales.</ul>
      <p><a id="Expenditure" name="Expenditure"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Expenditure</span></h4>

      <p>Broadcasting House in <!--del_lnk--> Portland Place, <!--del_lnk--> London is the official headquarters of the BBC. It is home to the national radio networks <!--del_lnk--> BBC Radio 2, <!--del_lnk--> 3, <!--del_lnk--> 4, <!--del_lnk--> 6 Music, and <!--del_lnk--> BBC 7. On the front of the building are statues of <!--del_lnk--> Prospero and <!--del_lnk--> Ariel (from <a href="../../wp/w/William_Shakespeare.htm" title="William Shakespeare">Shakespeare&#39;s</a> <i><!--del_lnk--> The Tempest</i>) sculpted by <!--del_lnk--> Eric Gill.<p>Renovation of Broadcasting House began in 2002 and is scheduled for completion in 2010. As part of a major reorganisation of BBC property, Broadcasting House is to become home to <!--del_lnk--> BBC News (both television and radio), national radio, and the <!--del_lnk--> BBC World Service. The major part of this plan involves the demolition of the two post-war extensions to the building and construction of a new building beside the existing structure. During the rebuilding process many of the BBC Radio networks have been relocated to other buildings in the vicinity of Portland Place.<p>In 2007/2008 BBC News is expected to relocate from the News Centre at <!--del_lnk--> BBC Television Centre to the refurbished Broadcasting House in what is being described as &quot;one of the world&#39;s largest live broadcast centres&quot;.<p>By far the largest concentration of BBC staff in the UK exists in <!--del_lnk--> White City. Well known buildings in this area include the <!--del_lnk--> BBC Television Centre, White City, Media Centre, Broadcast Centre and Centre House.<p>As well as the various BBC buildings in London, there are major BBC production centres located in <a href="../../wp/c/Cardiff.htm" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Belfast.htm" title="Belfast">Belfast</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Glasgow.htm" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Birmingham.htm" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Manchester.htm" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Bristol.htm" title="Bristol">Bristol</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Southampton.htm" title="Southampton">Southampton</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/Newcastle_upon_Tyne.htm" title="Newcastle upon Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a>. Some of these local centres (for example Belfast) are also known as &quot;Broadcasting House&quot; (see <!--del_lnk--> Broadcasting House (disambiguation)). There are also many smaller local and regional studios scattered throughout the UK.<p>In 2011 the BBC is planning to move several departments of the BBC North. The leading candidate is <!--del_lnk--> Salford Quays in <!--del_lnk--> Greater Manchester. This will mark a major decentralisation of the corporation&#39;s operations from London.<p><a id="Services" name="Services"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Services</span></h2>

      <p>The bbc.co.uk <!--del_lnk-->  <!--del_lnk--> website, formerly known as BBCi and before that BBC Online, includes a comprehensive, advertisement-free <!--del_lnk--> news website and archive. The BBC claims the site to be &quot;Europe&#39;s most popular content-based site&quot; and boasts that 13.2 million people in the UK visit the site&#39;s more than 2 million pages. According to <!--del_lnk--> Alexa&#39;s TrafficRank system, in March 2007 bbc.co.uk was the 19th most popular <!--del_lnk--> English Language website in the world, and the 31st most popular overall.<p>The website allows the BBC to produce sections which complement the various programmes on television and radio, and it is common for viewers and listeners to be told <!--del_lnk--> website addresses for the bbc.co.uk sections relating to that programme. The site also allows users to listen to most Radio output live and for seven days after broadcast using its <!--del_lnk--> RealPlayer-based &quot;Radio Player&quot;; some TV content is also distributed in <!--del_lnk--> RealVideo format. A new system known as <!--del_lnk--> IPlayer is under development, which uses <!--del_lnk--> peer-to-peer and <!--del_lnk--> DRM technology to deliver both radio and TV content for offline use for up to 7 days. Also, through participation in the <!--del_lnk--> Creative Archive Licence group, bbc.co.uk allowed legal downloads of selected archive material via the internet.<p><!--del_lnk--> BBC jam is a free online service, delivered through broadband and narrowband connections, providing high-quality interactive resources designed to stimulate learning at home and at school. Initial content was made available in January 2006. BBC jam was suspended on 20th March 2007<p>In recent years some major on-line companies and politicians have complained that the bbc.co.uk website receives too much funding from the television licence, meaning that other websites are unable to compete with the vast amount of advertising-free on-line content available on bbc.co.uk. Some have proposed that the amount of licence fee money spent on bbc.co.uk should be reduced &mdash; either being replaced with funding from advertisements or subscriptions, or a reduction in the amount of content available on the site. In response to this the BBC carried out an investigation, and has now set in motion a plan to change the way it provides its online services. bbc.co.uk will now attempt to fill in gaps in the market, but will guide users to other websites for currently existing market provision. (For example, instead of providing local events information and timetables, users will be guided to outside websites already providing that information.) Part of this plan included the BBC closing some of its websites, and rediverting money to redevelop other parts.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> BBC Worldwide Limited is the wholly owned commercial subsidiary of the BBC responsible for the commercial exploitation of BBC programmes and other properties, including a number of television stations throughout the world. The cable and satellite stations <!--del_lnk--> BBC Prime (in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a> the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, and <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a>), <!--del_lnk--> BBC America, <!--del_lnk--> BBC Canada (alongside <!--del_lnk--> BBC Kids), broadcast popular BBC programmes to people outside the UK, as does <!--del_lnk--> UK.TV (co-run with <!--del_lnk--> Foxtel and Fremantle Media) in <!--del_lnk--> Australasia. A similar service, <!--del_lnk--> BBC Japan, ceased broadcasts in April 2006 after its <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japanese</a> distributor folded. BBC Worldwide also runs a 24-hour news channel, <!--del_lnk--> BBC World and co-runs, with <!--del_lnk--> Virgin Media, the <!--del_lnk--> UKTV network of stations in the UK, producers of amongst others <!--del_lnk--> UKTV Gold. In addition, BBC television news appears nightly on many <!--del_lnk--> Public Broadcasting Service stations in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, as do reruns of BBC programmes such as <i><a href="../../wp/e/EastEnders.htm" title="EastEnders">EastEnders</a></i>, and in <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> on <!--del_lnk--> TV One.<p>Many BBC programmes (especially <!--del_lnk--> documentaries) are sold via BBC Worldwide to foreign television stations, and <!--del_lnk--> comedy, <!--del_lnk--> documentaries and <!--del_lnk--> historical drama productions are popular on the international DVD market.<p>BBC Worldwide also maintains the publishing arm of the BBC and it is the third-largest publisher of consumer magazines in the United Kingdom. BBC Magazines, formerly known as BBC Publications, publishes the <i><!--del_lnk--> Radio Times</i> (and published the now-defunct <i><!--del_lnk--> The Listener</i>) as well as a number of magazines that support BBC programming such as <i><!--del_lnk--> BBC Top Gear</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> BBC Good Food</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> BBC Sky at Night</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> BBC History</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> BBC Wildlife</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> BBC Music</i>.<p>The BBC has traditionally played a major role in producing book and music tie-ins with its broadcast material. <!--del_lnk--> BBC Records produced soundtrack albums, talking books and material from radio broadcasts of music.<p>Between 2004 and 2006 BBC Worldwide owned the independent magazine publisher Origin Publishing.<p>BBC Worldwide also licences and directly sells <a href="../../wp/d/DVD.htm" title="DVD">DVD</a> and audio recordings of popular programmes to the public, most notably <i><a href="../../wp/d/Doctor_Who.htm" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a></i> (including books and merchandise), and archive <!--del_lnk--> classical music recordings, initially as <i>BBC Radio Classics</i> and then <i>BBC Legends</i>.<h2><span class="mw-headline">Unions</span></h2>
      <p>Union membership is a private matter between staff and their chosen union: staff are not automatically covered by a union, but since the BBC is a large employer (in the media sector), membership numbers are considerable.<p>Staff at the BBC are normally represented by <!--del_lnk--> BECTU, along with journalistic staff by the <!--del_lnk--> NUJ and electrical staff by <!--del_lnk--> Amicus. Union membership is optional, and paid for by staff members and not by the BBC.<p><a id="Cultural_significance" name="Cultural_significance"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Cultural significance</span></h2>
      <p>The BBC was the only television broadcaster in the United Kingdom until 1955 and the only legal radio broadcaster until 1973. Its cultural impact was therefore significant since the country had no choice for its information and entertainment from these two powerful media.<p>Even after the advent of commercial television and radio, the BBC has remained one of the main elements in British in popular culture through its obligation to produce TV and radio programmes for the mass audiences. However the arrival of BBC2 allowed the BBC also to make programmes for minority interests in drama, documentaries, current affairs, entertainment and sport. Examples are cited such as <i><!--del_lnk--> I, Claudius</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Civilisation</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Tonight</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Monty Python&#39;s Flying Circus</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Pot Black</i>, but there many other ground-breaking examples can be given in each of these fields as shown by the BBC&#39;s entries in the <!--del_lnk--> British Film Institute&#39;s 2000 list of the <!--del_lnk--> 100 Greatest British Television Programmes. In radio the BBC has also maintained a high standard of news, drama, entertainment, documentaries, sport and music for all tastes, and still draws large audiences, while also serving minority tastes.<p>The BBC&#39;s objective of providing a service to the public, rather than just entertainment, has changed the public&#39;s perception in a wide range of subjects from health to natural history. By maintaining a high standard the BBC also defined a quality threshold that the commercial companies had to reach to retain their licences but the advent of the multi-channel age is lessening this effect. The export of BBC programmes, the <!--del_lnk--> BBC World Service and <!--del_lnk--> BBC World have meant that the cultural impact of the BBC has been also experienced world-wide.<p>Although the BBC has changed society, the society has also changed the BBC. The term <!--del_lnk--> BBC English (Received Pronunciation) refers to the former use of <!--del_lnk--> Standard English with this accent. However the organisation now makes more use of <!--del_lnk--> regional accents in order to reflect the diversity of the UK, though clarity and fluency are still expected of presenters.

Many popular everyday sayings are derived from BBC-produced television shows.<p><a id="Criticism" name="Criticism"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Criticism</span></h2>
