      <p><b>Bryce Canyon National Park</b> is a <!--del_lnk--> national park located in southwestern <!--del_lnk--> Utah in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. Contained within the park is <b>Bryce Canyon</b>. Despite its name, this is not actually a <!--del_lnk--> canyon, but rather a giant natural <!--del_lnk--> amphitheater created by <!--del_lnk--> erosion along the eastern side of the <!--del_lnk--> Paunsaugunt Plateau. Bryce is distinctive due to its unique <a href="../../wp/g/Geology.htm" title="Geology">geological</a> structures, called <i><!--del_lnk--> hoodoos</i>, formed from wind, water, and ice erosion of the river and lakebed <!--del_lnk--> sedimentary rocks. The red, orange and white colors of the <!--del_lnk--> rocks provide spectacular views.<p>Bryce is at a much higher elevation than nearby <a href="../../wp/z/Zion_National_Park.htm" title="Zion National Park">Zion National Park</a> and the <a href="../../wp/g/Grand_Canyon.htm" title="Grand Canyon">Grand Canyon</a>. The rim at Bryce varies from 8,000 to 9,000 feet (2400 to 2700 m), whereas the south rim of the Grand Canyon sits at 7,000 feet (2100 m) above <!--del_lnk--> sea level. The area therefore has a very different <a href="../../wp/e/Ecology.htm" title="Ecology">ecology</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Climate.htm" title="Climate">climate</a>, and thus offers a contrast for visitors to the region (who often visit all three parks in a single vacation).<p>The canyon area was settled by <a href="../../wp/m/Mormon.htm" title="Mormon">Mormon</a> pioneers in the 1850s and was named after <!--del_lnk--> Ebenezer Bryce, who homesteaded in the area in 1875. The area around Bryce Canyon became a United States national monument in 1924 and was designated as a national park in 1928. The park covers 56 mi&sup2; (145 km&sup2;). The park receives relatively few visitors compared to Zion Canyon and the Grand Canyon, largely due to its remote location. The town of <!--del_lnk--> Kanab, Utah is situated at a central point between these three parks.<p>The national park also lends its name to <!--del_lnk--> Bryce, the 3D modeling software which specialises in rendering this kind of rugged landscape.<p>

      <p>Bryce Canyon National Park is located in southern <!--del_lnk--> Utah about 50 miles (80 km) northeast and 1000 feet (300 m) higher than <a href="../../wp/z/Zion_National_Park.htm" title="Zion National Park">Zion National Park</a>. The <a href="../../wp/w/Weather.htm" title="Weather">weather</a> in Bryce Canyon is therefore cooler and the park receives more <!--del_lnk--> precipitation. A nearby example very similar to Bryce Canyon but at a higher elevation is in <!--del_lnk--> Cedar Breaks National Monument.<p>The national park lies within the <!--del_lnk--> Colorado Plateau geographic <!--del_lnk--> province of <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a> and straddles the southeastern edge of the Paunsagunt Plateau west of the Paunsagunt Fault (<i>Paunsagunt</i> is Paiute for &quot;home of the <a href="../../wp/b/Beaver.htm" title="Beaver">beaver</a>&quot;). Park visitors arrive from the plateau part of the park and look over the plateau&#39;s edge toward a valley containing the fault and the <!--del_lnk--> Paria River just beyond it (<i>Paria</i> is Paiute for &quot;muddy or elk water&quot;). The edge of the <!--del_lnk--> Kaiparowitz Plateau bounds the opposite side of the valley.<p>Bryce Canyon was not formed from <!--del_lnk--> erosion initiated from a central <!--del_lnk--> stream, meaning it technically is not a <!--del_lnk--> canyon. Instead <!--del_lnk--> headward erosion has excavated large <!--del_lnk--> amphitheater-shaped features in the <!--del_lnk--> Cenozoic-aged rocks of the Paunsagunt Plateau. This erosion exposed delicate and colorful pinnacles called <!--del_lnk--> hoodoos that are up to 200 feet (60 m) high. A series of amphitheaters extend more than 20 miles (30 km) within the park. The largest is <!--del_lnk--> Bryce Amphitheater, which is 12 miles long (19 km), 3 miles wide (5 km) and 800 feet deep (240 m).<p>The highest part of the park at 9,105 feet (2,775 m), <!--del_lnk--> Rainbow Point, is at the end of this scenic drive. From there <!--del_lnk--> Aquarius Plateau, Bryce Amphitheater, <!--del_lnk--> Henry Mountains, the <!--del_lnk--> Vermilion Cliffs, and the <!--del_lnk--> White Cliffs can be seen. Cope Canyon, where it exits the park in the north-east section is the lowest part of the park at 6,600 feet (2,011 m).<p><a id="Human_history" name="Human_history"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Human history</span></h2>

      <p>Little is known about early <a href="../../wp/h/Human.htm" title="Human">human</a> habitation in the Bryce Canyon area. Archaeological surveys of Bryce Canyon National Park and the <!--del_lnk--> Paunsaugunt Plateau show that people have been in the area for at least 10,000 years. Several-thousand-year-old <!--del_lnk--> Basketmaker-period <!--del_lnk--> Anasazi artifacts have been found south of the park. Other artifacts from the <!--del_lnk--> Pueblo-period Anasazi and the <!--del_lnk--> Fremont culture (up to the mid-12th century) have also been found.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Paiute Indians moved into the surrounding valleys and plateaus in the area around the same time that the other cultures left. These <!--del_lnk--> Native Americans hunted and gathered for most of their food but also supplemented their diet with some cultivated products. The Paiute in the area developed a <a href="../../wp/m/Mythology.htm" title="Mythology">mythology</a> surrounding the hoodoos (pinnacles) in Bryce Canyon. They believed that hoodoos were the Legend People whom the trickster <!--del_lnk--> Coyote turned to stone. At least one older Paiute said his culture called the hoodoos <i>Anka-ku-wass-a-wits</i>, which is <!--del_lnk--> Paiute for &quot;red painted faces&quot;.<p><a id="White_exploration_and_settlement" name="White_exploration_and_settlement"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">White exploration and settlement</span></h3>
      <p>It was not until the late 18th and the early 19th century that the first <!--del_lnk--> Caucasians explored the remote and hard to reach area. <a href="../../wp/m/Mormon.htm" title="Mormon">Mormon</a> scouts visited the area in the 1850s to gauge its potential for <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agricultural</a> development, use for <!--del_lnk--> grazing, and settlement.<p>The first major scientific expedition to the area was led by U.S. Army Major <!--del_lnk--> John Wesley Powell in 1872. Powell, along with a team of mapmakers and geologists, surveyed the Sevier and Virgin River area as part of a larger survey of the <!--del_lnk--> Colorado Plateaus. His mapmakers kept many of the Paiute place names.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Small groups of Mormon pioneers followed and attempted to settle east of Bryce Canyon along the <!--del_lnk--> Paria River. In 1873 the <!--del_lnk--> Kanarra Cattle Company started to use the area for <a href="../../wp/c/Cattle.htm" title="Cattle">cattle</a> grazing.<p><!--del_lnk--> The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sent <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> immigrant Ebenezer Bryce and his wife Mary to settle land in the Paria Valley because they thought Ebenezer&#39;s carpentry skills would be useful in the area. The Bryce family chose to live right below Bryce Canyon Amphitheater. Bryce grazed his cattle inside what are now park borders and reputedly thought that the amphitheaters were a &quot;helluva place to lose a cow.&quot; He also built a road to the plateau to retrieve firewood and timber and a <a href="../../wp/c/Canal.htm" title="Canal">canal</a> to irrigate his crops and water his <a href="../../wp/a/Animal.htm" title="Animal">animals</a>. Other settlers soon started to call the unusual place &quot;Bryce&#39;s canyon&quot;, which was later formalized into Bryce Canyon.<p>A combination of <a href="../../wp/d/Drought.htm" title="Drought">drought</a>, <!--del_lnk--> overgrazing, and <a href="../../wp/f/Flood.htm" title="Flood">flooding</a> eventually drove the remaining Paiutes from the area and prompted the settlers to attempt construction of a water diversion channel from the <!--del_lnk--> Sevier River drainage. When that effort failed most of the settlers, including the Bryce family, left the area. Bryce moved his family to <!--del_lnk--> Arizona in 1880. The remaining settlers did manage to dig a 10 mile (16 km) long ditch from the Sevier&#39;s east fork into Tropic Valley.<p><a id="Creation_of_the_park" name="Creation_of_the_park"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Creation of the park</span></h3>

      <p>People like Forest Supervisor <!--del_lnk--> J.W. Humphrey promoted the scenic wonders of Bryce Canyon&#39;s amphitheaters, and by 1918 nationally distributed articles also helped to spark interest. However, poor access to the remote area and the lack of accommodations kept visitation to a bare minimum.<p><!--del_lnk--> Ruby Syrett, <!--del_lnk--> Harold Bowman, and the Perry brothers later built modest lodging and set up &quot;touring services&quot; in the area. Syrett later served as the first <!--del_lnk--> postmaster of Bryce Canyon. Visitation steadily increased, and by the early 1920s the <!--del_lnk--> Union Pacific Railroad became interested in expanding <a href="../../wp/r/Rail_transport.htm" title="Rail transport">rail</a> service into southwestern Utah to accommodate more tourists.<p>At the same time, <!--del_lnk--> conservationists became alarmed by the damage <!--del_lnk--> overgrazing and <!--del_lnk--> logging on the plateau along with unregulated visitation were having on the fragile features of Bryce Canyon. A movement to have the area protected was soon started, and <!--del_lnk--> National Park Service Director <!--del_lnk--> Stephen Mather responded by proposing that Bryce Canyon be made into a state park. The <!--del_lnk--> governor of Utah and the <!--del_lnk--> Utah Legislature, however, lobbied for national protection of the area. Mather relented and sent his recommendation to President <a href="../../wp/w/Warren_G._Harding.htm" title="Warren G. Harding">Warren G. Harding</a>, who on <!--del_lnk--> June 8, <!--del_lnk--> 1923, declared Bryce Canyon National Monument into existence.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>A road was built the same year on the plateau to provide easy access to outlooks over the amphitheaters. From 1924 to 1925, <!--del_lnk--> Bryce Canyon Lodge was built from local timber and stone.<p>In 1924, members of <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Congress decided to start work on upgrading Bryce Canyon&#39;s protection status from a <!--del_lnk--> U.S. National Monument to a <!--del_lnk--> National Park to establish Utah National Park. A process of transferring ownership of private and state-held land in the monument to the federal government started, the <!--del_lnk--> Utah Parks Company negotiating much of the transfer. The last of the land in the proposed park&#39;s borders was sold to the federal government four years later, and on <!--del_lnk--> February 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1928, the renamed Bryce Canyon National Park was established.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In 1931, President <a href="../../wp/h/Herbert_Hoover.htm" title="Herbert Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a> annexed an adjoining area south of the park, and in 1942 an additional 635 acres (2.57 km&sup2;) was added. This brought the park&#39;s total area to the current figure of 35,835 acres (145.02 km&sup2;). Rim Road, the scenic drive that is still used today, was completed in 1934 by the <!--del_lnk--> Civilian Conservation Corps. Administration of the park was conducted from neighboring <!--del_lnk--> Zion Canyon National Park until 1956, when Bryce Canyon&#39;s first superintendent started work.<p><a id="More_recent_history" name="More_recent_history"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">More recent history</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> USS <i>Bryce Canyon</i> was named for the park and served as a supply and repair ship in the U.S. Pacific Fleet from <!--del_lnk--> March 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1947, to <!--del_lnk--> June 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1981. She was the only ship in the <!--del_lnk--> United States Navy to be decorated with the Gold E, having won five consecutive efficiency awards.<p><b><!--del_lnk--> Bryce Canyon Natural History Association (BCNHA)</b> was established in 1961. It runs the bookstore inside the park visitor centre and is a non-profit organization created to aid the interpretive, educational and scientific activities of the National Park Service, at Bryce Canyon National Park. A portion of the profits from all bookstore sales are donated to public land units. Since BCNHA&#39;s inception in 1961, donations have exceeded $3.5 million.<p>Responding to increased visitation and <!--del_lnk--> traffic congestion, the <!--del_lnk--> National Park Service implemented a voluntary, <a href="../../wp/s/Summer.htm" title="Summer">summer</a>-only, in-park shuttle system in June 2000. In 2004, reconstruction began on the aging and inadequate road system in the park.<p><a id="Geology" name="Geology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geology</span></h2>

      <p>The Bryce Canyon area shows a record of deposition that spans from the last part of the <a href="../../wp/c/Cretaceous.htm" title="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> period and the first half of the <!--del_lnk--> Cenozoic era. The ancient depositional environment of region around what is now the park varied:<ul>
       <li>The <!--del_lnk--> Dakota Sandstone and the <!--del_lnk--> Tropic Shale were deposited in the warm, shallow waters of the advancing and retreating <!--del_lnk--> Cretaceous Seaway (outcrops of these rocks are found just outside park borders).<li>The colorful <!--del_lnk--> Claron Formation that the park&#39;s delicate <!--del_lnk--> hoodoos are carved from was laid down as sediments in a system of cool <!--del_lnk--> streams and <!--del_lnk--> lakes that existed from 63 to about 40 million years ago (from the <a href="../../wp/p/Paleocene.htm" title="Paleocene">Paleocene</a> to the <a href="../../wp/e/Eocene.htm" title="Eocene">Eocene</a> epochs). Different sediment types were laid down as the lakes deepened and became shallow and as the shoreline and <!--del_lnk--> river deltas migrated.</ul>
      <p>Several other formations were also created but were mostly <!--del_lnk--> eroded away following two major periods of uplift:<ul>
       <li>The <!--del_lnk--> Laramide orogeny affected the entire western part of what would become <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a> starting about 70 million years ago and lasting for many millions of years after. This event helped to build the ancestral <a href="../../wp/r/Rocky_Mountains.htm" title="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> and in the process closed the Cretaceous Seaway. The Straight Cliffs, Wahweap, and Kaiparowits formations were victims of this uplift.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Colorado Plateaus were uplifted 10 to 15 million years ago and were segmented into different <!--del_lnk--> plateaus &mdash; each separated from its neighbors by <!--del_lnk--> faults and each having its own uplift rate. The <!--del_lnk--> Boat Mesa Conglomerate and the <!--del_lnk--> Sevier River Formation were removed following this uplift.</ul>

      <p>Vertical joints were created by this uplift, which were eventually (and still are) preferentially eroded. The easily eroded Pink Cliffs of the Claron Formation respond by forming freestanding pinnacles in <!--del_lnk--> badlands called hoodoos, while the more resistant White Cliffs formed monoliths. The pink colour is from <!--del_lnk--> iron oxide and <a href="../../wp/m/Manganese.htm" title="Manganese">manganese</a>. Also created were arches, <!--del_lnk--> natural bridges, walls, and windows. Hoodoos are composed of soft sedimentary rock and are topped by a piece of harder, less easily eroded stone that protects the column from the elements. Bryce Canyon has one of the highest concentrations of hoodoos of any place on <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a>.<p>The formations exposed in the area of the park are part of the <!--del_lnk--> Grand Staircase.

      <p>More than 10 miles (16 km) of marked but ungroomed <a href="../../wp/s/Skiing.htm" title="Skiing">skiing</a> trails are available off of Fairyland, Paria, and Rim trails in the park. Twenty miles of connecting groomed ski trails are in nearby <!--del_lnk--> Dixie National Forest and <!--del_lnk--> Ruby&#39;s Inn.<p>The air in the area is so clear that on most days from Yovimpa and Rainbow points, <!--del_lnk--> Navajo Mountain and the Kaibab Plateau can be seen 90 miles (140 km) away in <!--del_lnk--> Arizona. On a really clear day the Black Mesas of eastern Arizona and western <!--del_lnk--> New Mexico can be seen some 200 miles (320 km) away. The park also has a 7.3 magnitude night sky, making it the one of the darkest in <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>. Stargazers can therefore see 7500 <a href="../../wp/s/Star.htm" title="Star">stars</a> with the naked <a href="../../wp/e/Eye.htm" title="Eye">eye</a>, while in most places fewer than 2000 can be seen due to <!--del_lnk--> light pollution (in many large cities only a few dozen can be seen). Park rangers host several public stargazing events and evening programs on astronomy, nocturnal animals, and night sky protection. The Bryce Canyon Astronomy Festival, typically held in June, attracts thousands of visitors.<p>There are two campgrounds in the park, North Campground and Sunset Campground. Loop A in North Campground is open year-round. Additional loops and Sunset Campground are open from late spring to early autumn.
