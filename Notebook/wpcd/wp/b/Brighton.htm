      <p><b>Brighton</b> is located on the south coast of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, and together with its immediate neighbour <!--del_lnk--> Hove forms the <a href="../../wp/c/City.htm" title="City">city</a> of <!--del_lnk--> Brighton and Hove. Brighton is one of the largest and most famous <!--del_lnk--> seaside resorts in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>.<p>With origins dating before <a href="../../wp/d/Domesday_Book.htm" title="Domesday Book">Domesday</a>, the ancient settlement of <i>Brighthelmston</i> emerged as an important health resort during the 18th century and a popular destination for <!--del_lnk--> day-trippers after the arrival of the <!--del_lnk--> railway in 1841. Brighton experienced rapid population growth reaching a peak of over 160,000 by 1961. Modern Brighton forms the part of a significant <!--del_lnk--> conurbation stretching along the coast West to <!--del_lnk--> Littlehampton, stretching to the east of Brighton, encompassing smaller, less built up areas like <!--del_lnk--> Rottingdean and <!--del_lnk--> Saltdean with a population of around 480,000.<p>Brighton is a popular tourist resort with numerous hotels, restaurants and entertainment facilities which additionally serve a substantial <!--del_lnk--> business conference industry. The modern city of Brighton &amp; Hove is also an important educational centre with two <a href="../../wp/u/University.htm" title="University">universities</a> and many <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English language</a> schools.<p>

      <p>In the <a href="../../wp/d/Domesday_Book.htm" title="Domesday Book">Domesday Book</a>, Brighton was called <i>Bristelmestune</i> and a rent of 4,000 <!--del_lnk--> herring was established. In June 1514 <i>Brighthelmstone</i> was burnt to the ground by French raiders during a war between England and <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>. Only part of <!--del_lnk--> St. Nicholas&#39;s Church and the street pattern of what is now <i>The Lanes</i> survived the attack. The first known drawing of <i>Brighthelmstone</i> was made in 1545 and depicts what is believed to be the raid of 1514.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>During the 1740s and 1750s <!--del_lnk--> Dr Richard Russell of <!--del_lnk--> Lewes began prescribing the medicinal use of the <a href="../../wp/s/Seawater.htm" title="Seawater">seawater</a> at Brighton to his patients. By 1780, development of the <!--del_lnk--> Regency terraces had started and the fishing village quickly became the fashionable <!--del_lnk--> resort of Brighton. The growth of the town was further encouraged following the patronage of the Prince Regent (later <a href="../../wp/g/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="George IV of the United Kingdom">King George IV</a>) after his first visit in 1783. He spent much of his leisure time in the town and constructed the exotic and expensive <!--del_lnk--> Royal Pavilion during the early part of his <!--del_lnk--> Regency.<p>The arrival of the <!--del_lnk--> railway in 1841 brought Brighton within the reach of day-trippers from <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> and rapid population growth from around 7,000 in 1801 to over 120,000 by 1901. The <!--del_lnk--> Victorian era saw the building of many of the famous landmarks in Brighton including the <!--del_lnk--> Grand Hotel (1864), the <!--del_lnk--> West Pier (1866) and the <!--del_lnk--> Palace Pier (1899).<p>After a number of boundary changes made between 1873 and 1952, the land area of Brighton had increased significantly from 1,640 acres in 1854 to 14,347 acres in 1952. New housing estates were established in the acquired areas including <!--del_lnk--> Moulsecoomb, <!--del_lnk--> Bevendean, <!--del_lnk--> Coldean and <!--del_lnk--> Whitehawk. Closer to the centre of town, a major <!--del_lnk--> slum-clearance development was initiated in the Hanover area. The replacement <!--del_lnk--> council housing, including Tarnerland near Richmond Street, stretches from the bottom of Albion Hill to the tower blocks at Mount Pleasant, and radically changed the local street layout.<p>More recently, <!--del_lnk--> gentrification of much of Brighton has seen a return of the highly fashionable image which had characterised the growth of the Regency period. Recent housing developments in the <!--del_lnk--> North Laine, for instance, have been kept in keeping with the local make up of the area.<p>In 1997 Brighton and Hove were joined together to form the <!--del_lnk--> unitary authority of <!--del_lnk--> Brighton and Hove, which in turn was granted <a href="../../wp/c/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="City status in the United Kingdom">city status</a> by <a href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Queen Elizabeth II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> as part of the <!--del_lnk--> millennium celebrations in 2000.<p><a id="Landmarks" name="Landmarks"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Landmarks</span></h2>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Royal Pavilion is a former Royal palace built as the home for the Prince Regent during the early 1800s and is notable for its Indian architecture and Oriental interior design. The building and surrounding grounds were purchased by the town in 1849 for &pound;53,000.<p><!--del_lnk--> Brighton Pier (or the <i>Palace Pier</i>) was opened in 1899 and is the largest pier in Brighton. It features a large <!--del_lnk--> funfair, restaurants and arcade halls.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> West Pier was built in 1866 and has been closed since 1975 awaiting renovation. The West Pier was one of only two Grade I <!--del_lnk--> listed piers in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> until the pier burnt down in 2003. Plans for erecting a new landmark in its place &ndash; the <!--del_lnk--> i360, a 183m observation tower designed by <!--del_lnk--> London Eye architects Marks Barfield &ndash; were announced in June 2006. Plans were approved by the City council on <!--del_lnk--> 11 October <!--del_lnk--> 2006. <p>Created in 1883, <!--del_lnk--> Volk&#39;s Electric Railway runs along the inland edge of the beach from the Palace Pier to Black Rock.

      <p>A major tourist attraction is the pebble beach, which has a variety of bars, restaurants, night clubs and amusement arcades. Together with the attractions further inland, these contribute to Brighton being sometimes erroneously referred to as &quot;London-by-the-sea&quot;; it certainly offers one of the most accessible tourist beaches from London.<p>Brighton beach has a designated official <!--del_lnk--> nudist area (south of the easterly part of Kemptown). This is unusual in that very few naturist beaches in the United Kingdom are located within urban areas.<p>Since the 1978 demolition of the open-air swimming lido at Black Rock, the most easterly part of Brighton&#39;s seafront, the area has been developed considerably and now features one of Europe&#39;s largest <!--del_lnk--> marinas. However, the site of the pool itself remains empty except for a skate park and graffiti wall, and further development is planned for the area including a high-rise hotel which has aroused public and media debate, mirroring the situation with proposals for the site of the King Alfred leisure centre nearby in Hove.<div class="thumb tright">

Partly characterised by a collection of narrow alleyways following the street pattern of the original fishing-based settlement, the resident businesses in The Lanes are predominantly jewellers, antique shops, restaurants and pubs.<p>Churchill Square is an indoor <!--del_lnk--> shopping centre with a floor space of 470,000 sq ft (43,663 m&sup2;) and includes 85 shops, 5 restaurants and 1,600 car parking spaces. It was originally built in the 1960s as an open-air pedestrianised shopping centre, but was completely rebuilt in 1998. Further mainstream retail areas include Western Road and London Road.<p>The <i>North Laine</i> area (a name often confused with <i>The Lanes</i>) is a retail, leisure and residential area situated immediately north of <i>The Lanes</i>. Its name derives from the Anglo-Saxon word &quot;Laine&quot; meaning a type of agricultural plot. The North Laine contains a mix of businesses dominated by caf&eacute;s, <i>avant-garde</i> shops, and theatres. However, its character is gradually changing. Due to property price rises and the expense of local council taxes, many small privately owned businesses are being literally &quot;priced out&quot; of the area and being replaced by larger entertainment chains and leisure companies. To counterbalance this, Orbit housing association and the city council have built some affordable properties in the North Laine for people on low incomes.<p>Brighton has a high density of businesses involved in media in general, particularly digital or &quot;new media&quot; companies, and since the 1990s has sometimes been referred to as &quot;Silicon Beach&quot;; there is even a suite of offices with this name. The new media community in Brighton has been supported by a number of initiatives, in particular <i><!--del_lnk--> Wired Sussex</i> &ndash; a not-for-profit business development agency for over 1,200 digital media companies across the South East of England.<p><!--del_lnk--> American Express has a distinctive (former headquarters) building in Edward Street.<p><a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h2>

      <p>According to a display in Brighton Museum, Brighton has the oldest continuous electricity supply in the world, which commenced in 1882. Other towns had electricity supplies slightly earlier, but these have not been running continuously to the present day. Brighton&#39;s first power station has been listed as the first &quot;large&quot; power station in the world. <p>Brighton&#39;s nearby neighbour, Hove, is seen by some as a more desirable location than Brighton and it is often referred to by locals as &quot;Hove, actually&quot;.
