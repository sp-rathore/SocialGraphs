The organic composition of Barbados is thought to be of non-volcanic origin and is predominantly composed of <!--del_lnk--> limestone-<!--del_lnk--> coral.

      <p>The earliest inhabitants of Barbados were <!--del_lnk--> Amerindian nomads. Three waves of migrants moved north toward <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>. The first wave was of the <!--del_lnk--> Saladoid-<!--del_lnk--> Barrancoid group, who were farmers, fishermen, and ceramists that arrived by <!--del_lnk--> canoe from <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a> (<a href="../../wp/v/Venezuela.htm" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Orinoco Valley) around <!--del_lnk--> 350 CE. The <!--del_lnk--> Arawak people were the second wave of migrants, arriving from South America around <!--del_lnk--> 800 CE. Arawak settlements on the island include <!--del_lnk--> Stroud Point, <!--del_lnk--> Chandler Bay, <!--del_lnk--> Saint Luke&#39;s Gully, and <!--del_lnk--> Mapp&#39;s Cave. According to accounts by descendants of the aboriginal Arawak tribes on other local islands, the original name for Barbados was <b>Ichirouganaim</b>. In the 13th century, the Caribs arrived from South America in the third wave, displacing both the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid. For the next few centuries, the Caribs&mdash;like the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid&mdash;lived in isolation on the island.<p>The name &quot;Barbados&quot; comes from a <!--del_lnk--> Portuguese explorer named Pedro Campos in <!--del_lnk--> 1536, who originally called the island <b>Os Barbados</b> (&quot;The Bearded Ones&quot;) upon seeing the appearance of the island&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> fig trees whose long hanging aerial roots, he thought, resembled beards. Between Campos&#39; sighting in 1536 and 1550, <!--del_lnk--> Spanish <!--del_lnk--> conquistadors seized many Caribs on Barbados and used them as <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slave labour</a> on <!--del_lnk--> plantations. Other Caribs fled the island, moving elsewhere.<p>British sailors who landed on Barbados in the 1620s at the site of present-day <!--del_lnk--> Holetown on the Caribbean coast found the island uninhabited. From the arrival of the first British settlers in <!--del_lnk--> 1627&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 1628 until independence in <!--del_lnk--> 1966, Barbados was under uninterrupted British control. Nevertheless, Barbados always enjoyed a large measure of local autonomy. Its <!--del_lnk--> House of Assembly began meeting in <!--del_lnk--> 1639. Among the initial important British figures was Sir <!--del_lnk--> William Courten.<p>Starting in the 1620s an increasing number of black slaves were brought to the isle. 5000 locals died of fever in 1647, and hundreds of slaves were executed by <!--del_lnk--> Royalist planters during the <!--del_lnk--> English Civil War in the 1640s, as they feared that the ideas of the <!--del_lnk--> Levellers might spread to the slave population if <!--del_lnk--> Parliament took control of Barbados.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Large numbers of <!--del_lnk--> Celtic people, mainly from <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, went to Barbados as <!--del_lnk--> indentured servants. Over the next several centuries the Celtic population was used as a buffer between the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon plantation owners and the larger <!--del_lnk--> African population, variously serving as members of the Colonial militia and playing a strong role as allies of the larger African slave population in a long string of colonial rebellions. As well, in 1659, the English shipped many Irishmen and Scots off to Barbados as slaves. With King James II, and other kings in his dynasty, also sending Scots, and English, off to the isle. For instance in 1685, after the crushing of the Monmouth Rebellion. The modern descendants of this original slave population are sometimes derisively referred to as <!--del_lnk--> Red Legs, or locally &#39;ecky becky&#39; and are some of the poorest inhabitants of modern Barbados. There has also been large scale intermarriage between the African and Celtic populations on the islands. Because the Africans could withstand tropical diseases and the climate much better than the white slave population, and also because those poor whites who had or acquired the means to emigrate often did so, Barbados turned from mainly Celtic in the 17th century to overwhelmingly black by the 20th century.<p>As the <a href="../../wp/s/Sugar.htm" title="Sugar">sugar</a> industry developed into the main commercial enterprise, Barbados was divided into large plantation estates that replaced the small holdings of the early British settlers. Some of the displaced farmers relocated to British colonies in North America, most notably <!--del_lnk--> South Carolina. To work the plantations, West Africans were transported and enslaved on Barbados and other Caribbean islands. The <!--del_lnk--> slave trade ceased in <!--del_lnk--> 1804. Slaves though carried on being oppressed, causing, in <!--del_lnk--> 1816, the major slave rebellion, in the isle&#39;s history. One thousand people died in the revolt for freedom, with 144 slaves executed, and 123 deported, by the king&#39;s army. Eighteen years later slavery was abolished in the British Empire in <!--del_lnk--> 1834. In Barbados and the rest of the British West Indian colonies, full emancipation from slavery was preceded by an apprenticeship period that lasted six years.<p>However, plantation owners and merchants of British descent still dominated local politics, due to the high income qualification required for voters. More than 70% of the population, many of them disenfranchised women, were excluded from the democratic process. It was not until the 1930s that the descendants of emancipated slaves began a movement for political rights. One of the leaders of this movement, Sir <!--del_lnk--> Grantley Adams, founded the <!--del_lnk--> Barbados Labour Party, then known as the <!--del_lnk--> Barbados Progressive League, in <!--del_lnk--> 1938. Though a staunch supporter of the monarchy, Adams and his party demanded more for the poor and for the people. Progress toward a more democratic government in Barbados was made in <!--del_lnk--> 1942, when the exclusive income qualification was lowered and women were given the right to vote. By <!--del_lnk--> 1949 governmental control was wrestled from the planters and, in <!--del_lnk--> 1958, Adams became Premier of Barbados.<p>From <!--del_lnk--> 1958 to <!--del_lnk--> 1962, Barbados was one of the ten members of the <!--del_lnk--> West Indies Federation, an organisation doomed by nationalistic attitude and by the fact that its members, as colonies of Britain, held limited legislative power. Adams&#39; leadership of the Federation (he served as its first and only &quot;Prime Minister&quot;), his failed attempts to form similar unions, and his continued defence of the monarchy demonstrated that he was no longer in touch with the needs of his country. <!--del_lnk--> Errol Walton Barrow, a fervent reformer, was to become the new people&#39;s advocate. Barrow had left the BLP and formed the <!--del_lnk--> Democratic Labour Party as a liberal alternative to Adams&#39; conservative government. To this day, Barrow remains a beloved hero in the eyes of Barbadians, as it was he who instituted many of the reforms and programs currently in place, including free education for all Barbadians, regardless of class or colour, and the School Meals system. By <!--del_lnk--> 1961, Barrow had replaced Adams as Premier and the DLP controlled the government.<p>With the Federation dissolved, Barbados had reverted to its former status, that of a <!--del_lnk--> self-governing colony. The island negotiated its own independence at a constitutional conference with the United Kingdom in June <!--del_lnk--> 1966. After years of peaceful and democratic progress, Barbados finally became an independent state within the <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth of Nations on <!--del_lnk--> November 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1966, with Errol Barrow serving as its first Prime Minister.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>
      <p>Barbados is a <!--del_lnk--> parliamentary democracy. Executive authority is vested in the <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister and <!--del_lnk--> Cabinet, which is collectively responsible to the <!--del_lnk--> Parliament. The Prime Minister is appointed by the <!--del_lnk--> Governor General as the member of the House of Assembly best able to command the support of the majority of the members. The Prime Minister usually selects a cabinet from his party members in the legislature. The present government is proposing that Barbados become a <!--del_lnk--> republic within the <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth of Nations, with a ceremonial <!--del_lnk--> president replacing the <!--del_lnk--> British Sovereign. This issue is still being hotly debated as the island has been governmentally autonomous for decades.<p>Barbados has been an independent state in the Commonwealth since <!--del_lnk--> November 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1966, and as such functions as a parliamentary democracy modelled after the British <!--del_lnk--> Westminster system. Control of the government is held by the Cabinet and is responsible to the Parliament, which comrpises a 30-seat <!--del_lnk--> House of Assembly and a 21-seat <!--del_lnk--> Senate. Barbados is one of the most secure democracies in the Caribbean. <!--del_lnk--> Executive power is in the hands of the <!--del_lnk--> prime minister and his <!--del_lnk--> cabinet. The prime minister is usually the leader of the winning party in the elections for the House of Assembly, whose members are elected every five years. The Senate has 21 members, and its members are appointed by the governor general.<p>Barbados is a full and participating member of the <!--del_lnk--> Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the <!--del_lnk--> Caribbean (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy (CSME), the <!--del_lnk--> Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ) [which currently only pertains to Barbados and <a href="../../wp/g/Guyana.htm" title="Guyana">Guyana</a>, and is expected to replace the UK <!--del_lnk--> Privy Council for the entire English speaking Caribbean eventually], and the <!--del_lnk--> Association of Caribbean States (ACS).<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>Barbados is a relatively flat island, rising gently to the central highland region, the highest point being <!--del_lnk--> Mount Hillaby, in the Scotland district, at 336 <!--del_lnk--> metres (1,100 <!--del_lnk--> ft) above sea level. The island is located in a slightly eccentric position in the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, to the east of the other <!--del_lnk--> Caribbean islands. The <a href="../../wp/c/Climate.htm" title="Climate">climate</a> is tropical, with a rainy season from June to October.<p>Barbados is often spared from the amount of tropical storms and hurricanes during the rainy season due to its far eastern location in the Atlantic Ocean pushing it just outside of the principal <!--del_lnk--> hurricane belt. The island does get brushed or hit about every 3 years and the average number of years between direct hurricane hits is about once every 26.6 years.<p>In the parish of <!--del_lnk--> Saint Michael lies Barbados&#39; capital and chief city <!--del_lnk--> Bridgetown. Locally <!--del_lnk--> Bridgetown is sometimes referred to as &quot;The City,&quot; but the most common reference is simply &quot;Town&quot;.

      <p>Historically, the economy of Barbados had been dependent on <a href="../../wp/s/Sugarcane.htm" title="Sugarcane">sugarcane</a> cultivation and related activities, but production in recent years has been diversified into the <a href="../../wp/m/Manufacturing.htm" title="Manufacturing">manufacturing</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">tourism</a> sectors. Offshore finance and information services have become increasingly important foreign exchange earners, and there is also a healthy interest into the island&#39;s light manufacturing sector. In the last ten years the Government has been seen as business-friendly and economically sound. Since the late 1990s the island has seen an increasing construction boom, the island began to see new hotels, redevelopments, new homes, office complexes, condominiums, and mansions being developed across the island.<p>The government continues its efforts to reduce <!--del_lnk--> unemployment, encourage direct foreign investment, and privatize remaining state-owned enterprises. Unemployment has been reduced from high levels of around 14 percent in the past to under 10 percent currently.<p>The economy contracted in <!--del_lnk--> 2001 and <!--del_lnk--> 2002 due to slowdowns in tourism, consumer spending and the impact of the <a href="../../wp/s/September_11%252C_2001_attacks.htm" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>, but rebounded in <!--del_lnk--> 2003 and has showed growth since <!--del_lnk--> 2004.

      <p>The island of Barbados has a single major <!--del_lnk--> airport, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Sir Grantley Adams International Airport (GAIA)</i> (<!--del_lnk--> IATA identifier <!--del_lnk--> BGI). The <i>Grantley Adams</i> Airport receives daily flights by several major airlines, from points around the globe, as well as several smaller regional commercial airlines and charters. The airport serves as the main air-transportation hub for the Eastern Caribbean. The airport is currently under-going a US$100 million upgrade and expansion.<p>The island is well developed and there are many local quality-hotels known internationally which offer world-class accommodations. Timeshares are available, and many of the smaller local hotels and private villas which dot the island have space available if booked months in advance. The southern and western coasts of Barbados are popular, with its calm light blue Caribbean sea and fine white and pinkish sandy beaches. Along the island&#39;s east coast the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> side are tumbling waves which are perfect for light <!--del_lnk--> surfing, but a little bit risky due to under-tow currents. The &#39;Soup Bowl&#39; near to Bathsheba is a very popular spot with surfers all year round.<p><!--del_lnk--> Shopping districts are another treat in Barbados, with ample duty-free shopping. There is also a festive nightlife available in mainly tourist areas like the Saint Lawrence Gap. Other attractions include wildlife reserves, jewelry stores, <!--del_lnk--> scuba diving, helicopter rides, <!--del_lnk--> golf, <!--del_lnk--> festivals (the largest being the annual crop over festival July/Aug), sight seeing, cave exploration, exotic <!--del_lnk--> drinks and fine <!--del_lnk--> clothes <!--del_lnk--> shopping.<p><a id="Attractions.2C_landmarks_and_points_of_interest" name="Attractions.2C_landmarks_and_points_of_interest"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Attractions, landmarks and points of interest</span></h3>

      <p>Transport on the island is good, with &#39;route taxis&#39;, called &quot;ZR&#39;s&quot; (pronounced &quot;Zed-Rs&quot;), travelling to most points on the island. These small buses can at times be crowded, but will usually take the more scenic routes to destinations. These buses generally depart from the capital <!--del_lnk--> Bridgetown or from <!--del_lnk--> Speightstown in the northern part of the island.<p>Buses are abundant in Barbados. There are three bus systems running seven days a week (though less frequently on Sundays), and a ride on any of them costs $1.50 BDS. The smaller buses from the two privately owned systems (&quot;ZR&#39;s&quot; and &quot;minibuses&quot;) can make change; the larger blue buses from the government-operated Barbados Transport Board system cannot. Most routes require a connection in Bridgetown. However, if you wait long enough, you might find a bus that bypasses the capital and takes you right to your destination. Drivers are generally happy to help you get where you&#39;re going; however, some drivers within the competitive privately owned systems are reluctant to instruct you to use competing services, even if those would be preferable.<p>Competition for patrons extends to the bus terminals (sometimes just a parking lot full of buses); it is normal for the &#39;ZR&#39; bus conductors to attempt to escort you to his vehicle and engage in loud altercations with other drivers and conductors, in competition for your patronage. These altercations, though sometimes dramatic, are less problematic than they usually seem to the unaccustomed.<p>Some hotels also provide visitors with shuttles to points of interest on the island. Hotel shuttles generally leave right outside of the hotel&#39;s lobby. The island also has an abundance of taxis-for-hire, although visitors staying on the island may find this an expensive option. Visitors also have the option of transport by car, presuming that they have a valid driver&#39;s license (issued in their native country.) There are several locally owned and operated vehicle rental agencies in Barbados, however there are no multi-national car rental agencies (e.g. Avis, Europcar, Hertz, etc.).<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>Barbados has a population of about 279,000 and a growth rate of 0.33% (Mid-2005 estimates). Close to 90 percent of all Barbadians (also known colloquially as <i>Bajan</i>) are of <!--del_lnk--> African descent (&quot;Afro-Bajans&quot;), mostly descendants of the <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slave</a> labourers on the sugar plantations. The remainder of the population includes groups of <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europeans</a> (&quot;Anglo-Bajans&quot; / &quot;Euro-Bajans&quot;), Chinese locally known as Bajan-Chiney, Bajan Hindus and Muslims, and an influential Middle Eastern (&quot;Arab-Bajans&quot;) group mainly of <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syrian</a> and <a href="../../wp/l/Lebanon.htm" title="Lebanon">Lebanese</a> descent.<p>Other groups in Barbados include people from the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and <!--del_lnk--> expatriates from <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>.

The term &quot;Bajan&quot;, may have come from a localized pronunciation of the word Barbadian which at times can sound more like &quot;Bar-bajan&quot;. The term Barbadian is used less frequently than is &quot;Bajan&quot;.<p>The largest <!--del_lnk--> Carnival cultural event which takes place in Barbados is the <i>Crop Over Festival</i> as known internationally.<p>As is the case in many of the other Caribbean and Latin American countries, Crop Over is an important event for many people on the island, as well as the thousands of tourists that flock to the island to participate in the annual events.<p>The <i>Crop Over</i> festival which includes various musical competitions, and other traditional activities usually kicks into high gear from the beginning of July, and ends in its entirety with the costumed parade on Kadooment Day, held on the first Monday of August.:<i>See also: <a href="../../wp/m/Music_of_Barbados.htm" title="Music of Barbados">Music of Barbados</a></i><p><a id="Sport" name="Sport"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sport</span></h2>
