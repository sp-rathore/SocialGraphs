<h2>Progress Report on SOS Children’s Village Dassa-Zoum&eacute;, Benin</h2>
<p>The Children&rsquo;s Village in Dassa-Zoum&eacute; is the third SOS Village to be built in Benin.  The construction of the family house, has now been completed.  In total, twelve family houses have been built. The Village opened a few weeks ago, and the first 55 children were welcomed to their new home. In time, the Village will be home to 120 children. The children were welcomed by their new mothers at a party, which the children really enjoyed. </p><p>The Village Director is currently pursuing a more stable supply of electricity from the national board, soon to be finalised.  It is important to SOS Children that we provide our children with a comfortable and safe home. A borehole has been built to supply the Village with clean drinking water, but in time SOS Children&rsquo;s Village Dassa-Zoum&eacute; will be connected to the national water supply. </p><p>All the supplies for the family homes have been bought, although we are still awaiting arrival on four fridges. A bank account for the Village has recently been opened, and lots of trees, grass and flowers will be planted to make SOS Children&rsquo;s Village Dassa-Zoum&eacute; look really pretty.</p><p>63 children are currently registered for schooling now that teaching staff have been selected.  The primary school has seven classrooms including a purpose built classroom for those with special needs, due to open very soon.  All the equipment for the school has been purchased, this includes furniture and computers. The school will provide 210 children with a free education, including children from the local community.  A Kindergarten is also being built for the younger children.</p><p>The Social Centre at Dassa-Zoum&eacute; will be open to members of the local community, and will offer counselling and psychological support, community support and health counselling for families affected by HIV/AIDS.</p>
