      <p>Originally called Bacat&aacute; by the <!--del_lnk--> Mexicas, it was the centre of their civilization before the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish explorers colonized the area, and it sustained a large population. The European settlement was founded in <!--del_lnk--> August 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1538, by <!--del_lnk--> Gonzalo Jim&eacute;nez de Quesada and was named &quot;Santa F&eacute; de Bacat&aacute;&quot; after his birthplace Santa F&eacute; and the local name. &quot;Bacat&aacute;&quot; had become the modern &quot;Bogot&aacute;&quot; by the time it was made the capital of the <!--del_lnk--> Viceroyalty of New Granada, which was then part of the <!--del_lnk--> Viceroyalty of Peru, and the city soon became one of the centers of Spanish colonial power and civilization in South America.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1810-<!--del_lnk--> 11 its citizens revolted against Spanish rule and set up a government of their own, but had to contend with internal divisions and the temporary return to power of Spanish military loyalists, who reassumed control of the city from <!--del_lnk--> 1816 to <!--del_lnk--> 1819, when <a href="../../wp/s/Sim%25C3%25B3n_Bol%25C3%25ADvar.htm" title="Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var">Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var</a> captured it after his victory at <!--del_lnk--> Boyac&aacute;. Bogot&aacute; was then made the capital of <!--del_lnk--> Gran Colombia, a federation combining the territories of modern Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador. When that republic was dissolved into its constituent parts, Bogot&aacute; remained the capital of New Granada, which later became the Republic of Colombia. See <!--del_lnk--> History of Colombia.<p>In 1956, the municipality was joined to other neighboring municipalities forming a &quot;Special District&quot; (<a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_language.htm" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>: <i>Distrito Especial</i>). With the Constitution of 1991, Bogot&aacute; was confirmed as the Capital of Colombia acquiring the name &quot;Santa Fe de Bogot&aacute;&quot;, and changing the category from Special District to &quot;Capital District&quot; (<a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_language.htm" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>: <i>Distrito Capital</i>).<p>In August <!--del_lnk--> 2000 the capital&#39;s name was officially changed back from &quot;Santa F&eacute; de Bogot&aacute;&quot; to the more usual &quot;Bogot&aacute;&quot;.

      <p>The flag originates from the insurgency movement against the colonial authorities, which began on <!--del_lnk--> July 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1810. During this insurgency, the rebels wore armbands with yellow and red bands, as these colours were the ones in the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish flag which was the one used as the flag for the New Kingdom of Granada.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> October 9, <!--del_lnk--> 1952, exactly 142 years after these events, decree 555 of 1952 officially and definitively adopted the patriotic armband as the flag of Bogot&aacute;.<p>The flag itself is divided horizontally in two, the top band is yellow and the bottom band is red. The yellow colour denotes the gold from the earth, as well as the virtues of justice, clemency, benevolence, the so-called &quot;mundane qualities&quot; (defined as nobility, excellence, richness, generosity, splendour, health, steadfastness, joy and prosperity), long life, eternity, power and constancy.

      <p>Some services are public and others are private. The public services include energy, sewer and phones. Energy and sewer bills are stratified based on the location of owner&#39;s residence. Thus, the wealthier sections of society help subsidize the energy bills of the poorer sections of society. Telephone service is provided by both &quot;Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Bogot&aacute;&quot; (ETB), a city-owned company, and &quot;Capitel&quot;, owned by <i>Colombia Telecomunicaciones</i> and &quot;EPM Bogot&aacute;&quot;, owned in turn by the <!--del_lnk--> Medell&iacute;n public services company (<i>Empresas P&uacute;blicas de Medell&iacute;n</i> - EPM) . Coin or card-operated payphones are also available, along with cell phone providers. There are (as of May <!--del_lnk--> 2005) three main operators of wireless phones: <!--del_lnk--> Movistar (owned by Spanish firm <!--del_lnk--> Telef&oacute;nica), <!--del_lnk--> Comcel (owned by <!--del_lnk--> Telmex) and <!--del_lnk--> Ola (co-owned by ETB and EPM).<p>Bogot&aacute; also receives money from exports like flowers and emeralds. In downtown Bogot&aacute;, millions of dollars in domestically produced rough and cut emeralds are bought and sold daily. Other important industries include financial services, especially banking. Bogot&aacute; is headquarters to major commercial banks, and to the Banco de la Rep&uacute;blica, Colombia&#39;s central bank. Bogot&aacute; is also a printing and publishing centre. The city is a major convention destination with many major convention centers: Centro Ferial de Convenciones Corferias, Centro de Convenciones y Eventos Cafam, Centro de Convenciones Gonzalo Jim&eacute;nez De Quezada, among others. Because of its status as site of the country&#39;s capital, it is home to a number of government agencies, which represent another major component of the city&#39;s economy.<p>The city&#39;s industrial base include staples of the Colombian economy such as GM Colmotores, Compa&ntilde;&iacute;a Colombiana Automotriz, and Ecopetrol.<p><a id="Transportation_and_Communications" name="Transportation_and_Communications"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Transportation and Communications</span></h3>

      <p>Bogot&aacute; is a modern city with a modern transportation system. It includes an international <!--del_lnk--> airport, bus lines, taxis, the <!--del_lnk--> TransMilenio bus rapid transit system, and even a train that serves as transportation for the outskirts of the city.<p>Buses are the main means of mass transportation. There are two bus systems: the traditional system and the trasmilenio. The traditional system runs a variety of bus types, operated by several companies on normal streets and avenues:<ul>
       <li><b>bus</b>; large buses.<li><b>buseta</b>; medium size buses.<li><b>microbus</b> or <b>colectivo</b>; vans or minivans.</ul>
      <p>The buses are divided into two categories: &quot;ejecutivo&quot;, which is supposed to be a deluxe service and is not supposed to carry standing passengers, and &quot;corriente&quot; or normal service. Bus fares range, as of March <!--del_lnk--> 2006, from COP 900 to 1250 (US$ .40 aprox.)<p>In addition, Bogot&aacute; has several types of taxis. Yellow taxis (cabs) are by far the most common. People often use them in order to get to their destination faster, although they are more expensive. Bogot&aacute; also has white taxis, used mostly as shuttles by hotels or companies to transport customers.<p><a id="Airports" name="Airports"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Airports</span></h4>
      <p>Bogot&aacute;&#39;s principal airport is <!--del_lnk--> El Dorado International Airport. Several national airlines (<!--del_lnk--> Avianca, <!--del_lnk--> AeroRep&uacute;blica, <!--del_lnk--> AIRES and <!--del_lnk--> SATENA), and international airlines (such as <!--del_lnk--> Iberia, <!--del_lnk--> American Airlines, <!--del_lnk--> Varig, <!--del_lnk--> Copa, <!--del_lnk--> Continental, <!--del_lnk--> Delta, <!--del_lnk--> Air Canada, <!--del_lnk--> Aerogal,<!--del_lnk--> TAME, <!--del_lnk--> TACA) operate from El Dorado. Bogot&aacute;&#39;s airport is one of the largest and most expensive in <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>. Because of its central location in <a href="../../wp/c/Colombia.htm" title="Colombia">Colombia</a> and <!--del_lnk--> America, it is preferred by national land transportation providers, as well as national and international air transportation providers.<p>Currently, a major expansion of El Dorado airport is in the planning stage. This stage will be finished on January 2008.<p><a id="Bus_Terminals" name="Bus_Terminals"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Bus Terminals</span></h4>
      <p>Bogot&aacute; is a hub for national and international bus routes. This terminal serves routes to the majority of cities and towns in Colombia  and is the largest in the country.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> TransMilenio is a <!--del_lnk--> bus rapid transit system, a network combining modern articulated buses that operate on exclusive roads (busways) and smaller buses (feeders) that operate in residential areas, bringing passengers to the main grid. TransMilenio&#39;s main routes are: Caracas Avenue, 80th Street, Avenue of the Americas, Northern Highway (<i>Autopista Norte</i>), Jim&eacute;nez Avenue, and 30th Avenue (also referred to as <i>Norte Quito Sur</i> or <i>N.Q.S.</i> for short). The Suba Avenue routes and the southern leg of the 30th Avenue route were opened in April 2006. The third phase of the system will cover 7th Avenue, 10th Avenue, and 26th Street (or <i>Avenida El Dorado</i>). The system is expected to cover the entire city by 2030.<p>The Transmilenio rapid bus service is extremely cheap, clean and efficient and carries commuters to numerous corners of the city. While the Transmilenio is expansive, there are some main routes that are not yet reached.<p><a id="Security_on_Transmilenio" name="Security_on_Transmilenio"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">Security on Transmilenio</span></h5>
      <p>As in any other highly crowded area, users of TransMilenio must be aware that when riding the system they are exposed to pickpockets. Isolated instances of people getting mugged have been reported as well. Security on buses and in stations is handled by police officers employed by the city. However, most of the time the officers assigned are recently graduated highschool students serving their mandatory year with the armed forces (&#39;Polic&iacute;a Bachiller&#39;). Higher ranking officers are assigned as supervisors and respond when a Polic&iacute;a Bachiller requests assistance.<p><a id="Bike_Paths_Network" name="Bike_Paths_Network"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Bike Paths Network</span></h4>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Bogot&aacute;&#39;s network of bike paths, also called <b>ciclorutas</b>, is one of the most extensive dedicated <!--del_lnk--> bike path networks of any city in the world, with a total extension of 303 km. It extends from the north of the city, 170th Street, to the south, 27th Street, and from <!--del_lnk--> Monserrate on the east, to the <!--del_lnk--> Bogot&aacute; River on the west. The cicloruta was started by the <!--del_lnk--> Antanas Mockus administration (1995-1998), and considerably extended during the administration of Mayor <!--del_lnk--> Enrique Pe&ntilde;alosa.<p>On Sundays, many people ride a popular tourist train with their family. On weekends, the train runs from Bogot&aacute; to Zipaquir&aacute; and Nemoc&oacute;n, towns on the outskirts of Bogot&aacute;.<p>A lack of security on bike paths has caused many would-be riders to search for more traditional means of transportation.<p><a id="Colleges_and_Universities" name="Colleges_and_Universities"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Colleges and Universities</span></h2>
