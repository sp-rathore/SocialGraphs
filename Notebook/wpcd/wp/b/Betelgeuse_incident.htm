      <p><b>The <i>Betelgeuse</i> incident</b>, also known as the <i>Betelgeuse</i> or Whiddy Island disaster, occurred on <!--del_lnk--> 8 January <!--del_lnk--> 1979, at around 1 a.m., when the <!--del_lnk--> oil tanker <i>Betelgeuse</i> exploded in <a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_Ireland.htm" title="Republic of Ireland">Ireland</a> at the offshore jetty of the <!--del_lnk--> Whiddy Island Oil Terminal due to the failure of the ship&#39;s structure during an operation to discharge its cargo of <!--del_lnk--> oil. The tanker was owned by <!--del_lnk--> Total S.A. and the oil terminal was owned and operated by <!--del_lnk--> Gulf Oil.<p>The explosion and resulting fire claimed the lives of 50 people (42 <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> nationals, 7 <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Irish</a> nationals and 1 <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a> national). Only 27 bodies were recovered. A further fatality occurred during the salvage operation with the loss of a <!--del_lnk--> Dutch diver.<p>

      <p>During the 1960s, developments in the pattern of oil transportation indicated that it would soon become most economic to move oil between the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> using <!--del_lnk--> Ultra Large Crude Carrier vessels. These vessels were so large that they would not be able to enter most of the older ports on the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea.htm" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/English_Channel.htm" title="English Channel">English Channel</a> coasts.<p>Accordingly, it was judged appropriate to build a new oil terminal in Europe capable of handling the largest vessels that were planned. The intention was that oil coming from the Middle East would be off-loaded at this terminal and then stored for <!--del_lnk--> transshipment to European refineries using smaller vessels. The closure of the <a href="../../wp/s/Suez_Canal.htm" title="Suez Canal">Suez Canal</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1967 as a result of the <!--del_lnk--> Six-Day War reinforced the viability of this scheme. Oil shipments had to come round the <!--del_lnk--> Cape of Good Hope, thus avoiding the vessel size constraints previously imposed by the canal.<p>In 1966, the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf Oil Corporation identified <!--del_lnk--> Whiddy Island in <!--del_lnk--> Bantry Bay, Ireland, as being the most suitable site for the new terminal. Whiddy Island offered a long, sheltered deep-water anchorage. Furthermore, it was well away from any major population centres and shipping lanes. Construction started in <!--del_lnk--> 1967 and the terminal was completed in <!--del_lnk--> 1969.<p>The onshore facility included a &#39;tank farm&#39; consisting of two tanks for <!--del_lnk--> ballast, two for <!--del_lnk--> bunker fuel oil, one for <!--del_lnk--> diesel oil and twelve <!--del_lnk--> crude oil storage tanks, each capable of holding 81,280 <!--del_lnk--> tonnes, bringing the total capacity to approximately 1.3 million tonnes of oil. The offshore facility was comprised of an island type <!--del_lnk--> berth (known colloquially as the &#39;jetty&#39;) 488 metres (1,600 ft) in length, approximately 396 metres (1,300 ft) from the onshore facility.<p>The construction and operation of the terminal transformed the economy of the Bantry area. In <!--del_lnk--> 1968 the tanker <i>Universe Ireland</i> went into service for Gulf. At 312,000 <!--del_lnk--> dwt this was the largest ship in the world. It was intended to use this vessel mainly to move oil between <a href="../../wp/k/Kuwait.htm" title="Kuwait">Kuwait</a> and Whiddy Island. It was the first of six such tankers planned for use by the company.<p>The terminal was very successful for the first five years of operation, but then events began to move against it. The Suez Canal reopened and the economics of ULCCs began to appear less satisfactory than had originally been anticipated. Shipping goods in the form of infrequent but very large loads involves engaging more idle capital in the form of stock than the alternatives. Also, the process of transshipment is costly. The whole economic basis of the Whiddy terminal was incompatible with the &#39;<!--del_lnk--> just-in-time&#39; approach to industrial management which was being widely adopted at the time. That apart, the late <!--del_lnk--> 1970s saw a levelling-off in demand for oil as the result of both economic recession and a rise in the price of oil. All these circumstances caused a fall in the utilisation of the terminal to a level below that which had been planned for. Thus, by the late 1970s, the local Gulf operating company (Gulf Oil Terminals (Ireland) Ltd) was struggling to maintain the viability of the terminal. The company had been forced to undertake a number of cost saving measures.<p><a id="The_incident" name="The_incident"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The incident</span></h2>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> 24 November <!--del_lnk--> 1978, the <i>Betelgeuse</i> left <!--del_lnk--> Ras Tanura in the <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Gulf.htm" title="Persian Gulf">Persian Gulf</a> bound for <!--del_lnk--> Leixoes, <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portugal</a> with a full cargo of crude oil. Built in 1968, by <!--del_lnk--> Chantiers de l&#39;Atlantique, in <!--del_lnk--> Saint-Nazaire, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, the 121,432 dwt vessel was registered by <!--del_lnk--> Total S.A. at <!--del_lnk--> Le Havre, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>.<p>Originally the <i>Betelgeuse</i> was to call at <!--del_lnk--> Sines, <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>, to lighten ship, but poor weather conditions prevented the vessel from entering the harbour. Plans were further frustrated at <!--del_lnk--> Leixoes, where a ship had grounded across the entrance to the harbour, preventing the <i>Betelgeuse</i> from berthing there to discharge her cargo. The <i>Betelgeuse</i> was then instructed to sail to <!--del_lnk--> Whiddy Island, <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>.<p>The <i>Betelgeuse</i> first put in at <!--del_lnk--> Vigo, <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> to change some of her crew, and then sailed for <!--del_lnk--> Whiddy Island on <!--del_lnk--> 30 December <!--del_lnk--> 1978. During the passage the vessel encountered heavy weather in the <!--del_lnk--> Bay of Biscay and after reporting a leakage of oil was instructed to head towards <!--del_lnk--> Brest, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> at reduced speed. However, the origin of the leak was discovered and stopped. The vessel proceeded on its original planned course, arriving in <!--del_lnk--> Bantry Bay on <!--del_lnk--> 4 January <!--del_lnk--> 1979.<p>By 8 p.m. on <!--del_lnk--> 6 January <!--del_lnk--> 1979, the <i>Betelgeuse</i> had completed berthing at the offshore jetty. At 11:30 p.m. the same day, the vessel commenced discharging its 114,000 <!--del_lnk--> tonnes of mixed Arabian <!--del_lnk--> crude oil, which was expected to take about 36 hours. A number of the crew went ashore while this was in progress and the wife of one of the officers joined her husband on the vessel.<p>At about 1 a.m. (evidence on the precise time conflicts) on Monday, <!--del_lnk--> 8 January, a rumbling/cracking noise was heard from the vessel, followed shortly by a huge explosion within its hull. The force of the explosion was seen to blow men from the jetty into the sea. Local residents reported seeing the <i>Betelgeuse</i> engulfed in a ball of fire a few moments later. A series of further explosions followed which broke the vessel in half. Much of the oil cargo still on board ignited and this generated temperatures estimated to exceed 1,000 &deg;C. The concrete unloading jetty crumbled and firefighters, arriving on the scene from several neighbouring towns, were unable to get near the vessel. The firefighters concentrated their efforts on preventing the fire from spreading to the tanks of the storage farm and containing the oil spillage. Local families living on the island fled for their lives.<p>After a few hours the <i>Betelgeuse</i> sank at her moorings in 30 metres of water, which largely extinguished the main body of the fire. In spite of this, rescue workers were not able to approach the wreck (some of which was still above water) for two weeks due to clouds of toxic and inflammable gas surrounding it. After two weeks, it was possible to start recovering bodies from the wreck and pumping off the remains of the oil cargo that was still on board.<p><a id="The_aftermath" name="The_aftermath"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The aftermath</span></h2>
      <p>What became known variously as &#39;the <i>Betelgeuse</i> incident&#39;, &#39;the <i>Betelgeuse</i> disaster&#39; or &#39;the Whiddy Island disaster&#39; was the worst maritime disaster in Irish history. (Gulf and Total executives commonly referred to &#39;the <i>Betelgeuse</i> incident&#39;). Military and civilian personnel were mobilised from all over <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> to deal with it. The incident was the subject of agonised debate in the <!--del_lnk--> D&aacute;il. One <!--del_lnk--> TD noted that there had been earlier incidents at the Whiddy Island terminal and questioned whether Gulf&#39;s status as a major employer had made the authorities reluctant to enforce a rigorous inspection regime.<p>The Irish government appointed a Tribunal to investigate the incident, presided over by Justice Declan Costello. This Tribunal took a year to hear evidence and prepare a 480 page report. The report indicated three main factors that had contributed to the incident. These were:<ol>
       <li>The poor condition of the <i>Betelgeuse</i> for which its operator, <!--del_lnk--> Total S.A., was to blame. Immediately before the incident, the vessel&#39;s hull and tanks were cracked, corroded and leaking. The 11 year old vessel had been worked hard and was at the end of its service life.<li>Incorrect unloading sequences and ballasting which resulted in the buoyancy of the hull becoming uneven and the hull therefore strained. Lack of crew training was the probable explanation. Total was held largely to blame for this. However, given that all the personnel involved in the unloading had died in the explosion, it was difficult to be certain as to what had happened.<li>Inadequate and poorly maintained fire fighting systems both on the vessel and on the jetty. Gulf and Total were held jointly to blame for this. A combination of human failings and financial constraints were the immediate causes.</ol>
      <p>It was determined that a faulty unloading operation had unbalanced the vessel, causing it to break its back and thereby rupturing several empty tanks. Vapour from the ruptured tanks had escaped into the vessel and exploded in a fireball. All the crew on board the ship at the time of the incident (41 in total) are believed to have died, although not all the bodies were found. In addition, one visitor to the ship (an officer&#39;s wife) and eight terminal workers were killed. Initial efforts to contain the fire were hampered by a lack of organisation and poorly maintained fire fighting equipment at the terminal. The Bantry fire brigade spent some time waiting at the town pier for a launch to take them onto the island. The terminal&#39;s own fire engine would not start. Firefighters had to break into the terminal&#39;s main depot in order to access equipment (much of which did not work) and materials.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>There was some controversy over the exact timing of events and the response of the terminal management to the disaster as it unfolded. Some local residents claimed that there was anything up to 5 minutes between the audible structural failure of the vessel and the time at which the initial explosion happened. If this were so, the opportunity to attempt an evacuation had been missed. But the terminal management insisted that the explosion had almost immediately followed the structural failure. However, all concerned praised the initiative and courage of the firefighters and rescue workers.<p>A Dutch salvage firm, L Smit &amp; Co, raised the <i>Betelgeuse</i> in four sections. The first section (the bow) was towed out to open water, 100 miles offshore, and scuttled. This measure attracted protests from the fishing community, so two further sections were sealed up and towed to breaking yards in Spain for disposal. A fourth section was broken up locally. During the salvage operation the life of a diver was lost. The last section was not removed until July 1980. Local fishing grounds were badly contaminated and a clean-up was not finally complete until 1983.<p>The costs of salvage, clean-up and compensation are believed to have totalled around US$120 millions. That included compensation paid by Total to Gulf. Most of the relevant costs were paid by insurance companies and all the various claims and counter-claims were eventually settled out of court. Gulf never reopened the terminal and a feasibility study in 1985 showed that it no longer had any potential use in international oil trade. In 1986 Gulf surrendered its lease on the site to the Irish government. The government used the terminal (after carrying out a limited refurbishment) to hold its strategic oil reserve, with loading and unloading carried out via a buoy. The terminal&#39;s main jetty was not rebuilt.<p>A number of memorial services have been held to commemorate anniversaries of the incident. The most recent of these was on the 25th anniversary in January 2004. Relatives of the victims joined with local residents in a special service held at St Finbarr&rsquo;s Church in <!--del_lnk--> Bantry. A memorial sculpture, incorporating the ship&#39;s bell which was recovered from the wreck, has been erected in the hillside graveyard overlooking the harbour. The bodies of two unidentified casualties from the incident are interred nearby.<p>
