      <p><b>Baltimore</b> is an <!--del_lnk--> independent city located in the <a href="../../wp/u/U.S._state.htm" title="U.S. state">U.S. state</a> of <!--del_lnk--> Maryland on the eastern coast of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States of America">United States of America</a>. As of 2005, the <!--del_lnk--> population of Baltimore City was 641,943 and the <!--del_lnk--> Baltimore-Towson metropolitan area has approximately 2.6 million residents . Baltimore is the largest city in <!--del_lnk--> Maryland and serves as the state&#39;s major cultural and industrial centre.<p>The city is named after the founding proprietor of the Maryland Colony, <!--del_lnk--> Lord Baltimore in the <!--del_lnk--> Irish House of Lords. Baltimore became the second leading port of entry for immigrants to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> during the 1800s. The city is a major U.S. <!--del_lnk--> seaport, situated closer to major midwestern markets than any other major seaport on the East Coast.<p>Because there is also a <!--del_lnk--> Baltimore County surrounding (but not including) the city, it is sometimes referred to as <b>Baltimore City</b> when a clear distinction is desired.<p>People from Baltimore are known as &quot;Baltimoreans.&quot;<p>

      <p>During the 17th century, various towns called &quot;Baltimore&quot; were founded as commercial ports at various locations on the upper <!--del_lnk--> Chesapeake Bay. The present city dates from <!--del_lnk--> July 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1729, and is named after <!--del_lnk--> Lord Baltimore, who was the first <!--del_lnk--> Proprietary Governor of the <!--del_lnk--> Province of Maryland. Baltimore grew swiftly in the mid- to late 18th century as the granary for <a href="../../wp/s/Sugar.htm" title="Sugar">sugar</a>-producing <!--del_lnk--> colonies in the <!--del_lnk--> Caribbean. The profit from sugar encouraged the maximum possible cultivation of cane and the importation of food. The relatively shorter distance between Baltimore and the Caribbean colonies allowed swift <a href="../../wp/t/Transport.htm" title="Transport">transport</a> and minimized the spoilage of <!--del_lnk--> flour.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>One of Baltimore&#39;s greatest moments occurred during the <!--del_lnk--> War of 1812 with the British, who had declared Baltimore &quot;A nest of Pirates.&quot; Baltimore&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Fort McHenry came under attack by <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> forces near the <!--del_lnk--> harbour after the British had <!--del_lnk--> burned Washington, D.C. Known today as the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Baltimore, American forces won the decisive battles by repulsing a joint land and naval attack by the British forces. They fought to a stalemate at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of North Point after killing the British commander General Ross. British reinforcements were not possible after the British Navy was repulsed by the defenders of the fort, and all forces then withdrew. It was the naval engagement that inspired <!--del_lnk--> Francis Scott Key to write the <a href="../../wp/p/Poetry.htm" title="Poem">poem</a> &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The Star-Spangled Banner,&quot; the lyrics to the United States&#39; <!--del_lnk--> national anthem. The battle was memorialized in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle Monument which is on the city seal.<p>On an 1827 visit to the city <!--del_lnk--> John Quincy Adams nicknamed it &quot;Monument City.&quot;<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Baltimore is also the site of the first architectural <!--del_lnk--> monument honoring George Washington, a 178-foot Doric column erected in 1829 and designed by <!--del_lnk--> Robert Mills, who later designed the <!--del_lnk--> Washington Monument in Washington, D.C.<p>Baltimore became an independent city in 1851, being detached from <!--del_lnk--> Baltimore County at that time.<p>Prior to the Civil War, Maryland was a slave-holding state. During the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a>, Maryland was officially part of the <!--del_lnk--> Union, but kept slavery legal. Pro-Southern sentiment led to the <!--del_lnk--> Baltimore riot of 1861, when Union soldiers marched through the city. After the riot, Union troops occupied Baltimore, and Maryland came under direct federal administration &mdash; in part, to prevent the state from seceding &mdash; until the end of the war in April 1865. This was considered a necessary move by the Union to prevent <a href="../../wp/w/Washington%252C_D.C..htm" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, from being completely surrounded by seceded Confederate territory. The case <i><!--del_lnk--> Ex parte Merryman</i>, written by Supreme Court Chief Justice <!--del_lnk--> Roger Taney (himself a Marylander), dealt with the <!--del_lnk--> habeas corpus rights of Marylanders jailed by the <a href="../../wp/a/Abraham_Lincoln.htm" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> Administration and strongly rebuked Lincoln for his actions.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Great Baltimore Fire on <!--del_lnk--> February 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1904, destroyed over 1,500 buildings in 30 hours and forced most of the city to rebuild. Immediately afterward, Mayor <!--del_lnk--> Robert McLane was quoted in the Baltimore News as saying, &quot;To suppose that the spirit of our people will not rise to the occasion is to suppose that our people are not genuine Americans. We shall make the fire of 1904 a landmark not of decline but of progress.&quot; He then refused assistance, stating &quot;As head of this municipality, I cannot help but feel gratified by the sympathy and the offers of practical assistance which have been tendered to us. To them I have in general terms replied, &#39;Baltimore will take care of its own, thank you.&#39;&quot; (McLane committed suicide on <!--del_lnk--> May 30.) Two years later, on <!--del_lnk--> September 10, <!--del_lnk--> 1906, the Baltimore-American reported that the city had risen from the ashes and &quot;one of the great disasters of modern time had been converted into a blessing.&quot;<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Baltimore is the location of the <!--del_lnk--> Baltimore World Trade Centre, the world&#39;s tallest equilateral five-sided building (the five-sided <!--del_lnk--> JPMorganChase Tower in <a href="../../wp/h/Houston%252C_Texas.htm" title="Houston, Texas">Houston, Texas</a> is taller but has unequal sides).<p>Baltimore is also the location of <!--del_lnk--> Pimlico Race Course, the home of the <!--del_lnk--> Preakness Stakes, the second leg of the <!--del_lnk--> Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing. The Preakness has been run since 1873.<p>Baltimore&#39;s population peaked at 949,708 in the 1950 Census, which ranked it as the sixth-largest city in the country, behind <a href="../../wp/d/Detroit%252C_Michigan.htm" title="Detroit, Michigan">Detroit</a>, and ahead of <a href="../../wp/c/Cleveland%252C_Ohio.htm" title="Cleveland, Ohio">Cleveland</a>. For the next five decades, the city&#39;s population declined while its suburbs grew dramatically, bottoming out in 2000 at 636,251. In the 21st century, the city&#39;s population has stabilized and is once again rising, mostly due to revitalization efforts in many city neighborhoods.<p>In 1955 <!--del_lnk--> Flag House Courts, a public housing project made up of 3 12-story buildings, was built. The buildings were eventually demolished in 2001.<p>In recent years, efforts to redevelop the downtown area have led to a revitalization of the Inner Harbour. In 1979 the <!--del_lnk--> Baltimore Convention Centre was opened and was subsequently renovated and expanded in 1996. <!--del_lnk--> Harborplace, a modern urban retail and restaurant complex, was opened on the waterfront in 1980, followed by the <!--del_lnk--> National Aquarium in Baltimore, Maryland&#39;s largest tourist destination, and another cultural venue, the Baltimore Museum of Industry in 1981. In 1992, the <!--del_lnk--> Baltimore Orioles of <!--del_lnk--> Major League Baseball moved from <!--del_lnk--> Memorial Stadium to <!--del_lnk--> Oriole Park at Camden Yards downtown, and six years later the <!--del_lnk--> Baltimore Ravens of the <!--del_lnk--> National Football League moved next door into PSINet Stadium (later renamed <!--del_lnk--> M&amp;T Bank Stadium following <!--del_lnk--> PSINet&#39;s bankruptcy).<p>On <!--del_lnk--> October 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1996, Baltimore became the first city in the United States to adopt <!--del_lnk--> 311 as a non-emergency &quot;hot line&quot; telephone number, in order to reserve the use of <!--del_lnk--> 911 for genuine emergencies. The concept has been highly successful, and numerous other American municipalities have since implemented the practice.<p>A <!--del_lnk--> 60-car train derailment occurred in a <!--del_lnk--> tunnel in Baltimore on <!--del_lnk--> July 18, <!--del_lnk--> 2001. The derailment sparked a chemical fire that raged for six days and virtually shut down the downtown area until the heat caused a water main to rupture, largely extinguishing the fire but also causing significant flooding in the streets above. Three weeks later, manhole covers flew into the air as underground explosions along West Pratt Street followed due to residual explosive chemicals from the fire left in the sewers.<p>In 2003, the <!--del_lnk--> Baltimore Development Corporation announced that three hotel projects were being reviewed. As of September 2006, the 756-room, $305 million <!--del_lnk--> Hilton hotel project is currently under construction west of the <!--del_lnk--> Baltimore Convention Centre. The City of Baltimore hopes to have it finished and opened by August 2008. (See <!--del_lnk--> Baltimore Convention Centre Hotel Project for more details regarding the convention centre hotel.)<p>Also in 2003, Baltimore was affected by <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Isabel from flooding as a result of <!--del_lnk--> tidal surge, affecting primarily the <!--del_lnk--> Fells Point community and the <!--del_lnk--> Inner Harbour and surrounding low areas. Many places were flooded, including the sports centre <!--del_lnk--> ESPN Zone, the <!--del_lnk--> Baltimore World Trade Centre (which remained closed for approximately a month during cleanup efforts), and most of the Inner Harbour. Water levels rose some 20 feet in areas, flooding underground parking garages and displacing thousands of cubic yards of trash and debris.<p>Beginning in the early part of the 21st century, Baltimore has undergone a major building spree in the downtown area, specifically in the Inner Harbour East district. The skyline has extended further outward and upward,and will continue to do so well into the next decade. <!--del_lnk--> ARC Wheeler, a <a href="../../wp/p/Philadelphia.htm" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>-based developer has been approved to build a new hotel/condominium complex that will be the city&#39;s new tallest building, dubbed &quot;<!--del_lnk--> 10 Inner Harbour,&quot; initially approved at 59 stories and 717ft tall, but rumored to be in the process of being redesigned to be even taller. Other proposals for downtown skyscrapers are twin 65-story towers at sites on E. Saratoga Street and Guilford Avenue, an 800ft.+ tower and complex located on the banks of the <!--del_lnk--> Patapsco River&#39;s middle branch area, and a 40-story condo and hotel tower at 300 E. Pratt Street.<p><a id="Law_and_government" name="Law_and_government"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Law and government</span></h2>

      <p>City Crime Rankings (12th Edition) ranks Baltimore second only to <!--del_lnk--> Detroit among the most dangerous American cities over 500,000 in population. According to crime statistics there were 269 <!--del_lnk--> murders in Baltimore in 2005, giving it the highest murder rate per 100,000 of all U.S. cities of 250,000 or more population. <!--del_lnk-->  Though this is significantly lower than the record-high 353 murders in 1993, the murder rate in Baltimore is nearly seven times the national rate, six times the rate of <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a>, and three times the rate of <a href="../../wp/l/Los_Angeles%252C_California.htm" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a>. In addition, other categories of crime in Baltimore have also been declining, although overall crime rates are still high compared to the national average. The rate of forcible rapes has fallen below the national average in recent years; however, Baltimore still has much higher-than-average rates of aggravated <!--del_lnk--> assault, <!--del_lnk--> burglary, <!--del_lnk--> robbery, and <!--del_lnk--> theft and a local news survey, though unscientific, recorded that over 75% of respondents felt that Baltimore City is no safer.<p>Though the crime situation in Baltimore is considered one of the worst in the nation, city officials have pointed out that most violent crimes, particularly murders, are committed by people who know their victims and who are often associated with the <!--del_lnk--> illegal drug trade.<p>City officials have, however, come under scrutiny from Maryland legislators regarding the veracity of crime statistics reported by the Baltimore City Police Department. For 2003 the FBI identified irregularities in the number of rapes reported, which was confirmed by the Mayor. 2005&#39;s murder numbers appear to exhibit discrepancies as well The former Commissioner of Police states upon interview that the administration suppressed corrections of its reported crime. However, many of these charges seem to be, at least partially, politically motivated. Nonetheless, experts indicate that the city&#39;s reporting practices should raise eyebrows and call for an independent audit, with which the administration has not cooperated, despite requests from members of City Council and the City&#39;s auditor. While racial disparities in arrest and incarceration rates exist in Baltimore, both young white and black men in the city are arrested and incarcerated at relatively high rates. Fifty-two percent of black males in their 20s are either in prison, in jail, or under correctional supervision. Of the roughly 100,000 arrests each year in this city of 635,000, about a quarter do not merit charging and another quarter do not merit prosecution. The ACLU has filed a suit in respect of systematic civil rights abuses by the current administration.<p>Criminal intimidation has also been reported as a problem in the city. In an infamous case, community activist <!--del_lnk--> Angela Dawson and her family were murdered by firebomb in their Baltimore home on <!--del_lnk--> October 16, <!--del_lnk--> 2002, in retaliation for Dawson&#39;s reporting of criminal activity. In a separate incident, another public safety activist, Edna McAbier, was also targeted. Though she survived, she has fled her neighbourhood, where she cannot be protected by city police. In 2005, 3 men were sentenced to life in prison for their involvement in the latter case. One of these men had appeared in the infamous video <i><!--del_lnk--> Stop Snitchin&#39;,</i> a homemade DVD produced by local drug dealers threatening fellow dealers who failed to adhere to a street based code of ethics and became informants.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

      </div>
      <p>The city&#39;s geography and history as a working class port town has given it a very distinctive social flavor. The most prominent example is the city&#39;s association with <!--del_lnk--> blue crabs. The <!--del_lnk--> Chesapeake Bay for years was the <!--del_lnk--> East Coast&#39;s main source of blue crabs, and Baltimore became the central hub of the crab industry. In the tourist district (between <!--del_lnk--> Harborplace and <!--del_lnk--> Fells Point), it is almost impossible to find a shop or restaurant that does not serve crabs or <!--del_lnk--> crabcakes, or sell some sort of crab related merchandise. Maryland&#39;s distinctive way of eating crabs is often not understood by outsiders. Traditionally, crabs are steamed in rock salt and <!--del_lnk--> Old Bay Seasoning, a favored local all-spice manufactured in Baltimore for decades. They are eaten on tables spread with newspaper with the use of only a wooden mallet, a knife, and one&#39;s hands. Cold <a href="../../wp/b/Beer.htm" title="Beer">beer</a> is also said to be a must.<p>Another popular Baltimore food item is the &quot;chicken box&quot;. A chicken box is an inexpensive meal consisting of 4 or 5 <!--del_lnk--> fried chicken pieces served in a <!--del_lnk--> fast food <!--del_lnk--> carry out box with some kind of <!--del_lnk--> starch as a side (e.g. mashed potatoes, fries, rice, but usually biscuits). The item is chiefly sold at independent <!--del_lnk--> fried chicken shops and <!--del_lnk--> delis in the city. Chicken boxes are usually enjoyed with &quot;Half and Half&quot;, a drink combining iced tea and lemonade &mdash; referred to elsewhere in the U.S. as an &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Arnold Palmer&quot;.<p><a id="Baltimore_Club_Music" name="Baltimore_Club_Music"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Baltimore Club Music</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Baltimore Club or Baltimore House is a recent musical movement that started in the late eighties in the clubs of Baltimore City. The earliest masters of this style were DJ Technics, the Dew Doo Kids, and Rod Lee, it is a fast pace style combining hip hop, house, and techno music together. The songs will sample hooks and repeat them over beats going as fast as 140 beats per minute. It has gained enough popularity to spring artist like D.O.G., the Bossman, and Young Leek to major deals with <!--del_lnk--> Universal, So So Def, and <!--del_lnk--> Roc-a-fella. The recent stars of this music movement are DJ <!--del_lnk--> K Swift and DJ Blackstarr. Though club music is a DJ led movement, recently Rap stars have taken over the scene and created a new sub-genre of rap, the stars are the aforementioned D.O.G. and Young Leek, also A-MAZ-ON, Tae Eazy, Deuce Tre Deuce, Prince, and <!--del_lnk--> Penny X.

      <p>The city&#39;s favored local <a href="../../wp/b/Beer.htm" title="Beer">beer</a> has traditionally been <!--del_lnk--> National Bohemian, or, as residents refer to it, <i>Natty Boh</i>. In some areas of Baltimore, locals call it &quot;National.&quot; The beer and its one time mascot, Mr. Boh, are considered indelible parts of Baltimore culture. Though it is said that few truly enjoy the drink, the historically low price and association with the city make it a local favorite. The National Brewing Company was also the &quot;inventor&quot; of <!--del_lnk--> Colt 45 malt liquor in 1963. Natty Boh was also the long-time beer of choice for Orioles and Colts fans at Memorial Stadium. After the Orioles moved from Memorial Stadium in 1991, Natty Boh was no longer available to fans at Baltimore sporting events. However, for the 2006 Orioles season, &quot;Boh is Back&quot; and is being served throughout Oriole Park. <a id="The_Block" name="The_Block"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Block</span></h3>

      <p>Baltimore is noted for its near-omnipresent <!--del_lnk--> rowhouses. Rowhouses have been a feature of Baltimore architecture since the 1790s, with early examples of the style still standing in the <!--del_lnk--> Federal Hill and <!--del_lnk--> Fells Point neighborhoods. Older houses may retain some of their original features, such as marble doorsteps, widely considered to be Baltimore icons in themselves. Later rowhouses dating from the 1800s-1900s can be found in <!--del_lnk--> Union Square and throughout the city in various states of repair. They are a popular renovation property in neighborhoods that are undergoing <!--del_lnk--> urban renewal, although the practice is viewed warily by some as a harbinger of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> yuppification.&quot; Elsewhere in the city, rowhouses can be found abandoned, boarded-up, and reflective of Baltimore&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> inner-city blight.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p><a id="Marble_Steps" name="Marble_Steps"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Marble Steps</span></h3>
      <p>Marble steps found along the streets of Baltimore are as much a part of the city&#39;s culture as crabs and baseball games. The use of marble for steps is due to the presence of high quality white marble in <!--del_lnk--> Cockeysville, a town 17 miles north of Baltimore harbour by highway. Indeed, the marble found there is so attractive, stone was hauled all the way from this northern Maryland town to the nation&rsquo;s new capital, instead of local Potomac marble quarries, for use in decorative construction around Washington, D.C., including the <!--del_lnk--> Washington Monument, and 108 columns of the capitol building. During the construction phase of the Washington Monument, that is through the middle of the 19th century, the marble gained in popularity as a decorative stone and was used omnipresently for the steps of rowhouses surrounding Baltimore harbour and in Fells Point. Baltimoreans take pride in the fact that their mundane doorsteps are made from the same beautiful white marble used for the construction of the famous Washington Monument. Scrubbing marble steps has become a tradition in Baltimore. The ritual includes scrubbing the marble with Bon Ami powder and pumice stone.<p><a id="Hons" name="Hons"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Hons</span></h3>
      <p>Perhaps the most intriguing part of Baltimore&#39;s culture are the people themselves. Though nowadays the city is extremely culturally diverse, the lasting image of Baltimoreans seems to be the &quot;Hon&quot; culture exemplified most markedly by the longer established families and residents of the <!--del_lnk--> Highlandtown, <!--del_lnk--> Canton, <!--del_lnk--> Locust Point and <!--del_lnk--> Hampden neighborhoods. Between the 1950s and <!--del_lnk--> 70s, it wasn&#39;t uncommon to see working class local women dressing in bright, printed dresses with out-dated glasses and <!--del_lnk--> beehive hairdos. Men were often dressed casually, but with a general factory or dock worker look, as many in town did indeed have such jobs.<p>The name of the culture comes from the often parodied <!--del_lnk--> Baltimore accent and slang. &quot;Hon&quot; was a common informal name for someone else, properly pronounced &quot;hohn&quot;, with emphasis on the vowel. Baltimore&rsquo;s accent exemplifies a <!--del_lnk--> dialectal continuum between <!--del_lnk--> Tidewater American English and <!--del_lnk--> Delaware Valley American English, loosely possessing the vowel shifts of the former and general pronunciation of the latter. For instance, &quot;Baltimore&quot; is pronounced &quot;Bawlamer&quot; or even &quot;Balmer,&quot; and &quot;Maryland&quot; becomes &quot;Murland&quot; or &quot;Murlan.&quot; Other common pronunciations include &quot;ool,&quot; &quot;amblance,&quot; &quot;wooder,&quot; &quot;warsh,&quot; &quot;sharr, or shaow&quot; &quot;dug,&quot; &quot;tew&quot; (<i>oil</i>, <i>ambulance</i>, <i>water</i>, <i>wash</i>, <i>shower</i>, <i>dog</i>, and <i>two</i>, respectively).<p><!--del_lnk--> John Waters parodies the Hon culture, as well as Baltimore itself, extensively in his movies. For a somewhat accurate representation of <!--del_lnk--> Baltimorese, one can look to Waters&#39; narration spots in his 1972 movie <i><!--del_lnk--> Pink Flamingos</i>. Waters himself used a local commercial for <i>Mr Ray&#39;s Hair Weaves</i> as his main inspiration. The commercial was famous around town for Mr. Ray&#39;s extreme Baltimore accent. &quot;Cawl todaey, for your freee hame showink...&quot; was the most memorable line from that commercial, translating as &quot;Call today, or for your free home showing...&quot;<p>Some Baltimoreans believe that &quot;Hon&quot; has racist origins - that after desegregation, whites, particularly whites in service positions such as bus drivers and department store employees, did not want to have to address black customers as &quot;sir&quot; or &quot;ma&#39;am&quot; so they adopted &quot;hon&quot; as a generic, non-reverential form of address.<p><a id="Corned_Beef_Row" name="Corned_Beef_Row"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Corned Beef Row</span></h3>

      <p>Baltimore is on the northern end of the <!--del_lnk--> humid subtropical climate zone, according to the K&ouml;ppen classification, with moderating influence from its relative proximity to the ocean. It gets relatively hot, humid summers and cool, moist winters, but the climate is less extreme than that of other American cities farther inland at a similar latitude.<p>July is typically the hottest month of the year, with an average high temperature of 91&deg;F (33&deg;C) and an average low of 73&deg;F (23&deg;C). The record high for Baltimore is 108&deg;F (42&deg;C), set in <!--del_lnk--> 1985. January is the coldest month, with an average high of 44&deg;F (7&deg;C) and an average low of 29&deg;F (-2&deg;C). However, winter warm fronts can bring brief periods of springlike weather, and arctic fronts can briefly drop nighttime low temperatures into the teens. The record low temperature for Baltimore is -7&deg;F (-22&deg;C), set in <!--del_lnk--> 1934. Baltimore rarely experiences temperatures below 10&deg;F and above 100&deg;F. Due to an <!--del_lnk--> urban heat island effect in the city proper, the outlying, inland parts of the Baltimore metro area are usually several degrees cooler than the city proper and the coastal towns.<p>Typical in most <!--del_lnk--> East Coast cities, precipitation is generous, and very evenly spread throughout the year, with every month bringing 3-4 inches of precipitation. Spring, summer, and fall bring frequent showers and <a href="../../wp/t/Thunderstorm.htm" title="Thunderstorm">thunderstorms</a>, with an average of 105 sunny days a year. Annual snowfall averages around 20 inches (51 cm). However, seasonal snow totals have ranged from less than an inch to over 60 inches.  The largest snowstorm on record brought 28.2 inches to the city, <!--del_lnk--> from February 15-18, 2003. In the northern and western suburbs, the climate becomes more <!--del_lnk--> continental, and thus snowfall amounts are usually higher, where many places annually receive 24-36 inches (61-91 cm).  Freezing rain is not uncommon in Baltimore, but major ice storms are very rare.<p>The city lies in between two peculiar physical features that protect it from extreme weather and account for the relatively tempered seasons. The <!--del_lnk--> Appalachian Mountains protect central <!--del_lnk--> Maryland from much of the harsh northern winds and accompanying <!--del_lnk--> lake effect weather that bring subfreezing temperatures and heavy snows to the <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Lakes.htm" title="Great Lakes">Great Lakes</a> region, and the <!--del_lnk--> Delmarva Peninsula protects Baltimore from many of the <!--del_lnk--> tropical storms that affect the immediate coast.<dl>
