      <p><b>Basil Brush</b> is a reddish-brown <a href="../../wp/f/Fox.htm" title="Fox">fox</a> <!--del_lnk--> glove puppet character who has appeared in <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> children&#39;s (and later adult) television programmes from the <!--del_lnk--> 1960s to the present day. He was originally voiced by <!--del_lnk--> Ivan Owen, who died in <!--del_lnk--> 2000. He is noted for his <!--del_lnk--> catch phrase, &quot;Boom! Boom!&quot;, and his &#39;<!--del_lnk--> posh&#39; <!--del_lnk--> accent. His most prized possession is his tail, which he insists is called a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> brush&quot;.<p>Basil&#39;s persona (and gap-toothed look) was based on actor <!--del_lnk--> Terry-Thomas.<p>This character was created in <!--del_lnk--> 1963 by <!--del_lnk--> Peter Firmin for <i>The Three Scampies</i> children&#39;s show but his main popularity was achieved due to <i>The Basil Brush Show</i>, which premiered in <!--del_lnk--> 1968<p>

      <p><a id="The_Basil_Brush_Show" name="The_Basil_Brush_Show"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Basil Brush Show</span></h2>
      <p>Throughout the show&#39;s 12-year run Basil was always accompanied by a <!--del_lnk--> straight man, initially <!--del_lnk--> Rodney Bewes &mdash; aka Mr Rodney &mdash; better known as one half of <i><!--del_lnk--> The Likely Lads</i>.<p>Bewes was replaced by Mr Derek &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> Derek Fowlds of <i><a href="../../wp/y/Yes_Minister.htm" title="Yes Minister">Yes Minister</a></i> fame and the TV show <!--del_lnk--> Heartbeat &mdash; who was the stooge for Basil&#39;s quips between <!--del_lnk--> 1969 and <!--del_lnk--> 1973. The subsequent presenters were Mr Roy (Roy North, <!--del_lnk--> 1973-<!--del_lnk--> 1977), Mr Howard (Howard Williams), <!--del_lnk--> 1977-<!--del_lnk--> 1979), and Mr Billy (Billy Boyle, <!--del_lnk--> 1979-<!--del_lnk--> 1980).<p>Basil was in three more shows in the <!--del_lnk--> 1980s: the educational programme <i>Let&#39;s Read... With Basil Brush</i> (<!--del_lnk--> ITV, <!--del_lnk--> 1982-<!--del_lnk--> 1983), <i><!--del_lnk--> Crackerjack</i> (<a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a>), and <i>Basil&#39;s Joke Machine</i> (<!--del_lnk--> ITV, <!--del_lnk--> 1986).<!--del_lnk--> <p>Basil recorded two albums (both with the same title), <i>Boom! Boom! It&#39;s Basil Brush</i> in <!--del_lnk--> 1970 and <!--del_lnk--> 1977. His adventures also appeared on the pages of <i><!--del_lnk--> TV Comic</i> during the peak of his popularity.<p><a id="Basil_Brush_Show_Comeback_.282002.29" name="Basil_Brush_Show_Comeback_.282002.29"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Basil Brush Show Comeback (2002)</span></h2>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 2002, Basil made a comeback in a new children&#39;s <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a> <!--del_lnk--> sitcom, again named <i>The Basil Brush Show</i>, in which his new comic foil, Mr Stephen, was played by <!--del_lnk--> Christopher Pizzey. <!--del_lnk--> Georgina Leonidas and Michael Hayes also appear on the show. Basil Brush is now shown to have a family, which includes his destructive, hyperactive but cute nephew Bingo, and his rather nasty Cousin Mortimer. Other friends have been introduced as well, such as moneymaking business child Dave and sensible Molly. No-one is directly credited as being Basil&#39;s puppeteer on this show, although it is possibly Michael Winsor, who is credited as either Basil&#39;s &quot;fitness instructor&quot; or his &quot;personal assistant.&quot;<p><a id="Other_appearances" name="Other_appearances"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Other appearances</span></h2>
      <p>Basil appeared with <!--del_lnk--> Frank Skinner and <!--del_lnk--> David Baddiel for several episodes of the BBC TV series <!--del_lnk--> Fantasy Football League in <!--del_lnk--> 1994.<div class="thumb tright">
      </div>
      <p>He also briefly appeared as a presenter for several Friday episodes of the popular British children&#39;s tv programme <i><a href="../../wp/b/Blue_Peter.htm" title="Blue Peter">Blue Peter</a></i> in <!--del_lnk--> 2003 in which he had his own joke segment.<p>Basil played <!--del_lnk--> Dobby the <!--del_lnk--> house-elf in the <i><!--del_lnk--> French &amp; Saunders</i> sketch &quot;<a href="../../wp/h/Harry_Potter.htm" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> And The Secret Chamberpot Of Azerbaijan&quot; for <i><!--del_lnk--> Comic Relief</i> <!--del_lnk--> Red Nose Day 2003.<p>Basil appeared on <i><!--del_lnk--> French &amp; Saunders</i> in <!--del_lnk--> 2004.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 10 December <!--del_lnk--> 2005, Basil appeared on <i><!--del_lnk--> The Weakest Link</i> and won the show, receiving &pound;10,900 for his chosen charity, the <i><a href="../../wp/b/Blue_Peter.htm" title="Blue Peter">Blue Peter</a></i> 2005 charity appeal, &quot;Treasure Trail&quot; (in aid of <!--del_lnk--> Childline). This makes him the first (and at the time of writing, only) puppet to win <i>The Weakest link</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Roland Rat had previously appeared as a puppet contestant, but did not win). Basil returned to <i><a href="../../wp/w/Weakest_Link.htm" title="Weakest Link">Weakest Link</a></i> as one of the contestants on the show&#39;s 1000th UK edition, recorded on <!--del_lnk--> 1 November <!--del_lnk--> 2006. It was shown on <!--del_lnk--> BBC Two on <!--del_lnk--> 18 December <!--del_lnk--> 2006. Although he made it to the final round, this time he failed to win. However, the winner still decided to share half of her winnings with Basil&#39;s chosen charity.<p>Basil Brush was mentioned briefly in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Black Books</i> episode &quot;Blood&quot;, wherein Manny (<!--del_lnk--> Bill Bailey) purchases a &quot;large-print biography of Basil Brush&quot;, which he describes as &quot;quite good.&quot;<p>The current puppet is clearly different in a number of respects from the original 1960s vintage.<p><a id="New_Series_.282006.29" name="New_Series_.282006.29"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">New Series (2006)</span></h2>
      <p>The new series first aired in September 2006 on the <!--del_lnk--> CBBC Channel, and a week later on CBBC on <!--del_lnk--> BBC One. Stephen has so far only appeared in one scene (in the first episode while in a chip van). There are also 3 new characters (Liam, Lucy and Roxie).<p>Interspersed with the main programme, there are now various cartoon shorts in which Basil and/or another character is seen making jokes.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Brush&quot;</div>
