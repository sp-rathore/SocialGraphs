      <p>Historically, the country was referred to in <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> as &quot;White Russia&quot;. Although this is not exactly correct &ndash; the correct translation is &quot;White <!--del_lnk--> Ruthenia,&quot; which either describes the era of Eastern Europe populated by Slavics or the various states that occupied the area.<!--del_lnk-->  Despite this, the practice of using the term White Russia continues as of 2006 with the following languages: &quot;Wei&szlig;russland&quot; in <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a>, &quot;Beyaz Rusya&quot; in <!--del_lnk--> Turkish or &quot;&Lambda;&epsilon;&upsilon;&kappa;&omicron;&rho;&omega;&sigma;&#x3AF;&alpha;&quot; (Leukoros&iacute;a) in <!--del_lnk--> Greek (see <!--del_lnk--> wiktionary:Belarus for the full list). The first known use of &quot;White Russia&quot; to refer to Belarus was in the late 16th century by Englishman Sir <!--del_lnk--> Jerome Horsey. He used the term to describe the areas of <!--del_lnk--> Ivan the Terrible&#39;s empire. During the 17th century the Russian tsars used &quot;White Ruthenia&quot;, asserting that they were trying to recapture their heritage from the <a href="../../wp/p/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth.htm" title="Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>. After the Commonwealth broke up, the lands that now make up Belarus were officially referred to as &quot;Belarus&quot; and &quot;Belarusi&quot;, instead of the then-banned terms of &quot;Litwa&quot; and &quot;Licwiny.&quot;<p>The spellings <b>Belorussia</b> and <b>Byelorussia</b> are transliterations of the name of the country in <!--del_lnk--> Russian. Belarus was named &quot;Belorussia&quot; in the days of <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Russia, and the Russian <!--del_lnk--> tsar was usually styled &quot;Emperor of <!--del_lnk--> All the Russias &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> Great, <!--del_lnk--> Minor, and <!--del_lnk--> White&quot;. This practice continued throughout the <!--del_lnk--> Soviet era, with the country taking the official name of the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic&quot;. Some Belarusians object to the name &quot;Byelorussia&quot;, as it is an unwelcome reminder of the days under Russian and Soviet rule. <p>In 2002, an informal survey was conducted by the website <!--del_lnk--> pravapis.org to see which version of the name was used on a majority of websites. By using Google, the website looked up various terms and it found that &quot;Belarus&quot;, the official short form of the name, was used on 93% of websites checked. Spellings &quot;Belorussia&quot;, &quot;Bielorussia&quot; and &quot;Byelorussia&quot; were used in 1%&ndash;2% of cases.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>Between the 6th and 8th centuries, what is now known as Belarus was settled by the <!--del_lnk--> Slavs, who still dominate the country. The <!--del_lnk--> Early East Slavs gradually came into contact with the <!--del_lnk--> Varangians and were organized under the state of <!--del_lnk--> Rus&#39;, mainly in the area around modern-day <!--del_lnk--> Polatsk in the northern part of the country. In the 13th century, the state was badly affected by a <a href="../../wp/m/Mongol_Empire.htm" title="Mongol Empire">Mongol</a> invasion, and eventually parts of Rus&#39; were swallowed up by the <!--del_lnk--> Grand Duchy of Lithuania. <!--del_lnk-->  The core lands of the duchy were territories around <!--del_lnk--> Kernav&#x117;, <!--del_lnk--> Trakai, <!--del_lnk--> Vilnius cities and <!--del_lnk--> Samogitia. During this time, the Belarusian territories were largely at peace, but duchy itself was often at war and had famous victories against <!--del_lnk--> Mongols in the east, <!--del_lnk--> Turks in the south and <!--del_lnk--> Teutonic Knights in the west. By the 15th century, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania stretched across much of <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Europe, from the <a href="../../wp/b/Baltic_Sea.htm" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic Sea</a> to the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Sea.htm" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a>.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> February 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1386, <!--del_lnk--> Grand Duke of Lithuania <!--del_lnk--> Jogaila was crowned King of Poland, and allied the Grand Duchy with <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Poland</a> in a <!--del_lnk--> personal union under one monarch. This personal union eventually resulted in the <a href="../../wp/p/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth.htm" title="Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>, a new state created in 1569. However, by 1795, the state was divided and annexed by <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Russia, <!--del_lnk--> Prussia and <a href="../../wp/a/Austria.htm" title="Austria">Austria</a> in the course of the <!--del_lnk--> Partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Belarus territories remained part of the Russian Empire until being occupied by <!--del_lnk--> Germany during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>. Belarus first declared independence on <!--del_lnk--> 25 March <!--del_lnk--> 1918, forming the <!--del_lnk--> Belarusian People&#39;s Republic. The Republic, however, was short-lived, and the regime was overthrown soon after the German withdrawal. In 1919 Belarus became the <!--del_lnk--> Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (BSSR), and after Russian occupation of eastern Lithuania merged into the <!--del_lnk--> Lithuanian-Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. After the <a href="../../wp/p/Polish-Soviet_War.htm" title="Polish-Soviet War">Polish-Soviet War</a> ended in 1921, Byelorussian lands were split between Poland and the recreated Byelorussian SSR, which became a founding member of the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Union of Soviet Socialist Republics</a> in 1922. <!--del_lnk-->  In September 1939, the Soviet Union annexed the Polish-held Byelorussian land as a result of the <!--del_lnk--> Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. <!--del_lnk--> <p>In 1941, <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> launched <!--del_lnk--> Operation Barbarossa, invading the Soviet Union. Belarus was captured soon afterwards, and <!--del_lnk--> remained in Nazi hands until 1944. Much the country&#39;s infrastructure was destroyed and a large portion of its population was killed in the German invasion. The Jewish population of Belarus was also devastated during <a href="../../wp/t/The_Holocaust.htm" title="The Holocaust">The Holocaust</a>. It took until 1971 for the population of Belarus to reach the pre-war level. The Jewish population, however, never recovered. After the war ended, Byelorussia was among the 51 signatories to the founding of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>, in 1945. The reconstruction that took place in Belarus after the war brought comparative prosperity to the Soviet Republic. During this time, Belarus became a major centre of manufacturing in the western region of the USSR. The increase in jobs brought in a huge immigrant population from the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic. During <a href="../../wp/j/Joseph_Stalin.htm" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>&#39;s era, a policy of <!--del_lnk--> russification was started to &quot;protect&quot; Byelorussian SSR from influences by the West. This policy involved sending Russians from various parts of the Soviet Union and placing them in key positions in the Belorussian SSR government. The official use of the <!--del_lnk--> Belarusian language and other cultural aspects were also limited by <!--del_lnk--> Moscow. After Stalin died in 1953, his successor <!--del_lnk--> Nikita Khrushchev continued the Russification program, stating in the Byelorussian SSR capital of <!--del_lnk--> Minsk that &quot;The sooner we all start speaking <a href="../../wp/r/Russian_language.htm" title="Russian language">Russian</a>, the faster we shall build <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">communism</a>.&quot;<p>In 1986, a section of Belarus was affected by the fallout from the <!--del_lnk--> Chernobyl power plant <!--del_lnk--> accident in neighboring <!--del_lnk--> Ukraine. When Soviet premier <a href="../../wp/m/Mikhail_Gorbachev.htm" title="Mikhail Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a> began pushing through his <!--del_lnk--> Perestroika plan, the Belarusian people delivered a petition to him in December of 1986 explaining the loss of their culture. This event has been coined by historians as the &quot;cultural Chernobyl&quot;. In June of 1988, <!--del_lnk--> mass graves were discovered at the city of <!--del_lnk--> Kurapaty. The graves allegedly contained about 250,000 of Stalin&#39;s victims. Some contend that this discovery was proof that the Soviet government was trying to erase the Belarusian people and caused some to seek independence. Belarus declared itself sovereign on <!--del_lnk--> 27 July <!--del_lnk--> 1990, and the BSSR formally became the Republic of Belarus on <!--del_lnk--> 25 August <!--del_lnk--> 1991, attaining full independence. Around that time, <!--del_lnk--> Stanislav Shushkevich became Chairman of the <!--del_lnk--> Supreme Soviet of Belarus, the top leadership position in Belarus. Shushkevich, along with <!--del_lnk--> Boris Yeltsin of Russia and <!--del_lnk--> Leonid Kravchuk of <a href="../../wp/u/Ukraine.htm" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> met on <!--del_lnk--> December 8, <!--del_lnk--> 1991 in <!--del_lnk--> Belavezhskaya Pushcha to formally declare the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the formation of the <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth of Independent States. Since 1994, the country has been led by <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Lukashenko, who has been criticized by Western governments, <!--del_lnk--> Human Rights Watch, and other Western <!--del_lnk--> NGO for his Soviet-style domestic policies.<p>As of 2005, there appears to be a movement in Belarus towards reuniting with <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>. In November 2005, a draft constitution was sent to both <!--del_lnk--> Vladimir Putin and Lukashenko for approval. This move, along with others, is part of the 1996 plan created by Lukashenko and former Russian President <!--del_lnk--> Boris Yeltsin to create a <!--del_lnk--> union between the two nations.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>

      <p>Belarus is a <!--del_lnk--> republic, governed by a <!--del_lnk--> President and a <!--del_lnk--> bicameral <!--del_lnk--> parliament&mdash;the <!--del_lnk--> National Assembly&mdash;comprising a lower house, the 110 member <!--del_lnk--> House of Representatives, and an upper house, the 64 member <!--del_lnk--> Council of the Republic. The House of Representatives has the power to appoint the Prime Minister of Belarus, make constitutional amendments, call for a vote of confidence on the prime minister and make suggestions on the foreign and domestic policy of Belarus. The Council of the Republic has the power to select various government officials, conduct an impeachment trial of the president and the ability to accept or reject the bills passed from the House of Representatives. Each chamber has the ability to veto any law passed by local officials if it is contrary to the <!--del_lnk--> Constitution of Belarus. The President&mdash;since 1994, <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Lukashenko&mdash;is the <!--del_lnk--> head of state. The government is a <!--del_lnk--> Council of Ministers, headed by a <!--del_lnk--> prime minister; the members of the Council of Ministers need not be members of the legislature, and are appointed by the President. The judiciary comprises the <!--del_lnk--> Supreme Court and various specialized courts, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Constitutional Court, which deal with specific issued related to the constitution or business law. The judges of the Constitutional Court are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Council of the Republic.<p>In Belarus, while there are <!--del_lnk--> political parties that either support or oppose President Lukashenko, the majority of the seats in the National Assembly are filled by those not affiliated with any political parties (&quot;non-partisans&quot;). However, there are three political parties who hold seats in the House of Representatives: the <!--del_lnk--> Communist Party of Belarus (8 seats), the <!--del_lnk--> Agrarian Party of Belarus (3 seats), and the <!--del_lnk--> Liberal Democratic Party of Belarus (1 seat). The other two parties that pledged their support to Lukashenko, the <!--del_lnk--> Belarusian Socialist Sporting Party and the <!--del_lnk--> Republican Party of Labour and Justice, did not secure any seats in October 2004 election. Opposition parties, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Belarusian People&#39;s Front and the <!--del_lnk--> United Civil Party of Belarus did not gain any seats. The UCPB and the BPF are some of the parties that comprise the <!--del_lnk--> People&#39;s Coalition 5 Plus, a group of political parties who oppose Lukashenko. Several organizations, including as the <!--del_lnk--> Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe(OSCE), declared the election un-free due to opposition parties negative results and the bias of the Belarusian media in favour of the government. However, in constitutional as well as political terms, the House is of marginal importance. At the 2000 election, it took four rounds of voting before all the seats were filled; in the end, 86% of the elected deputies were independents, and the remainder were the representatives of parties traditionally loyal to the president (OSCE, 2000). The <!--del_lnk--> next round of elections took place on March 19th, 2006, and this election also included selecting the President. Lukashenko was opposed in the election by <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Milinkevich, a candidate representing a coalition of oppositional parties. Another opposition candidate, <!--del_lnk--> Alaksandar Kazulin of the Social Democrats was detained and beaten by police during protests surrounding the Lukashenko sponsored event, the <!--del_lnk--> All Belarusian People&#39;s Assembly. This event, among others, have caused for concern that the 2006 elections had irregularities. The President won a landslide victory, over 80% of the vote. It was however deemed unfair by the <!--del_lnk--> OSCE. (See <!--del_lnk--> Belarusian presidential election, 2006).<p>Lukashenko was quoted as saying that he has an &quot;authoritarian ruling style&quot; that he uses to run the country. The <!--del_lnk--> Council of Europe has barred Belarus from membership since 1997 for undemocratic voting irregularities in the November 1996 constitutional referendum and parliament by-elections. According to the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe, Belarus&#39;s constitution is &quot;illegal and does not respect minimum democratic standards and thus violates the principles of separation of powers and the rule of law&quot;. The Belarusian government is also criticized for <a href="../../wp/h/Human_rights.htm" title="Human rights">human rights</a> violations and its actions against <!--del_lnk--> NGOs, independent journalists, national minorities and opposition politicians. During the rule of the current administration in Belarus, there have been several cases of persecution, including the <!--del_lnk--> disappearance or death of prominent opposition leaders and independent journalists. Belarus is also one of just two nations in Europe that retains the <!--del_lnk--> death penalty for certain crimes (the other being <a href="../../wp/a/Albania.htm" title="Albania">Albania</a>). In testimony to the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, <!--del_lnk--> Secretary of State <a href="../../wp/c/Condoleezza_Rice.htm" title="Condoleezza Rice">Condoleezza Rice</a> labeled Belarus, among six nations, as part of the US&#39;s list of <i><!--del_lnk--> outposts of tyranny.</i> The Belarusian Foreign Ministry announced that the statement from Secretary Rice &quot;are a poor basis&quot; to form a good Belarusian-American alliance.<p>Belarus has been described as &quot;a small-scale Soviet Union at its finest period&quot;.<p><a id="Administrative_Divisions" name="Administrative_Divisions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Administrative Divisions</span></h2>

      <p>Belarus is divided into six <!--del_lnk--> provinces (&quot;<!--del_lnk--> voblasts&quot;), named after the cities that serve as their administrative centers. The city of Minsk, located in the Minsk province, has the special status of being a national subordinate as it isn&#39;t included in any voblast. Subdivision into <i>voblasts</i> is inherited from the Soviet era. Voblasts are further subdivided into <i><!--del_lnk--> raions</i> (commonly translated as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> districts&quot; or &quot;regions&quot;). Local legislative authorities (<i>raisovet</i>, &quot;raion council&quot;) are elected by the raion&#39;s residents; local executive authorities (<i>raion administration</i>) are appointed by higher executive authorities. In the same way, each voblast has its own legislative authority (<i>oblsovet</i>), elected by residents, and an executive authority (<i>voblast administration</i>), whose leader is appointed by the President.<p>(Administrative centers are given in parentheses.)<ol>

      <p>Belarus is <!--del_lnk--> landlocked, relatively flat, and contains large tracts of <!--del_lnk--> marshy land. Lakes and rivers punctuate the country. The largest marsh territory is <!--del_lnk--> Polesia, which is also amongst the largest marshes in Europe. There are 11,000 lakes in Belarus, but the majority of the lakes are smaller than 0.5&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> square kilometres (124&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> acres). Three major rivers run through the country, the <!--del_lnk--> Neman River, the <!--del_lnk--> Pripyat River, and the <!--del_lnk--> Dnepr River. Belarus&#39; highest point is <!--del_lnk--> Dzyarzhynskaya Hara (Dzyarzhynsk Hill), 345&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> metres (1,132&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ft), and its lowest point is on the Neman River, 90&nbsp;metres (295&nbsp;ft). The <a href="../../wp/c/Climate.htm" title="Climate">climate</a> ranges from harsh <a href="../../wp/w/Winter.htm" title="Winter">winters</a> (average January temperatures are in the range &minus;8&nbsp;&deg;<!--del_lnk--> C(18&nbsp;&deg;<!--del_lnk--> F) to &minus;2&nbsp;&deg;C (28&nbsp;&deg;F)) to cool and moist <a href="../../wp/s/Summer.htm" title="Summer">summers</a> (average temperature 15&nbsp;&deg;C (59&deg;F) to 20&nbsp;&deg;C(68&deg;F)).<p>Forest covers about 34 % of the total landscape, making forestry products one of the most abundant natural resources in Belarus. Other natural resources to be found in Belarus include <!--del_lnk--> peat deposits, small quantities of <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">oil</a> and natural gas, <a href="../../wp/g/Granite.htm" title="Granite">granite</a>, dolomite <!--del_lnk--> limestone, <!--del_lnk--> marl, <!--del_lnk--> chalk, <a href="../../wp/s/Sand.htm" title="Sand">sand</a>, <!--del_lnk--> gravel, and <a href="../../wp/c/Clay.htm" title="Clay">clay</a>.

      <p>The Belarusian <!--del_lnk--> economy remains about 80% state-controlled, as it has been since Soviet times. The country is relatively stable, economically, but depends to a large extent on raw material supplies from its close ally <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>. <a href="../../wp/i/Industry.htm" title="Industry">Industry</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a> remain largely in state hands. Belarus is therefore one of the very few state-capitalistic national economies remaining. Agriculture is dominated by collective farming, with the major sub-sectors the <!--del_lnk--> cultivation of <a href="../../wp/p/Potato.htm" title="Potato">potatoes</a> and <!--del_lnk--> cattle breeding. Historically important branches of industry include <a href="../../wp/t/Textile.htm" title="Textile">textiles</a> and wood processing. After 1965, creation of heavy industry and <!--del_lnk--> mechanical engineering (<!--del_lnk--> tractors, <!--del_lnk--> refrigerators) significantly strengthened the country&#39;s development. Within the Soviet Union, Belarus was one of the industrially most developed republics. Economically, Belarus engages itself in the <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth of Independent States, <!--del_lnk--> Eurasian Economic Community and <!--del_lnk--> Union with Russia. After 1990, with the introduction of free market structures into the former Soviet Union, industrial production plunged. However, economic growth returned in 1996 and in 2001 Belarus was first of CIS countries to reach 1990 levels of industrial production and agricultural production. Gross domestic product (GDP) for 2005 was $79.13 billion (estimate), which equates to an annual income of approximately $7,700 dollar per head. In 2005 <!--del_lnk--> GDP increased by about 8-9%, with the inflation rate averaging about 8%. According to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">UN</a>, average monthly income grew from 20 <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">United States dollars</a> to 225 USD during the last 10 years.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> unemployment rate, according to Belarusian government statistics, was about 2% in 2005. However, foreign experts have suggested that the real rate is probably higher. More controversial is the decision to abandon the <!--del_lnk--> Belarusian ruble (BYR) in favour of the <!--del_lnk--> Russian ruble (RUB), starting on <!--del_lnk--> January 1, <!--del_lnk--> 2008, according to Russian news agency <!--del_lnk--> ITAR-TASS.<p>The Belarusian economy is impacted by the political situations inside the republic. The impact is mostly felt in the form of sanctions against the country or the leadership of Belarus. For example, the the European Union adopted Council Regulation (EC) No 765/2006 on 18 May 2006. The Regulation provided for a freeze on the funds of President Lukashenko and between 30 to 35 high-level officials of Belarus. The sanctions also provided for travel bans for the aforementioned leaders. The sanction was imposed by the EU after the nation-block declared that the 19 March 2006 elections were fraudulent and for the crackdown on opposition groups. <!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

The male-to-female ratio in 2005 was estimated to be .88 males to every female.<p>Most demographic indicators for Belarus resemble other European countries, notably with both the population growth rate and the natural growth rate in the negative. The population growth is currently at &minus;0.06% in 2005, with a fertility rate of 1.43.

      <p>Traditional Belarusian dress originates from the time of <!--del_lnk--> Kievan Rus and over time was under the influence of cultures of neighbors: Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians, Russians, and other European nations. Aside from its predominantly Ruthenian roots, <!--del_lnk--> Belarusian cuisine is very close to Lithuanian. It is sometimes considered as somewhat less rich and impressive than those of its imposing neighbors. In fact, however, this may result from the general lack of national identity which still continues to hold back the development of a nation and also led to the loss of many culinary traditions in the last 100 years.<p>Certain aspects of the Belarusian culture have been lost over time because of the <!--del_lnk--> Russification period. President Lukashenko has introduced laws that force <a href="../../wp/r/Radio.htm" title="Radio">radio</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Television.htm" title="Television">television</a> stations to showcase a percentage of Belarusian talent daily, but it does not specify whether the performance has to be in the Belarusian or Russian language. <!--del_lnk-->  The said radio and television stations are state-owned, mostly controlled by the <!--del_lnk--> National State Teleradiocompany (TVR).<p>Musically, Belarus has a mixture of artists and sytles, based on what language they sing. On the radio, Belarusian artists can be heard alongside Russian artists. Belarusian TV shows concerts, usually state run, showing the same performers along with military bands from Belarus. Famous rock bands from the country include NRM, Neurodubel, Ulis, Nowaje Nieba and Krama. Several Belarusian acts perform in Poland and Lithuania, where the population of Belarusian speakers are very high. Lithuania is also the host of the Belarusian alternative music festival Basowiszcza. <!--del_lnk-->  Belarus, since 2004, has been sending artists to the <a href="../../wp/e/Eurovision_Song_Contest.htm" title="Eurovision Song Contest">Eurovision Song Contest</a>. <!--del_lnk--> <p>The Belarusian government sponsors many annual cultural festivals: &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Slavianski Bazaar in Vitebsk&quot;; &quot;Minsk Spring&quot;; &quot;Slavonic Theatrical Meetings&quot;; International Jazz Festival; National Harvesting Festival; &quot;Arts for Children and Youth&quot;; the Competition of Youth Variety Show Arts; &quot;Muses of Niesvizh&quot;; &quot;Mir Castle&quot;; and the National Festival of the Belarusian Song and Poetry.
