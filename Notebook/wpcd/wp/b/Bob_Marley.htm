His father, <!--del_lnk--> Norval Sinclair Marley, was a white Jamaican born in <!--del_lnk--> 1895 to <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> parents from <!--del_lnk--> Sussex. Norval was a <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Marines.htm" title="Royal Marines">Marine officer</a> and captain, as well as a <!--del_lnk--> plantation overseer, when he married <!--del_lnk--> Cedella Booker, an eighteen-year-old black Jamaican. Norval provided financial support for his wife and child, but seldom saw them, as he was often away on trips. Bob was ten years old when Norval died of a heart attack in 1955 at age 60.<p>Being of mixed race, Bob Marley faced questions about his own racial identity throughout his life.

      <p>Marley and his mother moved to <!--del_lnk--> Kingston&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Trenchtown slum after Norval&#39;s death. Marley was forced to learn <!--del_lnk--> self-defense, as he became the target of <!--del_lnk--> bullying because of his racial makeup and stature (he was 5&#39;4&quot; (163&nbsp;cm) tall). He gained a reputation for his physical strength and constitution, which earned him the nickname &quot;Tuff Gong&quot;.<p>Young Marley became friends with Neville &quot;Bunny&quot; Livingston (later <!--del_lnk--> Bunny Wailer), with whom Marley started to play music. Marley left school at the age of 14 and started as an apprentice at a local welder&#39;s shop. In his free time, he and Livingston made music with <!--del_lnk--> Joe Higgs, a local singer and devout <!--del_lnk--> Rastafarian whom many critics regard as Marley&#39;s mentor. It was at one of the <!--del_lnk--> jam sessions with Higgs and Livingston that Marley met Peter McIntosh (later known as <!--del_lnk--> Peter Tosh), who had similar musical ambitions.<p>In 1962, Marley recorded his first two singles, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Judge Not&quot; and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> One Cup of Coffee&quot;, with local music producer <!--del_lnk--> Leslie Kong. These songs attracted little attention, and were later re-released on Marley&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Songs of Freedom</i> album.<p><a id="The_Wailers" name="The_Wailers"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Wailers</span></h2>
      <p>In 1963, Bob Marley, Bunny Livingston, <!--del_lnk--> Peter McIntosh, <!--del_lnk--> Junior Braithwaite, <!--del_lnk--> Beverley Kelso, and <!--del_lnk--> Cherry Smith formed a <a href="../../wp/s/Ska.htm" title="Ska">ska</a> and <!--del_lnk--> rocksteady group, calling themselves &quot;The Teenagers&quot;. They later changed their name to &quot;The Wailing Rudeboys&quot;, then to &quot;The Wailing Wailers&quot;, and finally to &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The Wailers&quot;. By 1966, Braithwaite, Kelso, and Smith had left The Wailers, leaving the core trio of Marley, Livingston, and McIntosh.<p>Marley took on the role of leader, singer, and main songwriter. Much of The Wailers&#39; early work, including their first single <i><!--del_lnk--> Simmer Down</i>, was produced by <!--del_lnk--> Coxsone Dodd at <!--del_lnk--> Studio One. The single topped Jamaican Charts in 1964 and established The Wailers as one of the hottest groups in the country. They followed up with songs such as &quot;Soul Rebel&quot; and &quot;400 Years&quot;.<p>In 1966, Marley married <!--del_lnk--> Rita Anderson, and moved near his mother&#39;s residence in <!--del_lnk--> Wilmington, Delaware for a few months. Upon returning to Jamaica, Marley began practicing Rastafari and started to wear his trademark <!--del_lnk--> dreadlocks (<i>see the</i> <!--del_lnk--> religion section <i>for more on Marley&#39;s religious views</i>).<p>After a conflict with Dodd, Marley and his band teamed up with <!--del_lnk--> Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry and his studio band, <!--del_lnk--> The Upsetters. Although the alliance lasted less than a year, they recorded what many consider The Wailers&#39; finest work. Marley and Perry split after a dispute regarding the assignment of recording rights, but they would remain friends and work together again.<p>Between 1968 and 1972, Bob and Rita Marley, Peter McIntosh, and Bunny Livingston recut some old tracks with <!--del_lnk--> JAD Records in Kingston and <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> in an attempt to commercialize The Wailers&#39; sound. Livingston later asserted that these songs &quot;should never be released on an album... they were just demos for record companies to listen to&quot;.<p>The Wailers&#39; first album, <i><!--del_lnk--> Catch A Fire</i>, was released worldwide in 1973, and sold well. It was followed a year later by <i><!--del_lnk--> Burnin&#39;</i>, which included &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Get Up, Stand Up&quot; and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> I Shot The Sheriff&quot;. <a href="../../wp/e/Eric_Clapton.htm" title="Eric Clapton">Eric Clapton</a> made a hit cover of the latter in 1974.<p>The Wailers broke up in 1974, with each of the three main members going on to pursue solo careers. The reason for the breakup is shrouded in conjecture; some believe that there were disagreements amongst Livingston, McIntosh, and Marley concerning performances, while others claim that Livingston and McIntosh simply preferred solo work. McIntosh began recording under the name <!--del_lnk--> Peter Tosh, and Livingston continued on as Bunny Wailer.<p><a id="Bob_Marley_.26_The_Wailers" name="Bob_Marley_.26_The_Wailers"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers</span></h2>
      <p>Despite the breakup, Marley continued recording as &quot;Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers&quot;. His new <!--del_lnk--> backing band included brothers <!--del_lnk--> Carlton and <!--del_lnk--> Aston &quot;Family Man&quot; Barrett on drums and bass respectively, <!--del_lnk--> Junior Marvin and <!--del_lnk--> Al Anderson on lead guitar, <!--del_lnk--> Tyrone Downie and <!--del_lnk--> Earl &quot;Wya&quot; Lindo on keyboards, and <!--del_lnk--> Alvin &quot;Seeco&quot; Patterson on percussion. The &quot;<!--del_lnk--> I Threes&quot;, consisting of <!--del_lnk--> Judy Mowatt, <!--del_lnk--> Marcia Griffiths, and Marley&#39;s wife, Rita, performed backup vocals.<p>In 1975, Marley had his international breakthrough with his first hit outside Jamaica, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> No Woman, No Cry&quot; from the <i><!--del_lnk--> Natty Dread</i> album. This was followed by his breakthrough album in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">US</a>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Rastaman Vibration</i> (1976), which spent four weeks in the <!--del_lnk--> Billboard charts Top Ten.<p>In December 1976, two days before &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Smile Jamaica&quot;, a free concert organized by <!--del_lnk--> Jamaican Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> Michael Manley in an attempt to ease tension between two warring political groups, Marley, his wife, and manager Don Taylor were wounded in an assault by unknown gunmen inside Marley&#39;s home. Taylor and Marley&#39;s wife sustained serious injuries, but later made full recoveries. Bob Marley received only minor injuries in the chest and arm. The shooting was thought to have been politically motivated, as many felt the concert was really a support rally for Manley. Nonetheless, the concert proceeded, and an injured Marley performed as scheduled.<p>Marley left Jamaica at the end of 1976 for <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, where he recorded his <i><!--del_lnk--> Exodus</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Kaya</i> albums. <i>Exodus</i> stayed on the British album charts for 56 consecutive weeks. It included four UK hit singles: &quot;Exodus&quot;, &quot;Waiting In Vain&quot;, &quot;Jamming&quot;, and also &quot;One Love&quot;, a rendition of <!--del_lnk--> Curtis Mayfield&#39;s hit, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> People Get Ready&quot;. It was here that he was arrested and received a conviction for possession of a small quantity of <!--del_lnk--> cannabis while travelling in London.<p>In 1978, Marley performed at another political concert in Jamaica, the <!--del_lnk--> One Love Peace Concert, again in an effort to calm warring parties. Near the end of the performance, by Marley&#39;s request, Manley and his political rival, <!--del_lnk--> Edward Seaga, joined each other on stage and shook hands.<p>The words he said, as he called the two politicians onstage, and while he held their hands above his head:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>Marley may have seen <!--del_lnk--> medical doctors as <i>samfai</i>, <!--del_lnk--> confidence men who cheat the gullible by pretending to have the power of witchcraft .

      <p>Bob Marley&#39;s music has continuously grown in popularity in the years since his death, providing a stream of revenue for his estate and affording him a mythical status in <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a> music history. He remains enormously popular and well-known all over the world, particularly so in Africa. Marley was inducted into the <!--del_lnk--> Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in <!--del_lnk--> 1994. <i><!--del_lnk--> Time</i> magazine chose Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers&#39; <i><!--del_lnk--> Exodus</i> as the greatest album of the 20th century.<p>In 2001, the same year that Marley won the <!--del_lnk--> Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, a feature-length documentary about his life by <!--del_lnk--> Jeremy Marre, Rebel Music, was nominated for the Best Long Form Music Video documentary at the Grammies. It won various other awards. With contributions from Rita, the Wailers, and Marley&#39;s lovers and children, it tells much of the story too in his own words.<p>In February <!--del_lnk--> 2006, a Brooklyn community board voted to rename a portion of Church Avenue, which runs through several heavily populated Caribbean-American neighbourhoods, after Bob Marley, pending approval of the New York City Council.<p>In January <!--del_lnk--> 2005, it was reported that Rita Marley was planning to have her late husband&#39;s remains exhumed and reburied in <!--del_lnk--> Shashamane, <a href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia.htm" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>. This announcement was met with great resistance in Jamaica, with critics arguing that his life was a testament to the unique <!--del_lnk--> Jamaican culture. Marley&#39;s 60th birthday celebration on February 6, 2005 was celebrated in Shashamane, having previously always been held in Jamaica. Later that year, Rita Marley denied having made such plans.<p><a id="Discography" name="Discography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Discography</span></h2>
