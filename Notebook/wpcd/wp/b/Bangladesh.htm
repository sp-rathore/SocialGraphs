      <p><b>Bangladesh</b>, officially the <b>People&#39;s Republic of Bangladesh</b>, is a country in <!--del_lnk--> South Asia. It is surrounded by <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> on all sides except for a small border with <a href="../../wp/m/Myanmar.htm" title="Myanmar">Myanmar</a> to the far southeast and the <a href="../../wp/b/Bay_of_Bengal.htm" title="Bay of Bengal">Bay of Bengal</a> to the south. Together with the Indian state of <!--del_lnk--> West Bengal, it makes up the ethno-linguistic region of <!--del_lnk--> Bengal. The name <i>Bangladesh</i> means &quot;Country of Bengal&quot; and is written as <big>&#x9AC;&#x9BE;&#x982;&#x9B2;&#x9BE;&#x9A6;&#x9C7;&#x9B6;</big> and <!--del_lnk--> pronounced <span class="IPA audiolink nounderlines" style="white-space: nowrap;"><!--del_lnk--> [&#39;ba&#x14B;lad&#x32A;e&#x283;]</span>  in the official <!--del_lnk--> Bengali language.<p>The borders of Bangladesh were set by the <!--del_lnk--> Partition of India in 1947, when it became the eastern wing of <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> (<!--del_lnk--> East Pakistan), separated from the western wing by 1,600&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km (1,000&nbsp;miles). Despite their common religion of <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a>, the ethnic and linguistic gulf between the two wings, compounded by an apathetic government based in <!--del_lnk--> West Pakistan, resulted in the independence of Bangladesh under the leadership of <a href="../../wp/s/Sheikh_Mujibur_Rahman.htm" title="Sheikh Mujibur Rahman">Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</a> in 1971 after the bloody <!--del_lnk--> Bangladesh Liberation War, in which it was supported by India. The years following independence have been marked by political turmoil, with thirteen different heads of government, and at least four <!--del_lnk--> military coups.<p>The population of Bangladesh ranks <!--del_lnk--> seventh in the world, but its area of approximately 144,000 km&sup2; is ranked ninety-fourth, making it one of the <!--del_lnk--> most densely populated countries in the world, or the most densely populated country if small <!--del_lnk--> island nations or <!--del_lnk--> city-states are not included. It is the third largest <!--del_lnk--> Muslim-majority nation, but has a slightly smaller Muslim population than the Muslim minority in India. Geographically dominated by the fertile <!--del_lnk--> Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta, the country has annual <!--del_lnk--> monsoon floods, and <!--del_lnk--> cyclones are frequent. Bangladesh is one of the founding members of <!--del_lnk--> South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), <!--del_lnk--> BIMSTEC, and a member of the <!--del_lnk--> OIC and the <!--del_lnk--> D-8.<p>

      <p>Remnants of <a href="../../wp/c/Civilization.htm" title="Civilization">civilization</a> in the greater <!--del_lnk--> Bengal region date back 4,000 years, when the region was settled by <!--del_lnk--> Dravidian, <!--del_lnk--> Tibeto-Burman, and <!--del_lnk--> Austro-Asiatic peoples. The exact origin of the word <i>Bangla</i> or Bengal is unknown, though it is believed to be derived from the Dravidian-speaking tribe <i>Bang</i> that settled in the area around the year 1000 BCE.<p>After the arrival of <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Aryans, the kingdom of <!--del_lnk--> Gangaridai was formed from at least the 7th century BCE, which later united with <!--del_lnk--> Bihar under the <!--del_lnk--> Magadha and <!--del_lnk--> Maurya Empires. Bengal was later part of the <!--del_lnk--> Gupta Empire from the 3rd to the 6th centuries <!--del_lnk--> CE. After its collapse, a dynamic Bengali named <!--del_lnk--> Shashanka founded an impressive yet short-lived kingdom. After a period of anarchy, the <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhist</a> <!--del_lnk--> Pala dynasty ruled the region for four hundred years, followed by a shorter reign of the <!--del_lnk--> Hindu <!--del_lnk--> Sena dynasty. <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> was introduced to Bengal in the twelfth century by <!--del_lnk--> Sufi missionaries, and subsequent Muslim conquests helped spread Islam throughout the region. <!--del_lnk--> Bakhtiar Khilji, a Turkish general, defeated <!--del_lnk--> Lakshman Sen of the Sena dynasty and conquered large parts of Bengal. The region was ruled by dynasties of <a href="../../wp/s/Sultan.htm" title="Sultan">Sultans</a> and feudal lords for the next few hundred years. By the sixteenth century, the <!--del_lnk--> Mughal Empire controlled Bengal, and <!--del_lnk--> Dhaka became an important provincial centre of Mughal administration.<p>European traders arrived late in the 15th century, and their influence grew until the <a href="../../wp/b/British_East_India_Company.htm" title="British East India Company">British East India Company</a> gained control of Bengal following the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Plassey in 1757. The bloody rebellion of 1857, known as the <!--del_lnk--> Sepoy Mutiny, resulted in transfer of authority to the <a href="../../wp/b/British_monarchy.htm" title="British monarchy">crown</a>, with a British <!--del_lnk--> viceroy running the administration (Baxter, pp.30&mdash;32). During colonial rule, famine racked the Indian subcontinent many times, including the <!--del_lnk--> Great Bengal famine of 1943 that claimed 3 million lives.<p>Between 1905 and 1911, an <!--del_lnk--> abortive attempt was made to divide the province of Bengal into two zones, with <!--del_lnk--> Dhaka being the capital of the eastern zone. (Baxter, pp. 39&mdash;40) When India was partitioned in 1947, Bengal was <!--del_lnk--> partitioned along religious lines, with the <!--del_lnk--> western part going to India and the eastern part joining <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> as a province called <!--del_lnk--> East Bengal (later renamed <!--del_lnk--> East Pakistan), with its capital at <!--del_lnk--> Dhaka.<p>In 1950, land reform was accomplished in East Bengal with the abolishment of the feudal <!--del_lnk--> zamindari system. (Baxter, p. 72) However, despite the economic and demographic weight of the east, Pakistan&#39;s government and military were largely dominated by the upper classes from the west. The <!--del_lnk--> Language Movement of 1952 was the first sign of friction between the two wings of Pakistan. (Baxter, pp. 62&mdash;63) Dissatisfaction with the central government over economic and cultural issues continued to rise through the next decade, during which the <!--del_lnk--> Awami League emerged as the political voice of the Bengali-speaking population. It agitated for <!--del_lnk--> autonomy in the 1960s, and in 1966, its president <a href="../../wp/s/Sheikh_Mujibur_Rahman.htm" title="Sheikh Mujibur Rahman">Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</a> was jailed; he was released in 1969 after an unprecedented popular uprising.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>In 1970, a massive <!--del_lnk--> cyclone devastated the coast of East Pakistan, and the central government responded poorly. The Bengali population&#39;s anger was compounded when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, whose <!--del_lnk--> Awami League won a majority in Parliament in the 1970 elections, (Baxter, pp. 78&mdash;79) was blocked from taking office. After staging compromise talks with Mujib, President <!--del_lnk--> Yahya Khan arrested him on the night of <!--del_lnk--> March 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1971, and launched <!--del_lnk--> Operation Searchlight, a sustained military assault on East Pakistan. Yahya&#39;s methods were extremely bloody, and the violence of the war resulted in many civilian deaths. Chief targets included <!--del_lnk--> intellectuals and Hindus, and about ten million <!--del_lnk--> refugees fled to neighbouring India. (LaPorte, p. 103) Estimates of those massacred range from three hundred thousand to 3 million. Most of the Awami League leaders fled and set up a government-in-exile in <a href="../../wp/k/Kolkata.htm" title="Kolkata">Calcutta</a>, India. The <!--del_lnk--> Bangladesh Liberation War lasted for 9 months. The <!--del_lnk--> guerrilla <!--del_lnk--> Mukti Bahini and Bengali regulars eventually received support from the <!--del_lnk--> Indian Armed Forces in December 1971. Major Ziaur Rahman declared the independence of the country over radio. Under the command of <!--del_lnk--> Lt. General J.S. Arora, the <!--del_lnk--> Indian Army achieved a decisive victory over Pakistan on <!--del_lnk--> 16 December <!--del_lnk--> 1971, taking over 90,000 <!--del_lnk--> prisoners of war in the <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.<p>After its independence, Bangladesh became a parliamentary democracy, with Mujib as the Prime Minister. In the 1973 parliamentary elections, the Awami League gained an absolute majority. A nationwide famine occurred during 1973 and 1974, and in early 1975, Mujib initiated a one-party socialist rule with his newly formed <!--del_lnk--> BAKSAL. On <!--del_lnk--> August 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1975, Mujib and his family were assassinated by mid-level military officers.<p>A series of bloody coups and counter-coups in the following three months culminated in the ascent to power of General <!--del_lnk--> Ziaur Rahman, who reinstated multi-party politics and founded the <!--del_lnk--> Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). Zia&#39;s rule ended when he was assassinated in 1981 by elements of the military. Bangladesh&#39;s next major ruler was General <!--del_lnk--> Hossain Mohammad Ershad, who gained power in a bloodless coup in 1982 and ruled until 1990, when he was ousted in a popular uprising. Since then, Bangladesh has reverted to a parliamentary democracy. Zia&#39;s widow, <!--del_lnk--> Khaleda Zia, led the <!--del_lnk--> BNP to parliamentary victories in 1991 and 2001 and was Prime Minister from 1991 to 1996 and again from 2001 to end of 2006. At the present, the caretaker government is in power and after a successful election the new government will be formed. <!--del_lnk--> Sheikh Hasina, one of Mujib&#39;s surviving daughters and the head of the Awami League, was in power from 1996 to 2001. Although Bangladesh enjoys the distinction of having two female politicians leading national politics, it continues to suffer from extensive corruption, disorder and political violence.<p><a id="Government_and_politics" name="Government_and_politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Government and politics</span></h2>

      <p>Bangladesh is a <a href="../../wp/p/Parliamentary_system.htm" title="Parliamentary system">parliamentary democracy</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> President is the <!--del_lnk--> head of state, a largely ceremonial post. The real power is held by the <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister, who is the <!--del_lnk--> head of government. The president is elected by the legislature every five years and has normally limited powers that are substantially expanded during the tenure of a <!--del_lnk--> caretaker government, mainly in controlling the transition to a new government. Bangladesh has instituted a unique system of transfer of power; at the end of the tenure of a government, power is handed over to members of a <!--del_lnk--> civil society for three months, who run the general elections and transfer the power to elected representatives. This system was first practiced in 1991 and institutionalized in 1996 as the 13th amendment to the constitution.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> prime minister is ceremonially appointed by the president and must be a member of parliament (<!--del_lnk--> MP), commanding the confidence of the majority of the MPs. The <!--del_lnk--> cabinet is composed of <!--del_lnk--> ministers selected by the prime minister and appointed by the president. The <!--del_lnk--> unicameral <!--del_lnk--> parliament is the 300-members House of the Nation or <i><!--del_lnk--> Jatiyo Sangshad</i>, elected by popular vote from single-member constituencies for five-year terms of office. There is <!--del_lnk--> universal suffrage for all citizens from the age of 18.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Constitution of Bangladesh was written in 1972 and has undergone thirteen <!--del_lnk--> amendments. The highest <!--del_lnk--> judiciary body is the <!--del_lnk--> Supreme Court, whose Chief Justices and other judges are appointed by the President. The Judiciary is not separate from the administration, which has caused much commotion in recent years. Laws are loosely based on <!--del_lnk--> English common law, but family laws such as marriage and inheritance are based on religious scripts, and hence differ from one religious community to another.<p>The two <!--del_lnk--> major parties in Bangladesh are the <!--del_lnk--> Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and <!--del_lnk--> Bangladesh Awami League. BNP finds its allies among <!--del_lnk--> Islamist parties like <!--del_lnk--> Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh and <!--del_lnk--> Islami Oikya Jot, while <!--del_lnk--> Awami League aligns with <!--del_lnk--> leftist and <!--del_lnk--> secularist parties. Another important player is the <!--del_lnk--> Jatiya Party, headed by former military ruler Ershad. The Awami League-BNP rivalry has been bitter and punctuated by protests, violence and murder. Student politics is particularly strong in Bangladesh, a legacy from the liberation movement era. Almost all parties have highly active student wings, and students have been elected to the Parliament.<p>Two radical Islamist parties, <!--del_lnk--> Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh (JMJB) and <!--del_lnk--> Jama&#39;atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), were banned in February 2005. Bomb attacks taking place since 1999 have been blamed on those groups, and hundreds of suspected members have been detained in numerous security operations, including the head the of those two parties in 2006. The first recorded case of a suicide bomb attack in Bangladesh took place in November 2005.<p><a id="Subdivisions" name="Subdivisions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Subdivisions</span></h2>

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Bangladesh is divided into six administrative divisions, each named after their respective divisional headquarters: <!--del_lnk--> Barisal (<big>&#x9AC;&#x9B0;&#x9BF;&#x9B6;&#x9BE;&#x9B2;</big>), <!--del_lnk--> Chittagong (<big>&#x99A;&#x99F;&#x9CD;&#x99F;&#x997;&#x9CD;&#x9B0;&#x9BE;&#x9AE;</big>), <!--del_lnk--> Dhaka (<big>&#x9A2;&#x9BE;&#x995;&#x9BE;</big>), <!--del_lnk--> Khulna (<big>&#x996;&#x9C1;&#x9B2;&#x9A8;&#x9BE;</big>), <!--del_lnk--> Rajshahi (<big>&#x9B0;&#x9BE;&#x99C;&#x9B6;&#x9BE;&#x9B9;&#x9C0;</big>), and <!--del_lnk--> Sylhet (<big>&#x9B8;&#x9BF;&#x9B2;&#x9C7;&#x99F;</big>).<p>Divisions are subdivided into administrative units known as <i>zila</i>, or districts. There are 64 districts in Bangladesh, with each district further subdivided into <i>thana</i>, or police stations (formerly called upa-zila or sub-districts). The area within each police station, except for those in metropolitan areas, is divided into several unions, with each union consisting of multiple villages. In the metropolitan areas, police stations are divided into wards, which are further divided into <i>mahallas</i>. There are no elected officials at the divisional, district or <i>thana</i> levels, and the administration is composed only of government officials. Direct elections are held for each union (or ward), electing a chairperson and a number of members. In 1997, a parliamentary act was passed to reserve 3 seats (out of 12) in every union for female candidates.<p><!--del_lnk--> Dhaka is the capital and largest city of Bangladesh. Other major cities include <!--del_lnk--> Chittagong, <!--del_lnk--> Khulna, <!--del_lnk--> Rajshahi, <!--del_lnk--> Barisal and <!--del_lnk--> Sylhet. These metropolitan cities have <!--del_lnk--> mayoral elections, while other municipalities elect a chairperson. Mayors and chairpersons are elected for a span of five years.<p><a id="Geography_and_climate" name="Geography_and_climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography and climate</span></h2>

      <p>Bangladesh is located in the low-lying <!--del_lnk--> Ganges-<!--del_lnk--> Brahmaputra River Delta or <!--del_lnk--> Ganges Delta. This delta is formed by the confluence of the <a href="../../wp/g/Ganges_River.htm" title="Ganges River">Ganges</a> (local name <!--del_lnk--> Padma or <i>P&ocirc;dda</i>), <!--del_lnk--> Brahmaputra (<!--del_lnk--> Jamuna or <i>Jomuna</i>), and <!--del_lnk--> Meghna rivers and their respective tributaries. The <!--del_lnk--> alluvial soil deposited by these rivers has created some of the most highly fertile plains of the world.<p>Most parts of Bangladesh are within 10 metres above the sea level, and it is believed that about 10% of the land would be flooded if the sea level were to rise by 1 metre. The highest point in Bangladesh is in Mowdok range at 1,052&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> m (3,451&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ft) in the <!--del_lnk--> Chittagong Hill Tracts to the southeast of the country. A major part of the coastline comprises a <!--del_lnk--> marshy <!--del_lnk--> jungle, the <!--del_lnk--> Sundarbans, the largest <!--del_lnk--> mangrove forest in the world and home to diverse flora and fauna, including the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Bengal Tiger. In 1997, this region was declared endangered.<p>Straddling the <!--del_lnk--> Tropic of Cancer, Bangladeshi climate is <a href="../../wp/t/Tropics.htm" title="Tropics">tropical</a> with a mild winter from October to March, a hot, humid summer from March to June. A warm and humid <!--del_lnk--> monsoon season lasts from June to October and supplies most of the country&#39;s rainfall. Natural calamities, such as <a href="../../wp/f/Flood.htm" title="Flood">floods</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Tropical_cyclone.htm" title="Tropical cyclone">tropical cyclones</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Tornado.htm" title="Tornado">tornadoes</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> tidal bores occur almost every year, combined with the effects of <!--del_lnk--> deforestation, <a href="../../wp/s/Soils_retrogression_and_degradation.htm" title="Soils retrogression and degradation">soil degradation</a> and <!--del_lnk--> erosion. <!--del_lnk--> Cox&#39;s Bazar, south of the city of <!--del_lnk--> Chittagong, has a beach that stretches uninterrupted over 120&nbsp;kilometres (75&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mi); it is the longest unbroken natural sea beach in the world.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>

      <p>Despite sustained domestic and international efforts to improve economic and demographic prospects, Bangladesh remains an underdeveloped and <!--del_lnk--> overpopulated nation. The <!--del_lnk--> per capita income in 2004 was a low US$440, and many other economic indicators were less than impressive. Yet, as the <a href="../../wp/w/World_Bank_Group.htm" title="World Bank Group">World Bank</a> notes in its July 2005 Country Brief, the country has made impressive progress in human development by focusing on increasing <a href="../../wp/l/Literacy.htm" title="Literacy">literacy</a>, achieving gender parity in schooling, and reducing population growth.<p><!--del_lnk--> Jute was once the economic engine of the country. Its share of the world export market peaked in the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">Second World War</a> and the late 1940s at 80% and even in the early 1970s accounted for 70% of its export earnings. However, <!--del_lnk--> polypropylene products began to substitute jute products worldwide and the jute industry started to slow down. Bangladesh grows significant quantities of rice, tea and <a href="../../wp/m/Mustard_plant.htm" title="Mustard plant">mustard</a>. Although two-thirds of Bangladeshis are farmers, more than three quarters of Bangladesh&rsquo;s export earnings come from the <!--del_lnk--> garment industry, which began attracting foreign investors in the 1980s due to cheap labour and low conversion cost. In 2002, the industry exported US$5 billion worth of products. The industry now employs more than 3 million workers, 90% of whom are women. A large part of foreign currency earnings also comes from the remittances sent by <!--del_lnk--> expatriates living in other countries.<p>Obstacles to growth include frequent cyclones and floods, inefficient state-owned enterprises, mismanaged <!--del_lnk--> port facilities, a growth in the labour force that has outpaced jobs, inefficient use of energy resources (such as <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_gas.htm" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a>), insufficient power supplies, slow implementation of economic reforms, political infighting and <!--del_lnk--> corruption. According to the World Bank&#39;s July 2005 Country Brief: &quot;Among Bangladesh&rsquo;s most significant obstacles to growth are poor governance and weak public institutions.&quot;<p>Since 1990, the country has achieved an average annual growth rate of 5% according to the World Bank, despite the hurdles. The <!--del_lnk--> middle class and the <!--del_lnk--> consumer industry have seen some growth. In December 2005, four years after its report on the emerging &quot;<!--del_lnk--> BRIC&quot; economies (<a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, and <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">China</a>), <!--del_lnk--> Goldman Sachs named Bangladesh one of the &quot;Next Eleven,&quot; along with <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, Pakistan and several other countries. Bangladesh has seen a sharp increase in <!--del_lnk--> foreign direct investment. A number of <!--del_lnk--> multinational corporations, including <!--del_lnk--> Unocal Corporation and <!--del_lnk--> Tata, have made major investments, the <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_gas.htm" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a> sector being a priority. In December 2005, the <!--del_lnk--> Central Bank of Bangladesh projected GDP growth around 6.5%.<p>One significant contributor to the development of the economy has been the widespread propagation of <!--del_lnk--> microcredit by <!--del_lnk--> Muhammad Yunus (awarded <!--del_lnk--> Nobel <a href="../../wp/n/Nobel_Peace_Prize.htm" title="Nobel Peace Prize">peace prize</a> in 2006) through the <!--del_lnk--> Grameen Bank. By the late 1990s, Grameen Bank had 2.3 million members, along with 2.5 million members of other similar organizations.<p>In order to enhance economic growth the government set up several export processing zones to attract foreign investment. These are managed by the <!--del_lnk--> Bangladesh Export Processing Zone Authority.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>Recent estimates of Bangladesh&#39;s population range from 142 to 147 million, making it one of the ten most populous countries in the world. With a population similar to <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>&#39;s confined to an area of 144,000 square kilometers, it is very densely populated. Bangladesh&#39;s population growth was among the highest in the world in the 1960s and 1970s, when the count grew from 50 to 90 million, but with the promotion of <a href="../../wp/b/Birth_control.htm" title="Birth control">birth control</a> in the 1980s, the growth rate slowed. The total <!--del_lnk--> fertility rate is now 3.2, compared with 6.2 three decades ago. The population is relatively young, with the 0&ndash;25 age group comprising 60%, while 3% are 65 or older. Life expectancy is 63 years for both males and females.<p>Bangladesh is ethnically homogeneous, with <!--del_lnk--> Bengalis comprising 98% of the population. The remainder are mostly <!--del_lnk--> Bihari migrants and indigenous tribal groups. There are 13 tribal groups located in the <!--del_lnk--> Chittagong Hill Tracts, the most populous of the tribes are the <!--del_lnk--> Chakmas. The region has been a source for ethnic tension since the inception of Bangladesh. The largest tribal groups outside the Hill Tracts are the <!--del_lnk--> Santhals and the <!--del_lnk--> Garos (Achiks). <!--del_lnk--> Human trafficking has been a lingering problem in Bangladesh and illegal immigration has remained a cause of friction with Myanmar and India.<p>The main language, as in <!--del_lnk--> West Bengal, is <!--del_lnk--> Bangla (Bengali), an <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Aryan language of <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> origin and has its own <!--del_lnk--> script. Bangla is the official language of Bangladesh. <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> is used as second language among the middle and upper classes and in higher education. Since a President Order in 1987, Bangla is used for all official correspondence except foreign ones.<p>Two major religions practised in Bangladesh are <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> (88% US State Department est. 2005) and <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> (11% US State Dept. 2005). Ethnic <!--del_lnk--> Biharis are predominantly <!--del_lnk--> Shia Muslims. Other religious groups include <!--del_lnk--> Buddhists, <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christians</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Animists.<p>Health and education levels have recently improved as poverty levels have decreased. Nevertheless, Bangladesh remains among the poorest nations in the world. Most Bangladeshis are rural, living on subsistence farming. Nearly half of the population lives on less than 1 USD per day. Health problems abound, ranging from <!--del_lnk--> surface water contamination, to <a href="../../wp/a/Arsenic.htm" title="Arsenic">arsenic</a> in the <!--del_lnk--> groundwater, and diseases including <a href="../../wp/m/Malaria.htm" title="Malaria">malaria</a>, <!--del_lnk--> leptospirosis and <!--del_lnk--> dengue. The literacy rate in Bangladesh is approximately 41%. There is gender disparity, though, as literacy rates are 50% among men and 31% among women, according to a 2004 <!--del_lnk--> UNICEF estimate. Literacy has gone up due to many programs introduced in the country. Among the most successful ones are the <i>Food for education</i> (FFE) program introduced in 1993, and a stipend program for women at the primary and secondary levels.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

      <p>A new state for an old nation, Bangladesh has a culture that encompasses elements both old and new. The <!--del_lnk--> Bangla language boasts a rich literary heritage, which Bangladesh shares with the <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">Indian</a> state of <!--del_lnk--> West Bengal. The earliest literary text in Bangla is the eighth century <!--del_lnk--> Charyapada. Bangla literature in the medieval age was often either religious (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> Chandidas), or adaptations from other languages (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> Alaol). Bangla literature matured in the nineteenth century. Its greatest icons are the poets <a href="../../wp/r/Rabindranath_Tagore.htm" title="Rabindranath Tagore">Rabindranath Tagore</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Kazi Nazrul Islam. Bangladesh also has a long tradition in folk literature, evidenced by <i><!--del_lnk--> Maimansingha Gitika</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Thakurmar Jhuli</i> or stories related to <i><!--del_lnk--> Gopal Bhar</i>.<p>The musical tradition of Bangladesh is lyrics-based (<i>Baniprodhan</i>), with minimal instrumental accompaniment. The <!--del_lnk--> Baul tradition is a unique heritage of Bangla folk music, and there are numerous other musical traditions in Bangladesh, which vary from one region to the other. <!--del_lnk--> Gombhira, <!--del_lnk--> Bhatiali, <!--del_lnk--> Bhawaiya are a few of the better-known musical forms. Folk music of Bengal is often accompanied by the <!--del_lnk--> ektara, an instrument with only one string. Other instruments include the <!--del_lnk--> dotara, <!--del_lnk--> dhol, <a href="../../wp/f/Flute.htm" title="Flute">flute</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> tabla. Bangladesh also has an active heritage in <!--del_lnk--> North Indian classical music. Similarly, Bangladeshi dance forms draw from folk traditions, especially those of the tribal groups, as well as the broader Indian dance tradition. Bangladesh produces about 80 films a year. Mainstream <!--del_lnk--> Hindi films are also quite popular, as are films from <a href="../../wp/k/Kolkata.htm" title="Kolkata">Kolkata</a>, which has its own thriving Bengali-language movie industry. Around 200 dailies are published in Bangladesh, along with more than 1800 periodicals. However, regular readership is low, nearly about 15% of the population. Bangladeshis listen to a variety of local and national radio programmes from <!--del_lnk--> Bangladesh Betar, as well as Bangla services from the <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Voice of America. There is a state-controlled <!--del_lnk--> television channel, but in the last few years, privately owned channels have grown considerably.<p>The culinary tradition of Bangladesh has close relations to <!--del_lnk--> Indian and <!--del_lnk--> Middle Eastern cuisine as well as having many unique traits. Rice and fish are traditional favourites; leading to a common saying that &quot;fish and rice make a Bengali&quot; (<i>machhe bhate bangali</i>). Meat Consumption has increased with higher production in recent years.
