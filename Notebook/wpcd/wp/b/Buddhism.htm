      <p><b>Buddhism</b> (also known as <i>Buddha <!--del_lnk--> Dharma</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Pali: &#x92C;&#x941;&#x926;&#x94D;&#x927; &#x927;&#x92E;&#x94D;&#x92E;, &quot;the teachings of the awakened one&quot;) is a <!--del_lnk--> dharmic, <!--del_lnk--> non-theistic <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religion</a>, a way of life, a practical <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>, and a life-enhancing system of applied <a href="../../wp/p/Psychology.htm" title="Psychology">psychology</a>. Buddhism focuses on the teachings of <a href="../../wp/g/Gautama_Buddha.htm" title="Gautama Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a> (Pali: &#x917;&#x94C;&#x924;&#x92E; &#x92C;&#x941;&#x926;&#x94D;&#x927;), hereinafter referred to as &quot;the Buddha&quot;, who was born in <!--del_lnk--> Kapilavastu in what is now <a href="../../wp/n/Nepal.htm" title="Nepal">Nepal</a> around the fifth century BCE. Buddhism spread throughout the <!--del_lnk--> Indian subcontinent in the <!--del_lnk--> five centuries following the Buddha&#39;s passing, and thence into <!--del_lnk--> Central, <!--del_lnk--> Southeast, and <!--del_lnk--> East Asia over the next <!--del_lnk--> two millennia.<p>Today, Buddhism is divided primarily into three traditions:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Theravada (<a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>: &#x938;&#x94D;&#x925;&#x935;&#x93F;&#x930;&#x935;&#x93E;&#x926; <i>Sthavirav&#x101;da</i>);<li><!--del_lnk--> Mahayana (Sanskrit: &#x92E;&#x939;&#x93E;&#x92F;&#x93E;&#x928; <i>Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na</i>);<li><!--del_lnk--> Vajrayana, which developed from, and is sometimes still classified with, Mahayana.</ul>
      <p>Theravada is still practiced in certain parts of <!--del_lnk--> South Asia (mostly <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>) and <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asia; Mahayana is practiced predominantly in <!--del_lnk--> East Asia; and the esoteric Vajrayana is followed in <a href="../../wp/t/Tibet.htm" title="Tibet">Tibet</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Mongolia.htm" title="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>. The earlier non-Theravada <!--del_lnk--> Hinayana schools of thought that stemmed from <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> largely died out a millennium ago.<p>Buddhism continues to attract followers worldwide and is considered a <!--del_lnk--> major world religion. According to one source (<!--del_lnk--> ), &quot;World estimates for Buddhists vary between 230 and 500 million, with most around 350 million.&quot; However, <!--del_lnk--> estimates are uncertain for several countries. Buddhism is the <!--del_lnk--> fifth-largest religion in the world behind <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a>, <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> traditional Chinese religion, respectively. The monks&#39; order <!--del_lnk--> Sangha, which began during the lifetime of the Buddha in India, is amongst the oldest organizations on earth.<p>When used in a generic sense, a <a href="../../wp/b/Buddha.htm" title="Buddha">buddha</a> is generally considered to be a <!--del_lnk--> person who discovers the true <!--del_lnk--> nature of reality through years of spiritual cultivation, <!--del_lnk--> investigation of the various religious practices of his time, and <!--del_lnk--> meditation. This transformational discovery is called <!--del_lnk--> bodhi (literally, &quot;awakening&quot; &mdash; more commonly called &quot;enlightenment&quot;).<p>Any person who has <!--del_lnk--> awakened from the &quot;sleep of ignorance&quot; by directly realizing the true nature of reality is called a buddha. <a href="../../wp/g/Gautama_Buddha.htm" title="Gautama Buddha">The Buddha</a> is said to have been only the latest of many of these; there were other buddhas before him and there will be others in the future. According to the Buddha, any person can follow his example and become enlightened through the study of his words (&quot;<!--del_lnk--> Dharma&quot;) and putting them into practice, by leading a <!--del_lnk--> virtuous, <!--del_lnk--> moral life, and purifying the <a href="../../wp/m/Mind.htm" title="Mind">mind</a>.<p>The aim of Buddhist practice is to put an end to the sorrow (dukkha, Sanskrit/Pali: &#x926;&#x941;&#x915;&#x94D;&#x916;) of existence. In the words of the Buddha: &quot;I teach one thing and one thing only: suffering and the end of suffering&quot;. To achieve this state of the end of suffering (<!--del_lnk--> Nirvana or <!--del_lnk--> Nirodha), adherents train and purify the mind by following the <!--del_lnk--> Four Noble Truths and the <!--del_lnk--> Noble Eightfold Path, eventually arriving at an understanding of the true nature of all things. In this way all ignorance and unhappiness ends, and <!--del_lnk--> liberation is attained.<p>Buddhist teaching encourages individuals to practice and verify the Buddha&#39;s teachings based on their own personal experience, and also after consulting with &#39;the wise&#39;. If they find the teachings are valid (leading to more happiness and less suffering), they can apply these teachings in a practical form into their daily life if they so wish.<p>

      <p>Numerous distinct groups have developed since the passing of the Buddha, with diverse teachings that vary widely in practice, philosophical emphasis, and culture. However, there are certain doctrines which are common to the majority of schools and traditions in Buddhism.<p><a id="The_Four_Noble_Truths" name="The_Four_Noble_Truths"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Four Noble Truths</span></h3>

      <p>The Buddha taught that in life there exists <!--del_lnk--> sorrow / suffering which is caused by <!--del_lnk--> desire and it can be cured (ceased) by following the <!--del_lnk--> Noble Eightfold Path (Sanskrit: <b><span class="Unicode">&#x100;rya &#39;a&#x1E63;&#x1E6D;&#x101;&#x1E45;ga M&#x101;rga&#x1E25;</span></b> , P&#x101;li: <b><span class="Unicode">Ariyo A&#x1E6D;&#x1E6D;ha&#x1E45;giko Maggo</span></b>). This teaching is called the <b>Catv&#x101;ry &#x100;ryasaty&#x101;ni</b> (Pali: <b><span class="Unicode">Catt&#x101;ri Ariyasacc&#x101;ni</span></b>), the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Four Noble Truths&quot;.<ol>
       <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Suffering:</b> Birth is suffering, aging is suffering, illness is suffering, death is suffering; union with what is displeasing is suffering; separation from what is pleasing is suffering; not to get what one wants is suffering; in brief, the five aggregates subject to clinging are suffering.<li><b>The cause of suffering:</b> The <!--del_lnk--> desire which leads to <!--del_lnk--> renewed existence (rebirth).<li><b>The cessation of suffering:</b> The cessation of <!--del_lnk--> desire.<li><b>The way leading to the cessation of suffering:</b> The <!--del_lnk--> Noble Eightfold Path;</ol>
      <p>The Four Noble Truths was the topic of the first sermon given by the Buddha after his enlightenment, which was given to the ascetics with whom he had practiced austerities.<p>The Four Noble Truths were originally spoken by the Buddha, not in the form of a religious or philosophical text, but in the form of a common medical prescription of the time.<p><a id="Nirvana" name="Nirvana"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Nirvana</span></h3>

      <p>Nirvana is the extinguishment of all desire, delusion and ignorance. It has been likened to the snuffing out of a candle, where the spirit is freed from all worldly passions; it is the realization that the Self does not exist, and that human desires are empty. An enlightened Buddhist is able to act in this world with complete detachment (without desire), and their actions have no <!--del_lnk--> karma. A Buddhist who has attained Nirvana has escaped the world of cause-and-effect (they are free from the cycle of birth and rebirth). The realisation of Nirvana is a happy experience (but not the sensation of joy). Nirvana is fully realized at death, but can be experienced before death. There are four stages in the Buddhist life:<ul>
       <li>1. The &ldquo;Stream-Entrant&rdquo; (Bhikku) catches a glimpse of Nirvana, understands the concept of non-self and eliminates the possibility of being reborn in the lower realms of existence. They also develop a strong faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha (also known as the Triple Gem) and will only be reborn a maximum of seven more lives.<li>2. The &ldquo;Once-Returner&rdquo; (Arhant) eliminates sensual desires and will be born into the human world only once more.<li>3. The &ldquo;Non-Returner&rdquo; (Boddhisattva) after passing away from the human realm is born in the &quot;Brahma&quot; heaven, where the body does not exist as desire and delusion have been destroyed. After achieving this stage the person has already destroyed the first 5 fetters.<li>4. The &ldquo;Holy One&rdquo; (Buddha) is completely pure and free from desire, delusion and ignorance. That person has experienced Nirvana and will know it fully at death, when all matter, sensations, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness will disappear forever.</ul>

      <p>The Noble Eightfold Path is the way to the cessation of suffering, the fourth part of the Four Noble Truths. In order to fully understand the noble truths and investigate whether they were in fact true, the Buddha recommended that a certain path be followed which consists of:<ol>
       <li>Right Viewpoint - Realizing the Four Noble Truths <b><span class="Unicode">(samyag-d&#x1E5B;&#x1E63;&#x1E6D;i, samm&#x101;-di&#x1E6D;&#x1E6D;hi)</span></b><li>Right Values - Commitment to mental and ethical growth in moderation <b><span class="Unicode">(samyak-sa&#x1E43;kalpa, samm&#x101;-sa&#x1E45;kappa)</span></b><li>Right Speech - One speaks in a non hurtful, not exaggerated, truthful way <b><span class="Unicode">(samyag-v&#x101;c, samm&#x101;-v&#x101;c&#x101;)</span></b><li>Right Actions - Wholesome action, avoiding action that would do harm <b><span class="Unicode">(samyak-karm&#x101;nta, samm&#x101;-kammanta)</span></b><li>Right Livelihood - One&#39;s job does not harm in any way oneself or others; directly or indirectly (weapon maker, drug dealer, etc.) <b><span class="Unicode">(samyag-&#x101;j&#x12B;va, samm&#x101;-&#x101;j&#x12B;va</span>}</b><li>Right Effort - One makes an effort to improve <b><span class="Unicode">(samyag-vy&#x101;y&#x101;ma, samm&#x101;-v&#x101;y&#x101;ma)</span></b><li>Right Mindfulness - Mental ability to see things for what they are with clear consciousness <b><span class="Unicode">(samyak-sm&#x1E5B;ti, samm&#x101;-sati)</span></b><li>Right Meditation - State where one reaches enlightenment and the ego has disappeared <b><span class="Unicode">(samyak-sam&#x101;dhi, samm&#x101;-sam&#x101;dhi)</span></b></ol>
      <p>The word <b>samyak</b> means &quot;perfect&quot;. There are a number of ways to interpret the Eightfold Path. On one hand, the Eightfold Path is spoken of as being a progressive series of stages through which the practitioner moves, the culmination of one leading to the beginning of another, whereas others see the states of the &#39;Path&#39; as requiring simultaneous development. It is also common to categorize the Eightfold Path into <b><!--del_lnk--> praj&ntilde;&#x101;</b> (P&#x101;li <b>pa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#x101;</b>, wisdom), <b><!--del_lnk--> &#x15B;&#x12B;la</b> (P&#x101;li <b>s&#x12B;la</b>, virtuous behaviour) and <b><!--del_lnk--> sam&#x101;dhi</b> (concentration).<p><a id="Bodhi" name="Bodhi"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Bodhi</span></h3>

      <p><b>Bodhi</b> (<!--del_lnk--> P&#x101;li and <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> &#x92C;&#x94A;&#x927;&#x93F;, lit. <i>awakening</i>) is a title given in Buddhism to the specific awakening experience attained by <a href="../../wp/b/Buddha.htm" title="Buddha">the Buddha</a>. After attainment of Bodhi, it is believed one is freed from the cycle of <b><!--del_lnk--> <span class="Unicode">sa&#x1E43;s&#x101;ra</span></b>: birth, suffering, death and rebirth. Bodhi is attained only by the accomplishment of the <!--del_lnk--> p&#x101;ramit&#x101;s (perfections), when the <!--del_lnk--> Four Noble Truths are fully grasped, and when all <!--del_lnk--> karma has reached cessation. At this moment, all greed (<b>lobha</b>), hatred (Pali <b><span class="Unicode">do&#x1E63;a</span></b>, delusion (<b>moha</b>), ignorance (<a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> <b><!--del_lnk--> avidy&#x101;</b>, P&#x101;li <b>avijj&#x101;</b>), craving (<b>Sanskrit &#x924;&#x94D;&#x930;&#x94D;&#x936;&#x94D;&#x923;, [[<span class="Unicode">t&#x1E5B;&#x1E63;&#x1E47;&#x101;</span>]]</b>, P&#x101;li <b><span class="Unicode">ta&#x1E47;h&#x101;</span></b>) and belief in <i>that which is not the self</i> (<b><!--del_lnk--> an&#x101;tm&#x101;n</b>, P&#x101;li <b>an&#x101;tt&#x101;</b>) are extinguished. Bodhi thus implies understanding of <b><!--del_lnk--> an&#x101;tman</b> (P&#x101;li <b>anatta</b>), the absence of ego-centeredness. All schools of Buddhism recognise <!--del_lnk--> three types of Bodhi. They are <!--del_lnk--> &#x15A;r&#x101;vakabodhi (P&#x101;li: S&#x101;vakabodhi), <!--del_lnk--> Pratyekabodhi (P&#x101;li: Paccekabodhi) and Samyaksambodhi (P&#x101;li: Samm&#x101;sambodhi), the perfect enlightenment by which a <!--del_lnk--> Bodhisattva becomes a fully enlightened <a href="../../wp/b/Buddha.htm" title="Buddha">Buddha</a>. The aspiration to attain the state of samyaksambodhi, known as the Bodhisattva ideal, is considered as the highest ideal of Buddhism.<p><a id="Karma" name="Karma"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Karma</span></h3>
      <dl>

      <p>In a discourse (A.N. VI.63 Nibbedhika Sutta) the Buddha said:<dl>
       <dd>&ldquo;Intention, monks, is karma I say. Having willed, one acts through body, speech and mind&rdquo;.</dl>
      <p>According to the Buddha the moral order rests on each individual and not on any divine being:<dl>
       <dd>&quot;Owners of their own Karma, O young man, are living beings heirs of their Karma, have karma as the wombs from which they spring, having Karma as their refuge. Karma marks of living being, making them become depraved and excellent.&quot; (<i>Culakamma vibhanga sutta</i>.)</dl>
      <p>In Buddhism, Karma has a specific meaning quite different from other teachings. Karma means action derived from mental intent or volition and its result (<!--del_lnk--> Vipaka) or its effect upon the doer of that volitional deed (be that deed one of thought, word or physical action).<p><a id="Middle_Way" name="Middle_Way"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Middle Way</span></h3>
      <p>The primary guiding principle of Buddhist practice is the <!--del_lnk--> Middle Way which was discovered by the Buddha prior to his enlightenment (<b><!--del_lnk--> bodhi</b>). The <i>Middle Way</i> or <i>Middle Path</i> is often described as the practice of non-extremism; a path of moderation away from the extremes of self-indulgence and opposing self-mortification.<p><a id="Refuge_in_the_Three_Jewels" name="Refuge_in_the_Three_Jewels"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Refuge in the Three Jewels</span></h3>

The buddha who chooses the bodhisattva path makes a vow/pledge. This is considered the ultimate expression of compassion.<p>The <b>Three Jewels</b> are:<ul>
       <li>The <b><a href="../../wp/b/Buddha.htm" title="Buddha">Buddha</a></b> (i.e., <i>Awakened One</i>).

The Buddha could also be represented as the wisdom that understands Dharma, and in this regard the Buddha represents the perfect wisdom that sees reality in its true form.<li>The <b><!--del_lnk--> Dharma</b>: The teachings or law as expounded by the Buddha. Dharma also means the law of nature based on behaviour of a person and its consequences to be experienced (action and reaction).<li>The <b><!--del_lnk--> <span class="IAST Unicode" style="font-face: Arial Unicode MS, GNU Unifont, Lucida Sans Unicode; white-space: wrap; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">Sangha</span></b>: This term literally means &quot;group&quot; or &quot;congregation,&quot; but when it is used in Buddhist teaching the word refers to one of two very specific kinds of groups: either the community of Buddhist monastics (bhikkhus and bhikkhunis), or the community of people who have attained at least the first stage of Awakening (Sotapanna (<!--del_lnk--> pali &#x938;&#x94A;&#x924;&#x92A;&#x928;&#x94D;&#x928;) - one who has entered the stream to enlightenment).

The suffering caused by the karmic effects of previous thoughts, words and deeds can be alleviated by following the <!--del_lnk--> Noble Eightfold Path, although the Buddha of some Mahayana sutras, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Lotus Sutra, the <!--del_lnk--> Angulimaliya Sutra and the <!--del_lnk--> Nirvana Sutra, also teaches that powerful sutras such as the above-named can, through the very act of their being heard or recited, wipe out great swathes of negative karma.<p><a name=".C5.9A.C4.ABla_.28Virtuous_Behaviour.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">&#x15A;&#x12B;la (Virtuous Behaviour)</span></h3>

      <p><b><!--del_lnk--> &#x15A;&#x12B;la</b> (<a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>) or <b>s&#x12B;la</b> (<!--del_lnk--> P&#x101;li) is usually rendered into English as &quot;behavioural discipline&quot;, &quot;morality&quot;, or ethics. It is often translated as &quot;precept&quot;. It is an action that is an intentional effort. It is one of the <i>three practices</i> (sila - samadhi - panya) and the second <!--del_lnk--> p&#x101;ramit&#x101;. It refers to moral purity of thought, word, and deed. The four conditions of <b>&#x15B;&#x12B;la</b> are chastity, calmness, quiet, and extinguishment, i.e. no longer being susceptible to perturbation by the passions.<p>S&#x12B;la refers to overall (principles of) ethical behaviour. There are several levels of sila, which correspond to &#39;basic morality&#39; (<!--del_lnk--> five precepts), &#39;basic morality with asceticism&#39; (<!--del_lnk--> eight precepts), &#39;novice monkhood&#39; (<!--del_lnk--> ten precepts) and &#39;monkhood&#39; (<a href="../../wp/v/Vinaya.htm" title="Vinaya">Vinaya</a> or <!--del_lnk--> Patimokkha). Lay people generally undertake to live by the <!--del_lnk--> five precepts which are common to all Buddhist schools. If they wish, they can choose to undertake the <!--del_lnk--> eight precepts, which have some additional precepts of basic asceticism.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> five precepts are not given in the form of commands such as &quot;thou shalt not ...&quot;, but are training rules in order to live a better life in which one is happy, without worries, and can meditate well.<ul>
       <li>1. To refrain from taking life. (i.e. non-violence towards <!--del_lnk--> sentient life forms)<li>2. To refrain from taking that which is not freely given (i.e. not committing <!--del_lnk--> theft).<li>3. To refrain from sensual misconduct (abstinence from immoral sexual behaviour).<li>4. To refrain from lying. (i.e. speaking truth always)<li>5. To refrain from intoxicants which lead to loss of <!--del_lnk--> mindfulness.</ul>
      <p>In the <!--del_lnk--> eight precepts, the third precept on sexual misconduct is made more strict, and becomes a precept of <!--del_lnk--> celibacy.<p>The three additional rules of the eight precepts are:<ul>
       <li>6. To refrain from eating at the wrong time (only eat from sunrise to noon).<li>7. To refrain from dancing, using jewellery, going to shows, etc.<li>8. To refrain from using a high, luxurious bed.</ul>

      <p>In the language of the <!--del_lnk--> Noble Eightfold Path, <b>samyaksam&#x101;dhi</b> is &quot;right concentration&quot;. The primary means of cultivating <b>sam&#x101;dhi</b> is meditation. Almost all Buddhist schools agree that the Buddha taught two types of meditation, viz. <!--del_lnk--> <b>samatha</b> meditation (Sanskrit: <b>&#x15B;amatha</b>) and <!--del_lnk--> <b>vipassan&#x101;</b> meditation (Sanskrit: <b>vipa&#x15B;yan&#x101;</b>). Upon development of <b>sam&#x101;dhi</b>, one&#39;s mind becomes purified of defilement, calm, tranquil, and luminous.<p>Once the meditator achieves a strong and powerful concentration (<b><!--del_lnk--> jh&#x101;na</b>, Sanskrit &#x927;&#x94D;&#x92F;&#x93E;&#x928;&#x92E;&#x94D; <b>dhy&#x101;na</b>), his mind is ready to penetrate and gain insight (<!--del_lnk--> vipassan&#x101;) into the ultimate nature of reality, eventually obtaining release from all suffering. The cultivation of <!--del_lnk--> mindfulness is essential to mental concentration, which is needed to achieve insight.<p><!--del_lnk--> Samatha Meditation starts from being mindful to an object or idea, which is expanded to one&#39;s body, mind and entire surroundings, leading to a state of total concentration and tranquility (jh&#x101;na) There are many variations in the style of meditation, from sitting cross-legged or kneeling to chanting or walking. The most common method of meditation is to concentrate on one&#39;s breath, because this practice can lead to both samatha and vipassana.<p>In Buddhist practice, it is said that while samatha meditation can calm the mind, only vipassan&#x101; meditation can reveal how the mind was disturbed to start with, which is what leads to <b><!--del_lnk--> j&ntilde;&#x101;na</b> (P&#x101;li <b>&ntilde;&#x101;&#x1E47;a</b> knowledge) <b><!--del_lnk--> vij&ntilde;&#x101;na</b> (P&#x101;li <b>vi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#x101;&#x1E47;a</b> awareness), <b><!--del_lnk--> praj&ntilde;&#x101;</b> (P&#x101;li <b>pa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#x101;</b> pure understanding) and thus can lead to <b><!--del_lnk--> nirv&#x101;&#x1E47;a</b> (P&#x101;li <b>nibb&#x101;na</b>).<p><a id="Praj.C3.B1.C4.81_.28Wisdom.29" name="Praj.C3.B1.C4.81_.28Wisdom.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Praj&ntilde;&#x101; (Wisdom)</span></h3>

The result was that those 9 practices were declared unallowed according to Vinaya. After the second council however, some schisms occurred, and to resolve those schism and determine orthodoxy, a <!--del_lnk--> Third Buddhist Council was held at Pataliputta.</span><p>These schisms occurred <i>within</i> the <!--del_lnk--> traditions of Early Buddhism, at a time when the Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na movement either did not exist at all, or only existed as a current of thought not yet identified with a separate school.<p><span class="Unicode">One of the basic schisms was between the <!--del_lnk--> Sthaviras and the <!--del_lnk--> Mah&#x101;s&#x101;&#x1E45;ghikas.

      <p>Buddhism spread slowly in India until the time of the <!--del_lnk--> Mauryan emperor <!--del_lnk--> A&#x15B;oka the Great, who was a public supporter of the religion. The support of A&#x15B;oka and his descendants led to the construction of more Buddhist religious memorials (<!--del_lnk--> st&#x16B;pas) and to efforts to spread Buddhism throughout the enlarged Maurya empire and even into neighboring lands &ndash; particularly to the Iranian-speaking regions of <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Central Asia, beyond the Mauryas&#39; northwest border, and to the island of <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> south of India. These two missions, in opposite directions, would ultimately lead, in the first case to the spread of Buddhism into China, and in the second case, to the emergence of Therav&#x101;da Buddhism and its spread from Sri Lanka to the coastal lands of Southeast Asia.<p>This period marks the first spread of Buddhism beyond India. According to the <!--del_lnk--> edicts of A&#x15B;oka, emissaries were sent to various countries west of India in order to spread &quot;Dhamma&quot;, particularly in eastern provinces of the neighboring <!--del_lnk--> Seleucid Empire, and possibly even farther to <!--del_lnk--> Hellenistic kingdoms of the Mediterranean.

However, these schools became influential in northwestern India and Central Asia and, since their teaching is found among the scriptures preserved by the Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na schools, they may have had some formative influence on the Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na.

      <p>The precise geographical origins of <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana are unknown. It is likely that various elements of Mahayana developed independently from the 1st century BCE onwards, initially within several small individual communities, in areas to the north-west within the <!--del_lnk--> Kushan Empire (within present-day northern <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>), and in areas within the <!--del_lnk--> Shatavahana Empire, including <!--del_lnk--> Amaravati to the south-east (in present-day <!--del_lnk--> Andhra Pradesh), to the west around the port of <!--del_lnk--> Bharukaccha (present-day <!--del_lnk--> Bharuch, a town near <!--del_lnk--> Bombay), and around the various cave complexes, such as <!--del_lnk--> Ajanta and <!--del_lnk--> Karli (in present-day <!--del_lnk--> Gujarat and <!--del_lnk--> Maharashtra). On one side, Mahayana was a movement of lay Buddhists focused around <!--del_lnk--> stupa devotion. Pictures within the wall of a stupa representing the story of the Buddha and his previous reincarnation as a bodisattva were used to preach Buddhism to the masses. The Sangha, at the same time, became increasingly fragmented both in terms of <!--del_lnk--> Abhidharma and <a href="../../wp/v/Vinaya.htm" title="Vinaya">Vinaya</a> practice. This led to a widening distance between the laity and Sangha. The Mahayana movement, on the other hand, was ecumenical, reflecting a wide range of influence from <!--del_lnk--> various sects. Monks representing different philosophical orientations could live in the same Sangha as long as they practiced the same Vinaya. Still, in terms of Abhidharma, the <!--del_lnk--> Sarvastivada school (which had been rejected by the 3rd council, according to the Theravada tradition) and the <!--del_lnk--> Dharmaguptaka school, both of which were widespread in the Kushan Empire, seem to have had major influence. Moreover, those who believe that Mahayana sutras were composed during this period speculate that the process of reshuffling of sutras according to various Abhidharma eventually led to editing which made the composition of new Mahayana sutras possible.}}<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Around 100 CE, the Kushan emperor <!--del_lnk--> Kanishka convened the fourth Buddhist council and is usually associated with the formal rise of Mahayana Buddhism. This council is not recognised by Theravada line of Buddhism. This council did not simply rely on the original <a href="../../wp/t/Tripitaka.htm" title="Tripitaka">Tripitaka</a> in the third council. Instead, a set of new scriptures, mostly notably, the <!--del_lnk--> Lotus Sutra, an early version of the <!--del_lnk--> Heart Sutra and the <!--del_lnk--> Amitabha Sutra were approved, as well as fundamental principles of doctrine based around the concept of salvation for the masses (hence Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na &quot;great vehicle&quot;) and the concept of Buddhas and bodhisattva who embody transcendent <!--del_lnk--> Buddha-nature who strive to achieve such goal. The new scriptures were first written in <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>. From that point on, and in the space of a few centuries, Mahayana would flourish and spread from the India to <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asia, and towards the north to <!--del_lnk--> Central Asia and then east to <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> where Mahayana was <!--del_lnk--> Sinicized and this Sinicized Mahayana would be passed on to <a href="../../wp/k/Korea.htm" title="Korea">Korea</a>, <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> and finally to <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> in 538 CE.

      <p>Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na Buddhism received significant theoretical grounding from <!--del_lnk--> N&#x101;g&#x101;rjuna (c.150 - 250 CE), arguably the most influential scholar within the Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na tradition. From studying his writings, it is clear that N&#x101;g&#x101;rjuna was conversant with both the <!--del_lnk--> Nik&#x101;ya (H&#x12B;nay&#x101;na) philosophies and the emerging Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na tradition. He made explicit references to Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na texts, but his philosophy was argued within the parameters set out by the <a href="../../wp/t/Tripitaka.htm" title="Tripitaka">Tripi&#x1E6D;aka</a> s&#x16B;tras. Completely repudiating the then-dominant <!--del_lnk--> Sarv&#x101;stiv&#x101;da school, which argued for the existence of <b><!--del_lnk--> dharmas</b> (factors of existence) in past, present, and future, N&#x101;g&#x101;rjuna asserted that the nature of the dharmas (hence the enlightenment) to be <!--del_lnk--> &#x15B;&#x16B;nya (void or empty), bringing together other key Buddhist doctrines, particularly <!--del_lnk--> an&#x101;tman (no-self) and <!--del_lnk--> prat&#x12B;tyasamutp&#x101;da (dependent origination). His school of thought is known as the <!--del_lnk--> Madhyamaka.<p>After the end of the <!--del_lnk--> Ku&#x1E63;&#x101;&#x1E47;as, Buddhism flourished in India during the dynasty of the <!--del_lnk--> Guptas (4th &ndash; 6th century). Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na centres of learning were established, the most important one being the <!--del_lnk--> N&#x101;land&#x101; University in north-eastern India. Sarv&#x101;stiv&#x101;da teaching, which was criticized by N&#x101;g&#x101;rjuna was reformulated by scholars such as <!--del_lnk--> Vasubandhu and <!--del_lnk--> Asa&#x1E45;ga and were incorporated into the <!--del_lnk--> Yog&#x101;c&#x101;ra (Sanskrit: yoga practice) school. While the Madhyamaka school asserted that there is no ultimately real thing, the Yog&#x101;c&#x101;ra school asserts that only the mind is ultimately existent. These two schools of thought, in opposition or synthesis, form the basis of subsequent Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na theology.<p>There are differing views as to just when Vajray&#x101;na and its <!--del_lnk--> tantric practice started. In the Tibetan tradition, it is claimed that the historical &#x15A;&#x101;kyamuni Buddha taught tantra, but as these are esoteric teachings, they were written down long after the Buddha&#39;s other teachings. The earliest texts appeared around the early 4th century. N&#x101;land&#x101; University became a centre for the development of Vajray&#x101;na theory and continued as the source of leading-edge Vajray&#x101;na practices up through the 11th century. These practices, scriptures and theory were transmitted to China, Tibet, Indochina and Southeast Asia. China generally received Indian transmission up to the 11th century including tantric practice, while a vast amount of what is considered to be <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan Buddhism (Vajray&#x101;na) stems from the late (9th-12th century) N&#x101;land&#x101; tradition.<p><a id="Decline_of_Buddhism_in_India_and_Central_Asia" name="Decline_of_Buddhism_in_India_and_Central_Asia"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Decline of Buddhism in India and Central Asia</span></h3>
      <p>Buddhism was established in the northern regions of India and <!--del_lnk--> Central Asia, and kingdoms with Buddhist rulers such as <!--del_lnk--> Menander I and <!--del_lnk--> Kaniska. Under the rule of tolerant or even sympathetic <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Bactrian and Iranian <!--del_lnk--> Achaemenid kings, Buddhism flourished. The rulers of the <!--del_lnk--> Kush&#x101;na Empire adopted Buddhism, and it continued to thrive in the region under the rule of the <!--del_lnk--> Turk-Sh&#x101;h&#x12B;s.<p>Buddhists were briefly persecuted under the <!--del_lnk--> Zoroastrian priest-king Kirder. Syncretism between Zoroastrianism and Buddhism had resulted in the rise of a &#39;Buddha-Mazda&#39; divinity, which Kirder treated as heresy.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Hinayana traditions first spread among the <!--del_lnk--> Turkic tribes before combining with the <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana forms during the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE to cover modern-day <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, <a href="../../wp/k/Kashmir_region.htm" title="Kashmir">Kashmir</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, eastern and coastal <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a>, <a href="../../wp/u/Uzbekistan.htm" title="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Turkmenistan.htm" title="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Tajikistan.htm" title="Tajikistan">Tajikistan</a>. These were the ancient states of <!--del_lnk--> Gandhara, <!--del_lnk--> Bactria, <!--del_lnk--> Parthia and <!--del_lnk--> Sogdia from where it spread to <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>. Among the first of these Turkic tribes to adopt Buddhism was the Turki-<!--del_lnk--> Shahi who adopted Buddhism as early as the 3rd century BCE. It was not, however, the exclusive faith of this region. There were also <!--del_lnk--> Zoroastrians, <!--del_lnk--> Hindus, <!--del_lnk--> Nestorian Christians, <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jews">Jews</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Manichaeans, and followers of <!--del_lnk--> shamanism, <!--del_lnk--> Tengrism, and other indigenous, nonorganized systems of belief.<p>From the 4th Century CE on, <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hindu</a> dynasties had achieved preeminence elsewhere in India. Even in regions of Buddhist predominance, such as the northwest (<!--del_lnk--> Pa&ntilde;j&#x101;b) and the lower Gangetic plain (<!--del_lnk--> Uttar Pradesh and <!--del_lnk--> Bengal), the Indian caste system and other characteristics of Hinduism were found. In political contests between Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms, Buddhist rulers were gradually replaced by Hindu ones. By the 4th to 5th century Buddhism was already in decline in northern India, even though it was achieving multiple successes in Central Asia and along the <!--del_lnk--> Silk Road as far as China.<p>The Buddhist states of Central Asia were weakened in the 6th century following the invasion of the <!--del_lnk--> White Huns and Buddhism suffered as recorded by <!--del_lnk--> Xuanzang. Later Buddhist regions in Central Asia came either under the sway of the Persian <a href="../../wp/s/Sassanid_Empire.htm" title="Sassanid Empire">S&#x101;s&#x101;nids</a> or <a href="../../wp/t/Tibet.htm" title="Tibet">Tibet</a>. When the Muslim Arabs overthrew the S&#x101;ss&#x101;nids they encountered Buddhists in the eastern provinces of the Persian Empire. They called them by the Persian name of <i>butparast</i>, literally meaning &quot;buddha-worshipper&quot;, although the term has come to be used generally for any religion in which <!--del_lnk--> cult images play a role. Several high officials of the <a href="../../wp/a/Abbasid.htm" title="Abbasid">Abb&#x101;sid</a> Caliphate, notably the <!--del_lnk--> Barmakids, were descended from these East Iranian Buddhists.<p>When <!--del_lnk--> Muhammad ibn Q&#x101;sim led the invasion of <!--del_lnk--> Sindh at the mouth of the <!--del_lnk--> Indus river, he was aided by some Buddhists in his campaign against their Hindu overlord, <!--del_lnk--> R&#x101;j&#x101; Dahir. Relations with later Iranian rulers such as the <!--del_lnk--> Saffarids and <!--del_lnk--> Samanids were more difficult; Buddhist monasteries and st&#x16B;pas were not exempt from looting under Arab rule.<p>After the disintegration of the <a href="../../wp/a/Abbasid.htm" title="Abbasid">Abb&#x101;sid</a> Caliphate, the Muslim Turks rose to prominence among the Persian emirates that emerged in Central Asia and <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. In the 10th century CE, one of them, <!--del_lnk--> Mahm&#x16B;d of Ghazn&#x12B;, defeated the <!--del_lnk--> Hind&#x14D;-Sh&#x101;h&#x12B;s and finally brought the region firmly under Muslim rule through Afghanistan and the <!--del_lnk--> Pa&ntilde;j&#x101;b. He demolished monasteries alongside temples during his raid across north-western India but left those within his domains and <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> alone and <!--del_lnk--> al-Biruni recorded the Buddha as a prophet &quot;burxan&quot;.<p>The originally pagan Turkic tribes who lived in western Central Asia converted to Isl&#x101;m as they came to be increasingly influenced by Persian culture. As the Turkic tribes of Central Asia battled for control of land, similarly an ideological battle waged within them as <!--del_lnk--> Sufis, faced with an increasing hostile environment in Arabia, moved to <!--del_lnk--> Transoxania and found fertile ground here for converts among the Buddhist and non-Buddhist Turkic tribes alike. Buddhism persisted, together with <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Manichaeism, <!--del_lnk--> Zoroastrianism, and <!--del_lnk--> shamanism in areas to the east (modern <!--del_lnk--> Xinjiang) for several centuries, which did not become overwhelmingly Muslim until the 15th century CE; however, under the two-pronged onslaught Buddhism waned and over time Central Asia gradually became predominantly Muslim.<p>In 1215 <a href="../../wp/g/Genghis_Khan.htm" title="Genghis Khan">Genghis Khan</a> conquered <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and his horde devastated the local population indiscriminately; in 1227 after his death his conquest was divided and <!--del_lnk--> Chagatai established the <!--del_lnk--> Chagatai Khanate while <!--del_lnk--> Hulegu established the <!--del_lnk--> Il Khanate where Buddhism was the state religion across Muslim lands. In the Chagatai Khanate the Buddhist Turkic tribes slowly converted to Islam, including the occasional Khan <!--del_lnk--> . When Tarmashirin came to power he made Islam the official religion of the region in 1326. In the <!--del_lnk--> Il Khanate, <!--del_lnk--> Hulegu and his successors <!--del_lnk--> Abaqa and <!--del_lnk--> Arghun also established Buddhism as the state religion but were hostile to the Muslims. Many mosques were destroyed and numerous stupas built; however, when <!--del_lnk--> Ghazan came to power in 1295 and converted he reverted the state religion to <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> and the climate became hostile towards Buddhism. Today no stupas built by the earlier Mongol Khans survive, and after <!--del_lnk--> Ghazan&#39;s reign little mention of Buddhism can be found in Afghanistan and Central Asia.<p>Buddhists retained power in parts of northern India, in <a href="../../wp/k/Kashmir_region.htm" title="Kashmir">Ka&#x15B;m&#x12B;r</a> and especially in Bengal, where the Buddhist <!--del_lnk--> P&#x101;la kings ruled from the 8th-12th centuries CE. These last Buddhist strongholds played an important role in the evolution of the <!--del_lnk--> Vajray&#x101;na and the transmission of that form of Buddhism to <a href="../../wp/t/Tibet.htm" title="Tibet">Tibet</a> before they collapsed under assault from the Hindu <!--del_lnk--> Sena dynasty.<p>Elsewhere in India, Buddhism suffered from pressure by Hindu dynasties, such as the increasingly powerful <!--del_lnk--> Rajputs, as well as competition from a Hinduism that had gained ideological coherence and emotional vigor from such movements as <!--del_lnk--> Ved&#x101;nta philosophy and <!--del_lnk--> Bhakti devotionalism. One symptom of increased Hindu confidence with regard to Buddhism was the identification of the Buddha as an <!--del_lnk--> avat&#x101;ra of the Hindu god <!--del_lnk--> Vishnu &ndash; an identification which contradicted basic Buddhist understandings about the nature of a Buddha and of <!--del_lnk--> nirv&#x101;na.<p>In 1193, only a few decades after the fall of the P&#x101;la kingdom, <!--del_lnk--> Muhammad Khilj&#x12B; destroyed <!--del_lnk--> N&#x101;land&#x101;, the great Buddhist university. Khilj&#x12B; was one of the generals of <!--del_lnk--> Qutbudd&#x12B;n Aybak, a subject of the Afghan <!--del_lnk--> Ghurids but soon to become the monarch of a <!--del_lnk--> Muslim sultanate at Delhi. Khilj&#x12B;&#39;s march across northern India caused a precipitous decline in the fortunes of Indian Buddhism, as he destroyed Buddhist walled monasteries fortified by the Sena kings (which he thought were cities), killed the monks and burned their libraries.<p>After the <!--del_lnk--> Mongol invasions of Islamic lands across Central Asia, many <!--del_lnk--> Sufis also found themselves fleeing towards the newly established Islamic lands in India around the environs of <!--del_lnk--> Bengal. Here their influence, caste attitudes towards Buddhists, previous familiarity with Buddhism, lack of Buddhist political power or social structure along with <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>&#39;s revival movements such as <!--del_lnk--> Advaita and the rise of the syncretic <!--del_lnk--> bhakti movement, all contributed to a significant realignment of beliefs relegating Buddhism in India to the peripheries.<p>By the 13th century CE, Buddhism had become a marginal religion in central India; without a monastic infrastructure, Buddhism could not easily maintain its identity, and many Buddhists, especially in Bengal, were converted to Isl&#x101;m, Hinduism or left for the Himalayan foothills. In Ka&#x15B;m&#x12B;r Buddhism remained a significant religion down to the early 15th century, when it was displaced by Isl&#x101;m and Hinduism, except among the Tibetan peoples of <!--del_lnk--> Ladakh.<p>Elements of Buddhism have remained within India to the current day: the <!--del_lnk--> Bauls of <!--del_lnk--> Bengal have a syncretic set of practices with strong emphasis on many Buddhist concepts. Other areas of India have never parted from Buddhism, including Ladakh and other Himalayan regions with a primarily Tibetan population. <!--del_lnk--> Arunachal Pradesh and <a href="../../wp/s/Sikkim.htm" title="Sikkim">Sikkim</a> are the other Indian states where Buddhism is practiced in great numbers. The <!--del_lnk--> Newars of <a href="../../wp/n/Nepal.htm" title="Nepal">Nepal</a> also retain a form of Buddhism that differs from the Buddhism of Tibet. Furthermore, much of Buddhist philosophy was eventually absorbed into Hinduism.<p><a id="Main_Traditions" name="Main_Traditions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Main Traditions</span></h2>

      <p>Buddhist schools are usually divided into two main branches: <!--del_lnk--> Therav&#x101;da Buddhism and <!--del_lnk--> Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na Buddhism. <!--del_lnk--> Vajray&#x101;na is sometimes named as a third, but is more commonly considered a form of Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na Buddhism.<p>Another way of categorizing Buddhist schools follows the major languages of the extant Buddhist canons, which exist in <!--del_lnk--> P&#x101;li, <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan (also found in <!--del_lnk--> Mongolian translation) and <a href="../../wp/c/Chinese_language.htm" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a> collections, along with some texts that still exist in <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit.

      <p><b><!--del_lnk--> Mahayana</b> is an inclusive faith characterized by the adoption of new texts, in addition to the traditional Pali canon, and a shift in the understanding of Buddhism. It goes beyond the traditional Theravada ideal of the release from suffering (<!--del_lnk--> dukkha) and personal enlightenment of the <!--del_lnk--> arhats, to elevate the Buddha to a God-like status, and to create a pantheon of quasi-divine <!--del_lnk--> Bodhisattvas devoting themselves to personal excellence, ultimate knowledge and the salvation of humanity. In Mahayana, the Buddha became an idealized man-god and the Bodhisattva was the universal ideal of excellence.<p>The Mahayana branch emphasizes infinite, universal compassion (maha-karuna) or the selfless, ultra-altruistic quest of the Bodhisattva to attain the &quot;Awakened Mind&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> bodhicitta) of Buddhahood so as to have the fullest possible knowledge of how most effectively to lead all sentient beings into <!--del_lnk--> Nirvana. Emphasis is also often placed on the notions of Emptiness (<!--del_lnk--> shunyata, <!--del_lnk--> prajnaparamita and <!--del_lnk--> Buddha-nature. The Mahayana can also on occasion communicate a vision of the Buddha or Dharma which amounts to mysticism and give expression to a form of mentalist <!--del_lnk--> pantheism or <!--del_lnk--> panentheism (<!--del_lnk--> God in Buddhism).<p>In addition to the <a href="../../wp/t/Tripitaka.htm" title="Tripitaka">Tripitaka</a> scriptures, which (within Mahayana) are viewed as valid but only provisional or basic, Mahayana schools recognize all or part of a genre of <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana scriptures. Some of these sutras became for Mahayanists a manifestation of the Buddha himself. Mahayana Buddhism shows a great deal of doctrinal variation and development over time, and even more variation in terms of practice. While there is much agreement on general principles, there is disagreement over which texts are more authoritative.<p>Native Mahayana Buddhism is practiced today in <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="../../wp/k/Korea.htm" title="Korea">Korea</a> and most of <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>.

Vajray&#x101;na Buddhism exists today in the form of two major sub-schools: <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan Buddhism and <!--del_lnk--> Shingon Buddhism. One component of the Vajray&#x101;na is harnessing psycho-physical energy as a means of developing profoundly powerful states of concentration and awareness.

Using these techniques, it is claimed that a practitioner can achieve Buddhahood in one lifetime, or even as little as three years.

      <p>In his lifetime, the Buddha had not answered several philosophical questions. On issues like whether the world is eternal or non-eternal, finite or infinite, unity or separation of the body and the <!--del_lnk--> self, complete inexistence of a person after nirvana and then death, nature of the Supreme Truth, etc, the Buddha had remained silent. Commentators explain that such questions distract from practical activity for realizing <!--del_lnk--> enlightenment.<p>In numerous Mahayana sutras and Tantras, the Buddha stresses that Dharma (Truth) and the Buddha himself in their ultimate modus cannot truly be understood with the ordinary rational mind or logic: both Buddha and Reality (ultimately One) transcend all worldly concepts. The &quot;prajna-paramita&quot; sutras have this as one of their major themes. What is urged is study, mental and moral self-cultivation, and veneration of the sutras, which are as fingers pointing to the moon of Truth, but then to let go of ratiocination and to experience direct entry into Liberation itself. The Buddha in the self-styled &quot;Uttara-Tantra&quot;, the <!--del_lnk--> Mahaparinirvana Sutra, insists that, while pondering upon Dharma is vital, one must then relinquish fixation on words and letters, as these are utterly divorced from Liberation and the Buddha. The Tantra entitled the &quot;All-Creating King&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> Kunjed Gyalpo Tantra) also emphasises how Buddhic Truth lies beyond the range of thought and is ultimately mysterious. The Supreme Buddha, Samantabhadra, states there:<p>&quot;The mind of perfect purity [i.e. the Awakened Mind of Buddha] ... is beyond thinking and inexplicable ... It dwells in the self-perfected bliss which is deedless and self-perfected ... I am the best path of liberation. It is a path, subtle and difficult to understand, which is non-speculative and beyond thinking ... It cannot be captured in words ... It is firm, difficult to comprehend, and totally inexplicable.&quot; (<i>The Sovereign All-Creating Mind</i> tr. by E.K. Neumaier-Dargyay, pp. 111-112).<p>Also later, the famous Indian Buddhist <!--del_lnk--> yogi and teacher <!--del_lnk--> mahasiddha <!--del_lnk--> Tilopa discouraged any intellectual activity in his <!--del_lnk--> 6 words of advice.<p>Buddhist missionaries, however, often faced philosophical questions from other religions whose answers they themselves did not know. For those, who have attachment to <!--del_lnk--> intellectualism, Buddhist scholars produced a prodigious quantity of intellectual theories, philosophies and worldview concepts.

      <p>Buddhist scriptures and other texts exist in great variety. Different schools of Buddhism place varying levels of value on them. Some schools venerate certain texts as religious objects in themselves, while others take a more scholastic approach. The Buddhist canon of <!--del_lnk--> scripture is known in <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> as the <b><a href="../../wp/t/Tripitaka.htm" title="Tripitaka">Tripitaka</a></b> and in <!--del_lnk--> P&#x101;li as the <b>Tipitaka</b>. These terms literally mean &quot;three baskets&quot; and refer to the three main divisions of the canon, which are:<ul>
       <li>The <b><a href="../../wp/v/Vinaya.htm" title="Vinaya">Vinaya Pitaka</a></b>, containing disciplinary rules for the <!--del_lnk--> Sanghas of Buddhist <!--del_lnk--> monks and <!--del_lnk--> nuns, as well as a range of other texts including explanations of why and how rules were instituted, supporting material, and doctrinal clarification.<li>The <b><!--del_lnk--> S&#x16B;tra Pitaka</b> (P&#x101;li: Sutta Pitaka), contains the actual discourses of <a href="../../wp/g/Gautama_Buddha.htm" title="Gautama Buddha">the Buddha</a>.<li>The <b><!--del_lnk--> Abhidharma Pitaka</b> (P&#x101;li: <i>Abhidhamma Pitaka</i>) contains commentaries or systematic expositions of the Buddha&#39;s teachings.</ul>
      <p>Soon after the death of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held; a monk named <!--del_lnk--> Mah&#x101;k&#x101;&#x15B;yapa (P&#x101;li: Mah&#x101;kassapa) presided. The goal of the council was to record the Buddha&#39;s sayings &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> s&#x16B;tras (Sanskrit) or suttas (P&#x101;li) &ndash; and codify monastic rules (Vinaya). <!--del_lnk--> &#x100;nanda, the Buddha&#39;s personal attendant, was called upon to recite the discourses of the Buddha, and <!--del_lnk--> Up&#x101;li, another disciple, recited the rules of the Vinaya. These became the basis of the Tripitaka. However, this record was initially transmitted orally in form of chanting, and was committed to text in a much later period. Both the s&#x16B;tras and the Vinaya of every Buddhist school contain a wide variety of elements including discourses on the Dharma, commentaries on other teachings, cosmological and cosmogonical texts, stories of the Buddha&#39;s previous lives, and lists relating to various subjects.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Therav&#x101;da and other <!--del_lnk--> Nik&#x101;ya schools believe that the texts of their canon contain the actual words of the Buddha. The Therav&#x101;da canon, also known as the <a href="../../wp/p/Pali_Canon.htm" title="Pali Canon">P&#x101;li Canon</a> after the language it was written in, contains some four million words. Other texts, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na s&#x16B;tras, are also considered to be the word of the Buddha, but were transmitted either in secret, via lineages of mythical beings (such as the <!--del_lnk--> n&#x101;gas), or came directly from other <a href="../../wp/b/Buddha.htm" title="Buddha">Buddhas</a> or <!--del_lnk--> bodhisattvas. Some six hundred Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na sutras have survived in Sanskrit or in <a href="../../wp/c/Chinese_language.htm" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a> or <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan translations.<p>The followers of Therav&#x101;da Buddhism take the scriptures known as the P&#x101;li Canon as definitive and authoritative, while the followers of Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na Buddhism base their faith and philosophy primarily on the Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na s&#x16B;tras and their own versions of the Vinaya. The P&#x101;li sutras, along with other, closely-related scriptures, are known to the other schools as the <!--del_lnk--> &#x101;gamas.<p>Whereas the Therav&#x101;dins adhere solely to the &#x101;gamas and their commentaries, the adherents of Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na accept both the agamas and the Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na s&#x16B;tras as authentic and valid teachings of the Buddha, designed for different types of persons and different levels of spiritual penetration. For the Therav&#x101;dins, however, the Mahayana s&#x16B;tras are works of poetic fiction, not the words of the Buddha himself. The Theravadins are confident that the agamas represent the full and final statement by the Buddha of his Dhamma - and nothing more is truly needed beyond that. Anything added which claims to be the word of the Buddha and yet is not found in the Nikayas or their scholastic commentaries is treated with extreme caution if not outright rejection by Theravada.<p>For the Mah&#x101;y&#x101;nists, in contrast, the &#x101;gamas do indeed contain basic, foundational, and, therefore, relatively weighty pronouncements of the Buddha, but in their view, the Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na sutras articulate the Buddha&#39;s higher, more advanced and deeper doctrines, reserved for those who follow the exalted bodhisattva path. That path is built upon the motivation to achieve not only personal liberation, but Buddhahood itself in order to know how best to liberate all living beings from unhappiness. Hence the name <i>Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na</i> (lit., <i>the Great Vehicle</i>), which has room for both the general masses of sentient beings and those who are more developed. The &quot;Great&quot; of &quot;Maha-yana&quot; is indeed typical of much of this version of Buddhism - from the physical bigness (lengthiness) of some of the Mahayana sutras and the vastness of the Bodhisattva vow (to strive for <b>all</b> future time to help free other persons and creatures from pain), to the numbers of beings who are sought to be saved (infinitudes), to the (in some sutras and Tantras) final attainment of the Buddha&#39;s &quot;<b>Great</b> Self&quot; (<i>mahatman</i>) in the sphere of &quot;<b>Great</b> Nirvana&quot; (<i>mahanirvana</i>). For the Theravadins, however, this alleged &quot;greatness&quot; proclaimed by some Mahayana sutras does not necessarily equate to &quot;true&quot;.<p>Unlike many religions, Buddhism has no single central text that is universally referred to by all traditions. The size and complexity of the Buddhist canons have been seen by some (including Buddhist social reformer <!--del_lnk--> Babasaheb Ambedkar) as presenting barriers to the wider understanding of Buddhist philosophy.<p>Over the years, various attempts have been made at synthesizing a single Buddhist text that will encompass all of the major principles of Buddhism. In the <!--del_lnk--> Theravada tradition, condensed &#39;study texts&#39; were created that combined popular or influential scriptures into single volumes that could be studied by novice monks. Later in Sri Lanka, the <!--del_lnk--> Dhammapada was championed as a unifying scripture.<p><!--del_lnk--> Dwight Goddard collected what he felt was a representative sample of Buddhist scriptures- along with other classics of Eastern philosophy, such as the <a href="../../wp/t/Tao_Te_Ching.htm" title="Tao Te Ching">Tao Te Ching</a>- into his <!--del_lnk--> Buddhist Bible in the 1920&#39;s. More recently, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar attempted to create a single, combined document of Buddhist principles with his <!--del_lnk--> &ldquo;The Buddha and His Dhamma&rdquo;. Other such efforts have persisted to the present day, but currently there is no single text widely accepted as being central to all Buddhist traditions.<p><a id="Present_state_of_Buddhism" name="Present_state_of_Buddhism"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Present state of Buddhism</span></h2>

      <p>At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West, Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East, Buddhism is regarded as familiar and part of the establishment. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organised and well funded. In a number of countries, it is recognised as an official religion and receives state support. In the West, Buddhism is recognised as one of the growing spiritual influences. <p>
