It received a royal charter in 1155 and was granted county status in 1373. For half a millennium it was the second or third largest English city, until the rapid rise of <a href="../../wp/l/Liverpool.htm" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Manchester.htm" title="Manchester">Manchester</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Birmingham.htm" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> in the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> of the 1780s. It borders on the unitary districts of <!--del_lnk--> Bath and North East Somerset, <!--del_lnk--> North Somerset and <!--del_lnk--> South Gloucestershire, and has a short coastline on the <!--del_lnk--> Bristol Channel.<p>Bristol is one of the main centres of culture, employment and education in the region. From its earliest days, its prosperity has been linked to that of the <!--del_lnk--> Port of Bristol, the commercial <!--del_lnk--> port, which was in the city centre but has now moved to the Bristol Channel coast at <!--del_lnk--> Avonmouth and <!--del_lnk--> Portbury. In more recent years the economy has been built on the <!--del_lnk--> aerospace industry, and the city centre docks have been regenerated as a centre of heritage and culture. The city is famous for its unique music and film industries, and was a finalist for the 2008 <!--del_lnk--> European Capital of Culture.<p>

      <p>There is evidence of settlement in the Bristol area from the <!--del_lnk--> palaeolithic era, with 60,000-year-old archaeological finds at <!--del_lnk--> Shirehampton and <!--del_lnk--> St Annes. There are <a href="../../wp/i/Iron_Age.htm" title="Iron age">iron age</a> <!--del_lnk--> hill forts near the city, at <!--del_lnk--> Leigh Woods and <!--del_lnk--> Clifton Down on the side of the <a href="../../wp/a/Avon_Gorge.htm" title="Avon Gorge">Avon Gorge</a>, and on <!--del_lnk--> Kingsweston Hill, near <!--del_lnk--> Henbury. During the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Britain.htm" title="Roman Britain">Roman era</a> there was a settlement, <i>Abona</i>, at what is now <!--del_lnk--> Sea Mills, connected to <!--del_lnk--> Bath by <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_road.htm" title="Roman road">Roman road</a>, and another settlement at what is now <!--del_lnk--> Inns Court. There were also isolated villas and small settlements throughout the area.<p>The town of <i>Brycgstow</i> (<a href="../../wp/o/Old_English_language.htm" title="Old English language">Old English</a>, &quot;the place at the bridge&quot;) was in existence by the beginning of the 11th century, and under Norman rule acquired one of the strongest <!--del_lnk--> castles in southern England. The River Avon in the city centre has slowly evolved into <!--del_lnk--> Bristol Harbour, and since the 12th century the harbour has been an important port, handling much of England&#39;s trade with <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. In 1247 a new bridge was built and the town was extended to incorporate neighbouring suburbs, becoming in 1373 a <!--del_lnk--> county in its own right. During this period Bristol also became a centre of shipbuilding and manufacturing. Bristol was the starting point for many important voyages, notably <a href="../../wp/j/John_Cabot.htm" title="John Cabot">John Cabot</a>&#39;s 1497 voyage of exploration to North America.<p>By the 14th century Bristol was England&#39;s third-largest town (after London and <a href="../../wp/y/York.htm" title="York">York</a>), with perhaps 15-20,000 inhabitants on the eve of the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Death.htm" title="Black Death">Black Death</a> of 1348-49. The plague inflicted a prolonged pause in the growth of Bristol&#39;s population, with numbers remaining at 10-12,000 through most of the 15th and 16th centuries. The <!--del_lnk--> Diocese of Bristol was founded in 1542, with the former <a href="../../wp/a/Abbey.htm" title="Abbey">Abbey</a> of St Augustine becoming <!--del_lnk--> Bristol Cathedral. Traditionally this is equivalent to the town being granted <a href="../../wp/c/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="City status in the United Kingdom">city status</a>. During the <!--del_lnk--> 1640s Civil War the city suffered through Royalist military occupation and plague.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Renewed growth came with the 17th-century rise of England&#39;s American colonies and the rapid 18th-century expansion of England&#39;s part in the Atlantic trade in Africans taken for <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slavery</a> in the <!--del_lnk--> Americas. Bristol, along with <a href="../../wp/l/Liverpool.htm" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, became a significant centre for the slave trade although few slaves were brought to Britain. During the height of the slave trade, from 1700 to 1807, more than 2000 slaving ships were fitted out at Bristol, carrying a (conservatively) estimated half a million people from <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a> to the Americas and slavery. Fishermen who left Bristol were long part of the migratory fishery to the <!--del_lnk--> Grand Banks of <!--del_lnk--> Newfoundland and began settling that island permanently in larger numbers around this time. Bristol&#39;s strong nautical ties meant that maritime safety was an important issue in the city, In the 19th century <!--del_lnk--> Samuel Plimsoll, &quot;the sailor&#39;s friend&quot;, campaigned fearlessly to make the seas safer. He was shocked by the scandal of overloaded cargoes and successfully fought for a compulsory loadline on ships.<p>Competition from Liverpool from c.1760, the disruption of maritime commerce through war with <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> (1793) and the abolition of the slave trade (1807) contributed to the city&#39;s failure to keep pace with the newer manufacturing centres of the North and Midlands. The long passage up the heavily tidal Avon Gorge, which had made the port highly secure during the middle ages, had become a liability which the construction of a new &quot;Floating Harbour&quot; (designed by <!--del_lnk--> William Jessop) in 1804&ndash;9 failed to overcome. Nevertheless, Bristol&#39;s population (66,000 in 1801) quintupled during the 19th century, supported by new industries and growing commerce. It was particularly associated with the Victorian engineer <a href="../../wp/i/Isambard_Kingdom_Brunel.htm" title="Isambard Kingdom Brunel">Isambard Kingdom Brunel</a>, who designed the <!--del_lnk--> Great Western Railway between Bristol and London, two pioneering Bristol-built steamships, and the <a href="../../wp/c/Clifton_Suspension_Bridge.htm" title="Clifton Suspension Bridge">Clifton Suspension Bridge</a>. <!--del_lnk--> John Wesley founded the very first <!--del_lnk--> Methodist Chapel, in Bristol in 1739.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Bristol&#39;s city centre suffered severe damage from bombing during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. The original central shopping area, near the bridge and castle, is now a park containing two bombed out churches and some tiny fragments of the castle. A third bombed church nearby, St Nicholas, has been restored and currently houses private city council offices despite containing a <!--del_lnk--> triptych by <a href="../../wp/w/William_Hogarth.htm" title="William Hogarth">William Hogarth</a>, painted for the high altar of <!--del_lnk--> St Mary Redcliffe in 1756. Like much British post-war planning, the rebuilding of <!--del_lnk--> Bristol city centre was characterised by large, cheap <!--del_lnk--> tower blocks, <!--del_lnk--> brutalist architecture and expansion of roads. Since the 1980s this trend has changed with the closure of some main roads, the restoration of the Georgian period Queen&#39;s and Portland Squares, the current demolition and rebuilding of the Broadmead shopping centre and, in 2006, one of the city centre&#39;s tallest post-war blocks was torn down. The removal of the docks to <!--del_lnk--> Avonmouth, seven miles (11 km) downstream from the city centre has also allowed substantial corporate redevelopment of the old central dock area (the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Floating Harbour&quot;) in recent decades, although at one time the continued existence of the docks was in jeopardy as it was viewed as a derelict industrial site rather than a potential asset.<p><a id="Economy_and_industry" name="Economy_and_industry"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy and industry</span></h2>

      <p>As well as Bristol&#39;s nautical connections, the city&#39;s economy is reliant on the <!--del_lnk--> aerospace industry, the media, information technology and financial services sectors and tourism. In 1998 Bristol&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> GDP was &pound;6.224 billion <!--del_lnk--> GBP, and the combined GDP of South Gloucestershire, North Somerset and B&amp;NES was &pound;6.98 billion. The GDP per head was &pound;15,472, making the city more affluent than the UK as a whole, at 23% above the national average. This makes it the second-highest per-capita GDP of an English city, after London, and 34th in the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a>, as well as the only English core city with a GDP above the national average. In December 2005, Bristol&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> unemployment rate was 5.2%, compared to 3.6% for the south west and 4.8% for the United Kingdom.<p>While Bristol&#39;s economy is no longer reliant upon its port, the city is the largest importer of cars to the UK. Since the port was leased in 1991, &pound;330 million has been invested and the annual tonnage throughput has increased from 4m tonnes to 12m tonnes. The financial services sector employs 40,000 in the city, and the hi-tech sector is important, with 400 micro-electronics and silicon design companies, as well as the <!--del_lnk--> Hewlett-Packard national research laboratories. Bristol is the UK&#39;s seventh most popular destination for foreign tourists, and the city receives nine million visitors each year.<p>In the 20th century, Bristol&#39;s manufacturing activities expanded to include aircraft production at <!--del_lnk--> Filton, by the <!--del_lnk--> Bristol Aeroplane Company, and aero-engine manufacture by <!--del_lnk--> Bristol Aero Engines (later <!--del_lnk--> Rolls-Royce) at <!--del_lnk--> Patchway. The aeroplane company became famous for the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> <!--del_lnk--> Bristol Fighter, and <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">Second World War</a> <!--del_lnk--> Blenheim and <!--del_lnk--> Beaufighter aircraft. In the 1950s it became one of the country&#39;s major manufacturers of civil aircraft, with the <!--del_lnk--> Bristol Freighter and <!--del_lnk--> Britannia and the huge <!--del_lnk--> Brabazon airliner. The <!--del_lnk--> Bristol Aeroplane Company diversified into car manufacturing in the 1940s, building luxury hand-built cars at their factory in <!--del_lnk--> Filton, under the name <!--del_lnk--> Bristol Cars, which became independent from the Bristol Aeroplane Company in 1960.<p>In the 1960s Filton played a key role in the Anglo-French <i><a href="../../wp/c/Concorde.htm" title="Concorde">Concorde</a></i> supersonic airliner project. Concorde components were manufactured in British and French factories and shipped to the two final assembly plants, in <!--del_lnk--> Toulouse and Filton. The French manufactured the centre fuselage and centre wing and the British the nose, rear fuselage, fin and wingtips, while the Rolls-Royce/Snecma 593 engine&#39;s manufacture was split between <!--del_lnk--> Rolls-Royce (Filton) and <!--del_lnk--> SNECMA (<a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>). The British Concorde prototype made its maiden flight from Filton to <!--del_lnk--> RAF Fairford on <!--del_lnk--> 9 April <!--del_lnk--> 1969, five weeks after the French test flight. In 2003 the companies running Concorde made the decision to cease flying the aircraft and to retire them to locations (mostly museums) around the world. On <!--del_lnk--> 26 November <!--del_lnk--> 2003, Concorde 216 made the final Concorde flight, returning to Filton airfield to be kept there permanently as the centrepiece of a projected air museum. This museum will include the existing Bristol Aero Collection, which includes a <!--del_lnk--> Bristol Britannia aircraft.<p>The major <!--del_lnk--> aerospace companies in Bristol now are <a href="../../wp/b/BAE_Systems.htm" title="BAE Systems">BAE Systems</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Airbus.htm" title="Airbus">Airbus</a> and Rolls-Royce, all based at Filton. Another important <!--del_lnk--> aviation company in the city is <!--del_lnk--> Cameron Balloons, the world&#39;s largest manufacturer of <a href="../../wp/h/Hot_air_balloon.htm" title="Hot air balloon">hot air balloons</a>. Annually, in August, the city is host to the <!--del_lnk--> Bristol International Balloon Fiesta, one of Europe&#39;s largest hot air balloon events.<br clear="all" />

      <p>In summer the grounds of <!--del_lnk--> Ashton Court to the west of the city play host to the <!--del_lnk--> Bristol International Balloon Fiesta, a major event for <a href="../../wp/h/Hot_air_balloon.htm" title="Hot air balloon">hot-air ballooning</a> in the UK. The Fiesta draws a substantial crowd even for the early morning lift that typically begins at about 6.30 am. Events and a fairground entertain the crowds during the day. A second mass ascent is then made in the early evening, again taking advantage of lower wind speeds. Ashton Court also plays host to the <!--del_lnk--> Ashton Court festival each summer, an outdoors music festival which used to be known as the Bristol Community Festival.<p>The city&#39;s principal theatre company, the <!--del_lnk--> Bristol Old Vic, was founded in 1946 as an offshoot of the <!--del_lnk--> Old Vic company in London. Its premises on King Street consist of the 1766 Theatre Royal (400 seats), a modern studio theatre called the New Vic (150 seats), and foyer and bar areas in the adjacent Coopers&#39; Hall (built 1743). The Theatre Royal is a grade I <!--del_lnk--> listed building and the oldest continuously-operating theatre in England. The Prestigious <!--del_lnk--> Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, which had originated in King street is now a separate company. The <!--del_lnk--> Bristol Hippodrome is a larger theatre (1981 seats) which hosts national touring productions, while the 2000-seat <!--del_lnk--> Colston Hall, named after <!--del_lnk--> Edward Colston, is the city&#39;s main concert venue. Other theatres include the Tobacco Factory, QEH and Redgrave Theatres. Bristol is home to many live music venues, of which <!--del_lnk--> The Old Duke is perhaps the best known.<p>The music scene is thriving and significant. From the late 1970s onwards it was home to a crop of cultish bands combining punk, funk, dub and political consciousness, the most celebrated being <!--del_lnk--> The Pop Group. Ten years later, Bristol was the birthplace of a type of English <a href="../../wp/h/Hip_hop_music.htm" title="Hip hop music">hip-hop</a> music called <!--del_lnk--> trip hop or the &quot;Bristol Sound&quot;, epitomised in the work of artists such as <!--del_lnk--> Tricky, <!--del_lnk--> Portishead, <!--del_lnk--> Smith &amp; Mighty and <!--del_lnk--> Massive Attack. It is also a stronghold of <!--del_lnk--> drum n bass with notable artists such as the Mercury Prize winning <!--del_lnk--> Roni Size<!--del_lnk--> /Reprazent and <!--del_lnk--> Kosheen as well as the pioneering <!--del_lnk--> DJ Krust and <!--del_lnk--> More Rockers. This music is part of the wider Bristol urban culture scene which received international media attention in the 1990s and still thrives today.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery houses a collection of natural history, archaeology, local glassware, Chinese ceramics and art. The <!--del_lnk--> Bristol Industrial Museum, on the dockside, shows local industrial heritage and operates a steam railway, boat trips, and working dockside cranes. The City Museum also runs three preserved historic houses: the Tudor Red Lodge, the Georgian House, and <!--del_lnk--> Blaise Castle House. The <!--del_lnk--> Watershed Media Centre and <!--del_lnk--> Arnolfini gallery, both in disused dockside warehouses, exhibit contemporary art, photography and cinema.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Stop frame animation films and commercials painstakingly produced by <!--del_lnk--> Aardman Animations and high quality television series focusing on the natural world have also brought fame and artistic credit to the city. The city is home to the regional headquarters of <!--del_lnk--> BBC West, and the <!--del_lnk--> BBC Natural History Unit. Locations in and around Bristol often feature in the BBC&#39;s natural history programmes, including the cult children&#39;s television programme <i><!--del_lnk--> Animal Magic</i>, filmed at <!--del_lnk--> Bristol Zoo.<p>In literature Bristol is noted as the birth place of <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Chatterton, chief poet of the 18th-century Gothic literary revival, England&#39;s youngest writer of mature verse, and precursor of the Romantic movement. <!--del_lnk--> Robert Southey was born in Wine Street, Bristol in 1774, <a href="../../wp/s/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge.htm" title="Samuel Taylor Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a> and Southey married the Bristol Fricker sisters; and <!--del_lnk--> William Wordsworth spent time in the city where <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Cottle first published <!--del_lnk--> Lyrical Ballads in 1798.<p>The 18th and 19th century portrait painter Sir <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Lawrence and 19th century architect <!--del_lnk--> Francis Greenway, designer of many of <a href="../../wp/s/Sydney.htm" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>&#39;s first buildings, came from the city, and more recently the infamous <!--del_lnk--> graffiti artist <a href="../../wp/b/Banksy.htm" title="Banksy">Banksy</a>. Many famous comedians are locals, including <!--del_lnk--> Justin Lee Collins, <!--del_lnk--> Lee Evans, and writer/comedian <!--del_lnk--> Stephen Merchant. Bristol University has given us the satirist <!--del_lnk--> Chris Morris, <!--del_lnk--> Simon Pegg and <!--del_lnk--> Nick Frost of <i><!--del_lnk--> Spaced</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Shaun of the Dead</i> and <!--del_lnk--> Matt Lucas and <!--del_lnk--> David Walliams of <i><!--del_lnk--> Little Britain</i> fame. Hollywood actor <!--del_lnk--> Cary Grant was born in the city, <!--del_lnk--> Patrick Stewart, <!--del_lnk--> Jane Lapotaire, <!--del_lnk--> Pete Postlethwaite, <!--del_lnk--> Jeremy Irons, <!--del_lnk--> Greta Scacchi, <!--del_lnk--> Miranda Richardson, <!--del_lnk--> Helen Baxendale, <a href="../../wp/d/Daniel_Day-Lewis.htm" title="Daniel Day-Lewis">Daniel Day-Lewis</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Gene Wilder and <!--del_lnk--> Tony Robinson (<i><!--del_lnk--> Blackadder</i>) are amongst the many actors who learnt their craft at the world famous <!--del_lnk--> Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, opened by <!--del_lnk--> Sir Lawrence Olivier in 1946 and <!--del_lnk--> Hugo Weaving (<!--del_lnk--> Agent Smith, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Matrix</i>) studied at <!--del_lnk--> Queen Elizabeth&#39;s Hospital School.<p>Bristol has a daily morning <a href="../../wp/n/Newspaper.htm" title="Newspaper">newspaper</a>, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Western Daily Press</i>; an evening paper, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Evening Post</i>; a weekly free newspaper, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Bristol Observer</i>; and a Bristol edition of the free <i><!--del_lnk--> Metro</i> newspaper. The local weekly listings magazine, <i><!--del_lnk--> Venue</i>, covers the city&#39;s music, theatre and arts scenes. All of these papers are owned by the <!--del_lnk--> Northcliffe Group. The city has several local radio stations, including <!--del_lnk--> BBC Radio Bristol, <!--del_lnk--> GWR FM, <!--del_lnk--> Classic Gold 1260 and a university station, <!--del_lnk--> The Hub.<p>A distinctive dialect of <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> is spoken in Bristol (known colloquially as <i>Brizzle</i> or <i>Bristle</i>). Unusually for an urban area of England, this is a <!--del_lnk--> rhotic dialect, in which the <i>r</i> in words like <i>car</i> is pronounced. It is perhaps this element of the dialect which has led outsiders to dub it &quot;farmer speech&quot;. The most unusual feature of this dialect, unique to Bristol, is the <i>Bristol L</i> (or <i>terminal L</i>), in which an <i>L</i> sound is appended to words that end in a letter <i>a</i>. Thus &quot;area&quot; becomes &quot;areal&quot;, etc. This is how the city&#39;s name evolved from Brycgstow to have a final &#39;L&#39; sound: Bristol. Further Bristolian linguistic features are:-<ul>
       <li>The addition of a superfluous &quot;to&quot; in questions relating to direction or orientation, or using &quot;to&quot; instead of &quot;at&quot;.<li>Using male <!--del_lnk--> pronouns &quot;he&quot;, &quot;him&quot; instead of &quot;it&quot;.</ul>
      <p>For example, &quot;Where&#39;s that?&quot; would be phrased as &quot;Where&#39;s he to?&quot;, a feature exported to <!--del_lnk--> Newfoundland English.<p><a id="Politics_and_government" name="Politics_and_government"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Politics and government</span></h2>

      <p>Bristol City Council consists of 70 councillors representing 35 wards. They are elected in thirds with two councillors per ward, each serving a four-year term. Wards never have both councillors up for election at the same time, so effectively two-thirds of the wards are up each election. The Council has long been dominated by the <!--del_lnk--> Labour Party, but recently the <a href="../../wp/l/Liberal_Democrats.htm" title="Liberal Democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> have grown strong in the city and took minority control of the Council in 2005. The Council Leader is Liberal Democrat Councillor <!--del_lnk--> Barbara Janke and the Lord Mayor is <!--del_lnk--> Conservative Councillor <!--del_lnk--> Peter Abraham.<p>Bristol&#39;s constituencies in the <a href="../../wp/b/British_House_of_Commons.htm" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a> cross the borders with neighbouring authorities, and the city is divided into Bristol <!--del_lnk--> West, <!--del_lnk--> East, <!--del_lnk--> South and <!--del_lnk--> North-west and <!--del_lnk--> Kingswood. <!--del_lnk--> Northavon also covers some of the suburbs, but none of the administrative county. At the next General Election, the boundaries will be changed to coincide with the county boundary. Kingswood will no longer cover any of the county, and a new <!--del_lnk--> Filton and Bradley Stoke constituency will include the suburbs in South Gloucestershire. There are currently four <!--del_lnk--> Labour and one Liberal Democrat <!--del_lnk--> Members of Parliaments.<p>Bristol has a tradition of local political activism, and has been home to many important political figures. <!--del_lnk--> Tony Benn, a veteran left-wing politician, was Member of Parliament (MP) for <!--del_lnk--> Bristol South East from 1950 to 1983. <a href="../../wp/e/Edmund_Burke.htm" title="Edmund Burke">Edmund Burke</a>, MP for the <!--del_lnk--> Bristol constituency for six years from 1774, famously insisted that he was a Member of Parliament first, rather than a representative of his constituents&#39; interests. In 1963, <!--del_lnk--> Paul Stephenson led a boycott of the city&#39;s buses after the Bristol Omnibus Co. refused to employ black drivers and conductors. The boycott is known to have influenced the creation of the UK&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Race Relations Act in 1965. The women&#39;s rights campaigner <!--del_lnk--> Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence (1867&ndash;1954) was born in Bristol. Local support of <!--del_lnk--> fair trade issues was recognised in 2005 when Bristol was granted <!--del_lnk--> Fairtrade City status.<p>Bristol is unusual in having been a city with county status since medieval times. The county was expanded to include suburbs such as <!--del_lnk--> Clifton in 1835, and it was named a <!--del_lnk--> county borough in 1889, when the term was first introduced. However, on <!--del_lnk--> 1 April 1974, it became a local government district of the short-lived county of <!--del_lnk--> Avon. On <!--del_lnk--> 1 April 1996, it once again regained its independence and county status, when the county of Avon was abolished and Bristol became a <!--del_lnk--> Unitary Authority.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>In 2004 the <!--del_lnk--> Office for National Statistics estimated the county&#39;s population at 393,900, making it the 47th-largest ceremonial county in England. Using <!--del_lnk--> Census 2001 data the ONS estimated the contiguous built-up area to be 420,556, and <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan area to be 550,000.

At 3,599 people per <!--del_lnk--> square kilometre it has the seventh-highest population density of any English district.<p>In the 2001 census 91.83% of the population described themselves as white, 2.85% as South Asian, 2.32% as black, 2.08% as mixed race, 0.56% as Chinese and 0.34% other.

The rivers <!--del_lnk--> Avon and <!--del_lnk--> Frome cut through this limestone to the underlying clays, creating Bristol&#39;s characteristic hilly lansdscape. The Avon flows from Bath in the east, through <!--del_lnk--> flood plains and areas which were marshy before the growth of the city. To the west the Avon has cut through the limestone to form the <a href="../../wp/a/Avon_Gorge.htm" title="Avon Gorge">Avon Gorge</a>, partly aided by glacial meltwater after the last <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_age.htm" title="Ice age">ice age</a>. The gorge aided in the protection of Bristol Harbour, and has been quarried for stone to build the city. The land surrounding the gorge has been protected from development, as <!--del_lnk--> The Downs and <!--del_lnk--> Leigh Woods. The gorge and <!--del_lnk--> estuary of the Avon form the county&#39;s boundary with North Somerset, and the river flows into the <!--del_lnk--> Bristol Channel at <!--del_lnk--> Avonmouth at the mouth of the <a href="../../wp/r/River_Severn.htm" title="River Severn">River Severn</a>.

The city is partially sheltered by <!--del_lnk--> Exmoor and the <a href="../../wp/m/Mendip_Hills.htm" title="Mendip Hills">Mendip Hills</a>, but exposed from the <!--del_lnk--> Bristol Channel, and annual rainfall is similar to the national average, at 741-1060 <!--del_lnk--> mm.<p><a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h2>

The <!--del_lnk--> Create centre is home to many sustainable development projects and life-long learning schemes. The city has 129 infants and primary schools, 17 secondary schools, and three city learning centres.

As well as research at the two universities and <!--del_lnk--> Southmead Hospital, science education is important in the city, with <!--del_lnk--> At-Bristol, <!--del_lnk--> Bristol Zoo and <!--del_lnk--> Bristol Festival of Nature being prominent educational organisations.

      <p>There are two principal <!--del_lnk--> railway stations in Bristol, <!--del_lnk--> Bristol Parkway and <!--del_lnk--> Bristol Temple Meads, and there are scheduled coach links to most major UK cities. The city is connected by road on an east-west axis from <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> to <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a> by the <!--del_lnk--> M4 motorway, and on a north-southwest axis from <a href="../../wp/b/Birmingham.htm" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> to <!--del_lnk--> Exeter by the <!--del_lnk--> M5 motorway. Also within the county is the <!--del_lnk--> M49 motorway, a shortcut between the M5 in the south and M4 <!--del_lnk--> Severn Crossing in the west. The <!--del_lnk--> M32 motorway is a spur from the M4 to the city centre. The city is also served by its own airport, <!--del_lnk--> Bristol International (BRS), at Lulsgate, which has recently seen substantial investments in its runway, terminal and other facilities.<p>Public transport in the city consists largely of its bus network, provided by <!--del_lnk--> First Group. Buses in the city have been criticised for being unreliable and expensive, and in 2005 First were fined for delays and safety violations. Use of private cars in Bristol is high, and the city suffers from congestion problems, estimated to cost the economy &pound;350 million per year. Since 2000 the city council has included a <!--del_lnk--> light rail system in its <!--del_lnk--> Local Transport Plan, but has so far been unable to fund the project. The city was offered <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> funding for the system, but the <!--del_lnk--> Department for Transport did not provide the required additional funding. As well as support for public transport, there are several road building schemes supported by the local council, including re-routing and improving the <!--del_lnk--> South Bristol Ring Road. The central part of the city has water-based transport, operated as the <!--del_lnk--> Bristol Ferry Boat, which provide both leisure and commuter services on the harbour.<p>Bristol was never well served by suburban railways, though the <!--del_lnk--> Severn Beach Line to Avonmouth and <!--del_lnk--> Severn Beach survived the <a href="../../wp/b/Beeching_Axe.htm" title="Beeching Axe">Beeching Axe</a> and is still in operation. The <!--del_lnk--> Portishead Railway was closed to passengers under the Beeching Axe, but was relaid in 2000-2002 as far as the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Portbury Dock with a <!--del_lnk--> Strategic Rail Authority rail-freight grant. Plans to relay a further three miles of track to <!--del_lnk--> Portishead, a largely <!--del_lnk--> dormitory town with only one connecting road, have been discussed but there is insufficient funding to rebuild stations.<p>Despite being hilly, Bristol is one of the prominent cycling cities of England, and is home to the national cycle campaigning group <!--del_lnk--> Sustrans. It has a number of urban cycle routes, as well as links to <!--del_lnk--> National Cycle Network routes to Bath and London, to Gloucester and Wales, and to the south-western peninsula of England. Cycling has grown rapidly in the city, at 1.64% between 1991 and 2001, and 21% between 2001 and 2005.<p><a id="Twin_cities" name="Twin_cities"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Twin cities</span></h2>
