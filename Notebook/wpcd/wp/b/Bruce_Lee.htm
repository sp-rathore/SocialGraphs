      <p>Bruce Lee was an <!--del_lnk--> American Born Chinese (ABC) born at the <i>Chinese Hospital</i> in <a href="../../wp/s/San_Francisco%252C_California.htm" title="San Francisco, California">San Francisco, California</a> in 1940 to his Chinese father <!--del_lnk--> Lee Hoi-Chuen and Chinese-<!--del_lnk--> German mother Grace Lee. Lee&#39;s parents were on a one-year U.S. tour with the <!--del_lnk--> Cantonese Opera Company.<p><a id="Names" name="Names"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Names</span></h3>
      <p>Bruce&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Cantonese given name, <b>&#x632F;&#x85E9;</b> (Jun Fan <!--del_lnk--> Cantonese: <i>Janf&agrave;an</i> <!--del_lnk--> Pinyin: <i>Zh&egrave;nf&aacute;n</i>), literally means &quot;invigorate <a href="../../wp/s/San_Francisco%252C_California.htm" title="San Francisco, California">San Francisco</a>.&quot; At birth, he was given the English name &quot;Bruce&quot; by Dr. Mary Glover. Mrs. Lee had not initially planned on an American name but deemed it appropriate and concurred with Dr. Glover. Interestingly the name &quot;Bruce&quot; was never used within his family until he enrolled in <!--del_lnk--> La Salle College, a <a href="../../wp/h/Hong_Kong.htm" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> <!--del_lnk--> high school, at 12 years of age,  and then again at another Catholic boys&#39; school, <!--del_lnk--> St Francis Xavier&#39;s College.<p>In addition, Lee initially had a birth name <b>&#x674E;&#x70AB;&#x91D1;</b>  (<!--del_lnk--> Cantonese: <i>L&eacute;i Y&ugrave;ng&#x101;m</i> <!--del_lnk--> Pinyin: <i>L&#x1D0; Xu&agrave;nj&#x12B;n</i>) given by his mother, as at the time Lee&#39;s father was away on a <!--del_lnk--> Chinese opera tour. After several months, when Lee&#39;s father returned, the name was abandoned because of a conflict with the name of Lee&#39;s grandfather. Lee was then renamed <i>Jun Fan</i>. Finally, Lee was also given a feminine name, <b>&#x674E;&#x7D30;&#x9CF3;</b> (<!--del_lnk--> Cantonese: <i>L&eacute;i Saifung</i> <!--del_lnk--> Pinyin: <i>L&#x1D0; X&igrave;f&egrave;ng</i>), literally &quot;small <!--del_lnk--> phoenix&quot;. It was used throughout his early childhood in keeping with a Chinese custom traditionally thought to hide the child from evil spirits.<p>Bruce Lee&#39;s screen name was <b>&#x674E;&#x5C0F;&#x9F8D;</b> (<!--del_lnk--> Cantonese: <i>L&eacute;i S&iacute;ul&ugrave;ng</i> <!--del_lnk--> Pinyin: <i>L&#x1D0; Xi&#x1CE;ol&oacute;ng</i>) which literally means &quot;Lee Little Dragon&quot;. He was commonly known by this name in Asia. These were first used by the directors of the early Cantonese movies in which Lee performed. It is possible that the name &quot;little dragon&quot; was chosen based on his childhood name &quot;small phoenix&quot;. In Chinese tradition, the <!--del_lnk--> Chinese dragon and phoenix come in pairs to represent the male and female genders. However, it is more likely that he was called Little Dragon because he was born in the <!--del_lnk--> Year of the Dragon in the Hour of the Dragon, according to the <!--del_lnk--> Chinese zodiac.<p><a id="Education_and_family" name="Education_and_family"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Education and family</span></h3>
      <p>At age 14, Bruce Lee entered <!--del_lnk--> La Salle College in <a href="../../wp/h/Hong_Kong.htm" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, a <!--del_lnk--> high school, under the wing of Brother Henry. Then, he attended St Francis Xavier&#39;s College from 1957-1959.<p>In 1959, Bruce got into a fight with a feared <!--del_lnk--> Triad gang member&#39;s son. His father became concerned about his safety and Bruce was sent to the United States to live with an old friend of his father&#39;s. All he had was $100 and the title of 1958 <!--del_lnk--> Crown Colony <!--del_lnk--> Cha Cha Champion of Hong Kong. After living in San Francisco, he moved to <!--del_lnk--> Seattle to work for Ruby Chow, another friend of his father&#39;s. In 1959, Lee completed his high school education in Seattle and received his diploma from <!--del_lnk--> Edison Technical School. He enrolled at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Washington as a Philosophy Academic major. There he met his future wife <!--del_lnk--> Linda Emery.<p>Bruce and Linda married in 1964 and had two children together, <!--del_lnk--> Brandon Lee (born 1965) and <!--del_lnk--> Shannon Lee (born 1969). Brandon, an actor like his father, died on a movie set while filming <i><!--del_lnk--> The Crow</i> on <!--del_lnk--> March 31, <!--del_lnk--> 1993.<p><a id="Acting_career" name="Acting_career"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Acting career</span></h3>
      <p>Lee&#39;s father was a famous opera star. Through his father he was introduced into films at a very young age.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1964 at a demonstration in <!--del_lnk--> Long Beach, California, Lee met <!--del_lnk--> Karate champion <!--del_lnk--> Chuck Norris. In 1972, Lee introduced Norris to the big screen, as an opponent in <i>Return of the Dragon</i> (aka <i><!--del_lnk--> Way of the Dragon</i>).<p>Lee went on to star as <!--del_lnk--> Kato in the TV series <i><!--del_lnk--> The Green Hornet</i>, which ran from 1966 to 1967. Lee often used film cameras to teach and demonstrate his martial arts fighting techniques and theories.<p>He also appeared in the film <i><!--del_lnk--> Marlowe</i> in <!--del_lnk--> 1969 and a few episodes of the TV series <i><!--del_lnk--> Longstreet</i> in <!--del_lnk--> 1971.<p><!--del_lnk--> Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, a student of Bruce Lee, starred in <!--del_lnk--> Game of Death, Lee&#39;s last film. In the film, Lee, wearing the now famous yellow track suit, took on the 7 foot 2 giant basketball player in a climatic fight scene. Unfortunately, Lee died before the film was finished. However, the film was finished using a Bruce Lee <!--del_lnk--> look-alike in 1978.<p><a id="Filmography" name="Filmography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Filmography</span></h2>
      <p>Lee starred in a number of films that were released in the U.S., three of which (<i><!--del_lnk--> Enter the Dragon</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Way of the Dragon</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Game of Death</i>) premiered after his death.<table border="border" cellpadding="5" class="prettytable">

      <p>Note: The title <i>The Chinese Connection</i> (a play on the then-recently-released <i>The French Connection</i>) was originally intended for <i>The Big Boss</i> due to the drugs theme of the story.<p><!--del_lnk--> Yuen Lo, known later as <!--del_lnk--> Jackie Chan, was a member of the <!--del_lnk--> Seven Little Fortunes. He also was a stunt double for the villain Mr. Suzuki in Lee&#39;s <i>Fist of Fury</i>. In the film <i>Enter the Dragon</i>, Chan was one of the henchmen disposed of in the underground lair.<p><!--del_lnk--> Yuen Wah, also a member of the <!--del_lnk--> Seven Little Fortunes, and later to become a well known actor in his own right (notably starring in <!--del_lnk--> 2005&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Kung Fu Hustle</i>), was Lee&#39;s stunt double in Lee&#39;s last few films.<p>Bruce Lee&#39;s first formal, organized bout came as a teenager at his high school in Hong Kong. He was to fight a young <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <!--del_lnk--> boxer, a reigning two-time boxing champion. Bruce knocked his opponent out with repeated strikes, using the <!--del_lnk--> Wing Chun technique <i>jik chung chuy</i>.<p><a id="Jun_Fan_Gung_Fu" name="Jun_Fan_Gung_Fu"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Jun Fan Gung Fu</span></h3>

      <p>Lee began the process of creating his own martial arts system after his arrival in the United States in 1959. Lee called his martial arts <i><!--del_lnk--> Jun Fan Gung Fu</i> (literally Bruce&#39;s Gung Fu), which consisted mostly of <!--del_lnk--> Wing Chun, with elements of Western <!--del_lnk--> Boxing and <a href="../../wp/f/Fencing.htm" title="Fencing (sport)">fencing</a>. Lee taught friends he met in Seattle, starting with <!--del_lnk--> Judo practitioner <!--del_lnk--> Jesse Glover as his first student and who later became his first assistant instructor. Before moving to <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a> Lee opened his first martial arts school, named the Lee Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute, in Seattle.<p>At the invitation of <!--del_lnk--> Ed Parker, Lee appeared in the 1964 <!--del_lnk--> Long Beach International Karate Championships and performed repetitions of two-finger pushups (using the thumb and the index finger) with feet approximately shoulder-width apart. At the same Long Beach event he also performed the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> One inch punch&quot;. The description of which is as follows: Lee stood upright, his right foot forward with knees bent slightly, in front of a standing, stationary partner. Lee&#39;s right arm was partly extended and his right fist approximately an inch away from the partner&#39;s chest. Without retracting his right arm, Lee then forcibly delivered the punch to his partner while largely maintaining his posture, sending the partner backwards and falling into a chair placed behind the partner (to prevent injury), though the force of the impact caused his partner to soon after fall onto the floor.<p>In 1964, Lee was challenged by <!--del_lnk--> Wong Jack Man, a practitioner of <!--del_lnk--> Northern Shaolin. Lee claimed that, after arriving in San Francisco, his theories about martial arts and his teaching of &quot;secret&quot; Chinese martial arts to non-Asian students gave him enemies in the martial arts community. In contrast, Wong stated that he requested a bout with Lee as a result of Lee&#39;s open challenge during a demonstration at a Chinatown theatre; Lee had claimed to be able to defeat any martial artist in San Francisco, according to Wong. The two fought in December, 1964, at a kung fu school in <!--del_lnk--> Oakland, California. Lee and Wong provided significantly different accounts of the private bout, which was not filmed. Afterwards, Lee stated in an interview, without naming Wong as the loser, that he had defeated an unnamed challenger. In response, Wong wrote his description of the fight as well as an invitation to Lee for a public match, which was printed on the front page of Chinese Pacific Weekly, a Chinese-language newspaper in San Francisco. Lee did not fight Wong again.<p><a id="Jeet_Kune_Do" name="Jeet_Kune_Do"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Jeet Kune Do</span></h3>

      <p>The match with Wong influenced Lee&#39;s philosophy on fighting. Lee believed that the fight had lasted too long and that he had failed to live up to his potential. He took the view that traditional martial arts techniques were too rigid and formalistic to be practical in scenarios of chaotic street fighting. Lee decided to develop a system with an emphasis on &quot;<i>practicality</i>, <i>flexibility</i>, <i>speed</i>, and <i>efficiency</i>&quot;.

      <p>Lee emphasized what he called &quot;<i>the style of no style</i>&quot;. This consisted of utilizing a non-formalized approach which Lee claimed was not indicative of traditional styles. Because Lee felt the system he called Jun Fan Gung Fu was too restrictive, it was transformed to what he would come to describe as <i>Jeet Kune Do</i> or the <i>Way of the Intercepting Fist</i>, a term he would later regret because <i>Jeet Kune Do</i> implied specific parameters that styles connotate whereas the whole point of the system was to exist outside of parameters and limitations. Some confuse the Jeet Kune Do system with the personal version that Bruce Lee practised. Jeet Kune Do can be seen as both a process and a product, the latter deriving from the former.<p>Bruce Lee certified three instructors: <!--del_lnk--> Taky Kimura, <!--del_lnk--> James Yimm Lee (no relation to Bruce Lee) and <!--del_lnk--> Dan Inosanto. James Yimm Lee, a close friend of Bruce Lee, died without certifying additional students. Taky Kimura, to date, has certified one person in <!--del_lnk--> Jun Fan Gung Fu: his son and heir <!--del_lnk--> Andy Kimura. Not all other instructors are certified, although Dan Inosanto has certified some (e.g. Dwight Woods and others). Prior to his death, Lee told his then only two living instructors Inosanto and Kimura (James Yimm Lee had died in 1972.) to dismantle his schools. Both Taky Kimura and Dan Inosanto were allowed to teach small classes thereafter without using the name Jeet Kune Do.<p>As a result of a lawsuit between the estate of Bruce Lee (also known as Concord Moon) and the Inosanto Academy, the name &quot;Jun Fan Jeet Kune Do&quot; was legally trademarked, and the rights were given solely to the Lee estate. &quot;The name is made up of two parts: &#39;Jun Fan&#39; (Bruce&#39;s given Chinese name) and &#39;Jeet Kune Do&#39; (the Way of the Intercepting Fist). The development of Bruce Lee&#39;s art from 1961 until the end of his life was one smooth and indivisible path. In the beginning, he referred to his teachings simply as <i>Jun Fan Gung Fu</i>.<p>Some martial arts instructors, in an effort to promote themselves or their martial arts schools, make dubious claims about learning from or teaching Bruce Lee. Yet, only three were certified by Lee.<p><a id="Physical_fitness_and_nutrition" name="Physical_fitness_and_nutrition"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Physical fitness and nutrition</span></h2>
      <p>Bruce Lee felt that many martial artists of his day did not spend enough time on physical conditioning. He at first resorted to traditional <!--del_lnk--> bodybuilding techniques to build mass, then upon further education realised that a different sort of training was needed to increase his speed and power.<p>The weight training program that Lee used during a stay in Hong Kong in 1965 indicated biceps curls of 36kg (79 lbs) and eight repetitions for endurance. This translates to an estimated <!--del_lnk--> one repetition maximum of 50kg, (110 lbs)  placing Lee in approximately the 100th percentile for the 55 to 64 kilogram weight class (121-141 Lbs).<p>Lee believed that the <!--del_lnk--> abdominal muscles were one of the most important muscle groups for a martial artist, since <i>virtually every movement</i> requires some degree of abdominal work. Perhaps more importantly, the &quot;abs&quot; are like a shell, protecting the ribs and vital organs. Bruce Lee&#39;s washboard abs did not come from mere abdominal training; he was also a proponent of cardiovascular conditioning and would regularly run, jump rope, and ride a stationary bicycle. A typical exercise for Lee would be running two to six <!--del_lnk--> miles in fifteen to forty-five minutes.<p>Another element in Bruce Lee&#39;s quest for abdominal definition was nutrition. According to Linda Lee, soon after he moved to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, Bruce started to take nutrition seriously and developed an interest in health foods and high-protein drinks. He ate lean meat sparingly and consumed large amounts of fruits and vegetables.<p><a id="Bruce_Lee.27s_feats" name="Bruce_Lee.27s_feats"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Bruce Lee&#39;s feats</span></h2>

      <p>These are some quotes from Bruce Lee&#39;s students and people who trained with him, about his feats of strength:<ul>
       <li><b>Leo Fong</b><ul>
         <li>&quot;Yes, I was on the receiving end of his side kick. It was like getting hit with a truck.&quot;</ul>
       <li><b>Mito Uhera</b><ul>
         <li>&quot;Bruce always felt that if your stomach wasn&#39;t developed, then you had no business doing any hard sparring.&quot;</ul>
      </ul>
      <p><a id="Philosophy" name="Philosophy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Philosophy</span></h2>
      <p>Although Bruce Lee is best known as a martial artist and actor, Lee majored in <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Washington. Lee&#39;s books on martial arts and fighting philosophies are well-known both for their philosophical assertions both inside and outside of martial arts circles. His philosophy often mirrored his fighting beliefs, though he was quick to claim that his martial arts were solely a metaphor for such teachings. His influences include <a href="../../wp/t/Taoism.htm" title="Taoism">Taoism</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, and the writings of <!--del_lnk--> Krishnamurti.<p>The following are some of Bruce Lee&#39;s quotes that reflect his fighting philosophy.<ul>
       <li>&quot;Be formless... shapeless like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle; it becomes the bottle. You put it into a teapot; it becomes the teapot. Water can flow, and it can crash. Be water, my friend...&quot;<li>&quot;The more relaxed the muscles are, the more energy can flow through the body. Using muscular tensions to try to &#39;do&#39; the punch or attempting to use brute force to knock someone over will only work to opposite effect.&quot;<li>&quot;Mere technical knowledge is only the beginning of Kung Fu. To master it, one must enter into the spirit of it.&quot;<li>&quot;There are lots of guys around the world that are lazy. They have fat guts. They talk about chi power and things they can do, but don&#39;t believe it.&quot;<li>&quot;I&#39;m not a master. I&#39;m a student-master, meaning that I have the knowledge of a master and the expertise of a master, but I&#39;m still learning. So I&#39;m a student-master. I don&#39;t believe in the word &#39;master.&#39; I consider the master as such when they close the casket.&quot;<li>&quot;Do not deny the classical approach, simply as a reaction, or you will have created another pattern and trapped yourself there.&quot;<li>&quot;Jeet Kune Do: it&#39;s just a name; don&#39;t fuss over it. There&#39;s no such thing as a style if you understand the roots of combat.&quot;<li>&quot;Unfortunately, now in boxing people are only allowed to punch. In Judo, people are only allowed to throw. I do not despise these kinds of martial arts. What I mean is, we now find rigid forms which create differences among clans, and the world of martial art is shattered as a result.&quot;<li>&quot;I think the high state of martial art, in application, must have no absolute form. And, to tackle pattern A with pattern B may not be absolutely correct.&quot;<li>&quot;True observation begins when one is devoid of set patterns.&quot;<li>&quot;The other weakness is, when clans are formed, the people of a clan will hold their kind of martial art as the only truth and do not dare to reform or improve it. Thus they are confined in their own tiny little world. Their students become machines which imitate martial art forms.&quot;<li>&quot;Some people are tall; some are short. Some are stout; some are slim. There are various different kinds of people. If all of them learn the same martial art form, then who does it fit?&quot;<li>&quot;Ultimately, martial art means honestly expressing yourself. It is easy for me to put on a show and be cocky so I can show you some really fancy movement. But to express oneself honestly, not lying to oneself, and to express myself honestly enough; that my friend is very hard to do.&quot;<li>&quot;Use no way as way; use no limitation as limitation.&quot;<li>&quot;The Most powerful fighter, is an ordinary man with laser precision focus.&quot;<li>&quot;One great cause of failure is lack of concentration.&quot;<li>&quot;If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you&#39;ll never get it done.&quot;</ul>

      <p>Bruce Lee&#39;s death was officially attributed to <!--del_lnk--> cerebral edema.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> July 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1973, Lee was in Hong Kong, due to have dinner with former <a href="../../wp/j/James_Bond.htm" title="James Bond">James Bond</a> star <!--del_lnk--> George Lazenby, with whom he intended to make a film. According to Lee&#39;s wife Linda, Bruce met producer <!--del_lnk--> Raymond Chow at 2 P.M. at home to discuss the making of the movie <i><!--del_lnk--> Game of Death</i>. They worked until 4 P.M. and then drove together to the home of <!--del_lnk--> Betty Ting Pei, a <a href="../../wp/t/Taiwan.htm" title="Taiwan">Taiwanese</a> actress (claimed by some to be Lee&#39;s mistress) who was to have a leading role in the film. The three went over the script at her home, and then Chow left to attend a dinner meeting.<p>A short time later, Lee complained of a headache, and Ting Pei gave him a prescription <!--del_lnk--> analgesic known as <!--del_lnk--> Equagesic.<p>At around 7:30 P.M., he laid down for a nap. After Lee didn&#39;t turn up for the dinner, Chow came to the apartment but could not wake Lee up. A doctor was summoned, who spent ten minutes attempting to revive him before sending him by ambulance to <!--del_lnk--> Queen Elizabeth Hospital. However, Lee was dead by the time he reached the hospital. There was no visible external injury; however, his brain had swollen considerably, from 1,400 to 1,575 grams (13%). Lee was 32 years old. The medical staff examining him concluded that the immediate cause of death was Cerebral Edema. Dr. R. R. Lycette of Queen Elizabeth Hospital determined that the swelling in the brain, and Lee&#39;s untimely death, was the result of an adverse reaction to one of the compounds in the prescription equagesic tablet.   On <!--del_lnk--> October 15, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, Chow stated in an interview that Lee was allergic to Equagesic. When the physicians announced Bruce Lee&#39;s death officially, it was pronounced &quot;death by misadventure&quot;. However, the exact details of Lee&#39;s death were controversial from the moment it was announced. Bruce Lee&#39;s iconic status and unusual death at a young age led to several <!--del_lnk--> conspiracy theories about Lee&#39;s death, such as a murder involving <!--del_lnk--> Triads seeking <!--del_lnk--> protection money, vengeful rival martial artists, or other enemies like Chinese and American directors and producers &mdash; but none of these is supported by any evidence. His sudden death has since passed into the realm of legend, with one legend claiming that Lee faked his death, and will return when he has perfected his martial arts.<p><a id="Burial" name="Burial"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Burial</span></h2>
