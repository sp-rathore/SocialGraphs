      <p>The <b>Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; Faith</b> is a religion founded by <!--del_lnk--> Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h in 19th century <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Empire.htm" title="Persian Empire">Persia</a>. Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s number around 6 million in more than 200 countries around the world.<p>According to Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; teachings, religious history is seen as an evolving educational process for mankind, through God&#39;s messengers, which are termed <!--del_lnk--> Manifestations of God. <!--del_lnk--> Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h is seen as the most recent, pivotal, but not final of these individuals. He claimed to be the expected redeemer and teacher prophesied in <a href="../../wp/j/Judaism.htm" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a>, <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, and other religions, and that his mission was to establish a firm basis for unity throughout the world, and inaugurate an age of peace and justice, which Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s expect will inevitably arise.<p>&quot;<b>Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;</b>&quot; (<i>Ba-haa-ee</i> or <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/ba&#x2C8;ha&#x2D0;&#x294;i&#x2D0;/</span>) is either an adjective referring to this religion or the term for a follower of Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h, and not a noun referring to the religion as a whole. The term comes from the Arabic word <!--del_lnk--> Bah&aacute;&rsquo; (&#x628;&#x647;&#x627;&#x621;), meaning &quot;glory&quot; or &quot;splendor&quot;.<p>

      <p>Three underlying core assertions are often simply referred to as the <!--del_lnk--> unity of God, the <!--del_lnk--> unity of religion, and the <!--del_lnk--> unity of mankind. This formulation is often helpful in understanding Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; approaches to a variety of religious topics, though it belies much of the complexity found in the hundreds of books and letters that form the Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; texts. Much of Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; practice and social teachings are rooted in these priorities.<p><a id="God" name="God"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">God</span></h3>

      <p>Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s believe in a single, imperishable <a href="../../wp/g/God.htm" title="God">God</a>, the creator of all things, including all the creatures and forces in the universe.  The existence of God is thought to be eternal, without a beginning or end, and is described as &quot;a personal God, unknowable, inaccessible, the source of all Revelation, eternal, omniscient, omnipresent and almighty.&quot;  Though inaccessible directly, God is nevertheless seen as conscious of his creation, with a will and purpose. Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s believe that God expresses this will in many ways, including through a series of divine messengers referred to as <!--del_lnk--> Manifestations of God or sometimes <i>divine educators</i>. In expressing God&#39;s intent, these manifestations are seen to establish religion in the world.<p>Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; teachings state that God is too great for humans to fully comprehend, or to create a complete and accurate image. In the Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; religion God is often referred to by titles (e.g. the All-Powerful, or the All-Loving), and there is a substantial emphasis on <!--del_lnk--> monotheism, rejecting such doctrines as the <a href="../../wp/t/Trinity.htm" title="Trinity">Trinity</a>.<p><a id="Religion" name="Religion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h3>

      <p>Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; notions of progressive religious revelation result in their accepting the validity of most of the worlds&#39; religions, whose founders and central figures are seen as Manifestations of God. These include, but are not limited to <a href="../../wp/j/Jesus.htm" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Muhammad.htm" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Moses, and <a href="../../wp/g/Gautama_Buddha.htm" title="Gautama Buddha">Buddha</a>. Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s also believe that other religious figures, such as <!--del_lnk--> Adam, <!--del_lnk--> Noah, and <!--del_lnk--> Hud historically existed and were prophets of God. Religious history is interpreted as a series of <!--del_lnk--> dispensations, where each <i>manifestation</i> brings a somewhat broader and more advanced <!--del_lnk--> revelation, suited for the time and place in which it was expressed. Specific religious social teachings (e.g. the direction of prayer, or dietary restrictions) may be revoked by a subsequent manifestation so that a more appropriate requirement for the time and place may be established. Conversely, certain general principles (e.g. neighbourliness, or charity) are seen to be universal and consistent. Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s do not believe that this process of progressive revelation will end. They do, however, believe that it is cyclical. Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s do not expect a new manifestation of god to appear prior to 1000 years after Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h&#39;s revelation.<p>Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; beliefs are sometimes described as <!--del_lnk--> syncretic combinations of earlier religions&#39; beliefs. Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s, however, assert that their religion is a distinct tradition with its own scriptures, teachings, laws, and history. Its cultural and religious debt to the <!--del_lnk--> Shi&#39;a Islamic matrix in which it was founded is seen as analogous to the Jewish socio-religious context in which Christianity was established. Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s describe their faith as an independent world religion, differing from the other traditions only in its relative newness and in the appropriateness of Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h&#39;s teachings to the modern context. Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h is believed to fulfill the <!--del_lnk--> messianic expectations of these precursor faiths.<p><a id="Human_beings" name="Human_beings"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Human beings</span></h3>

      <p>Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s believe that human beings have a &quot;rational <!--del_lnk--> soul&quot;, and that this provides the species with a unique capacity to recognize God&#39;s station and humanity&#39;s relationship with its creator. Every human is seen to have a duty to recognize God and his manifestations, and to conform to their teachings. Through recognition and obedience, service to fellow humans and regular prayer and spiritual practice, Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s believe that the soul becomes closer to God, the spiritual ideal in Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; belief. When a human dies, the soul passes into the next world, where its spiritual development in the physical world becomes a basis for judgment and advancement in the spiritual world. Heaven and Hell are taught to be spiritual states of nearness or distance from God that describe relationships in this world and the next, and not physical places of reward and punishment achieved after death.<p>The Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; writings emphasize the essential equality of human beings, and the abolition of prejudice. Humanity is seen as essentially one, though highly varied; its diversity of race and culture are seen as worthy of appreciation and tolerance. Doctrines of racism, nationalism, caste, and social class are seen as artificial impediments to unity. The Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; teachings state that the unification of mankind is the paramount issue in the religious and political conditions of the present world.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>Although it concentrates on social and ethical issues as well, some of the Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; Faith&#39;s foundational texts might be described as mystical. Shoghi Effendi has called the <i><!--del_lnk--> Seven Valleys</i> Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h&#39;s &quot;greatest mystical composition.&quot; It was written to a follower of <!--del_lnk--> Sufism, a mystic and esoterical tradition of Islam. It was first translated into English in 1906, becoming one of the earliest available books of Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h to the <!--del_lnk--> West. The <i><!--del_lnk--> Hidden Words</i> is another book written by Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h during the same period, containing 153 short passages described by `Abdu&#39;l-Bah&aacute; as &quot;a treasury of divine mysteries&quot;.<p><a id="The_Covenant" name="The_Covenant"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Covenant</span></h3>

      <p>Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s have high regard for what is termed the &quot;Greater Covenant&quot;, which they see as universal in nature, and from &quot;time immemorial&quot; has been carried through by the <!--del_lnk--> Manifestations of God of all ages. They also regard highly the &quot;Lesser Covenant&quot;, which is viewed as an agreement between a Messenger of God and his followers, unique to each revelation, and includes social practices and the continuation of authority in the religion. At this time Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s view Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h&#39;s revelation as a binding lesser covenant for his followers; in the Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; writings being firm in the covenant is considered as one of the main religious virtues a person can work toward.<p>With unity as an essential teaching of the religion, Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s follow an <!--del_lnk--> administration that they believe is divinely ordained, and therefore see attempts to create schisms and divisions as insignificant, doomed efforts which are contrary to the teachings of Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h. Throughout Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; history schisms have occurred over the succession of authority. The followers of the various <!--del_lnk--> Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; divisions, who in total, number in the low thousands, are regarded as <!--del_lnk--> Covenant-breakers and shunned, essentially <!--del_lnk--> excommunicated.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; history is often traced through a sequence of leaders, beginning with the <!--del_lnk--> B&aacute;b&#39;s May 23, 1844 declaration in Shiraz, and ultimately resting on an administrative order established by the central figures of the religion. The tradition was mostly isolated to the <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Empire.htm" title="Persian Empire">Persian</a> and <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman</a> empires until after the death of Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h in 1892, at which time he had followers in thirteen countries of Asia and Africa. Under the leadership of his son, `Abdu&#39;l-Bah&aacute;, the religion gained a footing in Europe and America, and was consolidated in Iran, where it still suffered intense <!--del_lnk--> persecution. After the death of `Abdu&#39;l-Bah&aacute; in 1921, the leadership of the Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; community entered a new phase, evolving from that of a single individual to an administrative order with a system of both elected bodies and appointed individuals.<p><a id="The_B.C3.A1b" name="The_B.C3.A1b"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The B&aacute;b</span></h3>

      <p>In 1844 Siyyid `Al&iacute;-Muhammad of <!--del_lnk--> Shiraz, Iran proclaimed that he was &quot;the B&aacute;b&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> Arabic: <span class="spanAr" dir="rtl" lang="ar" style="font-size:1.1em" xml:lang="ar"><b>&#x627;&#x644;&#x628;&#x627;&#x628;</b></span>&lrm; <span class="Unicode">&#x200B;</span> &quot;the Gate&quot;), after a <!--del_lnk--> Shi`a religious concept. His followers were therefore known as <!--del_lnk--> B&aacute;b&iacute;s. As the B&aacute;b&#39;s teachings spread, the Islamic clergy saw it as a threat, and B&aacute;b&iacute;s came under increased persecution, at times being forced to choose between renouncing their beliefs or being killed. Several military confrontations took place between government and B&aacute;b&iacute; forces. The B&aacute;b himself was imprisoned and eventually executed in 1850.<p>Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s see the B&aacute;b as the forerunner of the Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; Faith, because the B&aacute;b&#39;s writings introduced the concept of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> He whom God shall make manifest&quot;, a Messianic figure whose coming, according to Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s, was announced in the scriptures of all of the world&#39;s great religions, and whom Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h, the founder of the Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; Faith, claimed to be in 1863. <!--del_lnk--> The B&aacute;b&#39;s tomb is located in <!--del_lnk--> Haifa, Israel, and is an important place of <!--del_lnk--> pilgrimage for Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s. The remains of the B&aacute;b were brought secretly from Persia to the Holy Land and were eventually interred in the Shrine built for them in a spot specifically designated by Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h.<p><a id="Bah.C3.A1.27u.27ll.C3.A1h" name="Bah.C3.A1.27u.27ll.C3.A1h"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h</span></h3>

      <p>M&iacute;rz&aacute; Husayn `Al&iacute; of N&uacute;r was one of the early followers of the B&aacute;b, who later took the title of Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h. He was arrested and imprisoned for this involvement in 1852. He claimed that while incarcerated in the dungeon of the <!--del_lnk--> S&iacute;y&aacute;h-Ch&aacute;l in <a href="../../wp/t/Tehran.htm" title="Tehran">Tehran</a>, he received the first intimations that he was the one anticipated by the B&aacute;b. He announced this in 1863.<p>Shortly thereafter he was expelled from <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Empire.htm" title="Persian Empire">Persia</a> to <a href="../../wp/b/Baghdad.htm" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>, in the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>; then to <a href="../../wp/i/Istanbul.htm" title="Istanbul">Constantinople</a>; then to <!--del_lnk--> Adrianople. During this time tensions grew between Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h and <!--del_lnk--> Subh-i-Azal, the appointed leader of the B&aacute;b&iacute;s, culminating in Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h&#39;s 1866 declaration. While in Adrianople, he wrote letters to several rulers of the world, including Sultan <!--del_lnk--> Abd&uuml;l&acirc;ziz, declaring his mission as a Messenger of God. As a result Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h was banished a final time, to the penal colony of <!--del_lnk--> `Akk&aacute;, in present-day <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israel</a>.<p>Towards the end of his life, the strict and harsh confinement was gradually relaxed, and he was allowed to live in a home near `Akk&aacute;, while still officially a prisoner of that city. He died there in 1892. Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s regard his resting place at <!--del_lnk--> Bahj&iacute; as the <!--del_lnk--> Qiblih to which they turn in prayer each day. During his lifetime, Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h left a large volume of writings; the <i><!--del_lnk--> Kit&aacute;b-i-Aqdas</i>, and the <!--del_lnk--> Book of Certitude are recognized as primary Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; theological works, and the <!--del_lnk--> Hidden Words and the <!--del_lnk--> Seven Valleys as primary mystical treatises.<p><a name=".60Abdu.27l-Bah.C3.A1"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">`Abdu&#39;l-Bah&aacute;</span></h3>

      <p>In 1939 <!--del_lnk--> Shoghi Effendi launched a seven year plan, followed by another in 1946. In 1953 he launched the <!--del_lnk--> Ten Year World Crusade, with extremely ambitious goals for the expansion of Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; communities and institutions, the translation of <!--del_lnk--> Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; literature into several new languages, and the sending of <!--del_lnk--> Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; pioneers into previously unreached nations. He announced in letters during the Ten Year Crusade that it would be followed by other plans under the direction of the Universal House of Justice, which was elected in 1963 at the culmination of the Crusade. The House of Justice then launched a nine year plan in 1964, and a series of subsequent multi-year plans of varying length and goals followed, guiding the direction of the international Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; community.<p><a id="Current_international_plan" name="Current_international_plan"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Current international plan</span></h3>
      <p>Since the late 1990&#39;s, the House of Justice has been directing communities to prepare for large-scale expansion, organizing localities into &quot;clusters&quot;, creating new institutions such as <!--del_lnk--> Regional Councils and strengthening the various &quot;training institutes&quot;.  The recently completed five-year plan (2001-2006) focused on developing institutions and creating the means to &quot;sustain large-scale expansion and consolidation&quot; (Rid&#x323;v&aacute;n 158). Since 2001, the Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s around the world have been specifically encouraged to focus on children&#39;s classes, devotional gatherings, and a systematic study of the religion, known as <!--del_lnk--> study circles. A new focus was added in December 2005 with the addition of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> junior youth&quot; classes to the core activities, focusing on education for those between 11 and 14.<p>The second five-year plan (2006-2011) was launched by the <!--del_lnk--> Universal House of Justice in April of 2006; it calls upon the Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s of the world to establish advanced patterns of growth and community development in over 1,500 &quot;clusters&quot; around the world. It also alludes to a possible tier-election process for <!--del_lnk--> Local Spiritual Assemblies in localities with many Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s. The years from 2001 until 2021 represent four successive five-year plans, culminating in the centennial anniversary of the passing of <!--del_lnk--> `Abdu&#39;l-Bah&aacute;.<p><a id="Study_circles" name="Study_circles"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Study circles</span></h3>

      <p>Along with a focus on consolidation has come a systematic approach to education and community development.

Participants complete a sequence of workbooks in small groups, facilitated by a tutor, and upon completion of the sequence a participant can then go on to facilitate study circles for others.<p>The most popular study program is the <!--del_lnk--> Ruhi Institute, a study course originally designed for use in <a href="../../wp/c/Colombia.htm" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>, but which has received wide use. The first book studies three themes: the <!--del_lnk--> Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; writings, <!--del_lnk--> prayer, and <!--del_lnk--> life and death.

The laws, when not in direct conflict with the civil laws of the country of residence are binding on every Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;.

       <li>Recite an <!--del_lnk--> obligatory prayer each day after reaching the age of maturity, deemed to be 15.

Its purpose is mainly to foster spiritual harmony, fellowship and unity between the two partners and the rearing of children. The Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; teachings on marriage call it a <i>fortress for well-being and salvation</i> and place marriage and the family as the foundation of the structure of <a href="../../wp/s/Society.htm" title="Society">human society</a>. Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h highly praised marriage, declaring it an eternal command of God, also discouraging divorce, and requiring <!--del_lnk--> chastity outside of marriage; Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h taught that a husband and wife should strive to improve the spiritual life of each other.<p>Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s intending to marry &quot;should study each other&#39;s character and spend time getting to know each other before they decide to marry, and when they do marry it should be with the intention of establishing an eternal bond.&quot; Although parents should not choose partners for their children, once two individuals decide to marry, they must receive the consent of all living parents, even if one partner is not a Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;. <!--del_lnk--> Interracial marriage is highly praised in the <!--del_lnk--> Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; teachings. The Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; marriage ceremony is simple; the only compulsory part of the wedding is the reading of the wedding vows prescribed by <!--del_lnk--> Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h which both the groom and the bride read, in the presence of two witnesses. The vows are:<dl>
       <dd>&quot;We will all, verily, abide by the Will of God.&quot;</dl>

      <p>The official symbol of the Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; Faith is the five-pointed star, but a nine-pointed star is more frequently used. The ringstone symbol and calligraphy of the Greatest Name are also often encountered. The former consists of two stars interspersed with a stylized Bah&aacute;&rsquo; (<!--del_lnk--> Arabic: <span class="spanAr" dir="rtl" lang="ar" style="font-size:1.1em" xml:lang="ar"><b>&#x628;&#x647;&#x627;&#x621;</b></span>&lrm; <span class="Unicode">&#x200B;</span> &quot;splendor&quot; or &quot;glory&quot;) whose shape is meant to recall the three onenesses.

      <p>The Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; calendar is based upon the calendar established by the B&aacute;b. The year consists of 19 months of 19 days, with four or five <!--del_lnk--> intercalary days, to make a full solar year. The Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; New Year corresponds to the traditional Persian New Year, called <!--del_lnk--> Naw R&uacute;z, and occurs on the vernal equinox, <!--del_lnk--> March 21, at the end of the month of fasting. Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; communities gather at the beginning of each month at a meeting called a <!--del_lnk--> Feast for worship, consultation and socializing.<p>Each of the 19 months is given a name which is an attribute of God; some examples include Bah&aacute;&rsquo; (Splendour), &lsquo;Ilm (Knowledge), and Jam&aacute;l (Beauty).The Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; week is familiar in that it consists of seven days, with each day of the week also named after an attribute of God; some examples include Istiql&aacute;l (Independence), Kam&aacute;l (Perfection) and &lsquo;Id&aacute;l (Justice). Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s observe 11 <!--del_lnk--> Holy Days throughout the year, with work suspended on 9 of these. These days commemorate important anniversaries in the history of the religion.<p><a id="Persecution" name="Persecution"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Persecution</span></h2>

      <p>Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s continue to be persecuted in <!--del_lnk--> Islamist ruled countries, especially <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a>, where over 200 believers were executed between 1978 and 1998. Since the <!--del_lnk--> Islamic Revolution of 1979, Iranian Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s have regularly had their homes ransacked or been banned from attending university or holding government jobs, and several hundred have received prison sentences for their religious beliefs, most recently for participating in <!--del_lnk--> study circles. Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; cemeteries have been desecrated and property seized and occasionally demolished, including the House of M&iacute;rz&aacute; Buzurg, Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h&#39;s father. The House of the B&aacute;b in <!--del_lnk--> Shiraz has been destroyed twice, and is one of three sites to which Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s perform <!--del_lnk--> pilgrimage. <p>Even more recently the situation of Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s has worsened; the <!--del_lnk--> United Nations Commission on Human Rights revealed an October 2005 confidential letter from Command Headquarters of the Armed Forces of Iran to identify Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s and to monitor their activities  and in November 2005 the state-run and influential <!--del_lnk--> Kayhan  newspaper, whose managing editor is appointed by Iran&#39;s supreme leader, <!--del_lnk--> Ayatollah Khamenei, ran nearly three dozen articles defaming the Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; Faith.<p>Due to these actions, the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights stated on <!--del_lnk--> March 20, <!--del_lnk--> 2006 that she &quot;also expresses concern that the information gained as a result of such monitoring will be used as a basis for the increased persecution of, and discrimination against, members of the Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; faith, in violation of international standards. ... The Special Rapporteur is concerned that this latest development indicates that the situation with regard to religious minorities in Iran is, in fact, deteriorating.&quot;<p><a id="Reactions" name="Reactions"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Reactions</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Bernard Lewis states that the Muslim laity and Islamic authorities have always had great difficulty in accommodating post-Islamic monotheistic religions such as the Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; Faith, since on one hand the followers of such religions cannot be dismissed either as benighted heathens, like the polytheists of Asia and the animists of Africa, nor as outdated precursors, like the Jews and Christians. Moreover, their very existence presents a challenge to the Islamic doctrine of the perfection and finality of Muhammad&#39;s revelation. <p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith&quot;</div>
