      <p>Bologna was founded by the <!--del_lnk--> Etruscans with the name <i>Felsina</i> (ca. <!--del_lnk--> 534 BCE) in an area previously inhabited by the <!--del_lnk--> villanovians, a people of farmers and shepherds. The Etruscan city grew around a sanctuary built on a hill, and was surrounded by a necropolis.<p>In the <!--del_lnk--> 4th century BC the city was conquered by the Boii, a Gallic tribe, whence the ancient name <i>Bononia</i> of the Roman colony founded in c.189 BC. The settlers included 3,000 Latin families led by the consuls Lucius Valerius Flaccus, Marcus Atilius Seranus and Lucius Valerius Tappo. The building of the <!--del_lnk--> Via Aemilia in 187 BC made Bologna a road hub, connected to <!--del_lnk--> Arezzo through the <i>Via Flaminia minor</i> and to <!--del_lnk--> Aquileia through the <i>Via Aemilia Altinate</i>.<p>In 88 BC the city became a municipium: it had a rectilinear street plan with six <i>cardi</i> and eight <i>decumani</i> (intersecting streets) which are still discernible today. During the Roman era, its population varied between c.12,000 to c.30,000. At its peak, it was the 2nd city of Italy, and one of the most important of all the Empire) with various temples and baths, a theatre, and one arena. <!--del_lnk--> Pomponius Mela included <i>Bononia</i> among the five <i>opulentissimae</i> (&quot;richest&quot;) cities of Italy. The city was rebuilt by the Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Nero after a fire.<p>After a long decline, Bologna was reborn in the 5th century under bishop <!--del_lnk--> Petronius, who traditionally built the church of S. Stefano. After the fall of <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a>, Bologna was a frontier stronghold of the <!--del_lnk--> Exarchate of Ravenna in the Po plain, and was defended by a line of walls which however did not enclose most of the ancient ruined Roman city. In 728, the city was conquered by the <!--del_lnk--> Lombard king <!--del_lnk--> Liutprand, becoming part of the Lombard Kingdom. The German newcomers formed a district called &quot;addizione longobarda&quot; near the complex of S. Stefano, where <a href="../../wp/c/Charlemagne.htm" title="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> stayed in 786.<p>In the 11th century Bologna began to grow again as a free <a href="../../wp/m/Medieval_commune.htm" title="Medieval commune">Commune</a>, joining the <!--del_lnk--> Lombard League against <!--del_lnk--> Frederick Barbarossa in 1164. In 1088 the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Studio</i> was founded, now the oldest university of Europe, which could boast notable scholars of the Middle Ages like <!--del_lnk--> Irnerius, and, amongst its students, <a href="../../wp/d/Dante_Alighieri.htm" title="Dante Alighieri">Dante</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Boccaccio and <!--del_lnk--> Petrarca. In the <a href="../../wp/1/12th_century.htm" title="12th century">12th century</a> the expanding city needed a new line of walls, and another was completed in the <a href="../../wp/1/14th_century.htm" title="14th century">14th century</a>.<p>In 1256 Bologna promulgated the <i>Legge del Paradiso</i> (&quot;Paradise Law&quot;), which abolished feudal serfdom and freed the slaves using public money. At that time the city centre was full of towers (perhaps 180) built by the leading families, of notable public edifices, churches and abbeys. In 1294 Bologna was perhaps the 5th or the 6th city in Europe, after <!--del_lnk--> Cordoba, <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Venice, <!--del_lnk--> Florence, and, probably, <a href="../../wp/m/Milan.htm" title="Milan">Milan</a>, with 60,000 - 70,000 inhabitants.<p>Like most Italian communes of that age, Bologna was torn by internal struggles, which lead to the expulsion of the <!--del_lnk--> Ghibelline family of Lambertazzi in <!--del_lnk--> 1274. After being crushed in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Zappolino by the <!--del_lnk--> Modenese in <!--del_lnk--> 1325, Bologna began to decay and asked the protection of the <!--del_lnk--> Pope at the beginning of the <a href="../../wp/1/14th_century.htm" title="14th century">14th century</a>. In <!--del_lnk--> 1348, during the terrible European pestilence, about 30,000 inhabitants died.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>After the happy years of the rule of <!--del_lnk--> Taddeo Pepoli (<!--del_lnk--> 1337-<!--del_lnk--> 1347), Bologna fell to the <!--del_lnk--> Visconti of <a href="../../wp/m/Milan.htm" title="Milan">Milan</a>, but returned to the <!--del_lnk--> Papal orbit with Cardinal <!--del_lnk--> Gil de Albornoz in <!--del_lnk--> 1360. The following years saw an alternation of Republican governments (like that of <!--del_lnk--> 1377, which built the <!--del_lnk--> Basilica di San Petronio and the Loggia dei Mercanti) and Papal or Visconti restorations, while the city&#39;s families engaged in continual internecine fighting. In the middle of the <a href="../../wp/1/15th_century.htm" title="15th century">15th century</a> the <!--del_lnk--> Bentivoglio family gained the rule of Bologna, reigning with <!--del_lnk--> Sante (<!--del_lnk--> 1445-<!--del_lnk--> 1462) and <!--del_lnk--> Giovanni II (<!--del_lnk--> 1462-<!--del_lnk--> 1506). This period was a flourishing one for the city, with the presence of notable architects and painters who made Bologna a true city.<p>During the Renaissance, Bologna was the only Italian city that allowed women to excel in any profession. Women there had much more freedom than in other Italian cities. Some even had the opportunity to earn a degree at university.<p>Giovanni&#39;s reign ended in <!--del_lnk--> 1506 when the Papal troops of <!--del_lnk--> Julius II besieged Bologna and sacked the artistic treasures of his palace. From that point on, until the <!--del_lnk--> XVIII century, Bologna was part of the Papal States, ruled by a <i>cardinal legato</i> and by a Senate which every two months elected a <i>gonfaloniere</i> (judge), assisted by eight elder consuls. The city&#39;s prosperity continued, although a plague at the end of the <a href="../../wp/1/16th_century.htm" title="16th century">16th century</a> reduced the population from 72,000 to 59,000, and another in <!--del_lnk--> 1630 to 47,000. The population later recovered to a stable 60,000-65,000. In <!--del_lnk--> 1564 the Piazza del Nettuno and the Palazzo dei Banchi were built, along with the Archiginnasio, the seat of the University. The period of Papal rule saw the construction of many churches and other religious establishments, and the renovation of older ones. The 96 convents of Bologna are a record for Italy. Artists working in this age in Bologna established the <!--del_lnk--> Bolognese School that includes <!--del_lnk--> Annibale Carracci, <!--del_lnk--> Domenichino, <!--del_lnk--> Guercino and others of European fame.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>With the rise of <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleon_I_of_France.htm" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> Bologna became the capital of the <!--del_lnk--> Repubblica Cispadana and, later, the second most important centre after <a href="../../wp/m/Milan.htm" title="Milan">Milan</a> of the <!--del_lnk--> Repubblica Cisalpina and the <!--del_lnk--> Italian Kingdom. After the fall of Napoleon, Bologna suffered the Papal restoration, rebelling in <!--del_lnk--> 1831 and again <!--del_lnk--> 1849, when it temporarily expelled the <a href="../../wp/a/Austria.htm" title="Austria">Austrian</a> garrisons which commanded the city until <!--del_lnk--> 1860. After a visit by <!--del_lnk--> Pope Pius IX in <!--del_lnk--> 1857, the city voted for annexation to the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Sardinia on <!--del_lnk--> June 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1859, becoming part of the <!--del_lnk--> united Italy.<p>In the new political situation Bologna gained importance for its cultural role and became an important commercial, industrial and communications hub; its population began to grow again and at the beginning of the <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a> the old walls were destroyed (except few parts) in order to build new houses for the population.<p>Though damaged during the closing battles of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Bologna soon recovered and is now one of the richest, most civil and well-planned cities of Italy.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> August 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1980 a massive bomb killed 86 people in the central train station in the city (see <!--del_lnk--> Bologna massacre). Only two month previously <!--del_lnk--> Aerolinee Itavia Flight 870 crashed in suspicious circumstances enroute from Bologna to <!--del_lnk--> Palermo killing 81 people. The official verdict, released only in 1999 was that the plane was shot down accidentally by <a href="../../wp/n/NATO.htm" title="NATO">NATO</a> forces. <!--del_lnk--> (Guardian)<p><a id="Transport" name="Transport"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transport</span></h2>
      <p>Bologna is the first railway and motorway hub in <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>; its Fiera District (exhibitions) is the 2nd in <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> and the 4th in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>, with important international exhibitions, like Motorshow (cars, motor-cycles, considered the most important in all the world), Saie, Saiedue and Cersaie (buildings), Cosmoprof (beauty culture, considered the most important in all the World), Lineapelle, etc. Bologna and its metropolitan area has important industries (mechanics, foods, electronics), has very important retail and wholesale trade (the &quot;Centergross&quot; in the northern metropolitan area, built in 1973, was the biggest in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> until few years ago), and has the first Italian vegetable and fruit market. Bologna also has important monuments, museums, and rich cultural life.<p><a id="Importance" name="Importance"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Importance</span></h2>
      <p>The importance of Bologna in Italy and in Europe, considered from the points of view of culture, industry, trade, social, political, economy, etc., is much greater than suggested by its demographic data: about 400,000 inhabitants in the city, about 1 million in the metropolitan area, including over 100,000 students of the ancient and renowned <!--del_lnk--> University of Bologna, founded in the <a href="../../wp/1/11th_century.htm" title="11th century">11th century</a>.<p><a id="Main_sights" name="Main_sights"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Main sights</span></h2>
      <p>Until the late 19th century, when a large-scale urban reconstruction project was undertaken, Bologna remained one of the best-preserved Medieval cities in Europe, though to this day it remains unique in its historic value. Despite having suffered considerable bombing damage in 1944, Bologna&#39;s historic centre, Europe&#39;s 2nd largest (after <!--del_lnk--> Venice), contains a wealth of Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque artistic monuments of primary importance.<p>Bologna developed as an Etruscan, then Roman colony along the Via Emilia, the street that still runs straight through the city under the changing names of Strada Maggiore, Rizzoli, Ugo Bassi, and San Felice. Due to its Roman heritage, the most central streets of Bologna, today largely pedestrianized, follow the grid pattern of the Roman settlement.<p>The original Roman ramparts were supplanted by a high medieval system of fortifications, remains of which are still visible, and finally by a third and final set of ramparts built in the 13th century, of which numerous sections survive. Over twenty medieval defensive towers, some of them leaning precariously, remain from the over two hundred that were constructed in the era preceding the security guaranteed by unified civic government.<p>Bologna is home to numerous important churches. An incomplete list include:<ul>
       <li>the basilica of <!--del_lnk--> San Petronio, one of the biggest in the World<li><!--del_lnk--> San Pietro Cathedral<li><!--del_lnk--> Santo Stefano basilica and sanctuary<li><!--del_lnk--> San Domenico basilica and sanctuary<li><!--del_lnk--> San Francesco basilica<li><!--del_lnk--> Santa Maria dei Servi basilica<li><!--del_lnk--> San Giacomo Maggiore basilica<li><!--del_lnk--> Beata Vergine di San Luca basilica and sanctuary, on Colle della Guardia<li><!--del_lnk--> San Michele in Bosco<li><!--del_lnk--> San Paolo the Great, basilica</ul>
      <p>The cityscape is further enriched by elegant and extensive arcades (or porticos), for which the city is famous. In total, there are some 38 kilometres of arcades in the city&#39;s historical centre (over 45 km in the cityproper), which make it possible to walk for long distances sheltered from rain, snow, or hot summer sun. The Portico of San Luca, the longest in the World (3,5 km, 666 arcades) connects Porta Saragozza (one of the twelve Gates of the ancient Walls built in the Middle-Age which rounded the city on 7,5 km) with San Luca Sanctuary, on Colle della Guardia, over the city (289 m/o.l.s.).<p>The Sanctuary of the <!--del_lnk--> Madonna di San Luca is a very notable site, located just outside the main city on the Colle della Guardia (<i>Guard Hill</i>). Built in the 11th century and much enlarged in 14th and 18th centuries. The interior contains works of different masters but probably the most important is the painting of the Madonna with Child attributed to <!--del_lnk--> Luke the Evangelist. The best way to visit this Sanctuary is by foot as you can walk under the portico mentioned above.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>
      <p>Over the centuries, Bologna has acquired many nicknames: &quot;Bologna the learned one&quot; (<i>Bologna la dotta</i>) is a reference to its famous university; &quot;Bologna the fat one&quot; (<i>Bologna la grassa</i>) refers to its cuisine.<p>&quot;Bologna the red one&quot; has also been said to refer to the city&#39;s left-leaning politics. Until the election of a centre-right mayor in 1999, the city was a historic bastion of <a href="../../wp/s/Socialism.htm" title="Socialism">socialism</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">communism</a>. The centre-left gained power again in the 2004 mayoral elections, with the election of Sergio Cofferati. It was one of the first European settlements to experiment with the concept of &quot;free&quot; public transport.<p>Another nickname for Bologna is <i>Basket City</i>, referring to Bologna&#39;s obsession with <a href="../../wp/b/Basketball.htm" title="Basketball">basketball</a>, unusual in <a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Football (soccer)">football</a>-dominated Italy. The <!--del_lnk--> local derby between the city&#39;s two principal basketball clubs, <!--del_lnk--> Fortitudo and <!--del_lnk--> Virtus (often called after the clubs&#39; principal sponsors), is intense. Violence, however, has been largely absent in the derby.<p><a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Football (soccer)">Football</a> is still a popular sport in Bologna; the main local club is <!--del_lnk--> Bologna F.C. 1909, which was relegated to <!--del_lnk--> Serie B at the end of the 2004/2005 season.<p>The city of Bologna was appointed a UNESCO City of Music on 29 May 2006. According to UNESCO &quot;As the first Italian city to be appointed to the Network, Bologna has demonstrated a rich musical tradition that is continuing to evolve as a vibrant factor of contemporary life and creation. It has also shown a strong commitment to promoting music as an important vehicle for inclusion in the fight against racism and in an effort to encourage economic and social development. Fostering a wide range of genres from classical to electronic, jazz, folk and opera, Bologna offers its citizens a musical vitality that deeply infiltrates the city&rsquo;s professional, academic, social and cultural facets&quot;. <p><a id="Transport_2" name="Transport_2"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transport</span></h2>
      <p>Bologna is home to <!--del_lnk--> Guglielmo Marconi International Airport, expanded in 2004 by extending the runway to accommodate larger aircraft: it is the fifth busiest Italian airport for passenger traffic (about 3,6 million/year). Since 2004, is the third busiest for intercontinental flights.<p><!--del_lnk--> Bologna Central Station is considered the most important train hub in Italy thanks to the city&#39;s strategic location. Also, its goods-station (San Donato) with its 33 railway tracks, is the largest in Italy in size and traffic and is one of the biggest in Europe. Bologna&#39;s station holds a memory in Italian public consciousness for the huge terrorist bomb attack that killed 85 victims in August <!--del_lnk--> 1980. The attack is also known in Italy as the <!--del_lnk--> Strage di Bologna, the <i>Bologna massacre</i>. It is widely believed the bomb was planted by neo-fascist activists - possibly to stir public opinion against Italian communists.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>
      <p>As of 2004, the greater Bologna area had a resident population of 943,983, of which 94.09% were ethnic <!--del_lnk--> Italians. Immigrants in the city constitute 5.91% of the population. Of the 55,840 immigrants in Bologna, Europeans other than Italian origins slimly outnumber those from the <!--del_lnk--> African continent. They number 19,668 and are chiefly of <!--del_lnk--> Romanian, <!--del_lnk--> Albanian, and <!--del_lnk--> Ukrainian origins. Closely following, Africans number 19,060, but are almost entirely <!--del_lnk--> North African <!--del_lnk--> Arab rather sub-saharan blacks. A recent and growing Asian population number 14,119 and are mostly <!--del_lnk--> Filipino, and <!--del_lnk--> Chinese. The remaining consists of immigrants from the Americas and the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>.  While ageing continues to be a factor in the city&#39;s population, the number of births has risen in the past decade, contributing to the positive growth of the city.<dl>

      <p><a id="Cuisine" name="Cuisine"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Cuisine</span></h2>
      <p>Bologna is renowned for its culinary tradition and it is regarded by some as the food capital of Italy. It has given its name to <!--del_lnk--> Bolognese sauce, a meat based pasta sauce called in Italy <i><!--del_lnk--> rag&ugrave; alla bolognese</i> but in the City itself just <i>rag&ugrave;</i> alone as in <i><!--del_lnk--> Tagliatelle al rag&ugrave;</i> . Bologna is also influenced by Milanese cuisine as its specialities include <!--del_lnk--> risotto, however one is hard pressed to find bread that is neither stale nor made from finely ground bleached flour.<p>Situated in the fertile Po River Valley, the rich local cuisine depends heavily on meats and cheeses. As in all of Emilia-Romagna, the production of cured <!--del_lnk--> pork meats such as <!--del_lnk--> prosciutto, <!--del_lnk--> mortadella and <!--del_lnk--> salame is an important part of the local food industry. Well-regarded nearby vineyards include Pignoletto dei Colli Bolognesi, Lambrusco di Modena and Sangiovese di Romagna.<p><!--del_lnk--> Tagliatelle al rag&ugrave;, <!--del_lnk--> tortellini served in broth and <!--del_lnk--> mortadella (the original Bologna sausage) are among the local specialties.<p><a id="University" name="University"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">University</span></h2>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> University of Bologna, founded in 1088, is the oldest existing university in Europe, and was an important centre of European intellectual life during the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, attracting scholars from throughout <!--del_lnk--> Christendom. A unique heritage of medieval art, exemplified by the illuminated manuscripts and jurists&#39; tombs produced in the city from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century, provide a cultural backdrop to the renown of the medieval institution. The Studium, as it was originally known, began as a loosely organized teaching system with each master collecting fees from students on an individual basis. The location of the early University was thus spread throughout the city, with various colleges being founded to support students of a specific nationality.<p>In the Napoleonic era, the headquarters of the university were moved to their present location on Via Zamboni (formerly Via San Donato), in the north-eastern sector of the city centre. Today, the University&#39;s 23 faculties, 68 departments, and 93 libraries are spread across the city and include four subsidiary campuses in nearby <!--del_lnk--> Cesena, <!--del_lnk--> Forl&igrave;, <!--del_lnk--> Ravenna, and <!--del_lnk--> Rimini. Noteworthy students present at the university in centuries past included <a href="../../wp/d/Dante_Alighieri.htm" title="Dante Alighieri">Dante</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Petrarch, <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Becket.htm" title="Thomas Becket">Thomas Becket</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Pope Nicholas V, <!--del_lnk--> Erasmus of Rotterdam, and <a href="../../wp/n/Nicolaus_Copernicus.htm" title="Nicolaus Copernicus">Copernicus</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Laura Bassi, appointed in 1732, became the first woman to officially teach at a college in Europe. In more recent history, <!--del_lnk--> Luigi Galvani, the discoverer of <!--del_lnk--> biological electricity, and <a href="../../wp/g/Guglielmo_Marconi.htm" title="Guglielmo Marconi">Guglielmo Marconi</a>, the pioneer of radio technology, also worked at the University. The University of Bologna remains one of the most respected and dynamic post-secondary educational institutions in Italy. To this day, Bologna is still very much a university town, and the city&#39;s population swells from 400,000 to over 500,000 whenever classes are in session. This community includes a great number of Erasmus, Socrates, and overseas students. Several American Colleges and Universities, such as <!--del_lnk--> Brown University, <!--del_lnk--> Dickinson College and <!--del_lnk--> University of California, sponsor exchange programs. There is also a consortium of several universities, the <!--del_lnk--> Bologna Cooperative Studies Program, that is headed by <!--del_lnk--> Indiana University. The <!--del_lnk--> University of Denver also has an embedded study abroad program in Bologna, in coordination with the Centre for Civic Engagement. In addition the <!--del_lnk--> Johns Hopkins University <!--del_lnk--> School of Advanced International Studies maintains a permanent campus in the city.<p>Nowadays, the University of Bologna controls 23 faculties: Agricultural sciences; Industrial Chemistry; Economics; Pharmacy; Law; Engineering; Literature and philosophy; Foreign languages and literatures; Medicine and surgery; Veterinary medicine; Sciences of education; Mathematics, physics and natural sciences; Sciences of physical education; Political Sciences; Statistics. Only in <!--del_lnk--> Cesena: Architecture; Psychology. Only in <!--del_lnk--> Ravenna: Conservation of cultural heritage.<div class="thumb tright">
