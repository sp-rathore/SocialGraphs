      <p><b>Berlin</b> is the <a href="../../wp/c/Capital.htm" title="Capital">capital</a> city and one of the sixteen <!--del_lnk--> states of the <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Federal Republic of Germany</a>. It is the heart of the Berlin-<!--del_lnk--> Brandenburg metropolitan region, located in northeastern Germany. With a population of 3.4 million, Berlin is the country&#39;s largest city, and the second <!--del_lnk--> most populous city in the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a>.<p>Berlin is one of the most influential centers in European politics, culture and science. The city serves as an important hub of continental transportation and is home to some of the most prominent universities, sport events, orchestras, and museums. Its economy is based on the service sector, encompassing a diverse range of media and life science corporations, convention venues, research institutes, and creative industries.<p>The rapidly evolving metropolis enjoys an international reputation for its festivals, contemporary architecture, nightlife, and avant-garde arts. Being a major tourist centre and home to people from over 180 nations, Berlin is a focal point for individuals who are attracted by its liberal lifestyle, urban eclecticism, and artistic freedom.<p>First documented in the 13th century, Berlin became successively the capital of the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Prussia (from 1701), the <!--del_lnk--> German Empire (1871-1918), the <a href="../../wp/w/Weimar_Republic.htm" title="Weimar Republic">Weimar Republic</a> (1919-1932) and the <!--del_lnk--> Third Reich (1933-1945). After <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the city was divided. <!--del_lnk--> East Berlin became the capital of the <!--del_lnk--> GDR (East Germany), while <!--del_lnk--> West Berlin remained a <!--del_lnk--> West German <!--del_lnk--> enclave surrounded by the <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin_Wall.htm" title="Berlin Wall">Berlin Wall</a> from 1961-1989. Following the <a href="../../wp/g/German_reunification.htm" title="German reunification">reunification</a> in 1990, the city regained its status as the capital of all Germany.<p>

      <p>The first written mention of towns in the area of present-day Berlin dates from the late 12th and early 14th century. <!--del_lnk--> Spandau is first mentioned in 1197, and <!--del_lnk--> K&ouml;penick in 1209, though these areas did not join Berlin until 1920. The central part of Berlin can be traced back to two towns: C&ouml;lln (on the <!--del_lnk--> Fisher Island) is first mentioned in a 1237 document, and Berlin (across the Spree in what is now called the <!--del_lnk--> Nikolaiviertel) in one from 1244. From the beginning, the two cities formed an economic and social unit. In 1307, the two cities were united politically. Over time, the twin cities came to be known simply as Berlin, the larger of the pair.<p>In 1415 <!--del_lnk--> Frederick I became the <!--del_lnk--> elector of the Margraviate of <!--del_lnk--> Brandenburg, which he ruled until 1440. Subsequent members of the <!--del_lnk--> Hohenzollern family ruled until 1918 in Berlin, first as electors of Brandenburg, then as kings of <!--del_lnk--> Prussia, and finally as German emperors. In 1448 citizens rebelled in the &ldquo;Berlin Indignation&rdquo; against the construction of a new royal palace by Elector <!--del_lnk--> Frederick II Irontooth. This protest was not successful, however, and the citizenry lost many of its political and economic privileges. In 1451 Berlin became the royal residence of the Brandenburg electors, and Berlin had to give up its status as a free <!--del_lnk--> Hanseatic city. In 1539 the electors and the city officially became <!--del_lnk--> Lutheran.<br clear="all" />

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Thirty Years&#39; War between 1618 and 1648 had devastating consequences for Berlin. A third of the houses were damaged, and the city lost half of its population. <!--del_lnk--> Frederick William, known as the &ldquo;Great Elector&rdquo;, who had succeeded his father <!--del_lnk--> George William as ruler in 1640, initiated a policy of promoting <!--del_lnk--> immigration and <!--del_lnk--> religious toleration. With the <!--del_lnk--> Edict of Potsdam in 1685, Frederick William invited the French <!--del_lnk--> Huguenots to Brandenburg. More than 15,000 Huguenots came, of whom 6,000 settled in Berlin. Around 1700, approximately twenty percent of Berlin&#39;s residents were French, and their cultural influence was great. Many other immigrants came from <!--del_lnk--> Bohemia, <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Poland</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Salzburg.<p>With the coronation of <!--del_lnk--> Frederick I in 1701 as king, Berlin became the capital of the kingdom of <!--del_lnk--> Prussia. In 1740 Friedrich II, known as <!--del_lnk--> Frederick the Great (1740-1786) came to power. Berlin became, under the rule of the philosophically-oriented Frederick II, centre of <!--del_lnk--> the Enlightenment. The <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> transformed Berlin during the 19th century; the city&#39;s economy and population expanded dramatically, and it became the main rail hub and economic centre of Germany. Additional suburbs soon developed and increased the area and population of Berlin. In 1861, outlying suburbs including <!--del_lnk--> Wedding, <!--del_lnk--> Moabit, and several others were incorporated into Berlin. In 1871, Berlin became capital of the newly founded <!--del_lnk--> German Empire.<p><a name="20th_century"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">20th century</span></h3>

      <p>At the end of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> in 1918, the <a href="../../wp/w/Weimar_Republic.htm" title="Weimar Republic">Weimar Republic</a> was proclaimed in Berlin. In <!--del_lnk--> 1920, the <!--del_lnk--> Greater Berlin Act united dozens of suburban cities, villages, and estates around Berlin into a greatly expanded city and established Berlin as a separate administrative region. After this expansion, Berlin had a population of around 4 million. <!--del_lnk--> 1920s Berlin was an exciting city known for its liberal subcultures, including homosexuals and prostitution, and well known for its fierce political street fights.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Nazi Party came to power in 1933 and started <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> in 1939. Nazi rule destroyed Berlin&#39;s Jewish community, which numbered 170,000 before the Nazis came to power. After the pogrom of <!--del_lnk--> Kristallnacht in 1938, thousands of the city&#39;s German Jews were imprisoned in the nearby <!--del_lnk--> Sachsenhausen concentration camp or, in early 1943, were shipped to death camps such as <!--del_lnk--> Auschwitz. During the war, large parts of Berlin were destroyed in <!--del_lnk--> the 1943&ndash;45 air raids and during the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Berlin. After the <!--del_lnk--> end of the war in Europe in 1945, Berlin received large numbers of refugees from the Eastern provinces. The victorious powers divided the city into four sectors, analogous to the <!--del_lnk--> occupation zones into which Germany was divided. The sectors of the Western Allies (the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, and <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>) formed <!--del_lnk--> West Berlin, while the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet sector</a> formed <!--del_lnk--> East Berlin.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>All four allies retained shared responsibility for Berlin. However, the growing political differences between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union led the latter, which controlled the territory surrounding Berlin, to impose the <!--del_lnk--> Berlin Blockade, an economic blockade of West Berlin. The allies successfully overcame the Blockade by airlifting food and other supplies into the city from <!--del_lnk--> 24 June <!--del_lnk--> 1948 to <!--del_lnk--> 11 May <!--del_lnk--> 1949. In 1949 the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in <!--del_lnk--> West Germany, while the <!--del_lnk--> Marxist-Leninist German Democratic Republic was proclaimed in <!--del_lnk--> East Germany.<p>The founding of the two German states increased <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> tensions. West Berlin was surrounded by East German territory. East Germany, however, proclaimed East Berlin (which it described only as &quot;Berlin&quot;) as its capital, a move that was not recognized by the western powers. Although half the size and population of West Berlin, it included most of the historic centre. The tensions between east and west culminated in the construction of <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin_Wall.htm" title="Berlin Wall">Berlin Wall</a> between East and West Berlin and other barriers around West Berlin by the East Germany on <!--del_lnk--> 13 August <!--del_lnk--> 1961 and were exacerbated by a tank standoff at <!--del_lnk--> Checkpoint Charlie on <!--del_lnk--> 27 October <!--del_lnk--> 1961. West Berlin was now de facto a part of West Germany with a unique legal status, while East Berlin was de facto a part of East Germany.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Berlin was completely separated. It was possible for Westerners to pass from one to the other only through strictly controlled checkpoints. For most Easterners, travel to West Berlin or West Germany was no longer possible. In 1971, a <!--del_lnk--> Four-Power agreement guaranteed access across East Germany to West Berlin and ended the potential for harassment or closure of the routes.<p>In 1989 pressure from the East German population brought a transition to democracy in East Germany, and its citizens gained free access across the Berlin Wall, which was subsequently mostly demolished. Not much is left of it today; the <!--del_lnk--> East Side Gallery in <!--del_lnk--> Friedrichshain near the <i>Oberbaumbr&uuml;cke</i> over the <!--del_lnk--> Spree preserves a portion of the Wall. In 1990 the two parts of Germany were <a href="../../wp/g/German_reunification.htm" title="German reunification">reunified</a> as the Federal Republic of Germany, and Berlin became the German capital according to the unification treaty. In 1999 the German parliament and government began their work in Berlin.<br clear="all" />

      <p>Berlin is located in eastern Germany, about 110 kilometers (65 miles) west of the border with <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Poland</a>. Berlin&#39;s landscape was shaped by <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_sheet.htm" title="Ice sheet">ice sheets</a> during the last <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_age.htm" title="Ice age">ice age</a>. The city centre lies along the river <!--del_lnk--> Spree in the Berlin-Warsaw <i>Urstromtal</i> (ancient river valley), formed by water flowing from melting ice sheets at the end of the last Ice Age. The <i>Urstromtal</i> lies between the low Barnim plateau to the north, and the Teltow plateau to the south. In <!--del_lnk--> Spandau, Berlin&#39;s westernmost borough, the Spree meets the river <!--del_lnk--> Havel, which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and <!--del_lnk--> Gro&szlig;er Wannsee. A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree, which flows through the <!--del_lnk--> Gro&szlig;er M&uuml;ggelsee in eastern Berlin.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Substantial parts of present-day Berlin extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of the Spree Valley. Large parts of the boroughs <!--del_lnk--> Reinickendorf and <!--del_lnk--> Pankow lie on the Barnim plateau, while most of the boroughs <!--del_lnk--> Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf, <!--del_lnk--> Steglitz-Zehlendorf, <!--del_lnk--> Tempelhof-Sch&ouml;neberg, and <!--del_lnk--> Neuk&ouml;lln lie on the Teltow plateau. The borough of Spandau lies partly within the Berlin <i>Urstromtal</i> and partly on the Nauen Plain, which stretches to the west of Berlin. The highest elevations in Berlin are the <!--del_lnk--> Teufelsberg in the borough of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf and the M&uuml;ggelberge in the borough of <!--del_lnk--> Treptow-K&ouml;penick. Both hills have an elevation of about 115 meters (377 feet). The Teufelsberg is in fact an artificial pile of rubble from the ruins of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>.<br clear="all" />
      <p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>
      <p>Berlin has a <a href="../../wp/t/Temperate.htm" title="Temperate">temperate</a>/mesothermal climate (Cfb) according to the <!--del_lnk--> K&ouml;ppen climate classification system. The mean annual temperature for Berlin-Dahlem (a location within <!--del_lnk--> Steglitz-Zehlendorf) is 9.4<!--del_lnk--> &deg;C (48.9<!--del_lnk--> &deg;F) and its mean annual precipitation totals 578 mm (22.8 inches). The warmest months are June, July, and August, with mean temperatures of 16.7 to 17.9&deg;C (62.1 to 64.2&deg;F). The coldest are December, January, and February, with mean temperatures of &minus;0.4 to 1.2&deg;C (31.3 to 34.2&deg;F). Berlin&#39;s built-up area creates a <!--del_lnk--> microclimate, with heat stored by the city&#39;s buildings. Temperatures can be 4&deg;C higher in the city than in the surrounding areas.<table class="wikitable">

      <p>The city&#39;s appearance today is predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany&#39;s history in the <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a>. Each of the national governments based in Berlin&mdash;the 1871 <!--del_lnk--> German Empire, the <a href="../../wp/w/Weimar_Republic.htm" title="Weimar Republic">Weimar Republic</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>, <!--del_lnk--> East Germany, and now the reunified <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>&mdash;initiated ambitious construction programs, each with its own distinctive character. Berlin was devastated by bombing raids during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, and many of the old buildings that escaped the bombs were eradicated in the 1950s and 1960s in both West and East. Much of this destruction was initiated by municipal architecture programs, to build new residential or business quarters and main roads. Berlin&#39;s unique recent history has left the city with an eclectic array of architecture and sights.<p>Neighborhoods still reveal whether one is in the former eastern or western part of the city. In the eastern part, many <!--del_lnk--> Plattenbauten can be found, reminders of <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Bloc ambitions to create complete residential areas with fixed ratios of shops, kindergartens and schools. Another difference between former east and west is in the design of little red and green men on pedestrian crossing lights (<!--del_lnk--> Ampelm&auml;nnchen in German); the eastern versions received an opt-out during the standardization of road traffic signs after re-unification, and have survived to become a popular icon in tourist products. However, they are by now common in western Berlin too and so can no longer be considered a uniquely East Berlin phenomenon.<p>

The <!--del_lnk--> Social Democratic Party (SPD) and <!--del_lnk--> Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) took control of the city government after the <!--del_lnk--> 2001 state election and won another term in the <!--del_lnk--> 2006 state election.<p>The Governing Mayor is simultaneously lord mayor of the city (<i>Oberb&uuml;rgermeister der Stadt</i>) and prime minister of the federal state (<i>Ministerpr&auml;sident des Bundeslandes</i>). The office of Berlin&#39;s governing mayor is in the <!--del_lnk--> Rotes Rathaus (Red City Hall). Presently (April 2006), this office is held by <!--del_lnk--> Klaus Wowereit of the SPD. The city&#39;s government is based on a coalition between the SPD and Die Linke. PDS, a party formed by a merger of the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) (the successor to <!--del_lnk--> the former East German communist party), which renamed itself in 2005 for cooperation with the <!--del_lnk--> Labor and Social Justice Party.<p>Mainly due to reunification-related expenditures, Berlin as a German state has accumulated more debt than any other city in Germany, with the most current estimate being <a href="../../wp/e/Euro.htm" title="Euro">&euro;</a>61.2 billion.<br clear="all" />

      <p>Berlin is subdivided into twelve <!--del_lnk--> boroughs (<i>Bezirke</i>), but before <!--del_lnk--> Berlin&#39;s 2001 administrative reform there were 23. Each borough is subdivided into a number of localities (<i>Stadtteile</i>), which represent the traditional <!--del_lnk--> urbanized areas that inhabitants identify with. Some of these have been rearranged several times over the years. At present the city of Berlin consists of 96 such localities. The localities often consist of a number of city neighborhoods (usually called <i><!--del_lnk--> Kiez</i> in colloquial German) representing small residential areas.<p>Each borough is governed by a borough council (<i>Bezirksamt</i>) consisting of five councilors (<i>Bezirksstadtr&auml;te</i>) and a borough mayor (<i>Bezirksb&uuml;rgermeister</i>). The borough council is elected by the borough assembly (<i>Bezirksverordnetenversammlung</i>). The boroughs of Berlin are not independent municipalities. The power of borough governments is limited and subordinate to the Senate of Berlin. The borough mayors form the Council of Mayors (<i>Rat der B&uuml;rgermeister</i>), led by the city&#39;s Governing Mayor, which advises the Senate.<p>The localities have no government bodies of their own, even though most of the localities have historic roots in older municipalities that predate the formation of Greater Berlin on <!--del_lnk--> 1 October <!--del_lnk--> 1920. The subsequent position of locality representative (<i>Ortsvorsteher</i>) was discontinued in favour of borough mayors.<p><a id="Sister_cities" name="Sister_cities"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Sister cities</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Town twinning between Berlin and other cities began in 1987, excluding that with Los Angeles which began in 1967. East Berlin&#39;s partnerships were canceled at the time of German reunification and later partially reestablished. West Berlin&#39;s partnerships had previously been restricted to the borough level. During the Cold War era, the partnerships had reflected the different powers blocs, with West Berlin partnering with capitals in the West, and East Berlin mostly partnering with cities from the <!--del_lnk--> Warsaw Pact and its allies.<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="" style="background-color: transparent; width: 100%">

      <p>Before the reunification of Germany and the two Berlin parts in 1990, the city of West Berlin received substantial subsidies from the West German state to compensate for its geographic isolation from West Germany. Many of those subsidies were phased out after 1990. The reduced financial support for the city and its gradual economic decline have produced fiscal difficulties for Berlin&#39;s city government and forced it to cut funding for various programs. The current unemployment rate remains therefore above the German average at 16.5% as of October 2006.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Berlin developed a complex transportation and energy-supply infrastructure before World War II. After the war, West Berlin was cut off from the surrounding territory and had to develop independent infrastructures. Meanwhile, the government of East Germany purposely constructed rail lines and highways that allowed traffic to bypass West Berlin. The political reunification of East and West Berlin has led to the reintegration of Berlin&#39;s transportation and energy-supply with the infrastructures of the surrounding region. Crossing 979 bridges, 5334 kilometers of roads run through Berlin, of which 66 kilometers are motorways. In 2004, 1.428 million motor vehicles, including 6800 taxis, were registered in the city.Long-distance rail lines connect Berlin with all of the major cities of Germany and with many cities in neighboring European countries. Regional rail lines provide access to the surrounding region of Brandenburg and eastern Germany.<p><a id="Transportation" name="Transportation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Transportation</span></h3>

      <p>The inner city is crossed from west to east by the elevated main line (<i>Stadtbahn</i>), which carries S-Bahn trains as well as regional and long-distance trains. This main line passes through most of the city&#39;s long-distance and regional train stations, including <!--del_lnk--> Berlin-Charlottenburg, <!--del_lnk--> Berlin Zoologischer Garten, <!--del_lnk--> Berlin Hauptbahnhof, <!--del_lnk--> Friedrichstra&szlig;e, <!--del_lnk--> Alexanderplatz, and <!--del_lnk--> Berlin Ostbahnhof.<p>The second component of Berlin&#39;s rail network is the S-Bahn ring (<i>Ringbahn</i>) that forms a circle around the inner city and crosses the main line at <!--del_lnk--> Westkreuz (&ldquo;west crossing&rdquo;) and <!--del_lnk--> Ostkreuz (&ldquo;east crossing&rdquo;). A number of regional and regional express lines connect Berlin with the surrounding region. The city is also served by the freight rail yard at Seddin, south of Potsdam.There are useful online resources for getting around Berlin using public transport, such as the route planner or a map of the current public transport network.<br clear="all" />

      <p>Berlin has three commercial airports&mdash;<!--del_lnk--> Tegel International Airport (TXL), <!--del_lnk--> Tempelhof International Airport (THF), and <!--del_lnk--> Sch&ouml;nefeld International Airport (SXF) serving 155 destinations (07/2006)- 118 of them in Europe. Sch&ouml;nefeld lies just outside Berlin&#39;s south-eastern border in the state of Brandenburg, while the other two airports lie within the city. Tempelhof handles only short-distance and commuter flights, and there are plans to close the airport and transfer its traffic to Berlin&#39;s other two airports. There are longer-term plans to close Tegel as well. Sch&ouml;nefeld is currently undergoing expansion. Berlin&#39;s airport authority aims to transfer all of Berlin&#39;s air traffic in 2011 to a greatly expanded airport at Sch&ouml;nefeld, to be renamed <!--del_lnk--> Berlin Brandenburg International Airport.<p>

      <p>During the division of Berlin, the power grid of West Berlin was cut off from the power grid of the surrounding area in <!--del_lnk--> East Germany. West Berlin&#39;s <a href="../../wp/e/Electricity.htm" title="Electricity">electricity</a> supply was provided by thermal <!--del_lnk--> power stations. To facilitate buffering during load peaks, accumulators were installed during the 1980s at some of these power stations. These were connected by static inverters to the power grid and were loaded during times of low <!--del_lnk--> power consumption and unloaded during times of high consumption. In 1993 the power connections to the surrounding areas (previously in East Germany) which had been capped in 1951 were restored. In the western districts of Berlin nearly all power lines are underground cables&mdash;only a 380 kV and a 110 kV line, which run from Reuter substation to the urban <!--del_lnk--> Autobahn, use overhead lines. The <!--del_lnk--> Berlin 380 kV electric line was constructed when West Berlin&#39;s electrical system was a totally independent system and not connected to those of East or West Germany. This has now become the backbone of the whole city&#39;s power system.<p>Berlin&#39;s power supply is mainly, although not exclusively, provided by the Swedish firm <!--del_lnk--> Vattenfall. The company has come under criticism for relying more heavily than other electricity producers in Germany on <!--del_lnk--> lignite as an energy source, because burning lignite produces harmful emissions. However, Vattenfall has announced a commitment to shift towards reliance on cleaner, renewable energy sources.<p><a id="Berlin_quotations" name="Berlin_quotations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Berlin quotations</span></h2>
