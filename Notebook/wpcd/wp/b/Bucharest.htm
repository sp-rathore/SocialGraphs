      <p><b>Bucharest</b> (<!--del_lnk--> Romanian: <i>Bucure&#x15F;ti</i> <span class="IPA audiolink nounderlines" style="white-space: nowrap;"><!--del_lnk--> /bu.ku&#x2C8;re&#x283;t&#x2B2;/</span> ) is the <!--del_lnk--> capital city and industrial and commercial centre of <a href="../../wp/r/Romania.htm" title="Romania">Romania</a>. It is located in the southeast of the country, at <span class="plainlinksneverexpand"><!--del_lnk--> 44&deg;25&prime;N 26&deg;06&prime;E</span>, and lies on the banks of the <!--del_lnk--> D&acirc;mbovi&#x163;a River.<p>By European standards Bucharest is not an old city, its existence first being referred to by scholars as late as 1459. Since then it has gone through a variety of changes, becoming the state capital of Romania in 1862 and steadily consolidating its position as the centre of the Romanian mass media, culture and arts. Its eclectic architecture is a mix of historical, interbellum, Communist-era, and modern. In the period between the two World Wars, the city&#39;s elegant architecture and the sophistication of its elite earned Bucharest the nickname of the &quot;Paris of the East&quot; or &quot;Little Paris&quot; (<i>Micul Paris</i>). Although many buildings and districts in the historic centre were damaged or destroyed by war, earthquakes and <!--del_lnk--> Nicolae Ceau&#x15F;escu&#39;s program of <!--del_lnk--> systematization, much survived. In recent years, the city has been experiencing an economic and cultural boom.<p>According to the 2002 census, Bucharest proper has a population of 1,921,751. There are approximately 2.3 million inhabitants in the greater metropolitan area. Economically, the city is by far the most prosperous in Romania and is one of the main industrial centres and transportation hubs of <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Europe. As the most important city in Romania, Bucharest also has a broad range of educational facilities.<p>The city is administratively known as the Municipality of Bucharest (<i>Municipiul Bucure&#x15F;ti</i>), and has the same administrative level as a <!--del_lnk--> county, being further subdivided into six <!--del_lnk--> sectors.<p>

      <p>Bucharest is situated on the banks of the <!--del_lnk--> D&acirc;mbovi&#x163;a River, which flows into the <!--del_lnk--> Arge&#x15F; River, a tributary of the <a href="../../wp/d/Danube.htm" title="Danube">Danube</a>. Several lakes &ndash; the most important of which are <!--del_lnk--> Lake Floreasca, <!--del_lnk--> Lake Tei and <!--del_lnk--> Lake Colentina &ndash; stretch across the city, along the <!--del_lnk--> Colentina River, a tributary of the D&acirc;mbovi&#x163;a. In addition, in the centre of the capital there is a small artificial lake &ndash; Lake Ci&#x15F;migiu &ndash; surrounded by the <!--del_lnk--> Ci&#x15F;migiu Gardens. The Ci&#x15F;migiu Gardens have a rich history, being frequented by famous poets and writers. Opened in 1847 and based on the plans of German architect <!--del_lnk--> Carl F.W. Meyer, the gardens are currently the main recreational facility in the city centre.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Besides Ci&#x15F;migiu, Bucharest contains several other large parks and gardens, including <!--del_lnk--> Her&#x103;str&#x103;u Park and the <!--del_lnk--> Botanical Garden. Her&#x103;str&#x103;u is a large public park located in the north of the city, and the site of the <!--del_lnk--> Village Museum, while the Bucharest&#39;s botanical garden is the largest in Romania and contains over 10,000 species of plants, many of them exotic; it was once a pleasure park for the royal family.<p>Bucharest is situated in the south eastern corner of the <!--del_lnk--> Romanian Plain, in an area once covered by the <!--del_lnk--> Vl&#x103;siei forest, which, after it was cleared, gave way to a fertile flatland. As with <!--del_lnk--> many cities, Bucharest is traditionally considered to have seven hills, in the tradition of the seven hills of <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a>. Bucharest&#39;s seven hills are: <!--del_lnk--> Mihai Vod&#x103;, <!--del_lnk--> Patriarchy Hill, <!--del_lnk--> Radu Vod&#x103;, <!--del_lnk--> Cotroceni, <!--del_lnk--> Spirei, <!--del_lnk--> V&#x103;c&#x103;re&#x15F;ti and <!--del_lnk--> Sf. Gheorghe Nou.<p>The city has a total area of 226 <!--del_lnk--> km&sup2;. The altitude varies from 55.8 metres at the D&acirc;mbovi&#x163;a bridge in <!--del_lnk--> C&#x103;&#x163;elu, south-eastern Bucharest and 91.5 m at the <!--del_lnk--> Militari church. The city has a relatively round shape, with the centre situated approximately in the cross-way of the main north-south/east-west axes at the <!--del_lnk--> University Square. The milestone for Romanian&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> kilometre zero is placed just south of University Square in front of the New St. George Church (Sf&acirc;ntul Gheorghe Nou) at St. George Square (Pia&#x163;a Sf&acirc;ntul Gheorghe). Bucharest&#39;s radius, from University Square to the city limits in all directions, varies from about 10 to 12 km.<p>Until recently, the regions surrounding Bucharest were largely rural, but after 1989, new suburbs started to be built around Bucharest, in the surrounding <!--del_lnk--> Ilfov county. Further urban consolidation is expected to take place when the Bucharest metropolitan area is formed in 2006, which will incorporate various communes and cities of Ilfov and surrounding counties.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h2>

      <p>Bucharest has a <!--del_lnk--> continental climate, characterised by hot dry <a href="../../wp/s/Summer.htm" title="Summer">summers</a> and cold <a href="../../wp/w/Winter.htm" title="Winter">winters</a>. Due to its position on the <!--del_lnk--> Romanian Plain, the city&#39;s winters could get windy, even though some of the winds are mitigated due to <!--del_lnk--> urbanisation. Winter temperatures are often below 0&deg;C, even though they rarely drop below -10&deg;C. In summer, the average temperature is approximately 23&deg;C (the average for July and August), despite the fact that temperatures sometimes reach 35-40&deg;C in mid-summer in the city centre. Although average <!--del_lnk--> precipitation and <!--del_lnk--> humidity during summer is low, there are infrequent yet heavy and often violent storms. During spring and autumn, temperatures vary between 18-22&deg;C, and precipitation during this time tends to be higher than in summer, with more frequent yet milder periods of rain.<table class="wikitable" style="width: 75%; margin: 0 auto 0 auto;">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Bucharest has a unique status in Romanian administration, since it is the only municipality that is not part of a <!--del_lnk--> county. Its population, however, is larger than that of any Romanian county, and hence the power of the Bucharest General City Hall (<i>Prim&#x103;ria General&#x103;</i>), which is the city&#39;s local government body, is about the same as, if not greater than, that of Romanian county councils.<p>The city government is headed by a <!--del_lnk--> General Mayor (<i>Primar General</i>), currently (as of 2006) <!--del_lnk--> Adriean Videanu. Decisions are approved and discussed by the <!--del_lnk--> General Council (<i>Consiliu General</i>) made up of 55 elected councillors. Furthermore, the city is divided into six administrative <!--del_lnk--> sectors (<i>sectoare</i>), each of which has their own 27-seat sectorial council, town hall and mayor. The powers of local government over a certain area are therefore shared by the Bucharest City Hall and the local sectorial councils with little or no overlapping of authority. The general rule is that the main City Hall is responsible for citywide utilities such as the water system, the transport system and the main boulevards, while sectorial town halls manage the contact between individuals and the local government, secondary streets, parks, schools and cleaning services.<div class="thumb tright">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>The six sectors are numbered from one to six and are disposed radially so that each one has under its administration an area of the city centre. They are numbered clockwise and are further divided into districts without any form of administration (<i>cartiere</i>):<ul>
       <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Sector 1</b>: <!--del_lnk--> B&#x103;neasa, <!--del_lnk--> Pipera, <!--del_lnk--> Floreasca<li><b><!--del_lnk--> Sector 2</b>: <!--del_lnk--> Pantelimon, <!--del_lnk--> Colentina, <!--del_lnk--> Iancului, <!--del_lnk--> Muncii, <!--del_lnk--> Tei<li><b><!--del_lnk--> Sector 3</b>: <!--del_lnk--> Vitan, <!--del_lnk--> Dude&#x15F;ti, <!--del_lnk--> Titan, <!--del_lnk--> Centrul Civic<li><b><!--del_lnk--> Sector 4</b>: <!--del_lnk--> Berceni, <!--del_lnk--> Olteni&#x163;ei, <!--del_lnk--> V&#x103;c&#x103;re&#x15F;ti<li><b><!--del_lnk--> Sector 5</b>: <!--del_lnk--> Rahova, <!--del_lnk--> Ferentari, <!--del_lnk--> Cotroceni<li><b><!--del_lnk--> Sector 6</b>: <!--del_lnk--> Giule&#x15F;ti, <!--del_lnk--> Drumul Taberei, <!--del_lnk--> Militari, <!--del_lnk--> Cr&acirc;nga&#x15F;i</ul>
      <p>Like all other local councils in Romania, the Bucharest sectorial councils, the city&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> General Council and the mayors are elected every four years by the population. Additionally, Bucharest has a prefect, who is appointed by Romania&#39;s central government. The prefect is not allowed to be a member of a political party. The prefect&#39;s role is to represent the national government at local level, acting as a liaison and facilitating the implementation of National Development Plans and governing programmes at local level. The current prefect of Bucharest (as of 2006) is <!--del_lnk--> Mioara Mantale.<p>The Municipality of Bucharest, along with the surrounding <!--del_lnk--> Ilfov county, forms the <!--del_lnk--> Bucharest development region, which is equivalent to <!--del_lnk--> NUTS-II regions in the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> and is used by the European Union and the Romanian Government for statistical analysis and regional development. The Bucharest development region is not, however, an administrative entity.<p><a id="Justice_system" name="Justice_system"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Justice system</span></h3>
      <p>Bucharest&#39;s judicial system is similar to that of the Romanian counties. Each of the six sectors has their own local tribunal, while appeals from these tribunals&#39; verdicts, and more serious cases, are directed to the Bucharest Court of Appeals, the city&#39;s municipal court. Bucharest is also home to Romania&#39;s supreme court, the <!--del_lnk--> High Court of Cassation and Justice, as well as other national courts such as the Constitutional Court of Romania and the National Military Tribunal.<p>Bucharest has its own municipal police force, the Bucharest Police (<i>Poli&#x163;ia Bucure&#x15F;ti</i>), which is responsible for policing of crime within the whole city, and operates a number of special divisions. The Bucharest Police are headquartered on &#x15E;tefan cel Mare Blvd in the city centre, and has a number of precincts throughout the city. From 2004 onwards, each sector City Hall also has under its administration a Community Police force (<i>Poli&#x163;ia Comunitar&#x103;</i>), dealing with local community issues. Bucharest also houses the General Inspectorate of the <!--del_lnk--> Gendarmerie and the General Inspectorate of the <!--del_lnk--> National Police.<p><a id="Crime" name="Crime"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Crime</span></h3>
      <p>Bucharest&#39;s crime rate is rather low in comparison to other European capital cities, with the number of total offences declining by 51% between 2000 and 2004. In particular, levels of <!--del_lnk--> violent crime remain very low, with 24 murders and 1069 other violent offences taking place in 2004. Although there have been a number of recent police crackdowns on <!--del_lnk--> organised crime gangs, such as the C&#x103;m&#x103;taru clan, organised crime generally has a reduced impact on public life. Petty crime, however, is more common, particularly in the form of <!--del_lnk--> pickpocketing, which occurs mainly on the city&#39;s public transport network. Additionally, <!--del_lnk--> confidence tricks such as the <!--del_lnk--> Maradona scam are sometimes common, especially in regards to tourists, even though the frequency of these tricks has declined in recent years. Levels of crime are higher in the southern districts of the city, particularly in <!--del_lnk--> Ferentari, a socially-disadvantaged area mainly inhabited by people of <!--del_lnk--> Roma ethnicity.<p>Although the presence of <!--del_lnk--> street children was a problem in Bucharest in the 1990s, their numbers have declined significantly in recent years, currently lying at or below the average of major European capital cities. The same is true for <!--del_lnk--> beggars and <!--del_lnk--> homeless people, many of them from the disadvantaged <!--del_lnk--> Roma minority. However, there are still an estimated 1,000 street children in the city, many of whom engage in petty crime and begging. There has also been speculation that the street children are recruited by professional underground networks for criminal purposes. From 2000 onwards, Bucharest has seen an increase in illegal road races which occur mainly at night in the city&#39;s outskirts or on industrial sites.<p>A significant problem in the city remains <!--del_lnk--> institutional corruption, which is seen as the most important justice-and-law related problem in the city. While corruption in Romania has declined in recent years due to various government efforts, Bucharest&#39;s level of institutional corruption remains somewhat higher than the Romanian average.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>Bucharest&#39;s history alternated periods of development and decline from the early settlements of the <!--del_lnk--> Antiquity and until its consolidation as capital of Romania late in the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a>. According to the most popular of legends in circulation, the city was founded by a shepherd named <!--del_lnk--> Bucur.<p>First mentioned as &quot;the <!--del_lnk--> Citadel of Bucure&#x15F;ti&quot; in <!--del_lnk--> 1459, it became a residence of the <!--del_lnk--> Wallachian <!--del_lnk--> prince <!--del_lnk--> Vlad III the Impaler. The Old Princely Court (<i><!--del_lnk--> Curtea Veche</i>) was built by <!--del_lnk--> Mircea Ciobanul, and during following rules, Bucharest was established as the summer residence of the court, competing with <!--del_lnk--> T&acirc;rgovi&#x15F;te for the status of capital after an increase in the importance of southern <!--del_lnk--> Muntenia brought about by the demands of the <!--del_lnk--> suzerain power, the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>.<p>Burned down by the Ottomans and briefly discarded by princes at the start of the <a href="../../wp/1/17th_century.htm" title="17th century">17th century</a>, Bucharest was restored and continued to grow in size and prosperity. Its centre was around the street &quot;Uli&#x163;a Mare&quot;, which starting 1589 was known as <!--del_lnk--> Lipscani. Before the 1700s, it became the most important trade centre of Wallachia and became a permanent location for the Wallachian court after 1698 (starting with the reign of <!--del_lnk--> Constantin Br&acirc;ncoveanu).<p>Partly destroyed by natural disasters and rebuilt several times during the following 200 years, hit by <i><!--del_lnk--> Caragea&#39;s plague</i> in <!--del_lnk--> 1813-<!--del_lnk--> 1814, the city was wrested from Ottoman control and occupied at several intervals by the <!--del_lnk--> Habsburg Monarchy (<!--del_lnk--> 1716, <!--del_lnk--> 1737, <!--del_lnk--> 1789) and <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Russia (three times between <!--del_lnk--> 1768 and <!--del_lnk--> 1806). It was placed under <!--del_lnk--> Russian administration between <!--del_lnk--> 1828 and the <a href="../../wp/c/Crimean_War.htm" title="Crimean War">Crimean War</a>, with an interlude during the Bucharest-centered <!--del_lnk--> 1848 Wallachian revolution, and an <!--del_lnk--> Austrian garrison took possession after the Russian departure (remaining in the city until March 1857). Additionally, on <!--del_lnk--> March 23, <!--del_lnk--> 1847, a fire consumed about 2,000 buildings of Bucharest, destroying a third of the city. The social divide between rich and poor was described at the time by <!--del_lnk--> Ferdinand Lassalle as making the city &quot;a savage hotchpotch&quot;.<p>In 1861, when Wallachia and <!--del_lnk--> Moldavia were united to form the <!--del_lnk--> Principality of Romania, Bucharest became the new nation&#39;s capital; in 1881, it became the political centre of the newly-proclaimed <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Romania. During the second half of the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a>, due to its new status, the city&#39;s population increased dramatically, and a new period of urban development began. The extravagant architecture and cosmopolitan high culture of this period won Bucharest the nickname of &quot;The Paris of the East&quot; (or &quot;Little Paris&quot;, <i>Micul Paris</i>), with <!--del_lnk--> Calea Victoriei as its <!--del_lnk--> Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es or <!--del_lnk--> Fifth Avenue.<p>Between <!--del_lnk--> December 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1916 and November 1918, it was occupied by <!--del_lnk--> German forces, the legitimate capital being moved to <!--del_lnk--> Ia&#x15F;i. After <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, Bucharest became the capital of <!--del_lnk--> Greater Romania. As the capital of an <!--del_lnk--> Axis country, Bucharest suffered heavy losses during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, due to <!--del_lnk--> Allied bombings, and, on <!--del_lnk--> August 23, <!--del_lnk--> 1944, saw the <!--del_lnk--> the royal coup which brought Romania into the anti-<a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">German</a> camp, suffering a short but destructive period of <!--del_lnk--> Luftwaffe bombings in reprisal. On <!--del_lnk--> November 8, <!--del_lnk--> 1945, the king&#39;s birthday, the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a>-backed <!--del_lnk--> Petru Groza government suppressed pro-<!--del_lnk--> monarchist rallies.<p>During <!--del_lnk--> Nicolae Ceau&#x15F;escu&#39;s leadership (1965-1989), most of the historic part of the city was destroyed and replaced with Communist-style buildings, particularly high-rise apartment blocks. The best example of this is the development called <!--del_lnk--> Centrul Civic (the Civic Centre), including the <!--del_lnk--> Palace of the Parliament, where an entire historic quarter was razed to make way for Ceau&#x15F;escu&#39;s grandomanic constructions. In 1977, a strong <!--del_lnk--> 7.4 on the Richter-scale earthquake claimed 1,500 lives and destroyed many old buildings. Nevertheless, some historic neighbourhoods did survive to this day.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Romanian Revolution of 1989 began with mass anti-Ceau&#x15F;escu protests in <!--del_lnk--> Timi&#x15F;oara in December 1989 and continued in Bucharest, leading to the overthrow of the <!--del_lnk--> Communist regime. Dissatisfied with the post-revolutionary leadership of the <!--del_lnk--> National Salvation Front, students&#39; leagues and opposition groups organized large-scale protests continued in 1990 (the <!--del_lnk--> Golaniad), which were violently stopped by the miners of <!--del_lnk--> Valea Jiului (the <!--del_lnk--> Mineriad). Several other Mineriads followed, the results of which included a government change.<p>After the year 2000, due to the advent of Romania&#39;s economic boom, the city has modernised and is currently undergoing a period of urban renewal. Various residential and commercial developments are underway, particularly in the northern districts, while Bucharest&#39;s historic centre is currently undergoing significant restoration.<p><a id="Treaties_signed_in_Bucharest" name="Treaties_signed_in_Bucharest"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Treaties signed in Bucharest</span></h3>

      <p>The city&#39;s population, according to the 2002 census, is 2,082,000 inhabitants, or about 9% of the population of Romania. Additionally, there are about 50,000 people who commute to the city every day, mainly from the surrounding <!--del_lnk--> Ilfov county.<p>Bucharest&#39;s population experienced two phases of rapid growth, the first in the late 19th century, when the city grew in importance and size, and the second during the <!--del_lnk--> Communist period, when a massive urbanisation campaign was launched and many people <!--del_lnk--> migrated from rural areas to the capital. At this time, due to Ceau&#x15F;escu&#39;s ban on abortion and contraception, <!--del_lnk--> natural increase was also significant. Since the fall of Communism, however, the city&#39;s population continues to gently fall, due both to <!--del_lnk--> emigration and to a declining birth rate.<p>Approximately 97% of the population of Bucharest are <!--del_lnk--> ethnic Romanians, with the second largest ethnic group being the <!--del_lnk--> Roma, which make up 1.4% of the population. Other significant ethnic groups are <!--del_lnk--> Hungarians (0.3%), <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jews">Jews</a> (0.1%), <!--del_lnk--> Turks (0,1%), <!--del_lnk--> Germans (0,1%) and <!--del_lnk--> Chinese (0.1%). Some other inhabitants of Bucharest are of <!--del_lnk--> Greek, <!--del_lnk--> Armenian, <!--del_lnk--> Lipovan and <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italian</a> descent. The Greeks and the Armenians used to play significant roles in the life of the city at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century. One the predominantly Greek neighbourhoods <!--del_lnk--> Vitan - where a <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jew">Jewish</a> population also lived; the latter was more present in <!--del_lnk--> V&#x103;c&#x103;re&#x15F;ti and areas around <!--del_lnk--> Unirii Square.<p>In terms of religion, 96.1% of the population are <!--del_lnk--> Romanian Orthodox, 1.2% are <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic, 0.5% are <!--del_lnk--> Muslim and 0.4% are <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Rite-Catholic. Despite this, only 24% of the population, of any religion, attend a place of worship once a week or more. The life expectancy of residents of Bucharest in 2003-2005 was 74.14 years, around 2 years higher than the Romanian average. Female life expectancy was 77.41 years, in comparison to 70.57 years for males.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>

      <p>Bucharest is the most economically-developed and <!--del_lnk--> industrialised city in Romania, producing around 21% of the country&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> GDP and about one-quarter of its industrial production, while only accounting for 9% of the country&#39;s population. Almost one third of national taxes is paid by Bucharest&#39;s citizens and companies. Based on local purchasing power, Bucharest has a per-capita GDP of nearly 60% that of the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> average, and more than twice the <a href="../../wp/r/Romania.htm" title="Romania">Romanian</a> average. Based on the fact that Bucharest produces around 21% of Romanian GDP for a population of around 2 million, the GDP (<!--del_lnk--> PPP) per capita of the city would be US$20,057. The city&#39;s strong economic growth has revitalised infrastructure and led to the development of many shopping malls and modern residential towers and high-rise office buildings. In September <!--del_lnk--> 2005, Bucharest had an unemployment rate of 2.6%, significantly lower than the national unemployment rate of 5.7%.<p>Bucharest&#39;s economy is mainly centred on <a href="../../wp/i/Industry.htm" title="Industry">industry</a> and <!--del_lnk--> services, with services particularly growing in importance in the last ten years. The city serves as the headquarters of 186,000 firms, including nearly all large Romanian companies. An important source for growth since 2000 has been the city&#39;s property and construction boom, which has resulted in a significant growth in the construction sector. Bucharest is also Romania&#39;s largest centre for <!--del_lnk--> information technology and communications and is home to several software companies, including <!--del_lnk--> Softwin, which operates internationally. Bucharest contains Romania&#39;s largest stock exchange, the <!--del_lnk--> Bucharest Stock Exchange, which was merged in December <!--del_lnk--> 2005 with the Bucharest-based electronic stock exchange, <!--del_lnk--> Rasdaq.<p>The city has a number of international <!--del_lnk--> supermarket chains such as <!--del_lnk--> Carrefour, <!--del_lnk--> Cora and <!--del_lnk--> METRO. At the moment, the city is undergoing a retail boom, with a large number of supermarkets, and hypermarkets, constructed every year. For more information, see <!--del_lnk--> supermarkets in Romania. The biggest modern shopping centres in Bucharest are <!--del_lnk--> Bucharest Mall, <!--del_lnk--> Plaza Romania, City Mall, <!--del_lnk--> Jolie Ville Galleria and <!--del_lnk--> Unirea Shopping Centre. However, there are also a large number of traditional markets; the one at <!--del_lnk--> Obor covers about a dozen city blocks, and numerous large stores that are not officially part of the market effectively add up to a market district almost twice that size.<p><a id="Transport" name="Transport"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transport</span></h2>

      <p>Bucharest&#39;s extensive public transport system is the largest in Romania and the third largest in Europe. It is made up of the <!--del_lnk--> Bucharest Metro, as well as a surface transport system run by <!--del_lnk--> RATB (Regia Autonoma de Transport Bucuresti), which consists of buses, trams, trolleybuses and <!--del_lnk--> light rail. In addition, there is a private taxi and minibus system. The metro and the surface transport system &mdash; currently run by two separate state-owned corporations &mdash; will be merged in early 2006 to form the Bucharest Metropolitan Transport Board.<p>The city is served by two airports: <!--del_lnk--> Henri Coand&#x103; International Airport (formerly Otopeni) and <!--del_lnk--> Aurel Vlaicu International Airport (formerly B&#x103;neasa). Henri Coand&#x103; is the largest airport in <a href="../../wp/r/Romania.htm" title="Romania">Romania</a> and the main hub for the national operator <!--del_lnk--> TAROM. It is also connected to several international airports by a wide range of international airlines. The smaller Aurel Vlaicu Airport is used for charter flights and low-cost carriers.<p>Bucharest is the hub of Romania&#39;s national railway network, run by <!--del_lnk--> C&#x103;ile Ferate Rom&acirc;ne. The main railway station is <!--del_lnk--> Gara de Nord, or North Station, which provides connections to all major cities in Romania as well as international destinations such as <a href="../../wp/b/Budapest.htm" title="Budapest">Budapest</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Sofia, <a href="../../wp/v/Vienna.htm" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Prague.htm" title="Prague">Prague</a>. The city also has five other railway stations run by CFR, which are in the process of being integrated in a commuter railway serving Bucharest and the surrounding <!--del_lnk--> Ilfov county.<p>The city&#39;s municipal road network is centred around a series of high-capacity boulevards, which generally radiate out from the city centre to the outskirts. The main axes, which run north-south, east-west and northwest-southeast, as well as one internal and one external ring road, support the bulk of the traffic. The city&#39;s roads are usually very crowded during rush hours, due to an increase in car ownership in recent years. Every day, there are more than one million vehicles travelling within the city. This has resulted in wear and <!--del_lnk--> potholes appearing on many Bucharest roads, particularly secondary roads, this being identified as one of Bucharest&#39;s main infrastructural problems. In recent years, there has been a comprehensive effort on behalf of the City Hall to boost road infrastructure and according to the general development plan, nearly 2000 roads are expected to be repaired by 2008.<p>Bucharest is also a major intersection of <!--del_lnk--> Romania&#39;s national road network. It is the origin of most of the country&#39;s national roads and expressways, which link the city to all of Romania&#39;s major cities as well as to neighbouring countries such as <a href="../../wp/h/Hungary.htm" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Bulgaria.htm" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> and <a href="../../wp/u/Ukraine.htm" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>. Romania&#39;s two expressways currently in operation, the <!--del_lnk--> A1 and the <!--del_lnk--> A2, both start from Bucharest. The planned A3 and A4 freeways will also radiate from the Voluntari region in the city&#39;s northern outskirts.<p>Although it is situated on the banks of a river, Bucharest has never functioned as a port city, with other Romanian cities such as <!--del_lnk--> Constan&#x163;a and <!--del_lnk--> Br&#x103;ila acting as the country&#39;s main ports. However, the <!--del_lnk--> Danube-Bucharest Canal, which is 73 km long, is currently in construction and is around 60% completed. When finished, the canal will link Bucharest to the <!--del_lnk--> Danube River and, via the <!--del_lnk--> Danube-Black Sea Canal, to the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Sea.htm" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a>. This corridor is expected to be a significant component of the city&#39;s transport infrastructure and increase sea traffic by a large margin.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

Unlike other parts of Romania, such as the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Sea.htm" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a> coast or <!--del_lnk--> Transylvania, Bucharest&#39;s cultural scene is much more eclectic, without a defined style, and instead incorporates various elements of Romanian and international culture.<p><a id="Landmarks" name="Landmarks"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Landmarks</span></h3>

A newer landmark of the city is the <!--del_lnk--> Memorial of Rebirth, a stylised marble pillar unveiled in 2005 to commemorate the victims of the <!--del_lnk--> Romanian Revolution of 1989, which overthrew Communism. The abstract monument sparked a great deal of controversy when it was unveiled, being dubbed with names such as &quot;the toothpick and the olive,&quot; (<i>&quot;m&#x103;slina-n scobitoare&quot;</i>), as many believed that it didn&#39;t symbolise the revolution well enough.<p>Aside from these landmarks, Bucharest also has a number of cultural venues, mentioned below, that are often considered icons of the city, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Romanian Athaeneum.<p><a id="Visual_arts" name="Visual_arts"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Visual arts</span></h3>

The <!--del_lnk--> National Museum of Contemporary Art (MNAC), situated in a wing of the <!--del_lnk--> Palace of the Parliament, was opened in 2004 and contains a widespread collection of Romanian and international contemporary art, in a number of expressive forms. The MNAC also manages the Kalinderu MediaLab, which caters specifically to multimedia and experimental art.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Performing arts are one of the strongest cultural elements of Bucharest, and the city has a number of world-renowned facilities and institutions. The most prominent is the neoclassical <!--del_lnk--> Romanian Athenaeum, which was founded in 1852, hosts classical music concerts and is home to the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> George Enescu&quot; Philharmonic. Bucharest is also home to the <!--del_lnk--> Romanian National Opera, as well as the <!--del_lnk--> I.L. Caragiale National Theatre. Another well-known theatre in Bucharest is the <!--del_lnk--> State Jewish Theatre, which has gained increasing prominence in recent years due partly to the fact that it features plays starring world-renowned Romanian-Jewish actress <!--del_lnk--> Maia Morgenstern. There is also a large number of smaller theatres throughout the city that cater to specific genres, such as the Comedy Theatre, the Nottara Theatre, the Odeon Theatre, and the <!--del_lnk--> Constantin T&#x103;nase Revue Theatre.<p><a id="Music_and_nightlife" name="Music_and_nightlife"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Music and nightlife</span></h3>

      <p>Bucharest is home to Romania&#39;s largest recording labels, and is often the residence of Romanian, and more recently <a href="../../wp/m/Moldova.htm" title="Republic of Moldova">Moldovan</a>, musicians. The city&#39;s music scene is quite <!--del_lnk--> eclectic. Many Romanian rock bands of the 1970s and 1980s, such as Iris and <!--del_lnk--> Holograf, continue to be popular, particularly with the middle-aged, while since the 1990s there has been growth in the <!--del_lnk--> boy band and <a href="../../wp/h/Hip_hop_music.htm" title="Hip hop music">hip hop</a> genres. The eclectic pop-rock band <!--del_lnk--> Taxi have been gaining international respect, as has <!--del_lnk--> Spitalul de Urgen&#x163;&#x103;&#39;s raucous updating of traditional Romanian music. While many discos play <!--del_lnk--> manele, a Turkish-influenced type of music that is particularly popular in Bucharest&#39;s working class districts, the city has an increasing <a href="../../wp/j/Jazz.htm" title="Jazz">jazz</a> and <!--del_lnk--> blues scene, and, to an extent, <!--del_lnk--> eurodance/<!--del_lnk--> trance and <!--del_lnk--> heavy metal/<!--del_lnk--> punk. The city&#39;s nightlife, particularly its <!--del_lnk--> club scene grew significantly in the 1990s, and continues to increase. The city does not have a central nightlife strip, with many entertainment venues dispersed throughout the city centre.

      <p>Bucharest&#39;s culture has, especially in the last 15 years, become more modern and wordly in comparison to other Romanian cities. Traditional Romanian culture, however, continues to have an influence in domains such as theatre and music. Additionally, Bucharest has two internationally-renowned <!--del_lnk--> ethnographic museums, the <!--del_lnk--> Museum of the Romanian Peasant and the open-air <!--del_lnk--> Village Museum. The Village Museum, in <!--del_lnk--> Her&#x103;str&#x103;u Park, contains 272 authentic buildings and peasant farms from all over Romania. The Museum of the Romanian Peasant was declared the European Museum of the Year in 1996, and displays a rich collection of textiles (especially costumes), icons, ceramics, and other artifacts of Romanian peasant life.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Museum of Romanian History is another important museum in Bucharest, containing a collection of artefacts detailing Romanian history and culture from the prehistoric times, <!--del_lnk--> Dacian era, medieval times and the modern era.<p><a id="Cultural_events_and_festivals" name="Cultural_events_and_festivals"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cultural events and festivals</span></h3>

      <p>There are a number of cultural festivals in Bucharest throughout the year, in various domains, even though most festivals take place in the summer months of June, July and August. The National Opera organises the International Opera Festival every year in May and June, which includes ensembles and orchestras from all over the world. The Romanian Athaeneum Society hosts the <!--del_lnk--> George Enescu Classical Music Festival at various locations throughout the city in September every year. Additionally, the Museum of the Romanian Peasant and the Village Museum organise a number of events throughout the year showcasing Romanian folk arts and crafts. |} In recent years, due to the growing prominence of the Chinese community in Bucharest, several Chinese cultural events have taken place. The first officially-organised Chinese festival was the <!--del_lnk--> Chinese New Year&#39;s Eve Festival of February 2005 which took place in Nichita St&#x103;nescu Park and was organised by the Bucharest City Hall. In 2005, Bucharest was the first city in <!--del_lnk--> Southeastern Europe to host the international <!--del_lnk--> CowParade, which resulted in dozens of decorated cow sculptures being placed at various points across the city. Since 2005 Bucharest has its own contemporary art <!--del_lnk--> biennale, the <!--del_lnk--> Bucharest Biennale. The current (2006) issue (curated by Zsolt P&eacute;tranyi) will go on until the end of June, the next edition will be in 2008.<p>The 2000s also saw an increasing visibility of Bucharest <!--del_lnk--> gay culture, with the opening of the Queen&#39;s Club, the first <!--del_lnk--> LGBT club in the city, in 2001, and the launch of the annual <!--del_lnk--> Bucharest GayFest in 2004.

      <p>Of the city&#39;s <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">medieval</a> architecture, most of what survived into modern times was destroyed by the Communists and replaced by high-rise apartment blocks. Still, some historical precincts remain, the most notable of which is the <!--del_lnk--> Lipscani area. This precinct contains buildings such as <!--del_lnk--> Manuc&#39;s Inn and the ruins of the <!--del_lnk--> Curtea Veche (the Old Court of the King), and during the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> was the heart of Bucharest&#39;s commercial world.

During this time, the city grew significantly in size and sought to emulate other large European capitals such as <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>. Two notable buildings from this time are the <!--del_lnk--> Cre&#x163;ulescu Palace, currently housing cultural institutions including <!--del_lnk--> UNESCO&#39;s European Centre for Higher Education, and the <!--del_lnk--> Cotroceni Palace, the current residence of the <!--del_lnk--> Romanian President. Many large-scale constructions such as <!--del_lnk--> Gara de Nord, the main railway station, and the <!--del_lnk--> National Bank of Romania&#39;s headquarters, date from these times. In the 2000s, a wide variety of historic buildings in the city centre underwent restoration.

      <p>A major part of Bucharest&#39;s architecture is made up of buildings constructed during the <!--del_lnk--> Communist era replacing the historical arhitecture with &quot;more efficient&quot; high density apartment blocks. In Nicolae Ceau&#x15F;escu&#39;s project of <!--del_lnk--> systematization many new buildings were built in previously-historical areas, <!--del_lnk--> which were razed and then built upon from scratch. One of the best examples of this type of architecture is <!--del_lnk--> Centrul Civic, a development that replaced a major part of Bucharest&#39;s historic city centre with giant utilitarian buildings, mainly with <!--del_lnk--> marble or <!--del_lnk--> travertine fa&ccedil;ades, inspired by <a href="../../wp/n/North_Korea.htm" title="North Korea">North Korean</a> architecture. Communist-era architecture can also be found in Bucharest&#39;s residential districts, mainly in <i>blocuri</i>, which are high-density apartment blocks that house the majority of the city&#39;s population.<div class="thumb tright">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Since <!--del_lnk--> the fall of Communism in 1989, several Communist-era buildings have been refurbished, modernised and used for other purposes. Perhaps the best example of this is the conversion of several agro-alimentary complexes into shopping malls and commercial centres. These giant circular halls, which were most often known as <!--del_lnk--> hunger circuses due to the food shortages experienced in the 1980s, were constructed during the Ceau&#x15F;escu era to act as produce markets and <!--del_lnk--> refectories, although most were left unfinished at the time of the Revolution. Modern shopping malls like <!--del_lnk--> Bucharest Mall, <!--del_lnk--> Plaza Romania and <!--del_lnk--> City Mall emerged on pre-existent structures of former hunger circuses. Another example is the modernisation and conversion of a large utilitarian construction in <!--del_lnk--> Centrul Civic into a <!--del_lnk--> Marriott Hotel. This process was accelerated after 2000, when the city underwent a property boom, and many Communist-era buildings in the city centre became prime real estate due to their location. For example, a tram depot built during the Communist times was converted into a new shopping mall, the <!--del_lnk--> Anador Commercial Centre, which opened in 2005. In recent years, many Communist-era apartment blocks have also been refurbished to improve the city&#39;s urban appearance.<p><a id="Modern_architecture" name="Modern_architecture"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Modern architecture</span></h3>

      <p>The newest contribution to Bucharest&#39;s architecture took place after the fall of Communism, and particularly after 2000, when the city went through a period of urban renewal &ndash; and architectural revitalisation &ndash; on the back of Romania&#39;s economic boom. Buildings from this time are mostly made out of <a href="../../wp/g/Glass.htm" title="Glass">glass</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Steel.htm" title="Steel">steel</a>, and often have more than fifteen storeys. Examples include shopping malls (particularly the <!--del_lnk--> Bucharest Mall, a conversion and extension of a &quot;hunger circus&quot;), office buildings, bank headquarters, the <!--del_lnk--> Bucharest World Trade Centre and the <!--del_lnk--> Chamber of Commerce, which lies on the banks of the <!--del_lnk--> D&acirc;mbovi&#x163;a. <!--del_lnk--> As of 2005, there is a significant number of office buildings in construction, particularly in the northern and eastern parts of the city. Additionally, there has been a trend in recent years to add modern wings and <!--del_lnk--> fa&ccedil;ades to historic buildings, the most prominent example of which is the Bucharest Architects&#39; Association Building, which is a modern glass-and-steel construction built inside a historic stone fa&ccedil;ade. Aside from buildings used for business and institutions, various new residential developments are currently underway, many of which consist of modern high-rise buildings with a glass exterior, surrounded by American-style residential communities. These developments are increasingly prominent in the northern suburbs of the city, which are less densely-populated and are home to middle- and upper-class Bucharesters due to the process of <!--del_lnk--> gentrification.<br clear="all" />
