      <p><b>Biofuel</b> is any <!--del_lnk--> fuel that is derived from <!--del_lnk--> biomass &mdash; recently living <a href="../../wp/o/Organism.htm" title="Organism">organisms</a> or their metabolic byproducts, such as manure from cows. It is a <!--del_lnk--> renewable energy source, unlike other <!--del_lnk--> natural resources such as <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a> and <!--del_lnk--> nuclear fuels.<p>One definition of <i>biofuel</i> is any fuel with an 80% minimum content by volume of materials derived from living organisms harvested within the ten years preceding its manufacture.<p>Like coal and petroleum, biomass is a form of stored <!--del_lnk--> solar energy. The energy of the sun is &quot;captured&quot; through the process of <a href="../../wp/p/Photosynthesis.htm" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a> in growing plants. (<i>See also: <!--del_lnk--> Systems ecology</i>) One advantage of biofuel in comparison to most other fuel types is it is biodegradable, and thus relatively harmless to the environment if spilled. 25 Years: The Down Fall of Petrochemical Fuels Intro Petroleum, fossil fuel, fact it is not an inexhaustible source. Current life depends on petroleum, and yet we use it faster than we can make it. To sustain current life, the usage of an alternative fuel, in replacement of petroleum, is critical. The alternative fuels are much healthier for nature and the community. Corn fuel and cooking oils are also inexhaustible. Why Alternate? The alternate fuels have some pros that are a deciding factor among many to switch to the alternate source. The petrochemicals cause many smog problems in cities and suburbs that surround it, therefore causing children and adults alike to have health issues. All alternative fuel sources are much healthier, such as corn-based fuel called gasohol. Also, unlike petrochemicals, the alternative fuel sources are unlimited. The use of alternative fuels such as corn and soybean fuel will increase the economy in the U.S. and decrease the amount of money we send to the Middle East for oil. Also, it &quot;Costs MUCH less than . . . diesel.&quot; (&quot;Quick Breakdown: Vegetable&quot; par.11.) The alternative fuel will also decrease the smog problems, in places like California, New York City, and Chicago.<p>What&rsquo;s Available? Currently there are already alternative fuels on the market, though they are hard to locate. Vegetable oil is one good source of fuel; there is even a bus, which uses vegetable oil for fuel, which travels the country promoting the usage of alternative fuels. Also, vegetable oil is&ldquo;Usually gathered from cooperating restaurants . . . &rdquo; (&ldquo;Quick Breakdown: Vegetable&rdquo; par. 12) Another fuel source is gasohol which can be made out of soybeans and corn. Also, cooking oil in general will work as fuel. The Impact. In 1970 the Clean Air Act was instated for the protection of the U.S. environment and society. &ldquo;Vegetable oil and Biodiesel are virtually sulfur free . . . &rdquo; (&ldquo;Quick Breakdown: Vegetable&rdquo; par. 17) Switching to alternative fuels would support this act. The U.S. would also stop having to export money to the Middle East and start paying off our 8.66 trillion dollar debt. This would affect petroleum-based fuel companies. They will have to adapt for the betterment of the country. This would also hurt the Middle East&rsquo;s economy. Though that is true, the use of corn and soybean fuels will spike the U.S.&rsquo;s, specifically the mid west&rsquo;s, economy upward. It would also promote farmers to work and it would increase their profit.<div class="thumb tleft">

Biodegradable outputs from industry, <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>, <!--del_lnk--> forestry, and households can also be used to produce bioenergy; examples include <!--del_lnk--> straw, <!--del_lnk--> timber, <!--del_lnk--> manure, <a href="../../wp/r/Rice.htm" title="Rice">rice</a> husks, <!--del_lnk--> sewage, <!--del_lnk--> biodegradable waste and food leftovers. These feedstocks are converted into <!--del_lnk--> biogas through <!--del_lnk--> anaerobic digestion. Biomass used as fuel often consists of <!--del_lnk--> underutilized types, like <!--del_lnk--> chaff and animal waste.<p>Much research is currently in progress into the utilization of <!--del_lnk--> microalgae as an energy source, with applications being developed for biodiesel, ethanol, methanol, methane, and even hydrogen. On the rise is use of <!--del_lnk--> hemp, although politics currently restrains this technology.<p><!--del_lnk--> Paradoxically, in some industrialized countries like <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>, food is cheaper than fuel compared by price per <!--del_lnk--> joule . Central heating units supplied by food grade <a href="../../wp/w/Wheat.htm" title="Wheat">wheat</a> or maize are available.<p>Biofuel can be used both for central- and decentralized production of electricity and heat. As of 2005, bioenergy covers approximately 15% of the world&#39;s energy consumption . Most bioenergy is consumed in developing countries and is used for direct heating, as opposed to <a href="../../wp/e/Electricity.htm" title="Electricity">electricity</a> production.<p>The production of biofuels to replace oil and natural gas is in active development, focusing on the use of cheap <!--del_lnk--> organic matter (usually <!--del_lnk--> cellulose, agricultural and sewage waste) in the efficient production of liquid and gas biofuels which yield high <!--del_lnk--> net energy gain. The <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon.htm" title="Carbon">carbon</a> in biofuels was recently extracted from atmospheric <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> by growing plants, so burning it does not result in a net increase of carbon dioxide in the <a href="../../wp/e/Earth%2527s_atmosphere.htm" title="Earth&#39;s atmosphere">Earth&#39;s atmosphere</a>. As a result, biofuels are seen by many as a way to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by using them to replace non-renewable sources of energy. Noticeable is the fact that the quality of timber or grassy biomass does not have a direct impact on its value as an energy-source.<p>Dried compressed <!--del_lnk--> peat is also sometimes considered a biofuel. However, it does not meet the criteria of being a renewable form of energy, or of the carbon being recently absorbed from atmospheric carbon dioxide by growing plants. Though more recent than petroleum or coal, on the time scale of human industrialisation, peat is a fossil fuel and burning it does contribute to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>.<p>

      <p>Biofuel was used since the early days of the car industry. <!--del_lnk--> Nikolaus August Otto, the German inventor of the combustion engine, conceived his invention to run on ethanol. While <!--del_lnk--> Rudolf Diesel, the German inventor of the <!--del_lnk--> Diesel engine, conceived it to run on peanut oil. The Ford Model T, a car produced between 1903 and 1926 used ethanol. However, when crude oil began being cheaply extracted from deeper in the soil (thanks to drilling starting in the middle of the 19th century), cars began using fuels from oil. Nevertheless, before World War II, biofuels were seen as providing an alternative to imported oil in countries such as Germany, which sold a blend of gasoline with alcohol fermented from potatoes under the name <i>Reichskraftsprit</i>. In Britain, grain alcohol was blended with petrol by the Distillers Company Ltd under the name <i>Discol</i> and marketed through <!--del_lnk--> Esso&#39;s affiliate Cleveland.<p>After the War cheap Middle Eastern Oil lessened interest in biofuels. Then with the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979, there was an increase in interests from governments and academics in biofuels. However, interest decreased with the counter-shock of 1986 that made oil prices cheaper again. But since about 2000 with rising oil prices, concerns over the potential <!--del_lnk--> oil peak, greenhouse gas emissions (<a href="../../wp/g/Global_warming.htm" title="Global Warming">Global Warming</a>), and instability in the Middle East are pushing renewed interest in biofuels. Government officials have made statements and given aid in favour of biofuels. For example, U.S. president <a href="../../wp/g/George_W._Bush.htm" title="George W. Bush">George Bush</a> said in his 2006 State of Union speech, that he wants for the United States, by 2025, to replace 75% of the oil coming from the Middle East.<p><a id="Types_of_high_volume_industrial_biomass_on_Earth" name="Types_of_high_volume_industrial_biomass_on_Earth"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Types of high volume industrial biomass on Earth</span></h2>

Butanol can be burned &quot;straight&quot; in existing gasoline engines (without modification to the engine or car), produces more energy and is less corrosive and less water soluble than ethanol, and can be distributed via existing infrastructures.<li>Mixed Alcohols (e.g., mixture of ethanol, propanol, butanol, <!--del_lnk--> pentanol, <!--del_lnk--> hexanol and <!--del_lnk--> heptanol, such as <!--del_lnk--> Ecalene<sup>TM</sup>), obtained either by <!--del_lnk--> biomass-to-liquid technology (namely gasification to produce syngas followed by <!--del_lnk--> catalytic synthesis) or by <!--del_lnk--> bioconversion of biomass to mixed alcohol fuels.<li><!--del_lnk--> GTL or <!--del_lnk--> BTL both produce synthetic fuels out of biomass in the so called <!--del_lnk--> Fischer Tropsch process.

      <p>One widespread use of biofuels is in home cooking and heating. Typical fuels for this are wood, charcoal or dried dung. The biofuel may be burned on an open fireplace or in a special <!--del_lnk--> stove. The efficiency of this process may vary widely, from 10% for a well made fire (even less if the fire is not made carefully) up to 40% for a custom designed charcoal stove<sup>1</sup>. Inefficient use of fuel may be a minor cause of <!--del_lnk--> deforestation (though this is negligible compared to deliberate destruction to clear land for agricultural use) but more importantly it means that more work has to be put into gathering fuel, thus the quality of cooking stoves has a direct influence on the viability of biofuels.<p>&quot;American homeowners are turning to burning corn in special stoves to reduce their energy bills. Sales of corn-burning stoves have tripled this year [...] Corn-generated heat costs less than a fifth of the current rate for propane and about a third of electrical heat&quot; <!--del_lnk--> .<p><a id="Direct_electricity_generation" name="Direct_electricity_generation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Direct electricity generation</span></h3>
      <p>The methane in biogas is often pure enough to pass directly through gas engines to generate green energy. <!--del_lnk--> Anaerobic digesters or <!--del_lnk--> biogas powerplants convert this renewable energy source into electricity. This can either be used commercially or on a local scale.<p><a id="Use_on_farms" name="Use_on_farms"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Use on farms</span></h3>
      <p>In Germany small scale use of biofuel is still a domain of agricultural farms. It is an official aim of the German government to use the entire potential of 200,000 farms for the production of biofuel and bioenergy. (Source: VDI-Bericht &quot;Bioenergie - Energietr&auml;ger der Zukunft&quot;.<p><a id="Home_use" name="Home_use"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Home use</span></h3>
      <p>Different combustion-engines are being produced for very low prices lately . They allow the private house-owner to utilize low amounts of &quot;weak&quot; compression of methane to generate electrical and thermal power (almost) sufficient for a well insulated residential home.<p><a id="Problems_and_solutions" name="Problems_and_solutions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Problems and solutions</span></h2>
      <p>Unfortunately, much cooking with biofuels is done indoors, without efficient ventilation, and using fuels such as dung causes airborne pollution. This can be a serious health hazard; 1.5 million deaths were attributed to this cause by the <!--del_lnk--> World Health Organisation <!--del_lnk--> as of 2000 <sup>2</sup>. There are various responses to this, such as improved stoves, including those with inbuilt <!--del_lnk--> flues and switching to alternative fuel sources. Most of these responses have difficulties. One is that fuels are expensive and easily damaged. Another is that alternative fuels tend to be more expensive, but the people who rely on biofuels often do so precisely because they cannot afford alternatives. <sup>3</sup> Organisations such as <!--del_lnk--> Intermediate Technology Development Group work to make improved facilities for biofuel use and better alternatives accessible to those who cannot currently get them. This work is done through improving ventilation, switching to different uses of biomass such as the creation of biogas from solid biomatter, or switching to other alternatives such as <!--del_lnk--> micro-hydro power. Many environmentalists are concerned that first growth forest may be felled in countries such as Indonesia to make way for palm oil plantations, driven by rising demand for diesel in SE Asia and Europe.<p><a id="Direct_biofuel" name="Direct_biofuel"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Direct biofuel</span></h2>
      <p>Direct biofuels are biofuels that can be used in existing unmodified petroleum engines. Because engine technology changes all the time, exactly what a direct biofuel is can be hard to define; a fuel that works without problem in one unmodified engine may not work in another engine. In general, newer engines are more sensitive to fuel than older engines, but new engines are also likely to be designed with some amount of biofuel in mind.<p>Straight vegetable oil can be used in some (older) diesel engines. Only in the warmest climates can it be used without engine modifications, so it is of limited use in colder climates. Most commonly it is turned into biodiesel. No engine manufacturer explicitly allows any use of vegetable oil in their engines.<p>Biodiesel can be a direct biofuel. However, no current manufacturer covers their engine under warranty for 100% biodiesel (some have allowed 100% in the past, and it appears that changes in emission standards are the only reason they don&#39;t today, but no official statement exists). Many people have run thousands of miles on biodiesel without problem, and many studies have been made on 100% biodiesel.<p><!--del_lnk--> Butanol is often claimed as a direct replacement for gasoline. It is not in wide spread production at this time, and engine manufacturers have not made statements about its use. While on paper (and a few lab tests) it appears that butanol has sufficiently similar characteristics with gasoline such that it should work without problem in any gasoline engine, no widespread experience exists.<p>Ethanol is the most common biofuel, and over the years many engines have been designed to run on it. Many of these could not run on regular gasoline. It is open to debate if ethanol is a direct replacement in these engines though - they cannot run on anything else. In the late 1990&#39;s engines started appearing that by design can use either fuel. Ethanol is a direct replacement in these engines, but it is debatable if these engines are unmodified, or factory modified for ethanol.<p>Small amounts of biofuel are often blended with traditional fuels. The biofuel portion of these fuels is a direct replacement for the fuel they offset, but the total offset is small. For biodiesel, 5% or 20% are commonly approved by various engine manufacturers. See <!--del_lnk--> Common ethanol fuel mixtures for information on ethanol.<p><a id="International_efforts" name="International_efforts"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">International efforts</span></h2>
      <p>On the other hand, recognizing the importance of bioenergy and its implementation, there are international organizations such as <!--del_lnk--> IEA Bioenergy, established in 1978 by the International Energy Agency (IEA), with the aim of improving cooperation and information exchange between countries that have national programs in bioenergy research, development and deployment.<p><a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> has set a goal for <!--del_lnk--> 2008 that each member state should achieve at least 5.25% biofuel usage of all used traffic fuel.
