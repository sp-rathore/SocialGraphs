      <p>The name Benin has no proper connection to <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Benin (or <!--del_lnk--> Benin City). The name <!--del_lnk--> Dahomey was changed in 1975 to The Republic of Benin, named after the body of water on which the country lies, the <!--del_lnk--> Bight of Benin. This name was picked due to its neutrality, since the current political boundries of Benin encompass over 50 distinct linguistic groups and nearly as many individual ethnic groups. The name <!--del_lnk--> Dahomey was the name of the ancient <!--del_lnk--> Fon Kingdom, and was determined to be an inappropriate name for such a culturally diverse modern country.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>The African kingdom of <!--del_lnk--> Dahomey was formed by a mixture of various local ethnic groups on the Abomey plain. Historian IA Akinjogbin theorized that the insecurity caused by the slave trade may have contributed to mass migrations of different groups, including a segment of the royal family of the city of Allada, to Abomey. These groups coalesced around a strict military culture aimed at securing and eventually expanding the borders of the small kingdom.<p>Dahomey was known for its distinct culture and traditions. Boys were often apprenticed to older soldiers at a young age, and learned about the kingdom&#39;s military customs until they were old enough to join the army. Dahomey was also famous for instituing an elite female soldier corps, called &quot;Ahosi&quot; or &quot;our mothers&quot; in the Fongbe language, but better known as the Dahomean Amazons in English. This emphasis on military preparation and achievement earned Dahomey the nickname of &quot;little black Sparta&quot; from European observers and commentators like <!--del_lnk--> Sir Richard Burton. <!--del_lnk--> Human sacrifice was a common practice, according to contemporary sources; on holidays and special occasions, thousands of slaves and prisoners of war were beheaded in public. Some Dahomean religious beliefs maintained that decapitation enhanced the prestige and potency of the Dahomean throne and its warriors.<p>Though the founders of Dahomey appear to have initially been against it, the slave trade was active in the region of Dahomey for almost three hundred years, leading to the area being named &quot;the Slave Coast&quot;. The demands of court procedures, which demanded that a portion of war captives from the kingdom&#39;s many battles be decapitated, led to a decrease in the amount of enslaved people exported from the area. The number went from 20,000 at the end of the seventeenth century to 12,000 in the beginning of the 1800&#39;s. The decline is partly due to many colonial countries declaring slave trade illegal. This decline continued until 1885, when the last <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> trade vessel with slaves departed from the coast of present day Benin.<p>Along with the powerful Dahomean kingdom, a range of other nations inhabited the area that would become the Republic of Benin. Of note were the <!--del_lnk--> Ketu, Icha, Dassa, Anago, and other sub-groups of the <!--del_lnk--> Yoruba-speaking people. These groups were in close contact with related sub-groups in present-day Nigeria, and were often enemies of the Dahomeans. However, some were also citizens of Dahomey and in regions like present-day <!--del_lnk--> Porto Novo, both groups were intermarried.<p>North of these people were the <!--del_lnk--> Borgu, <!--del_lnk--> Mahi, and several other ethnic groups that form the country&#39;s present population.<p>By the middle of the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a>, Dahomey started to lose its status as the regional power, enabling the <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> to take over the area in <!--del_lnk--> 1892. In <!--del_lnk--> 1899, the land became part of the <!--del_lnk--> French West Africa colony, still as Dahomey. In <!--del_lnk--> 1958, it was granted autonomy as the Republic of Dahomey, and full independence started on <!--del_lnk--> August 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1960.<p>For the next 12 years, ethnic strife contributed to a period of turbulence. There were several coups and regime changes, with three main figures dominating - <!--del_lnk--> Sourou Apithy, <!--del_lnk--> Hubert Maga, and <!--del_lnk--> Justin Ahomadegb&eacute; - each of them representing a different area of the country. These three agreed to form a presidential council after violence had marred the <!--del_lnk--> 1970 elections. In <!--del_lnk--> 1972, a military coup led by <!--del_lnk--> Mathieu K&eacute;r&eacute;kou overthrew the council. He established a <a href="../../wp/m/Marxism.htm" title="Marxism">Marxist</a> government under the control of <!--del_lnk--> Military Council of the Revolution (CNR), and the country was renamed to the People&#39;s Republic of Benin in <!--del_lnk--> 1975. In <!--del_lnk--> 1979, the CNR was dissolved and elections took place. By the late <!--del_lnk--> 1980s, K&eacute;r&eacute;kou abandoned Marxism after an economic crisis and decided to re-establish a parliamentary <!--del_lnk--> capitalist system. He was defeated in <!--del_lnk--> 1991 elections by <!--del_lnk--> Nic&eacute;phore Soglo, becoming the first black African president to step down after an election. He returned to power after winning the <!--del_lnk--> 1996 vote. In <!--del_lnk--> 2001, a closely fought election resulted in K&eacute;r&eacute;kou winning another term. His opponents claimed there were some election irregularities.<p>President K&eacute;r&eacute;kou and former President Soglo did not run in the <!--del_lnk--> 2006 elections, both being barred by the constitution of Benin from running again due to their age and President K&eacute;r&eacute;kou&#39;s two recent terms as president. President K&eacute;r&eacute;kou is widely praised for making no effort to change the constitution so that he could remain in office or run again, unlike some African leaders. An election, considered free and fair, was held on <!--del_lnk--> March 5, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, and resulted in a <!--del_lnk--> runoff between <!--del_lnk--> Yayi Boni and <!--del_lnk--> Adrien Houngb&eacute;dji. The runoff election was held on <!--del_lnk--> March 19 and was won by Yayi Boni, who assumed office on <!--del_lnk--> April 6. The success of the fair multiparty elections in Benin won high praise, and Benin is widely considered a model democracy in Africa.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>

      <p>Stretched between the <a href="../../wp/n/Niger_River.htm" title="Niger River">Niger River</a> in the north and the <!--del_lnk--> Bight of Benin in the south, Benin&#39;s elevation is about the same for the entire country. Most of the population lives in the southern coastal plains, where Benin&#39;s largest cities are also located, including <!--del_lnk--> Porto Novo and <!--del_lnk--> Cotonou. The north of the country consists mostly of <!--del_lnk--> savanna and semi-arid highlands.<p>The climate in Benin is hot and humid with relatively little rain compared to other West African countries, although there are two rainy seasons (April-July and September-November). In the winter the dust winds of the <!--del_lnk--> harmattan can make the nights rather cold.<p>The largest city and commercial capital is <!--del_lnk--> Cotonou. The name <i>Cotonou</i> is from the <!--del_lnk--> Fon phrase <i><span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">ku t&#x254; nu</span></i> &#39;at the lake of the dead&#39;, from the adjacent lagoon. This is a reference to the belief that falling stars represent the souls of those who have just died falling to the underworld. It is said that when Cotonou was founded, the lights of the lacustrine village of <!--del_lnk--> Ganvi&eacute; across the lagoon were reflected in the waters, suggesting fallen stars at the bottom.

      <p>The economy of Benin remains underdeveloped and dependent on subsistence agriculture, <a href="../../wp/c/Cotton.htm" title="Cotton">cotton</a> production, and regional trade. Growth in real output has averaged a stable 5% in the past six years, but rapid population rise has offset much of this increase. <!--del_lnk--> Inflation has subsided over the past several years. In order to raise growth still further, Benin plans to attract more foreign investment, place more emphasis on <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">tourism</a>, facilitate the development of new food processing systems and agricultural products, and encourage new information and <!--del_lnk--> communication technology. The 2001 privatization policy should continue in <!--del_lnk--> telecommunications, water, electricity, and agriculture in spite of initial government reluctance. The <!--del_lnk--> Paris Club and bilateral creditors have eased the external debt situation, while pressing for speeded-up structural reforms.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>There are several dozen <b>ethnolinguistic groups</b> in Benin, representing three of Africa&#39;s language families: <!--del_lnk--> Niger-Congo, <!--del_lnk--> Nilo-Saharan, and <!--del_lnk--> Afroasiatic. The later is represented by <!--del_lnk--> Hausa living mostly as merchants in the north, while Nilo-Saharan is represented by the <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">D&#x25B;ndi</span>, descending from the <!--del_lnk--> Songhai Empire. The <!--del_lnk--> <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">D&#x25B;ndi</span> language predominates along the <a href="../../wp/n/Niger_River.htm" title="Niger River">Niger River</a> in the far north, and is used as a <!--del_lnk--> lingua franca in Muslim areas throughout the north, in Alibori, Borgou, and Donga provinces. Of the Niger-Congo family, five branches are represented:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Mande by the <!--del_lnk--> Boko or Busa, now in the far eastern corner (southern Alibori-northern Borgou), but previously more widely spread before being largely absorbed by the Bariba<li><!--del_lnk--> West Atlantic by the nomadic <!--del_lnk--> Fulbe scattered across the northeast<li><!--del_lnk--> Benue-Congo by the <!--del_lnk--> Yoruba of Collines and Plateau provinces, such as the old kingdom of <!--del_lnk--> Sakete, and the capital city of <a href="../../wp/p/Porto-Novo.htm" title="Porto-Novo">Porto-Novo</a>, having expanded west from <!--del_lnk--> <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">&#x186;y&#x254;</span> and <!--del_lnk--> <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">If&#x25B;</span> in the 12th to 19th centuries<li><!--del_lnk--> Gur (Voltaic) languages predominate in the four northern provinces, with the <!--del_lnk--> <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">Bat&#x254;mbu</span> (Bariba) of the old <!--del_lnk--> Borgou (Bariba) Kingdom occupying most of the countryside in its successor provinces of Borgou and Alibori, as well as the provincial captital of <!--del_lnk--> Parakou; the <!--del_lnk--> Yom throughout much of Donga province and its capital <!--del_lnk--> Djougou; and several groups in the Atakora, including the <!--del_lnk--> <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">B&#x25B;tamarib&#x25B;</span> of the Otammari country around the provincial capital of <!--del_lnk--> Natitingou, the <!--del_lnk--> Biali, the <!--del_lnk--> Waama of <!--del_lnk--> Tangui&eacute;ta, and the <!--del_lnk--> Gulm&agrave;ceba.<li><!--del_lnk--> Kwa, especially the <!--del_lnk--> Gbe languages spoken by the <!--del_lnk--> Tado peoples in the southern and central provinces: the <!--del_lnk--> Aja who established themselves in Kouffo province from neighboring <a href="../../wp/t/Togo.htm" title="Togo">Togo</a> and gave rise to the other Tado peoples of Benin, except for the <!--del_lnk--> Mina of Mono province, who arrived separately from Togo or <a href="../../wp/g/Ghana.htm" title="Ghana">Ghana</a>: The <!--del_lnk--> <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">F&#x254;n</span> culture centered in Zou province around the old <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">F&#x254;n</span> capital of <!--del_lnk--> Abomey, but also dominant in <!--del_lnk--> Cotonou and southern Atlantique areas such as <!--del_lnk--> Ouidah; the <!--del_lnk--> Maxi in central Collines, especially around <!--del_lnk--> Savalou; the <!--del_lnk--> <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">Ayiz&#x254;</span> of central Atlantique (<!--del_lnk--> Allada); the <!--del_lnk--> Xwla and <!--del_lnk--> Xueda in the lagoons of the coast; the <!--del_lnk--> <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">T&#x254;fin</span> of Ou&eacute;m&eacute;; and the <!--del_lnk--> Gun of Porto-Novo. Other Kwa languages are spoken by the <!--del_lnk--> Anii in southern Donga in the region of <!--del_lnk--> Bassila, and the <!--del_lnk--> <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">Foo&#x256;o</span> in western Donga near the town of <!--del_lnk--> Ouak&eacute;.</ul>
      <p>Numerically, the most important people are the Fon, with 1.7 million speakers of the Fon language (2001), followed by the various Yoruba groups (1.2 million), the Aja (600,000), the Bariba (460,000), the Ayizo (330,000), the Fulbe (310,000), and the Gun (240,000). Near the ports in the south can be found people of lighter skin who are descended from returned <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazilian</a> slaves. There are also small numbers of Europeans, principly <!--del_lnk--> French, and Asians, principly <!--del_lnk--> Lebanon and <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">Indians</a>.<p><b>Indigenous religions</b> are followed by a majority of the people and include local <!--del_lnk--> animistic religions in the <!--del_lnk--> Atakora (Atakora and Donga provinces), and <!--del_lnk--> Vodun among the Yoruba and Tado peoples of the centre and south of the country. The town of <!--del_lnk--> Ouidah on the central coast is the spiritual centre of Beninese vodun.<p>The Yoruba and Tado pantheons correspond closely:<ul>
       <li>The <a href="../../wp/g/God.htm" title="God">supreme deity</a> <!--del_lnk--> Mawu (in the Fon language) or <!--del_lnk--> Olodumare (in Yoruba)<li>The god of the earth and smallpox, <!--del_lnk--> Sakpata or Cankpana<li>The god of thunder, <!--del_lnk--> Xevioso or <!--del_lnk--> Cango<li>The god of war and iron, Gu or <!--del_lnk--> Ogun</ul>
      <p>The principal <b>introduced religions</b> are <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a>, introduced by the <!--del_lnk--> Songhai Empire and Hausa merchants, and now followed throughout <!--del_lnk--> Alibori, <!--del_lnk--> Borgou, and <!--del_lnk--> Donga provinces, as well as among the Yoruba, by 10-15% of the population; and <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, followed nominally by another 10-15% throughout the south and centre of Benin and in <!--del_lnk--> Otammari country in the <!--del_lnk--> Atakora. Most Christians, however, continue to hold Vodun beliefs and have incorporated the Christian pantheon into the Vodun.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>
      <p>It is believed that <!--del_lnk--> Vodun (or &quot;Voodoo&quot;, as it is commonly known) originated in Benin and was introduced to <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Caribbean Islands, and parts of North America by <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slaves</a> taken from this particular area of the <!--del_lnk--> Slave Coast. The <!--del_lnk--> indigenous religion of Benin is practiced by about 60% of the population. Since 1992 Vodun has been recognized as one of Benin&#39;s official religions, and a National Vodun Holiday is celebrated on January 10.<p>Many Beninese in the south of the country have <!--del_lnk--> Akan-based names indicating the day of the week they were born on. Twins are important in south Beninese culture, and special names for twins are also used.<p>Local languages are used as the languages of instruction in elementary schools, with French only introduced after several years. Beninese languages are generally transcribed with a separate letter for each speech sound (<!--del_lnk--> phoneme), rather than using <!--del_lnk--> diacritics as in French or <!--del_lnk--> digraphs as in English. This includes Beninese <!--del_lnk--> Yoruba, which in <a href="../../wp/n/Nigeria.htm" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> is written with both diacritics and digraphs. For instance, the <!--del_lnk--> mid vowels written <i>&eacute; &egrave;, &ocirc;, o</i> in French are written <i><span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">e, &#x25B;, o, &#x254;</span></i> in Beninese languages, whereas the <!--del_lnk--> consonants written <i>ng</i> and <i>sh</i> or <i>ch</i> in English are written <i>&#x14B;</i> and <i>c.</i> However, digraphs are used for <!--del_lnk--> nasal vowels and the <!--del_lnk--> labial-velar consonants <i>kp</i> and <i>gb,</i> as in the name of the Fon language <i>Fon gbe</i> <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/f&otilde; &#x261;&#x361;be/</span>, and diacritics are used as <!--del_lnk--> tone marks. In French-language publications, a mixture of French and Beninese orthographies may be seen.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benin&quot;</div>
