This municipality inside Brussels is correctly named <!--del_lnk--> The City of Brussels (French: <i>Bruxelles-Ville</i> or <i>Ville de Bruxelles</i>, Dutch: <i>Stad Brussel</i>), which is one of 19 <!--del_lnk--> municipalities that make up the Brussels-Capital Region (<i>see also</i>: <!--del_lnk--> Municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region). The municipality has a population of about 140,000 while the Brussels-Capital Region has 1,018,804 inhabitants (<!--del_lnk--> 1 January <!--del_lnk--> 2006). The Metropolitan area has about 2,090,000 inhabitants. <!--del_lnk--> <p>The Brussels-Capital Region is one of the three federated regions of Belgium, alongside <!--del_lnk--> Wallonia and the <!--del_lnk--> Flemish Region. Geographically and linguistically, it is a (bilingual) <!--del_lnk--> enclave in the (unilingual) Flemish Region. Regions are one component of Belgium&#39;s complex institutions, the three communities being the other component: the Brussels inhabitants must deal with either the <!--del_lnk--> French (speaking) community or the <!--del_lnk--> Flemish Community for matters such as culture and education.<p>Brussels is also the capital of both the French Community of Belgium (<i>Communaut&eacute; fran&ccedil;aise Wallonie-Bruxelles</i> in French) and of <a href="../../wp/f/Flanders.htm" title="Flanders">Flanders</a> (<i>Vlaanderen</i>); all Flemish capital institutions are established here: <!--del_lnk--> Flemish Parliament, <!--del_lnk--> Flemish government and its administration (though <a href="../../wp/a/Antwerp.htm" title="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> is considered the cultural capital of <a href="../../wp/f/Flanders.htm" title="Flanders">Flanders</a>).<p>Two of the main institutions of the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> - the <!--del_lnk--> European Commission and the <!--del_lnk--> Council of the European Union - have their headquarters in Brussels: the Commission in the <!--del_lnk--> Berlaymont building and the Council in the <!--del_lnk--> Justus Lipsius building facing it. The third institution, the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Parliament.htm" title="European Parliament">European Parliament</a>, also has a parliamentary chamber in Brussels in which its committee meet and some of its plenary sessions are held (the other plenary sessions are held in <!--del_lnk--> Strasbourg, and its administrative headquarters are in <a href="../../wp/l/Luxembourg.htm" title="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a>).<p>Brussels is also the political seat of <a href="../../wp/n/NATO.htm" title="NATO">NATO</a>, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, the <!--del_lnk--> Western European Union (WEU) and <!--del_lnk--> EUROCONTROL, the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation<p>Due to this, some countries have three ambassadors present in Brussels: the normal bi-lateral ambassador, the EU-ambassador, and finally the NATO-ambassador.<p>The &quot;language border&quot; divides Belgium into a northern, Dutch-speaking region, and a southern, French-speaking region. Although the real language border and the official one are largely identical, there are bilingual pockets on both sides with, in certain cases, no specific linguistic rights for the population speaking the other language. The Brussels-Capital Region is officially <!--del_lnk--> bilingual, while the majority of its residents speak French (see the linguistic history of Brussels in this article: <!--del_lnk--> linguistic situation section).<p>The highest building in Brussels is the <!--del_lnk--> South Tower (150 m); the most famous probably the <!--del_lnk--> Atomium, which is a remnant from the <!--del_lnk--> 1958 World Exposition.<p>

      <p>The name Brussels comes from the old Dutch <i>Bruocsella</i>, <i>Brucsella</i> or <i>Broekzele</i>, which means &quot;marsh (<i>bruoc</i>, <i>bruc</i> or <i>broek</i>) home (<i>sella</i> or <i>zele</i>)&quot; or &quot;home consisting of one room, in the marsh&quot;. &quot;Broekzele&quot; was spelt &quot;Bruxelles&quot; in French. In <!--del_lnk--> Belgian French <!--del_lnk--> pronunciation as well as in Dutch, the &quot;k&quot; eventually disappeared and &quot;z&quot; became &quot;s&quot;, as reflected in the current Dutch spelling (<span style="font-size: 0.95em; font-weight: bold; color:#555; position: relative;">(French)</span> /b&#x280;y.&#x2CC;sel/&nbsp;; Dutch /&#x2C8;bry.s(&#x258;)l/ or /&#x2C8;br&#x258;.s(&#x258;)l/).

      <p>In 977 AD, the <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">German</a> emperor <!--del_lnk--> Otto II gave the duchy of <!--del_lnk--> Lower Lotharingia on the empire&#39;s western frontier to <!--del_lnk--> Charles, the banished son of King <!--del_lnk--> Louis IV of France. Mention was already made of Brussels at the time: Bishop Saint-Gery of Cambrai-Arras settled a chapel on a small island (695). A century later <!--del_lnk--> Saint Vindicianus, also a monk of Cambrai-Arras, lived on that island. However, the founding of Brussels is usually said to be when a small castle was built by Charles around 979 on Saint-G&eacute;ry island in the <!--del_lnk--> Zenne or <!--del_lnk--> Senne river. The donation by Emperor Otto II the Great is recorded. Duke Charles had a shrine built for the relics of Saint Gudula in the Saint Gery chapel.<p>In 1041 the county of Brussels was taken over by <!--del_lnk--> Lambert I of <!--del_lnk--> Leuven, one of the <!--del_lnk--> Counts of Leuven who ruled the surrounding county, later the <!--del_lnk--> Duchy of Brabant. Under <!--del_lnk--> Lambert II of Leuven, a new <!--del_lnk--> castrum and the first city walls were built. In the <a href="../../wp/1/12th_century.htm" title="12th century">12th century</a> the small town became an important stop on the trade route from <!--del_lnk--> Brugge and <!--del_lnk--> Ghent to <a href="../../wp/c/Cologne.htm" title="Cologne">Cologne</a>. The village benefited from this favourable position and, as it grew to a population of around 30,000, the surrounding marshes were drained to allow for further expansion. The Counts of Leuven became <!--del_lnk--> Dukes of Brabant at about this time (1183/1184).<p>From 1357 to 1379, a new city wall was constructed as the former one was already proving to be too small: the inner ring or &#39;pentagon&#39; now follows its course.<p>In the <a href="../../wp/1/15th_century.htm" title="15th century">15th century</a>, by means of the wedding of heiress <!--del_lnk--> Margaret III of Flanders with <!--del_lnk--> Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, a new Duke of Brabant emerged from the House of <!--del_lnk--> Valois (namely <!--del_lnk--> Antoine, their son), with another line of descent from the Habsburgs (Maximilian of Austria, later <!--del_lnk--> Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, married <!--del_lnk--> Mary of Burgundy, who was born in Brussels).<p>Brabant had lost its independence, but Brussels became the Princely Capital of the prosperous <!--del_lnk--> Low Countries, and flourished.<p><!--del_lnk--> Charles V, heir of the Low Countries since 1506, though (as he was only 6 years old) governed by his aunt <!--del_lnk--> Margaret of Austria until <!--del_lnk--> 1515, was declared King of the unified <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>, in 1516, in the Cathedral of Saint Gudule in Brussels. Upon the death of his grandfather, <!--del_lnk--> Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1519, Charles became also the new archduke of the Austrian Empire and thus the <!--del_lnk--> Holy Roman Emperor of the Empire &quot;<!--del_lnk--> in which the sun does not set&quot;. It was in the <!--del_lnk--> Palace complex at the Brussels&#39; Coudenberg, that <!--del_lnk--> Charles V abdicated in 1555. This impressive palace, famous all over Europe, had expanded a lot since it was first the seat of the dukes of Brabant, but was sadly destroyed in 1731 in a huge fire (all that now remains is an archaeological site).<p>In 1695 Brussels was attacked by general Villeroy of King <a href="../../wp/l/Louis_XIV_of_France.htm" title="Louis XIV of France">Louis XIV of France</a>. A bombardment destroyed the city&#39;s heart: more than 4,000 houses were set on fire, including the medieval buildings on the Grote Markt or <!--del_lnk--> Grand Place.<p>In 1830, the <!--del_lnk--> Belgian revolution took place in Brussels after a performance of <!--del_lnk--> Auber&#39;s opera <i><!--del_lnk--> La Muette de Portici</i> at <!--del_lnk--> De Munt or <!--del_lnk--> La Monnaie theatre. On <!--del_lnk--> July 21, <!--del_lnk--> 1831, <!--del_lnk--> Leopold I, the first King of the Belgians, ascended the throne, undertaking the destruction of the city walls and the construction of many buildings. Under <!--del_lnk--> L&eacute;opold II, the city underwent many more changes: the Zenne was culverted (as it brought diseases), the <!--del_lnk--> North-South Junction was built, and the <!--del_lnk--> Tervuren Avenue was laid out.<p>From <!--del_lnk--> May 10, <!--del_lnk--> 1940, Brussels was bombed by the German army however most of the damage was done in 1944-1945. The <!--del_lnk--> Heysel Stadium disaster took place in Brussels on <!--del_lnk--> May 29, <!--del_lnk--> 1985. The Brussels Capital Region was founded on June 18, 1989.<p>Brussels is famous for celebrating its history, as well as history in general. This is most evident in the fact that Brussels has well over 100 museums.<p><a id="Brussels_as_capital_of_Belgium" name="Brussels_as_capital_of_Belgium"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Brussels as capital of Belgium</span></h2>
      <div style="text-align: center; margin: 0 10%;">
      </div>
      <p>Although some misbelieve that the capital of Belgium is Brussels at large, according to the Belgian Constitution (Art. 194) the capital of Belgium is the City of Brussels municipality. Arguments that the use of lower case in &quot;<i>ville</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>stad</i>&quot; in Article 194 for &quot;<i>ville de Bruxelles</i>&quot; (French), &quot;<i>stad Brussel</i>&quot; (Dutch) makes a subtle difference and means that Brussels at large is the capital cannot be defended on a legal basis. However, although the City of Brussels is the official capital, the by the federation and region delegated funds for the representative role of the capital are divided among the 19 municipalities and in practice, national Belgian institutions are indeed not only located in the City of Brussels, although many are, but also in most of the other 18 municipalities of the Brussels-Capital region. Meaning that <i>de facto</i> the entire Region serves as capital, but <i>de jure</i> only the City of Brussels is entitled to the title of capital city of Belgium.<p><a id="Places_of_interest" name="Places_of_interest"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Places of interest</span></h2>

      <p>Brussels&rsquo; identity owes much to its rich folklore and traditions, among the liveliest in the country:<ul>
       <li>A good introduction to the <i>brusseleir</i> local dialect and way of life can be obtained at the <i>House of Toone</i>. This theatre of <!--del_lnk--> marionettes, originally located in the Marolles area, is now delivering its slapstick comedy in a <!--del_lnk--> 1696 estaminet a stone throw away from the <!--del_lnk--> Grand Place.<li>The <i>Ommegang</i> (from old Dutch: <i>walking around</i>) started in the <!--del_lnk--> 14th-century as a religious <!--del_lnk--> procession. Taking place every year in July, it now commemorates Charles V&rsquo;s <!--del_lnk--> Joyous Entry in the city in <!--del_lnk--> 1549. The colourful parade includes floats, traditional giant puppets, such as <!--del_lnk--> Saint Michael and <!--del_lnk--> Saint Gudula, and scores of folkloric groups, either on foot or on horseback, dressed in medieval garb. The parade ends in a <!--del_lnk--> pageant on the Grand Place.<li>The <i>Meyboom</i> (<i>tree of May</i>) is an even older Brussels tradition (<!--del_lnk--> 1308), which takes place paradoxically on <!--del_lnk--> August 9. After parading a young <!--del_lnk--> beech in the city, it is planted in a joyful spirit involving lots of music, <i>brusseleir</i> songs, and giant puppets.</ul>

      <p>Brussels Capital Region is officially bilingual French-Dutch, although French, mother tongue of the majority of the population, is the <!--del_lnk--> lingua franca and is most widely used. Every public institution in Brussels, however, has to be bilingual.<p>For most centuries of its history, Dutch, (Brabantian variant), or more precisely the linguistic predecessor of it, was the common vernacular. French was only used by upper classes (less than 5% of the population). Research in the city&#39;s archives indicates that Dutch was by far the most widely used of the two as a vernacular and in its local administration, until the French occupation in <!--del_lnk--> 1793, even though French had been the language of the governors since the Burgundian era (probably some governors also spoke Dutch). <!--del_lnk--> <p>During the 19th and the 20th century, Belgium was completely dominated by the French-speaking bourgeoisie. Although the majority (about 60%) of the Belgian population spoke Dutch, it was French that became the official language. Civil administration, justice, education and even socio-economic business were for a long time conducted in French, even in the Dutch-speaking areas of the country. Brussels, naturally, attracted far more French-speaking immigrants than any other part of the country since it was there that the apparatus of the central government of the French-only speaking state was installed. In the capital Brussels, it was even more obvious that French rather than Dutch was the language of chances and prestige and more useful, as higher education and the better jobs all required French. Moreover, the Belgian state (founded in 1830) recognised Dutch, the language of the majority of its population, as an official language only in 1878.<p>According to a 2001 study by Rudi Janssens, a sociolinguist at the <!--del_lnk--> VUB, 80% of the population are more or less native French-speakers, 8.5% are native Dutch-speakers and 10.2% have both Dutch and French as a mother tongue (often mixed-language parents). Allophones, who speak neither Dutch nor French at home, are a small but growing segment of the population. One third of Brussels&#39; inhabitants has a foreign origin and does not have Belgian nationality. Since Brussels is completely surrounded by Flemish territory, the number of Dutch speakers is quite large during working hours and in cultural consumption time. In a survey conducted by the <!--del_lnk--> Universite Catholique de Louvain in <!--del_lnk--> Louvain-La-Neuve and published in June 2006, 51% of respondents from Brussels claimed to be bilingual. <p>It should be noted that due to the growth of the city of Brussels, the periphery, which is institutionally part of Dutch-speaking Flanders, attracts an important French-speaking population. In some of the municipalities immediately bordering the Brussels Capital Region, the majority of the population has become French-speaking, in a few cases numbering over 70%. The often minimal knowledge of Dutch of some French speakers and the perceived unwillingness of some to learn Dutch, although they live in Flanders, along with the increasingly nationalistic agenda of most flemish politicians, have led to friction between the two communities. One way of quickly identifying whether you are in Brussels or in Flanders is by looking at the colors on the pilars of the traffic lights: they are red and white in Brussels, and yellow and black in Flanders.<p>A curiosity is the &quot;Marollien&quot; dialect, heavily influenced by <!--del_lnk--> Walloon which used to be spoken mostly in a central section of the city. Today, the Brussels dialects are on the verge of extinction, although some try to revive them (see links).<p><a id="Universities_and_colleges" name="Universities_and_colleges"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Universities and colleges</span></h2>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Brussels metro dates back to <!--del_lnk--> 1976 (but underground lines known as <i>premetro</i> have been serviced by tramways since <!--del_lnk--> 1968). A comprehensive bus and <!--del_lnk--> tram network also covers the city.

      <p>In mediaeval times Brussels stood at the intersection of routes running north-south (the modern Hoogstraat/Rue Haute) and east-west (Gentsesteenweg/Chauss&eacute;e de Gand-Grasmarkt/Rue du March&eacute; aux Herbes-Naamsestraat/Rue de Namur). The ancient pattern of streets radiating from the <i>Grote Markt/Grand&#39;Place</i> in large part remains, but has been overlaid by boulevards built over the River <!--del_lnk--> Zenne/Senne, the city walls and the railway junction between the North and South Stations.<p>As one expects of a capital city, Brussels is the hub of the fan of old national roads, the principal ones being clockwise the N1 (N to <!--del_lnk--> Breda), N2 (E to <!--del_lnk--> Maastricht), N3 (E to <a href="../../wp/a/Aachen.htm" title="Aachen">Aachen</a>), N4 (SE to <a href="../../wp/l/Luxembourg.htm" title="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a>) N5 (S to <!--del_lnk--> Rheims), N6 (SW to <!--del_lnk--> Maubeuge), N8 (W to <!--del_lnk--> Koksijde) and N9 (NW to <!--del_lnk--> Ostend) . Usually named <i>steenwegen/chauss&eacute;es</i>, these highways normally run straight as a die, but on occasion lose themselves in a <!--del_lnk--> labyrinth of narrow shopping streets.<p>As for motorways, the town is skirted by the <!--del_lnk--> European route E19 (N-S) and the <!--del_lnk--> E40 (E-W), while the <!--del_lnk--> E411 leads away to the SE. Brussels has an <!--del_lnk--> orbital <!--del_lnk--> motorway, numbered <i>R0</i> (R-zero) and commonly referred to as the &quot;ring&quot; (French: <i>ring</i> Dutch: <i>grote ring</i>). It is pear-shaped as the southern side was never built as originally conceived, owing to residents&#39; objections.<p>The city centre, sometimes known as &quot;the pentagon&quot;, is surrounded by the &quot;small ring&quot; (Dutch: <i>kleine ring</i>, French: <i>petite ceinture</i>), a sequence of boulevards formally numbered <i>R20</i>. These were built upon the site of the second set of city walls following their demolition. Metro line 2 runs under much of these.<p>On the eastern side of the city, the <i>R21</i> (French: <i>grande ceinture</i>, no particular name in Dutch) is formed by a string of boulevards that curves round from Laken (<!--del_lnk--> Laeken) to Ukkel (<!--del_lnk--> Uccle). Some <i>premetro</i> stations (see <!--del_lnk--> Brussels metro) were built on that route. A little further out, a stretch numbered R22 leads from Zaventem to <!--del_lnk--> Sint-Job.<p><a id="Conferences_and_world_fairs" name="Conferences_and_world_fairs"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Conferences and world fairs</span></h2>
