It was first documented as a <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Britain.htm" title="Roman Britain">Roman</a> <!--del_lnk--> spa, although tradition suggests that it was founded earlier. The waters from its spring were believed to be a cure for many afflictions. From <!--del_lnk--> Elizabethan to <!--del_lnk--> Georgian times it was a resort city for the wealthy.

The river, once an unnavigable series of <!--del_lnk--> braided streams broken up by <!--del_lnk--> swamps and <a href="../../wp/p/Pond.htm" title="Pond">ponds</a>, has been managed by <!--del_lnk--> weirs into a single channel. Nevertheless, periodic flooding, which shortened the life of many buildings in the lowest part of the city, was normal until major flood control works in the 1970s.<p>The city has the hottest <!--del_lnk--> geothermal springs in the UK.

Bath came into <!--del_lnk--> Avon when that <!--del_lnk--> non-metropolitan county was created in 1974. Since the abolition of Avon in 1996, Bath has been the main centre of the <!--del_lnk--> unitary authority of <!--del_lnk--> Bath and North East Somerset (B&amp;NES).

      <p>According to the <a href="../../wp/p/Politics_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Politics of the United Kingdom">UK Government</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> 2001 census, Bath, together with North East Somerset (that is, more or less, the Mendip Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty), has a population of 169,040, with an average age of 39.9 (the national average being 38.6). According to the same statistics, the district is overwhelmingly populated by people of a white ethnic background at 97.2% &mdash; significantly higher than the national average of 90.9%. Other non-white ethnic groups in the district, in order of population size, are <!--del_lnk--> multiracial at 1%, Asian at 0.5% and black at 0.5% (the national averages are 1.3%, 4.6% and 2.1%, respectively).<p>The district is largely <!--del_lnk--> Christian at 71%, with no other religion reaching more than 0.5%. These figures generally compare with the national averages, though the <!--del_lnk--> non-religious, at 19.5%, are significantly more prevalent than the national 14.8%. Since Bath is known for the restorative powers of its waters, it is interesting to note that only 7.4% of the population describe themselves as &quot;not healthy&quot; in the last 12 months, compared to a national average of 9.2%; only 15.8% of the inhabitants say they have had a long-term illness, as against 18.2% nationally.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>The archaeological evidence shows that the site of the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Baths&#39; main spring was treated as a shrine by the <!--del_lnk--> Celts, and dedicated to the goddess <!--del_lnk--> Sulis. The Romans probably occupied Bath shortly after their invasion of Britain in 43 AD. They knew it as <i>Aquae Sulis</i> (literally &quot;the waters of Sul&quot;), identifying the goddess with <!--del_lnk--> Minerva. In Roman times the worship of Sulis Minerva continued and messages to her scratched onto metal have been recovered from the Sacred Spring by archaeologists. These are known as <!--del_lnk--> curse tablets. These curse tablets were written in Latin, and usually laid curses on other people, whom they feel had done them wrong. For example, if a citizen had his clothes stolen at the Baths, he would write a curse on a tablet, to be read by the Goddess Sulis Minerva, and also, the &quot;suspected&quot; names would be mentioned. The corpus from Bath is the most important found in Britain.<p>During the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Britain.htm" title="Roman Britain">Roman period</a>, increasingly grand temples and bathing complexes were built in the area, including the Great Bath. Rediscovered gradually from the 18th century onward, they have become one of the city&#39;s main attractions. The city was given defensive walls, probably in the 3rd century. From the later 4th century on, the <a href="../../wp/w/Western_Roman_Empire.htm" title="Western Roman Empire">Western Roman Empire</a> and its urban life declined. However, while the great <i><!--del_lnk--> suite of baths</i> at Bath fell into disrepair, some use of the hot springs continued.<p><a id="Post-Roman_and_Saxon" name="Post-Roman_and_Saxon"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Post-Roman and Saxon</span></h3>
      <p>It has been suggested that Bath may have been the site of the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Mons Badonicus (circa 500 AD), where <a href="../../wp/k/King_Arthur.htm" title="King Arthur">King Arthur</a> is said to have defeated the <!--del_lnk--> Saxons, but this <!--del_lnk--> is disputed. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle mentions Bath falling to the <a href="../../wp/w/Wessex.htm" title="Wessex">West Saxons</a> in 577 after the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Deorham. The <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxons called the town <b>Ba&eth;um</b>, Ba&eth;an or Ba&eth;on, meaning &quot;at the baths,&quot; and this was the source of the present name. In 675, <!--del_lnk--> Osric, King of the <!--del_lnk--> Hwicce, set up a monastic house at Bath, probably using the walled area as its precinct. <!--del_lnk--> King Offa of <a href="../../wp/m/Mercia.htm" title="Mercia">Mercia</a> gained control of this monastery in 781 and rebuilt the church, which was dedicated to <!--del_lnk--> St. Peter. Bath had become a royal possession. The old Roman street pattern was by now lost, and <a href="../../wp/a/Alfred_the_Great.htm" title="Alfred the Great">King Alfred</a> laid out the town afresh, leaving its south-eastern quadrant as the abbey precinct. <!--del_lnk--> Edgar of England was crowned king of England in Bath Abbey in 973.<p><a id="Norman.2C_Medieval_and_Tudor" name="Norman.2C_Medieval_and_Tudor"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Norman, Medieval and Tudor</span></h3>
      <p>King <!--del_lnk--> William Rufus granted the city to a royal physician, <!--del_lnk--> John of Tours, who became Bishop of <!--del_lnk--> Wells and Abbot of Bath in 1088, with permission to move the seat of <!--del_lnk--> Somerset from Wells to Bath, in line with current papal policy of encouraging bishops to move to more urban seats. He planned and began a much larger church as his cathedral, to which was attached a priory, with the bishop&#39;s palace beside it. New baths were built around the three springs.<p>Later bishops preferred Wells, whither the episcopal seat accordingly moved. By the 15th century, Bath&#39;s abbey church was badly dilapidated and in need of repairs. <!--del_lnk--> Oliver King, <!--del_lnk--> Bishop of Bath and Wells, decided in 1500 to rebuild it on a smaller scale. The new church was completed just a few years before Bath Priory was dissolved in 1539 by <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_VIII_of_England.htm" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a>. The abbey church was allowed to become derelict before being restored as the city&#39;s parish church in the <!--del_lnk--> Elizabethan period, when the city revived as a <!--del_lnk--> destination spa. The <!--del_lnk--> baths were improved and the city began to attract the aristocracy in the bathing seasons. Bath was granted <!--del_lnk--> city status by Royal Charter in <!--del_lnk--> 1590.<p><a name="17th_century"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">17th century</span></h3>

      <p>There had been much rebuilding in the <!--del_lnk--> Stuart period, but this was eclipsed by the massive expansion of the city in <!--del_lnk--> Georgian times. The old town within the walls was also largely rebuilt. This was a response to the continuing demand for elegant accommodation for the city&#39;s fashionable visitors, for whom Bath had become a pleasure resort as well as a spa. The architects <!--del_lnk--> John Wood the elder and his son <!--del_lnk--> John Wood the younger laid out the new quarters in streets and squares, the identical facades of which gave an impression of palatial scale and classical decorum. The creamy gold of <!--del_lnk--> Bath stone further unified the city, much of it obtained from the <!--del_lnk--> limestone <!--del_lnk--> Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines under <!--del_lnk--> Combe Down, which were owned by <!--del_lnk--> Ralph Allen (1694&ndash;1764). The latter, in order to advertise the quality of his quarried limestone, commissioned the elder John Wood to build him a country house on his <!--del_lnk--> Prior Park estate. A shrewd politician, he dominated civic affairs and became mayor several times.<p>The early 18th century saw Bath acquire its first purpose-built theatre, pump room and assembly rooms. Master of Ceremonies <!--del_lnk--> Beau Nash, who presided over the city&#39;s social life from 1705 until his death in 1761, drew up a code of behaviour for public entertainments. However, the city declined as a fashionable resort in the 19th century.<p>Bath elected two members to the <!--del_lnk--> unreformed House of Commons.<p><a name="19th_century"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">19th century</span></h3>
      <p>By the 1801 census the population of the city had reached 40,020 making it amongst the largest cities in Britain.<br /> Bath&#39;s most well known resident Jane Austen moved to the city with her father, mother and sister Cassandra in 1801. The family remained in the city until 1806 even though her father died there in 1805.<br /> The Austen family lived at 4 addresses in the city gradually sliding downmarket with each move. Whilst Jane Austen is reputed to have not liked Bath, it is probable that she was less happy about being uprooted from a comfortable country existence which she had enjoyed up to that date than she was with the city. She didn&#39;t write much whilst living in the city although Bath features centrally in two of her novels &#39;Northanger Abbey&#39; and &#39;Persuasion&#39;<br /> Jane Austen&#39;s time in Bath and the influence which the city had on her writing is celebrated in a permanent exhibition at <!--del_lnk--> The Jane Austen Centre.<p>In 1822 another of Bath&#39;s famous residents moved to the city. <!--del_lnk--> William Thomas Beckford bought a house in <!--del_lnk--> Lansdown Crescent, eventually buying a further two houses in the Crescent to form his residence. Having acquired all the land between his home and the top of <!--del_lnk--> Lansdown Hill, he created a garden over half a mile in length and built <!--del_lnk--> Beckford&#39;s Tower at the top.<p><a name="20th_century"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">20th century</span></h3>

      <p>During the 18th century, Bath was an extremely fashionable cultural hub, attracting the aristocracy and gentry from far and wide. This gave the city the finance and incentive to undertake large cultural developments. It was during this time that Bath&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Theatre Royal was first built, as well as <a href="../../wp/a/Architecture.htm" title="Architecture">architectural</a> triumphs such as <!--del_lnk--> Royal Crescent, <!--del_lnk--> Lansdown Crescent, the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Crescent, <!--del_lnk--> The Circus and <!--del_lnk--> Pulteney Bridge.<p>Today, Bath has five <a href="../../wp/t/Theatre.htm" title="Theatre">theatres</a> &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> Bath Theatre Royal, <!--del_lnk--> Ustinov Studio, The Egg, the <!--del_lnk--> Rondo Theatre, and the <!--del_lnk--> Mission Theatre &mdash; and attracts internationally renowned companies and directors, including <!--del_lnk--> Sir Peter Hall. The city also has a long-standing musical tradition; <!--del_lnk--> Bath Abbey is home to the <!--del_lnk--> Klais Organ and is the largest concert venue in the city, with about 20 concerts and 26 organ recitals each year. Another important concert venue is the <!--del_lnk--> Forum, a restored 1700-seat <!--del_lnk--> art deco cinema. The city holds the <!--del_lnk--> Bath International Music Festival and <!--del_lnk--> Mozartfest every year. Other festivals include the annual <!--del_lnk--> Bath Film Festival, <!--del_lnk--> Bath Literature Festival, the <!--del_lnk--> Bath Fringe Festival and the <!--del_lnk--> Bath Beer Festival.<p>The city is home to the <!--del_lnk--> Victoria Art Gallery, the <!--del_lnk--> Museum of East Asian Art, and <!--del_lnk--> The Holburne Museum of Art, as well as numerous museums, among them <!--del_lnk--> The Bath Postal Museum, <!--del_lnk--> The Museum of Costume, <!--del_lnk--> The Jane Austen Centre, the <!--del_lnk--> William Herschel Museum and the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Baths. The <!--del_lnk--> Bath Royal Literary and Scientific Institution, now in Queen Square, and founded in 1824 on the base of a 1777 Society for the encouragement of Agriculture, Planting, Manufactures, Commerce and the Fine Arts, has an important collection and holds a rich and popular programme of talks and discussions. See &#39;Places of interest&#39; below for details of many other places of artistic, cultural and historical interest.<p>There are numerous commercial art galleries and antique shops in Bath, which is one of the most important centres of the English antiques trade outside London.<p>For a list of churches in Bath, see <!--del_lnk--> here.

      <p>Perhaps the best known resident of Bath was <a href="../../wp/j/Jane_Austen.htm" title="Jane Austen">Jane Austen</a>, who lived in the city from 1801 until 1806. However, Jane Austen never liked the city, and wrote to her sister Cassandra, &quot;It will be two years tomorrow since we left Bath for Clifton, with what happy feelings of escape.&quot; Despite her feelings regarding the city, Bath has honoured her name with the Jane Austen Centre and a city walk based on Austen. After leaving the city, Austen wrote two novels, <i><!--del_lnk--> Northanger Abbey</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Persuasion</i> (written 1816, published 1818), which are largely set in the city and feature descriptions of taking the waters, social life, and cultural resources such as music recitals.<ul>

      <p>The city has several <!--del_lnk--> public parks, the main one being <!--del_lnk--> Royal Victoria Park, a short walk from the centre of the city. It was opened in 1830 and has an area of 57 acres (231,000 m&sup2;).

The park features a <!--del_lnk--> botanical garden, a large children&#39;s play park, and sports facilities, including <!--del_lnk--> crazy golf, <!--del_lnk--> bowls and <!--del_lnk--> lawn tennis.

Jane Austen wrote of Sydney Gardens that &quot;It would be pleasant to be near the Sydney Gardens.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Sally Lunn&#39;s buns (a type of <!--del_lnk--> teacake) have long been baked in Bath.

They can be eaten with sweet or savoury toppings.<p>Visitors sometimes confuse <i>Sally Lunn&#39;</i>s buns with <i><!--del_lnk--> Bath Buns</i> &mdash; smaller, round, very sweet, very rich buns that were associated with the city following <a href="../../wp/t/The_Great_Exhibition.htm" title="The Great Exhibition">The Great Exhibition</a>. Bath Buns were originally topped with crushed &#39;comfits&#39; created by dipping caraway seeds repeatedly in boiling sugar; but today seeds are added to a &#39;London Bath Bun&#39; (a reference to the bun&#39;s promotion and sale at the Great Exhibition). The seeds may be replaced by crushed sugar granules or &#39;nibs&#39;.<p>Bath has also lent its name to one other distinctive recipe &mdash; <i>Bath Olivers</i> &mdash; the dry baked biscuits invented by Dr William Oliver, physician to the <!--del_lnk--> Mineral Water Hospital in 1740. Oliver was an early anti-obesity campaigner, writing a <i>&quot;Practical Essay on the Use and Abuse of warm Bathing in Gluty Cases&quot;</i>. Local legend has it that he bequeathed the recipe for his low calorie biscuits to his coachman, a Mr Atkins, along with &pound;100 and a hundred sacks of flour.

      <p>Bath&#39;s principal industry is <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">tourism</a>. whose visits mainly fall into the categories of <!--del_lnk--> heritage tourism or <!--del_lnk--> cultural tourism. All significant stages of the <!--del_lnk--> history of England are represented within the city, from the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Baths (including their significant <!--del_lnk--> Celtic presence), to <!--del_lnk--> Bath Abbey and the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Crescent, to <!--del_lnk--> Thermae Bath Spa in the 2000s.<p>The size of the tourist industry is reflected in the almost 300 places of accommodation&mdash;including over 80 <!--del_lnk--> hotels, and over 180 <!--del_lnk--> Bed and Breakfasts&mdash;many of which are located in <!--del_lnk--> Georgian buildings and have five-star ratings - a good example being <!--del_lnk--> 3 Abbey Green. The city also contains approximately 100 restaurants, and a similar number of <!--del_lnk--> public houses and <!--del_lnk--> bars. Several companies offer <!--del_lnk--> open-top bus tours around the city, as well as tours on foot and on the river.<p>The tourist season is mainly the summer, though there is a year-round presence of tourists. While many come to Bath to see the city in general, some are attracted to particular aspects of the city, such as the <a href="../../wp/j/Jane_Austen.htm" title="Jane Austen">Jane Austen</a> landmarks or the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Baths.<p><a id="The_Spa" name="The_Spa"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">The Spa</span></h3>
      <p>In 2006, with the opening of <!--del_lnk--> Thermae Bath Spa, the city has attempted to recapture its historical position as the only town in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> offering visitors the opportunity to bathe in naturally heated spring waters.<p><a id="Twinned_towns" name="Twinned_towns"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Twinned towns</span></h3>

      <p>Bath is served by the <!--del_lnk--> Bath Spa railway station (designed by <a href="../../wp/i/Isambard_Kingdom_Brunel.htm" title="Isambard Kingdom Brunel">Isambard Kingdom Brunel</a>), which has regular connections to <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> <!--del_lnk--> Paddington, <a href="../../wp/b/Bristol.htm" title="Bristol">Bristol</a> <!--del_lnk--> Temple Meads, <!--del_lnk--> Cardiff Central, <!--del_lnk--> Swansea, <!--del_lnk--> Exeter, <a href="../../wp/p/Plymouth.htm" title="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Penzance (see <!--del_lnk--> Great Western Main Line), and also <!--del_lnk--> Westbury, <!--del_lnk--> Warminster, <!--del_lnk--> Salisbury, <a href="../../wp/s/Southampton.htm" title="Southampton">Southampton</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Portsmouth.htm" title="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Brighton.htm" title="Brighton">Brighton</a> (see <!--del_lnk--> Wessex Main Line). Services are provided by <!--del_lnk--> First Great Western. There is a suburban station on the main line, <!--del_lnk--> Oldfield Park, which has a limited commuter service to Bristol. The charming <!--del_lnk--> Green Park station, was once operated by the <!--del_lnk--> Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. The line (always steam driven) climbed over the Mendips and served many towns and villages on its 71 mile run to Bournemouth. Sadly this most splendid example of an English rural line was closed by <!--del_lnk--> Beeching in March 1966, with few remaining signs of its existence. However Bath Green Park station building survives and now houses a number of shops.<p>Though Bath does not have an airport, the city is not far from <!--del_lnk--> Bristol International Airport, which may be reached by <a href="../../wp/a/Automobile.htm" title="Automobile">car</a> and by <!--del_lnk--> bus or taxi, and by rail via Bristol Temple Meads or Nailsea and Backwell.<p><!--del_lnk--> National Express operates <!--del_lnk--> coach services from Bath to a number of cities.

      </div>
      <p>Of Bath&#39;s notable buildings, <!--del_lnk--> Bath Abbey is one of the most striking. Whilst appearing very old, it is of more recent construction than most of Britain&#39;s many ancient Abbeys and <!--del_lnk--> cathedrals. Originally a <!--del_lnk--> Norman church on earlier foundations, it was rebuilt in the early 16th century and transformed into a <!--del_lnk--> gothic fantasy of <!--del_lnk--> flying buttresses with crocketed <!--del_lnk--> pinnacles decorating a crenelated and pierced <!--del_lnk--> parapet. The style of architecture employed is known as <!--del_lnk--> late Perpendicular. The choir and transepts have a fine <!--del_lnk--> fan vault by <!--del_lnk--> Robert and <!--del_lnk--> William Vertue, who worked on the fan vault at <!--del_lnk--> King&#39;s College Chapel, Cambridge and designed similar vaulting in the <!--del_lnk--> Henry VII chapel at <a href="../../wp/w/Westminster_Abbey.htm" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>. The nave was given a matching vault in the 19th century. The building is lit by 52 windows.<p>The dominant style of architecture in Bath is <!--del_lnk--> Georgian; this evolved from the <a href="../../wp/p/Palladian_architecture.htm" title="Palladian architecture">Palladian</a> revival style which became popular in the early 18th century. Many of the prominent architects of the day were employed in the development of the city, and as a result Bath has many fine terraces of what appear to be elegant <!--del_lnk--> townhouses. However, the original purpose of much of Bath&#39;s fine architecture is concealed by the honey-coloured classical facades; in an <!--del_lnk--> era before the advent of the luxury <!--del_lnk--> hotel, these apparently elegant residences were frequently purpose-built rooming or lodging houses, where visitors to the city could hire a room, a floor, or (according to their means) an entire house for the duration of their visit, and be waited on by the house&#39;s communal <!--del_lnk--> servants. One example of this kind of aspirational deception is found on the north side of Queen Square. This development was designed to appear from the front as a single residence of palatial proportions, but inside seven more modest residences were concealed.<p>&quot;<!--del_lnk--> The Circus&quot; is one of the most splendid examples of town planning in the city. Three long, curved terraces designed by the elder <!--del_lnk--> John Wood form a circular space or theatre intended for civic functions and games. The games give a clue to the design, the inspiration behind which was the <!--del_lnk--> Colosseum in <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a>. Like the Coliseum, the three facades have a different order of architecture on each floor: <!--del_lnk--> Doric on the ground level, then <!--del_lnk--> Ionic on the <!--del_lnk--> piano nobile and finishing with <!--del_lnk--> Corinthian on the upper floor, the style of the building thus becoming progressively more ornate as it rises. Wood never lived to see his unique example of town planning completed, as he died five days after personally laying the foundation stone on <!--del_lnk--> May 18, <!--del_lnk--> 1754.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The best known of Bath&#39;s terraces is the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Crescent, built between 1767 and 1774 and designed by the younger <!--del_lnk--> John Wood. But all is not what it seems; while Wood designed the great curved facade of what appears to be about 30 houses with Ionic <!--del_lnk--> columns on a rusticated ground floor, that was the extent of his input. Each purchaser bought a certain length of the facade, and then employed their own architect to build a house to their own specifications behind it; hence what appears to be two houses is sometimes one. This system of elegant town planning is betrayed at the rear of the crescent: while the front is completely uniform and symmetrical, the rear is a mixture of differing roof heights, juxtapositions and fenestration. This &quot;<i>all to the front and no rear</i>&quot; architecture occurs repeatedly in Bath.<p>Around 1770 the eminent <a href="../../wp/n/Neoclassicism.htm" title="Neoclassicism">neoclassical</a> architect <!--del_lnk--> Robert Adam designed <!--del_lnk--> Pulteney Bridge, using as the prototype for the three-arched bridge spanning the Avon an original, but unused, design by <!--del_lnk--> Palladio for the <!--del_lnk--> Rialto Bridge in <!--del_lnk--> Venice. Thus, Pulteney Bridge became not just a means of crossing the river, but also a shopping arcade. Along with the Rialto Bridge, is one of the very few surviving bridges in Europe to serve this dual purpose. It has been substantially altered since it was built. The bridge was named after Frances and <!--del_lnk--> William Johnstone Pulteney, the owners of the Bathwick estate for which the bridge provided a link to the rest of Bath.<p>The heart of the Georgian city was the <!--del_lnk--> Pump Room, which, together with its associated Lower Assembly Rooms, was designed by <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Baldwin, a local builder who was responsible for many other buildings in the city, including the terraces in <!--del_lnk--> Argyle Street. Baldwin rose rapidly, becoming a leader in Bath&#39;s architectural history. In 1776 he was made the chief <!--del_lnk--> City Surveyor, and in 1780 became <!--del_lnk--> Bath City Architect. In <!--del_lnk--> 1776 he designed the Bath <!--del_lnk--> Guildhall, where his design of the interior produced what is considered one of the finest neo-classical interiors in the country. <!--del_lnk--> Great Pulteney Street, where he eventually lived, is another of his finest works: this wide <!--del_lnk--> boulevard, constructed circa 1789 and over 1000 ft (300m) long and 100 ft (30m) wide, is one of England&#39;s most attractive thoroughfares, and is lined on both sides by Georgian terraces.<p>Architecturally, Bath is one of the most balanced cities in England, and is an unusual example of coherent town planning combined with well-executed and diverse architectural styles. None the less, in the 1960s and early 1970s some parts of Bath were unsympathetically redeveloped, resulting in the loss of some 18th and 19th century buildings. This process was largely halted by a popular campaign which drew strength from the publication of Adam Fergusson&#39;s <i>The Sack of Bath</i>.<div class="thumb" style="margin: 5px; clear: both;">
