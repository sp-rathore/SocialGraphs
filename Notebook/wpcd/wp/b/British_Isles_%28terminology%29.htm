      <p>The various terms used to describe the different (and sometimes overlapping) geographical and political areas of the <!--del_lnk--> islands traditionally referred to collectively as <b>the British Isles</b> are often a source of confusion. The purpose of this article is to explain the meanings of and inter-relationships among those terms.<p>In brief, the main terms and their simple explanations are:<ul>
       <li>Geographical terms <ul>
         <li><a href="../../wp/b/British_Isles.htm" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> consist of <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and many smaller surrounding islands. There are <!--del_lnk--> some problems associated with the use of this term and its definition.<li><a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> is the largest island of the <!--del_lnk--> archipelago (sometimes informally referred to as <!--del_lnk--> Britain)<li><a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> is the second largest island of the archipelago.</ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li>Political terms <ul>
         <li>The <!--del_lnk--> United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a <!--del_lnk--> sovereign state occupying the island of Great Britain, the small nearby islands (but not the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands), and the North-Eastern part of the island of Ireland. Often shortened to &#39;United Kingdom&#39;, &#39;UK&#39; or <!--del_lnk--> Britain.<li><a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_Ireland.htm" title="Republic of Ireland">Ireland / Republic of Ireland</a> is a <!--del_lnk--> sovereign state occupying most of the island of Ireland.<li><a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> are the <!--del_lnk--> constituent countries of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.<li><a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> consists of England, Wales and Scotland<li><!--del_lnk--> England and Wales share the same legal system.<li><!--del_lnk--> British Islands consists of the <!--del_lnk--> United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the <a href="../../wp/c/Channel_Islands.htm" title="Channel Islands">Channel Islands</a> and the <a href="../../wp/i/Isle_of_Man.htm" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a>.</ul>
      </ul>
      <p>These various terms can be confusing not only in themselves (partly owing to the similarity between some of the actual words used), but also because they are often used loosely or inaccurately.<p>

Due to the changes in the common usage of the word &quot;British&quot; (to mean &quot;of the United Kingdom&quot;) it is a controversial term, and would be considered offensive by many Irish people, in 2006 the Irish minister for Education announced that school books would have this term removed.<li><!--del_lnk--> Great Britain and Ireland is an increasingly common replacement or substitute for the term <a href="../../wp/b/British_Isles.htm" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>.<li><b><!--del_lnk--> Islands of the North Atlantic</b> is another suggested replacement term for the British Isles, without the same political connotations. However, its convolution, its vagueness, and the popularity of the older term have meant that it is not in common use. The term was used as part of the Strand 3 level of negotiations for the Belfast agreement. (Its acronym, IONA, is also the name of the small but historically important island of <!--del_lnk--> Iona off the coast of Scotland.)<li><!--del_lnk--> British Islands (a political term not in common usage) is the UK, the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey (which in turn includes the smaller islands of <!--del_lnk--> Alderney, <!--del_lnk--> Herm and <!--del_lnk--> Sark).<li><b><!--del_lnk--> Brittany</b>, the historical <!--del_lnk--> Duchy in the West of <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, now a French <i>r&eacute;gion</i>; for this modern administrative sense, see <!--del_lnk--> Bretagne.</ul>

It includes <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>, and the <a href="../../wp/i/Isle_of_Man.htm" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a>, but usually excludes the <a href="../../wp/c/Channel_Islands.htm" title="Channel Islands">Channel Islands</a>. Also included are the thousands of small islands off the coast of both the larger islands such as <a href="../../wp/s/Shetland.htm" title="Shetland">Shetland</a> and <a href="../../wp/o/Orkney.htm" title="Orkney">Orkney</a>. The earliest known usage of this term is in a <!--del_lnk--> Greek text of 325 BC in the form <i>Pretanikai nesoi</i> (Pretanic isles).<p><a id="Great_Britain" name="Great_Britain"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Great Britain</span></h3>
      <p>Great Britain refers to the largest of the British Isles. The word &quot;Great&quot; simply means &quot;larger&quot; (no connection with &quot;greatness&quot; in other senses is intended) in contrast to <!--del_lnk--> Brittany, a historical term for a <!--del_lnk--> peninsula in modern France that largely corresponds with the present day French province of <!--del_lnk--> Bretagne. That region was settled by many British immigrants during the period of <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon migration into Britain, and named &quot;Little Britain&quot; by them. The <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a> term &quot;Bretagne&quot; now refers to the French &quot;Little Britain&quot;, not to the British &quot;Great Britain&quot;, which in French is called <i>Grande-Bretagne</i>.<p><a id="Ireland" name="Ireland"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Ireland</span></h3>
      <p>The second largest island in the archipelago is Ireland.

      <p>Although the <a href="../../wp/c/Channel_Islands.htm" title="Channel Islands">Channel Islands</a> are associated with the United Kingdom politically, they are an outcrop of the nearby French mainland, and historically they are the last remaining parts of the former <!--del_lnk--> Duchy of Normandy still under the crown of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>.<p><a id="Political_distinctions" name="Political_distinctions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Political distinctions</span></h2>

      <p><i>The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</i> is usually shortened to United Kingdom, UK or Britain. <i>Great Britain</i> is also widely used as a synonym for the UK.<p>The <b>United Kingdom</b> is a sovereign <!--del_lnk--> state. Its four <!--del_lnk--> constituent countries, whilst having equal rights to elect <!--del_lnk--> Members of Parliament on (nominally) the same terms, are sometimes considered to be of different status. This view may be supported by the existence of <!--del_lnk--> devolved governments with different levels of power in Scotland and Wales (see <!--del_lnk--> Asymmetrical federalism). Due to historical precedent, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, and <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a> are <!--del_lnk--> countries and <!--del_lnk--> nations in their own right (although none of these is sovereign today). Wales is also a <a href="../../wp/p/Principality.htm" title="Principality">principality</a> of the United Kingdom (<!--del_lnk--> Prince of Wales is a title usually given to the <!--del_lnk--> heir apparent to the <!--del_lnk--> British throne). <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> is sometimes described by <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> citizens as a <!--del_lnk--> province of the United Kingdom, which derives from the Irish <!--del_lnk--> province of <!--del_lnk--> Ulster, which <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> is part of. This epithet is also applied because it originally was part of the <!--del_lnk--> UK as part of the country of Ireland rather than as a constituent country or nation in its own right. Northern Ireland also had, until 1972, a far greater degree of <!--del_lnk--> self-government than the other constituent parts of the UK. In contrast to the British unionist usage, Irish nationalists consider all of <!--del_lnk--> Ulster to be the province of <!--del_lnk--> Ulster, and organise their sporting and cultural institutions accordingly.<p>The four constituent parts of the UK are also known to some as <i><!--del_lnk--> Home Nations</i> or the &quot;Four Nations&quot;; sporting contests between them are known as &quot;Home internationals&quot; (for example in <a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Football (soccer)">football</a>, see the <!--del_lnk--> British Home Championship).<p>The governing body for soccer in Northern Ireland is called the <!--del_lnk--> Irish Football Association, having been in existence since some 40 years before partition. Its counterpart in the Republic (plus <!--del_lnk--> Derry City FC) is the <!--del_lnk--> Football Association of Ireland. The Northern national team retained the name &quot;Ireland&quot; for some 50 years after partition. It is only since around 1970 that the two teams have been consistently referred to as &quot;Northern Ireland&quot; and &quot;Republic of Ireland&quot; respectively.<p>However, in <!--del_lnk--> Rugby Union, the four <i>Home Nations</i> are England, Ireland (the whole island, i.e. the Republic of Ireland plus Northern Ireland), Scotland and Wales.<p>Culturally, some consider the <!--del_lnk--> Cornish to be distinct from the English, but, politically, <!--del_lnk--> Cornwall is considered by the UK government to have the same status as any other <!--del_lnk--> county in England. However some have raised questions concerning the <!--del_lnk--> constitutional status of Cornwall.<p>Thus, <i>Great Britain</i> is both a geographical and a political entity. Geographically, it is one island, but politically it also contains the islands that belong to its constituent nations - England, Wales and Scotland (most notably England&#39;s <a href="../../wp/i/Isle_of_Wight.htm" title="Isle of Wight">Isle of Wight</a>, Wales&#39; <!--del_lnk--> Anglesey and Scotland&#39;s <a href="../../wp/i/Inner_Hebrides.htm" title="Inner Hebrides">Inner Hebrides</a>, <a href="../../wp/o/Outer_Hebrides.htm" title="Outer Hebrides">Outer Hebrides</a>, <a href="../../wp/o/Orkney.htm" title="Orkney Islands">Orkney Islands</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Shetland Islands).<p>However, the abbreviation <i>GB</i> is sometimes officially used for the UK, for example in the <a href="../../wp/o/Olympic_Games.htm" title="Olympic Games">Olympics</a> - where athletes from Northern Ireland may choose whether to represent the UK or the Republic of Ireland - and as the <!--del_lnk--> vehicle registration plate <!--del_lnk--> country identification code, however the <!--del_lnk--> internet code <i>&quot;<!--del_lnk--> .gb&quot;,</i> although allocated to the UK, is unused (the UK uses <i>&quot;<!--del_lnk--> .uk&quot;</i>). UK teams in the Olympics have competed under several different names - most recently in Athens the athletes were presented at the Opening Ceremony under a banner which said simply Great Britain, rather than the full Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Since the <!--del_lnk--> Good Friday Agreement, and the subsequent implementation legislation, sporting organisation (and several other organisations, e.g. <!--del_lnk--> tourism, and <!--del_lnk--> Irish Gaelic and <!--del_lnk--> Ulster Scots language boards) on the island of Ireland has increasingly been cross-border.<p>Citizens of the UK are called <i>British</i> or <i>Britons</i>. The term <i>Brits</i> may also be used, sometimes <!--del_lnk--> pejoratively, for example by supporters of <!--del_lnk--> Scottish independence when referring to supporters of the <a href="../../wp/a/Acts_of_Union_1707.htm" title="Acts of Union 1707">Union</a>. Some rather dated slang names for Britons are <i>Tommy</i> (for British soldiers), <i>Pom</i>, <i>Anglo</i> and <i>Limey</i>. <!--del_lnk--> Anglo properly refers only to England, but it is sometimes used as a broader reference as an element in compound adjectives: for example, <i>&quot;Anglo-French relations&quot;</i> may be used in newspaper articles when referring to relations between the political entities <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> and the United Kingdom. <i>Anglo-Saxon</i> may be used when referring to the whole English-speaking world, the <!--del_lnk--> Anglosphere, although ethnically very few of the world&#39;s one billion English-speakers are of <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon origin.

      <p><b>Ireland</b> is the name since 1937 of the independent state which covers the island of Ireland apart from Northern Ireland. Since the <!--del_lnk--> Republic of Ireland Act in 1949, the term &quot;Republic of Ireland&quot; has been widely used, but the official name in the <!--del_lnk--> Irish constitution is <i>Ireland</i>, or, in the Irish language, <i>&Eacute;ire</i>. This is also the geographical term for the entire island.<p>The Republic of Ireland gained full recognised independence from the United Kingdom in 1921. Northern Ireland is sovereign British territory, and a majority of the population of <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> consider themselves British. Traditionally Ireland is divided into four <!--del_lnk--> provinces - <!--del_lnk--> Leinster, <!--del_lnk--> Connacht, <!--del_lnk--> Munster and <!--del_lnk--> Ulster. The Republic of Ireland takes up 83% of the island, while Northern Ireland takes up six of the nine counties of Ulster. However, despite the label &quot;Northern&quot; Ireland, the most northerly point of the island is in <!--del_lnk--> County Donegal, territory of the Republic of Ireland.<p>On the <!--del_lnk--> island of Ireland (as everywhere), the naming of places often raises political issues. The usage of &quot;Ireland&quot; as the official name of the state in the constitution of the <a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_Ireland.htm" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a> causes offence to some <!--del_lnk--> Unionists in <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> as it implies that the Republic of Ireland still has a territorial claim to the whole island - the terminology of &quot;Republic of Ireland&quot; or &quot;&Eacute;ire&quot; is much preferred by Northern unionists when referring to that political state. Similarly, some <!--del_lnk--> Nationalists in Northern Ireland also prefer to reserve to usage of &quot;Ireland&quot; to refer to the whole island.<p>The Republic of Ireland is often referred to by <!--del_lnk--> Irish republicans by the term &quot;the Twenty-six Counties&quot;, with the connotation that the state constituted as such forms only a portion of the ideal political unit, which would consist of all of the <!--del_lnk--> thirty-two counties into which the island is divided. From 1922 to 1937, the state comprising those 26 counties was officially known by the term &quot;The <!--del_lnk--> Irish Free State&quot;.<p>Many people object to these latter two terms, as they are seen to imply that the Republic of Ireland is not a fully independent country. Conversely, some republicans and others refer to Northern Ireland as &quot;the Six Counties&quot; (in reference to Northern Ireland&#39;s six counties), a name that avoids the disputed link with Great Britain. Some even call it &quot;the occupied six counties&quot;. Some <!--del_lnk--> nationalists use the terms, &quot;the North of Ireland&quot; and, &quot;the North&quot;, instead of Northern Ireland; these are terms also used by the Irish national broadcaster <!--del_lnk--> RT&Eacute;.<p>Many people, especially some <!--del_lnk--> unionists, sometimes refer to <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> as <i>Ulster</i> - this is inaccurate as the <!--del_lnk--> Irish province of Ulster traditionally includes an additional three counties, which are in the Republic of Ireland. The term <i>Ulster</i> (and &quot;<i>the Province</i>&quot;) are sometimes preferred by Unionists, sometimes because it can suggest an origin of the polity of Northern Ireland that pre-dates 1922, referring back to the <!--del_lnk--> Act of Union 1800, the <a href="../../wp/g/Glorious_Revolution.htm" title="Glorious Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a> of 1689, the <!--del_lnk--> Plantation of Ulster in 1610, the ancient migrations between Ulster and Scotland, and even to <!--del_lnk--> biblical tradition. So, it is understandable that certain local place names should still be in dispute: see <!--del_lnk--> Derry/Londonderry name dispute.<p><a id="British_Islands" name="British_Islands"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">British Islands</span></h3>

      <p>The earliest known names for the islands come from the <!--del_lnk--> Massaliote Periplus of the <!--del_lnk--> 6th century BC, fragments of which survived in the writings of <!--del_lnk--> Avienus around <a href="../../wp/a/Anno_Domini.htm" title="AD">AD</a> <!--del_lnk--> 400. Ireland was referred to as <i>Ierne</i> (<i>Insula sacra</i>, the <i>sacred island</i>, as the Greeks interpreted it) &quot;inhabited by the race of <i>Hiberni</i>&quot; (<i>gens hiernorum</i>), and Britain as <i>insula Albionum</i>, &quot;island of the Albions&quot;. Earlier sources preserve fragments of the travel writings of the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">ancient Greek</a> <!--del_lnk--> Pytheas around <!--del_lnk--> 320 BC, and describe the British isles, including Ireland, as the &alpha;&iota; &Beta;&rho;&epsilon;&tau;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&iota;&alpha;&iota;, the <i>Brittanic Isles</i>. The peoples of these islands of <i>Prettanike</i> were called the &Rho;&rho;&epsilon;&tau;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&omicron;&iota;, <i>Priteni</i> or <i>Pretani</i>.<p>These names derived from a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Celtic language&quot; term which is likely to have reached Pytheas from the <!--del_lnk--> Gauls who may have used it as their term for the inhabitants of the islands. The Romans called the inhabitants of Gaul (modern <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>) <i>Galli</i> or <i>Celtae</i>. The latter term came from the Greek name &Kappa;&epsilon;&lambda;&tau;&omicron;&iota; for a central European people, and <a href="../../wp/1/17th_century.htm" title="17th century">17th century</a> antiquarians who found language connections developed the idea of a race of <!--del_lnk--> Celts inhabiting the area, but this term was not used by the Greeks or Romans for the inhabitants of Britain or Ireland.<p><i>Priteni</i> is the source of the <!--del_lnk--> Welsh language term <!--del_lnk--> Prydain, <i>Britain</i>, and has the same source as the <!--del_lnk--> Goidelic term <!--del_lnk--> Cruithne. The latter referred to the early <!--del_lnk--> Brythonic speaking inhabitants of Ireland, the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish highlands and the north of Scotland, who are known as the Cruithne in <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Gaelic, and who the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a> called <a href="../../wp/p/Picts.htm" title="Picts">Picts</a> or <!--del_lnk--> Caledonians.<p><a id="Romans" name="Romans"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Romans</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Caesar&#39;s invasions of Britain brought descriptions of the peoples of what he called <i>Britannia pars interior</i>, &quot;inland Britain&quot;, in <!--del_lnk--> 55 BC. Throughout Book 4 of his <i>Geography</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Strabo is consistent in spelling the island Britain (transliterated) as <i>Prettanikee</i>; he uses the terms <i>Prettans</i> or <i>Brettans</i> loosely to refer to the islands as a group - a common generalisation used by classical geographers. For example, in Geography 2.1.18, <i>&hellip;&omicron;&iota; &nu;&omicron;&tau;&iota;&omega;&tau;&alpha;&tau;&omicron;&iota; &tau;&omega;&nu; &Beta;&rho;&eta;&tau;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&omega;&nu; &beta;&omicron;&rho;&eta;&iota;&omicron;&tau;&eta;&rho;&omicron;&iota; &tau;&omicron;&upsilon;&tau;&omicron;&nu; &eta;&iota;&sigma;&iota;&nu;</i> (&hellip;the most southern of the Brettans are further north than this). He was writing around AD 10, although the earliest surviving copy of his work dates from the 6th century. <!--del_lnk--> Pliny the Elder writing around AD 70 uses a Latin version of the same terminology in section 4.102 of his <i><!--del_lnk--> Naturalis Historia</i>. He writes of Great Britain: <i>Albion ipsi nomen fuit, cum Britanniae vocarentur omnes de quibus mox paulo dicemus.</i> (Albion was its own name, when all [the islands] were called the Britannias; I will speak of them in a moment.). In the following section, 4.103, Pliny enumerates the islands he considers to make up the Britannias, listing Great Britain, Ireland, and many smaller islands. In his <i>Geography</i> written in the mid <a href="../../wp/2/2nd_century.htm" title="2nd century">2nd century</a> and probably describing the position around AD <!--del_lnk--> 100, <a href="../../wp/p/Ptolemy.htm" title="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> includes both Britain and Ireland &ndash; he calls it <i>Hibernia</i> &ndash; in the island group he calls <i>Britannia</i>. He entitles Book II, Chapter 1 of as <i>Hibernia, Island of Britannia</i>, and Chapter 2 as <i>Albion Island of Britannia</i>.<p>The name <i>Albion</i> for <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> fell from favour, and the island was described in Greek as &Rho;&rho;&epsilon;&tau;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&iota;&alpha; or &Beta;&rho;&epsilon;&tau;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&iota;&alpha;, in <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>Britannia</i>, an inhabitant as &Beta;&rho;&epsilon;&tau;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&omicron;&zeta;, <i>Britannus</i>, with the adjective &Beta;&rho;&epsilon;&tau;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&iota;&kappa;&omicron;&zeta;, <i>Britannicus</i>, equating to &quot;British&quot;. With the <!--del_lnk--> Roman conquest of Britain the name <!--del_lnk--> Britannia was used for the province of <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Britain.htm" title="Roman Britain">Roman Britain</a>. The Emperor <a href="../../wp/c/Claudius.htm" title="Claudius">Claudius</a> was honoured with the <!--del_lnk--> agnomen <i>Britannicus</i> as if he were the conqueror, and coins were struck from AD <!--del_lnk--> 46 inscribed <small>DE BRITAN, DE BRITANN, DE BRITANNI,</small> or <small>DE BRITANNIS</small>. With the visit of <!--del_lnk--> Hadrian in AD <!--del_lnk--> 121 coins introduced a female figure with the label <small>BRITANNIA</small> as a personification or goddess of the place. These and later Roman coins introduced the seated figure of Britannia which would be reintroduced in the <a href="../../wp/1/17th_century.htm" title="17th century">17th century</a>.<p>In the later years of Roman rule Britons who left Latin inscriptions, both at home and elsewhere in the Empire, often described themselves as <i>Brittanus</i> or <i>Britto</i>, and where describing their citizenship gave it as <i>cives</i> of a British tribe or of a <i>patria</i> (homeland) of <i>Britannia</i>, not <i>Roma</i>. From the 4th century, many Britons migrated from Roman Britain across the <a href="../../wp/e/English_Channel.htm" title="English Channel">English Channel</a> and founded <!--del_lnk--> Brittany.<p><a id="Medieval_period" name="Medieval_period"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Medieval period</span></h3>
      <p>While Latin remained the language of learning, from the early <!--del_lnk--> medieval period records begin to appear in native languages.

It was written in the late seventh century by <!--del_lnk--> Adomn&aacute;n of <!--del_lnk--> Iona, an Irish monk living on the <!--del_lnk--> Inner Hebridean island. The collective term for the archipelago used within this work is <b>Oceani Insulae</b> meaning <i>&quot;Islands of the Ocean&quot;</i> (Book 2, 46 in the Sharpe edition = Book 2, 47 in Reeves edition), it is used sparingly and no <i>Priteni</i>-derived collective reference is made.<p>Another early native source to use a collective term is the <i><!--del_lnk--> Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum</i> of <a href="../../wp/b/Bede.htm" title="Bede">Bede</a> written in the early eighth century. The collective term for the archipelago used within this work is <i>insularum</i> meaning &quot;islands&quot; (Book 1, 8) and it too is used sparingly.

He styled himself as <i>James I of Great Britain</i>, although both states retained their sovereignty and independent parliaments, the <!--del_lnk--> Parliament of Scotland and the <!--del_lnk--> Parliament of England. The <!--del_lnk--> 1707 <!--del_lnk--> Act of Union united England and Scotland in the <!--del_lnk--> United Kingdom of Great Britain under the <!--del_lnk--> Parliament of Great Britain, then in <!--del_lnk--> 1800 Ireland was brought under British government control by the <!--del_lnk--> Act of Union creating the <!--del_lnk--> United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Irish unrest culminated in the <!--del_lnk--> Irish War of Independence and the <!--del_lnk--> 1922 separation of the <!--del_lnk--> Irish Free State which later became the <a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_Ireland.htm" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>.

In order to be more specific, <i>Northern Irish</i> is therefore in common usage. The term <i>Ulster</i> can also be used as an adjective (e.g. &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Royal Ulster Constabulary&quot;), but this is more likely to be used by <!--del_lnk--> Unionists and has political connotations in the same fashion as its use as a proper noun (because only six of the traditional nine counties of <!--del_lnk--> Ulster, namely <!--del_lnk--> Antrim, <!--del_lnk--> Armagh, <!--del_lnk--> Down, <!--del_lnk--> Fermanagh, <!--del_lnk--> Londonderry and <!--del_lnk--> Tyrone, are included in Northern Ireland with the remaining three counties <!--del_lnk--> Cavan, <!--del_lnk--> Donegal and <!--del_lnk--> Monaghan forming part of the Republic). Likewise, <!--del_lnk--> Nationalists might describe, say, a lake in Northern Ireland as <i>Irish</i>. However, some <!--del_lnk--> Nationalists might attribute what they see as less attractive aspects of <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> to Britain or even to England (e.g. &quot;The Northern Ireland squad is an English football team&quot;).<p>Note that the geographical term &quot;Irish Sea&quot; thus far appears to have escaped political connotations, even though territorial control of the waters of the Irish Sea is divided between both the Republic of Ireland and the UK, and also includes a British Crown dependency, the Isle of Man &mdash; as yet there appears to be no controversy with the term&rsquo;s usage to mirror that of &quot;British Isles&quot;.<p>The &quot;Northern&quot; in &quot;Northern Ireland&quot; is not completely accurate.

However, it is sometimes used as being identical to the UK, i.e. covering only a part of the island of <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> while in other contexts it is used to refer to <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> and the surrounding islands but excluding the island of <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> entirely.<p>There have been several suggestions for replacements for the term <i>British Isles</i>.

      <p>Note: In Irish there are actually several terms for Northern Ireland: <i>An Tuaisceart</i>, meaning &quot;the North&quot;, is usually used, but a more recent term for official use is <i>Tuaisceart &Eacute;ireann</i>. <i>Ulaidh</i>, the Irish word for Ulster, is also sometimes used, though the traditional region of Ulster also includes 3 counties which are not included in the political region of Northern Ireland. Ironically the most northern point in Ireland is &#39;down South&#39;, that is ruled from Dublin, not London.<p>The English word <i>Welsh</i> is from a common <!--del_lnk--> Germanic root meaning &quot;foreigner&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> cognate with <!--del_lnk--> Wallonia and <!--del_lnk--> Wallachia, and also cognate with the word used in Mediaeval German to refer to the French and <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italians</a>). The English names <i><!--del_lnk--> Albion</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Albany</i> are related to <i>Alba</i> and used poetically for either England or Scotland, or the whole island of Great Britain. English <i><!--del_lnk--> Erin</i> is a poetic name for Ireland derived from <i>&Eacute;ire</i> (or rather, from its dative form <i>&Eacute;irinn</i>)<p><a id="The_term_.22Oile.C3.A1in_Bhriotanacha.22_for_.27British_Isles.27_in_the_Irish_language" name="The_term_.22Oile.C3.A1in_Bhriotanacha.22_for_.27British_Isles.27_in_the_Irish_language"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The term &quot;Oile&aacute;in Bhriotanacha&quot; for &#39;British Isles&#39; in the Irish language</span></h3>
      <p>In Irish, the term <i>Oile&aacute;in Bhriotanacha</i> is attested as a version of the English term &#39;British Isles&#39;. The 1937 book <i>T&iacute;r-E&oacute;lu&iacute;ocht na h-&Eacute;ireann</i> (&#39;The Geography of Ireland&#39;) by T. J. Dunne, translated by Toirdhealbhach &Oacute; Raithbheartaigh and published in Dublin by the Government Publications Office, states: <i>T&aacute; &Eacute;ire ar cheann de na h-oile&aacute;in a dtugar na <b>h-Oile&aacute;in Bhreataineacha</b> ortha agus at&aacute; ar an taobh Thiar-Thuaidh de&#39;n E&oacute;raip. T&aacute; siad tuairim a&#39;s ar ch&uacute;ig mh&iacute;le oile&aacute;n ar fad ann. (<b>Oile&aacute;nradh</b> an t-ainm a bheirtear ar &aacute;it ar bith i n-a bhfuil a l&aacute;n oile&aacute;n agus iad i n-aice a ch&eacute;ile mar seo.) &Eacute;ire agus an Bhreatain Mh&oacute;r (Sasain, an Bhreatain Bheag, agus Alba) an d&aacute; oile&aacute;n is m&oacute; de na h-Oile&aacute;in Bhreataineacha.</i> &#39;Ireland is one of the islands which are called the <b>British Isles</b> and which are on the North-Western side of Europe. It is thought that there are five thousand islands in total there. (<b>Archipelago</b> is the name which is borne by a place in which there are many islands next to each other like these.) Ireland and Great Britain (England, Wales, and Scotland) are the two largest islands of the British Isles.&#39;<p><a id="Other_terms_in_the_Irish_language" name="Other_terms_in_the_Irish_language"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other terms in the Irish language</span></h3>
      <p>Dineen&#39;s 1927 Irish-English dictionary gives <i>Oile&aacute;in Iarthair Eorpa</i> &#39;the British or West European Isles&#39;. Most often the term is avoided and <i>&Eacute;ire agus an Bhreatain</i> is used, though this ignores the thousands of small islands.<p><a id="Rockall" name="Rockall"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Rockall</span></h3>
      <p>The island of <a href="../../wp/r/Rockall.htm" title="Rockall">Rockall</a> is a disputed territory in the Atlantic Ocean. It is a small, uninhabited island lying some 301.4 km (187.3 miles) west of <!--del_lnk--> St Kilda (<a href="../../wp/o/Outer_Hebrides.htm" title="Outer Hebrides">Outer Hebrides</a>) and 424 km (229.1 miles) north-west of Ireland. It is claimed by the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> (as part of the <!--del_lnk--> Isle of Harris), whilst its surrounding <!--del_lnk--> continental shelf (but not the island itself) is claimed by the Republic of Ireland, <a href="../../wp/i/Iceland.htm" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> and <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> (through the <a href="../../wp/f/Faroe_Islands.htm" title="Faroe Islands">Faroe Islands</a>). Its remote position, however, means that it is open to question whether or not, geographically, it belongs to the British Isles. In any event The <!--del_lnk--> United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, states <i>Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf</i>.<p><a id="Slang" name="Slang"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Slang</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Blighty is a slang word for Britain derived from the <!--del_lnk--> Hindustani word <i>bil&#x101;yat&#x12B;</i> (&quot;foreign&quot;). Depending on the user, it is meant either affectionately or archly. It was often used by British soldiers abroad in the First World War to refer to home.<p><a id="Europe" name="Europe"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Europe</span></h3>
      <p>The term &quot;<a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>&quot; may be used in one of several different contexts by British people; either to refer to the whole of the European continent, to refer to only to <!--del_lnk--> Mainland Europe, sometimes called <i>&quot;continental Europe&quot;</i> or simply <i>&quot;the Continent&quot;</i> by some people in the archipelago &mdash; as in the apocryphal newspaper headlining &quot;Fog shrouds Channel, continent cut off.&quot;<p>Europe and the adjective European may also be used in reference to the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a>, particularly in a derogative context such as &quot;The new regulations handed out by Europe&quot;.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles_%28terminology%29&quot;</div>
