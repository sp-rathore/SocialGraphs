      <p>Judah Ben-Hur is a rich <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> prince and merchant in <a href="../../wp/j/Jerusalem.htm" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> at the beginning of the 1st century. Preceding the arrival of a new governor, Judah Ben-Hur&#39;s childhood friend Messala arrives as military <!--del_lnk--> commanding officer of the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman</a> legions. At first Judah and Messala are happy to meet after years apart, but their different political views separate them; Messala believes in the glory of <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Rome</a> and worldly imperial power, while Judah is devoted to his faith and Jewish nationalism. During the welcome parade for the governor, a roofing tile falls down from Judah&#39;s house and startles the governor&#39;s horse, nearly killing him. Although Messala knows that it was an accident, in order to intimidate the restive Jewish populace by punishing a powerful local family and good friend, he sends Judah to the <!--del_lnk--> galleys and throws his mother and sister into prison. Judah swears to come back and take revenge. En route to the sea, Judah is denied water when his slave gang arrives at Nazareth. He collapses, having lost the will to live, when an as-yet unknown <a href="../../wp/j/Jesus.htm" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a> gives him water and a motivation to survive.<div class="thumb tleft">
      </div>
      <p>After three years as a galley slave, the ship to which Judah is assigned becomes the flagship of Quintus Arrius, sent by the <!--del_lnk--> Emperor to destroy a fleet of Macedonian <!--del_lnk--> pirates. Judah&#39;s new commander notices his resolve and will to survive, although he declines the offer to transfer to Arrius&#39; gladiatorial team, declaring that God will aid him. The Roman armada attacks the pirates and his galley is sunk, but Judah manages to save the life of Arrius. They are soon rescued and Arrius adopts Judah as his son. Thus regaining his freedom and wealth, and having learned Roman ways (including becoming an expert <!--del_lnk--> charioteer), he eventually returns to Judea. Soon the Arab sheik Ilderin hires Ben-Hur to drive his chariot and Judah defeats Messala in a chariot race before the governor of Judea, Pontius Pilate. Messala, who attempts to cheat his way to victory, is mortally wounded in the race, but tells Judah where he can find his mother and sister: In the &quot;valley of the lepers,&quot; as they had contracted <!--del_lnk--> leprosy while in prison. Although he has accomplished his goal of revenge on Messala, Judah&#39;s soul remains tormented.<p>The film is subtitled &quot;A Tale of the Christ&quot;, and it is at this point that Jesus&#39;s presence is substantially increased. After Judah sees his mother and sister in the leper colony, Judah&#39;s love interest Esther witnesses the <a href="../../wp/s/Sermon_on_the_Mount.htm" title="Sermon on the Mount">Sermon on the Mount</a>. She tells Judah about it; they take his mother and sister to see Jesus, but they cannot get near him, as his trial has begun. Judah attempts to give Jesus water during his march to <!--del_lnk--> Calvary, echoing Jesus&#39;s kindness to him, but is shoved away by the guards. Judah witnesses the crucifixion. His mother and sister are healed by a miracle, as are his own heart and soul. He tells his family that as he heard Jesus talk of forgiveness while on the cross, saying, &quot;I felt His voice take the sword out of my hand&quot;. The film begins with the <!--del_lnk--> Magi visiting the infant Jesus, and ends with the empty crosses of <!--del_lnk--> Calvary in the background and a shepherd and his flock (a prominent Judeo-Christian symbol) in the foreground.<div class="notice spoiler endspoiler" style="border-top: 2px solid #dddddd; border-bottom:2px solid #dddddd; text-align: justify; margin: 1em; padding: 0.2em;"><i><b>Spoilers end here.</b></i></div>

      <p><i>Ben-Hur</i> was an extremely expensive production, requiring 300 sets scattered over 340 acres (1.4 km&sup2;). Its production was a gamble made by <!--del_lnk--> MGM to save itself from bankruptcy at $15 million; the gamble paid off when it earned a whopping total (in its time) of $75 million.<p><a id="Aspect_ratio" name="Aspect_ratio"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Aspect ratio</span></h3>
      <p>The movie was filmed in a process known as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> MGM Camera 65&quot;, 65mm negative stock from which was made into a 70mm <!--del_lnk--> anamorphic print with an aspect ratio of 2.76:1, one of the widest prints ever made, having a width of almost three times its height. A special lens which produced a 1.25X compression was used along with a 65mm negative (whose normal aspect ratio was 2.20:1) to produce this extremely wide aspect ratio. This allowed for spectacular panoramic shots in addition to six-channel audio. In practice, however, &quot;Camera 65&quot; prints were shown in an aspect ratio of 2.5:1 on most screens, so that theaters were not required to install new, wider screens or curtail the height of screens already installed.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Many other men were offered the role of Ben-Hur before Charlton Heston. <!--del_lnk--> Burt Lancaster claimed he turned down the role of Judah Ben-Hur because he &quot;didn&#39;t like the violent morals in the story&quot;. <!--del_lnk--> Paul Newman turned it down because he said he didn&#39;t have the legs to wear a tunic. <!--del_lnk--> Rock Hudson was also offered the role.<p>Out of respect, the face of Jesus is never shown. He was played by an old friend of director Wyler, Claude Heater, who received no credit for his only film role.<p><a id="The_chariot_race" name="The_chariot_race"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The chariot race</span></h3>
      <p>Even by current standards, the chariot race in <i>Ben-Hur</i> is considered to be one of the most spectacular action sequences ever filmed. Filmed at <!--del_lnk--> Cinecitt&agrave; Studios outside <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a> long before the advent of <!--del_lnk--> computer-generated effects, it took over three months to complete, using 8000 extras on the largest film set ever built, some 18 acres (73,000m&sup2;). Eighteen chariots were built, with half being used for practice. The race took five weeks to film. Tour buses visited the set every hour.<p>The large &quot;island&quot; in the middle of the stadium is fictional. It was designed to aid filmmaking, since a backdrop of a stone wall is cheaper to film than a backdrop of thousands of extras. In a real stadium, such an island would prevent spectators from viewing the race properly.<p>Charlton Heston spent four weeks learning how to drive a chariot. He was taught by the stunt crew, who offered to teach the entire cast, but Heston and Boyd were the only ones who took them up on the offer (Boyd had to learn in just two weeks, due to his late casting). At the beginning of the chariot race, Heston shook the reins and nothing happened; the horses remained motionless. Finally someone way up on top of the set yelled, &quot;Giddy-up!&quot; The horses then roared into action, and Heston was flung backward off the chariot.<p>To give the scene more impact and realism, three lifelike dummies were placed at key points in the race to give the appearance of men being run over by chariots. Most notable is the stand-in dummy for Stephen Boyd&#39;s Messala that gets tangled up under the horses, getting battered by their hooves. This resulted in one of the most grisly death scenes in motion pictures at this time and shocked audiences.<p>There are several <!--del_lnk--> urban legends surrounding the chariot sequence, one of which states that a stuntman died during filming. Stuntman <!--del_lnk--> Nosher Powell claims in his autobiography, &quot;We had a stunt man killed in the third week, and it happened right in front of me. You saw it, too, because the cameras kept turning and it&#39;s in the movie&quot;. There is no conclusive evidence to back up Powell&#39;s claim and it has been adamantly denied by director William Wyler, who states that neither man nor horse was injured in the famous scene. Another urban legend states that a car can be seen during the chariot race; the book <i>Movie Mistakes</i> claims this is a myth.<p>However, one of the best-remembered moments in the race came from a near-fatal accident. When Judah&#39;s chariot jumps another which has crashed in its path, the charioteer is seen to be almost thrown from his mount and only just manages to hang on and climb back in to continue the race. In reality, while the jump was planned, the character being flipped into the air was not, and stuntman Joe Canutt, son of second unit director <!--del_lnk--> Yakima Canutt, was considered fortunate to escape with only a minor chin injury. Nonetheless, when director Wyler intercut the long shot of Canutt&#39;s leap with a close-up of Heston clambering back into his chariot, a memorable scene resulted.<p><a id="The_galley_sequence" name="The_galley_sequence"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The galley sequence</span></h3>
      <p>The galley slave sequence is <!--del_lnk--> anachronistic: in reality, <!--del_lnk--> galley slaves did not exist until the <a href="../../wp/1/16th_century.htm" title="16th century">16th century</a>. The Roman navy was, from the outset, comprised completely of <!--del_lnk--> volunteers. All seamen, be they rowers/sailors or marines, joined up of their own volition and received regular pay and leave.<p>The original design for the boat Judah is enslaved upon was so heavy that it couldn&#39;t float. The scene therefore had to be filmed in a studio, but another problem remained: the cameras didn&#39;t fit inside, so the boat was cut in half and made able to be wider or shorter on demand. The next problem was the oars were too long, so those were cut too; however, this made it look unrealistic because the oars were too easy to row, so weights had to be added.<p>During filming, director Wyler noticed that one of the extras was missing a hand. He had the man&#39;s stump covered in blood, with a phony bone protruding from it, to add realism to the scene when the galley is rammed. Wyler made similar use of another extra who was missing a foot.<p><a id="Possible_homosexual_subtext" name="Possible_homosexual_subtext"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Possible homosexual subtext</span></h3>
      <p>In interviews for the <!--del_lnk--> 1986 book <i><!--del_lnk--> Celluloid Closet</i>, and later the <!--del_lnk--> 1995 documentary of the same name, screenwriter <!--del_lnk--> Gore Vidal asserts that he persuaded director Wyler to allow a carefully veiled homoerotic subtext between Messala and Ben-Hur. Vidal says his aim was to explain Messala&rsquo;s extreme reaction to Judah Ben-Hur&rsquo;s refusal to name fellow Jews. Surely, Vidal argued, Messala should have been able to understand that Judah, his close friend since childhood, would not be willing to name the names of his fellow Jews to a Roman officer. Vidal suggested a motivation to Wyler: Messala and Judah had been homosexual lovers while growing up, and then separated for a few years while Messala was in Rome. When Messala returns to Judea, he wants to renew the relationship with Judah, but Judah is no longer interested. It is the anger of a scorned lover which motivates Messala&rsquo;s vindictiveness toward Judah. Since the Hollywood <!--del_lnk--> production code would not permit this to appear on screen explicitly, it would have to be implied by the actors. Knowing Heston&rsquo;s aversion to homosexuality, Vidal suggested to Wyler that he direct Stephen Boyd to play the role that way, but not tell Heston. Vidal claims that Wyler took his advice, and that the results can be seen in the film, however, Vidal is the only person ever to make this claim, and all others queried about it have denied that it was even considered, including William Wyler and Chartlon Heston, who, when asked about Vidal&#39;s story, insisted that Vidal had little to do with the final film..<p><a id="Differences_between_novel_and_film" name="Differences_between_novel_and_film"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Differences between novel and film</span></h2>
      <div class="notice spoiler"><b><!--del_lnk--> Spoiler warning: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
      <p>There are several differences between the original novel and the film. The changes made serve to make the film&#39;s storyline more immediately dramatic.<ul>
       <li>The most striking difference is that Ben-Hur does not actually kill Messala, although the latter is seriously injured in the chariot race. In revenge for this, Messala plots to have Ben-Hur murdered, but his plans go wrong. It is revealed at the end of the novel that Iras (who is Messala&#39;s mistress and does not appear in the 1959 film) has murdered Messala in a fit of anger.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>Another striking difference is that Ben-Hur becomes a convert to Christianity much sooner in the novel, not after the Crucifixion, and he does not display the harsh bitterness that he does in the William Wyler film. Similarly, the healing of Ben-Hur&#39;s mother and sister takes place earlier in the book, not immediately after the death of Christ.</ul>
