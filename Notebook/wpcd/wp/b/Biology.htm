      <p><b>Biology</b> (from <!--del_lnk--> Greek <i>&beta;&#x3AF;&omicron;&sigmaf; &lambda;&#x3CC;&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf;</i>, see <!--del_lnk--> below) is the branch of <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">science</a> dealing with the study of <!--del_lnk--> living organisms. It is concerned with the <!--del_lnk--> characteristics, <a href="../../wp/s/Scientific_classification.htm" title="Scientific classification">classification</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> behaviors of <a href="../../wp/o/Organism.htm" title="Organism">organisms</a>, how <!--del_lnk--> species come into <!--del_lnk--> existence, and the interactions they have with each other and with the <!--del_lnk--> natural environment. Biology encompasses a broad spectrum of <!--del_lnk--> academic fields that are often viewed as independent disciplines. However, together they address <!--del_lnk--> phenomena related to living organisms (biological phenomena) over a wide range of scales, from <!--del_lnk--> biophysics to <a href="../../wp/e/Ecology.htm" title="Ecology">ecology</a>. All concepts in biology are subject to the same laws that other branches of science obey, such as the laws of <a href="../../wp/t/Thermodynamics.htm" title="Thermodynamics">thermodynamics</a> and <!--del_lnk--> conservation of energy.<div class="thumb tright" style="background-color: #f9f9f9; border: 1px solid #CCCCCC; margin:0.5em;">

      <p>At the organism level, biology has partially explained phenomena such as <!--del_lnk--> birth, <!--del_lnk--> growth, <!--del_lnk--> aging, <!--del_lnk--> death and <!--del_lnk--> decay of living organisms, similarities between offspring and their parents (<!--del_lnk--> heredity) and flowering of plants which have puzzled humanity throughout history. Other phenomena, such as <!--del_lnk--> lactation, <!--del_lnk--> metamorphosis, <!--del_lnk--> egg-hatching, <!--del_lnk--> healing, and <!--del_lnk--> tropism have been addressed. On a wider scale of time and space, biologists have studied <!--del_lnk--> domestication of animals and plants, the wide variety of living organisms (<a href="../../wp/b/Biodiversity.htm" title="Biodiversity">biodiversity</a>), changes in living organisms over many generations (<a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">evolution</a>), <a href="../../wp/e/Extinction.htm" title="Extinction">extinction</a>, <!--del_lnk--> speciation, <!--del_lnk--> social behaviour among animals, etc.<p>While <a href="../../wp/b/Botany.htm" title="Botany">botany</a> encompasses the study of plants, <!--del_lnk--> zoology is the branch of science that is concerned about the study of animals and <a href="../../wp/a/Anthropology.htm" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a> is the branch of biology which studies human beings. However, at the <!--del_lnk--> molecular scale, life is studied in the disciplines of <!--del_lnk--> molecular biology, <!--del_lnk--> biochemistry, and <!--del_lnk--> molecular genetics. More fundamental than these fields is biophysics which deals with energy within biological systems. At the next level, that of the <a href="../../wp/c/Cell_%2528biology%2529.htm" title="Cell (biology)">cell</a>, it is studied in <!--del_lnk--> cell biology. At the <!--del_lnk--> multicellular scale, it is examined in <!--del_lnk--> physiology, <a href="../../wp/a/Anatomy.htm" title="Anatomy">anatomy</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> histology. <!--del_lnk--> Developmental biology studies life at the level of an individual organism&#39;s development or <!--del_lnk--> ontogeny. Moving up the scale towards more than one organism, <a href="../../wp/g/Genetics.htm" title="Genetics">genetics</a> considers how <!--del_lnk--> heredity works between parent and offspring. <!--del_lnk--> Ethology considers the behaviour of organisms in their natural environment. <!--del_lnk--> Population genetics looks at the level of an entire <!--del_lnk--> population, and <!--del_lnk--> systematics considers the multi-species scale of <!--del_lnk--> lineages. Interdependent populations and their <!--del_lnk--> habitats are examined in <a href="../../wp/e/Ecology.htm" title="Ecology">ecology</a> and <!--del_lnk--> evolutionary biology. A speculative new field is <!--del_lnk--> astrobiology (or xenobiology), which examines the possibility of life beyond the Earth.<p>

      <p>Biology does not usually describe systems in terms of objects which obey immutable physical laws described by <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>.

However, biology is still subject to the same physical laws of the universe such as thermodynamics and conservation of mass.<p>The biological sciences are characterized and unified by several major underlying principles and concepts: <!--del_lnk--> universality, <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">evolution</a>, <!--del_lnk--> diversity, <!--del_lnk--> continuity, <a href="../../wp/g/Genetics.htm" title="Genetics">genetics</a>, <!--del_lnk--> homeostasis, and <!--del_lnk--> interactions.<p><a id="Universality:_Biochemistry.2C_cells.2C_and_the_genetic_code" name="Universality:_Biochemistry.2C_cells.2C_and_the_genetic_code"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Universality: Biochemistry, cells, and the genetic code</span></h3>

      <p>The central organizing concept in biology is that all life has a common origin and has changed and developed through the process of <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">evolution</a> (see <!--del_lnk--> Common descent). This has led to the striking similarity of units and processes discussed in the previous section. <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_Darwin.htm" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> established evolution as a viable theory by articulating its driving force, <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_selection.htm" title="Natural selection">natural selection</a> (<!--del_lnk--> Alfred Russel Wallace is recognized as the co-discoverer of this concept). <!--del_lnk--> Genetic drift was embraced as an additional mechanism of evolutionary development in the <!--del_lnk--> modern synthesis of the theory.<p>The evolutionary history of a <!--del_lnk--> species&mdash; which describes the characteristics of the various species from which it descended&mdash; together with its genealogical relationship to every other species is called its <!--del_lnk--> phylogeny. Widely varied approaches to biology generate information about phylogeny. These include the comparisons of <!--del_lnk--> DNA sequences conducted within <!--del_lnk--> molecular biology or <!--del_lnk--> genomics, and comparisons of <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil.htm" title="Fossil">fossils</a> or other records of ancient organisms in <a href="../../wp/p/Paleontology.htm" title="Paleontology">paleontology</a>. Biologists organize and analyze evolutionary relationships through various methods, including <!--del_lnk--> phylogenetics, <!--del_lnk--> phenetics, and <!--del_lnk--> cladistics (The major events in the evolution of life, as biologists currently understand them, are summarized on this <!--del_lnk--> evolutionary timeline).<br clear="right" />
      <p>In recent years, evolution and other branches of science have come under attack by people who disagree with scientific findings regarding the origins and diversity of life, favoring instead religious explanations.

      <p>Classification is the province of the disciplines of <!--del_lnk--> systematics and <!--del_lnk--> taxonomy. Taxonomy places organisms in groups called <!--del_lnk--> taxa, while systematics seeks to define their relationships with each other. This classification technique has evolved to reflect advances in <!--del_lnk--> cladistics and <a href="../../wp/g/Genetics.htm" title="Genetics">genetics</a>, shifting the focus from physical similarities and shared characteristics to <!--del_lnk--> phylogenetics.<p>Traditionally, living things have been divided into five kingdoms:<dl>
       <dd><!--del_lnk--> Monera -- <!--del_lnk--> Protista -- <a href="../../wp/f/Fungus.htm" title="Fungus">Fungi</a> -- <a href="../../wp/p/Plant.htm" title="Plant">Plantae</a> -- <a href="../../wp/a/Animal.htm" title="Animal">Animalia</a></dl>
      <p>However, many scientists now consider this five-kingdom system to be outdated. Modern alternative classification systems generally begin with the <!--del_lnk--> three-domain system:<dl>
       <dd><!--del_lnk--> Archaea (originally Archaebacteria) -- <a href="../../wp/b/Bacteria.htm" title="Bacterium">Bacteria</a> (originally Eubacteria) -- <a href="../../wp/e/Eukaryote.htm" title="Eukaryote">Eukaryota</a></dl>
      <p>These domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not, as well as differences in the cell exteriors.<p>Further, each kingdom is broken down continuously until each species is separately classified. The order is 1) Kingdom, 2) Phylum, 3) Class, 4) Order, 5) Family, 6) Genus, 7) Species. The scientific name of an organism is obtained from its Genus and Species. For example, humans would be listed as <i>Homo sapiens</i>. Homo would be the Genus and Sapiens is the species. Whenever writing the scientific name of an organism it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the species in lowercase; in addition the entire term would be put in italics. The term used for classification is called Taxonomy.<p>There is also a series of intracellular <!--del_lnk--> parasites that are progressively &quot;less alive&quot; in terms of <!--del_lnk--> metabolic activity:<dl>

      <p>Up into the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a>, it was commonly believed that life forms could appear spontaneously under certain conditions (see <!--del_lnk--> abiogenesis). This misconception was challenged by <a href="../../wp/w/William_Harvey.htm" title="William Harvey">William Harvey</a>&#39;s diction that &quot;all life [is] from [an] egg&quot; (from the <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Omne vivum ex ovo&quot;), a foundational concept of modern biology. It simply means that there is an unbroken continuity of life from its initial origin to the present time.<p>A group of organisms shares a common descent if they share a common <!--del_lnk--> ancestor. All <a href="../../wp/o/Organism.htm" title="Organism">organisms</a> on the <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a> have been and are descended from a common ancestor or an ancestral <!--del_lnk--> gene pool. This last universal common ancestor of all organisms is believed to have appeared about <!--del_lnk--> 3.5 billion years ago. Biologists generally regard the universality of the <a href="../../wp/g/Genetic_code.htm" title="Genetic code">genetic code</a> as definitive evidence in favour of the theory of universal common descent (UCD) for all <a href="../../wp/b/Bacteria.htm" title="Bacterium">bacteria</a>, <!--del_lnk--> archaea, and <a href="../../wp/e/Eukaryote.htm" title="Eukaryote">eukaryotes</a> (see: <!--del_lnk--> origin of life).<p><a id="Homeostasis" name="Homeostasis"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Homeostasis</span></h3>

      <p>Every living thing interacts with other organisms and its <!--del_lnk--> environment. One reason that biological systems can be difficult to study is that so many different interactions with other organisms and the environment are possible, even on the smallest of scales. A microscopic <a href="../../wp/b/Bacteria.htm" title="Bacterium">bacterium</a> responding to a local sugar gradient is responding to its environment as much as a <a href="../../wp/l/Lion.htm" title="Lion">lion</a> is responding to its environment when it searches for food in the <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">African</a> <!--del_lnk--> savannah. For any given species, <!--del_lnk--> behaviors can be <!--del_lnk--> co-operative, <!--del_lnk--> aggressive, <!--del_lnk--> parasitic or <!--del_lnk--> symbiotic. Matters become more complex when two or more different species interact in an <!--del_lnk--> ecosystem.

      <p>Biology has become such a vast research enterprise that it is not generally regarded as a single discipline, but as a number of clustered sub-disciplines. This article considers four broad groupings. The first group consists of those disciplines that study the basic structures of living systems: <a href="../../wp/c/Cell_%2528biology%2529.htm" title="Cell (biology)">cells</a>, <!--del_lnk--> genes etc.; the second group considers the operation of these structures at the level of tissues, organs, and bodies; the third group considers organisms and their histories; the final constellation of disciplines focuses on their interactions. It is important to note, however, that these boundaries, groupings, and descriptions are a simplified characterization of biological research. In reality, the boundaries between disciplines are fluid, and most disciplines frequently borrow techniques from each other. For example, evolutionary biology leans heavily on techniques from molecular biology to determine <!--del_lnk--> DNA sequences, which assist in understanding the genetic variation of a population; and physiology borrows extensively from cell biology in describing the function of organ systems.<br clear="right" />

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Molecular biology is the study of biology at a <!--del_lnk--> molecular level. This field overlaps with other areas of biology, particularly with <a href="../../wp/g/Genetics.htm" title="Genetics">genetics</a> and <!--del_lnk--> biochemistry. Molecular biology chiefly concerns itself with understanding the interactions between the various systems of a cell, including the interrelationship of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and learning how these interactions are regulated.<p><!--del_lnk--> Cell biology studies the <!--del_lnk--> physiological properties of <a href="../../wp/c/Cell_%2528biology%2529.htm" title="Cell (biology)">cells</a>, as well as their <!--del_lnk--> behaviors, interactions, and <!--del_lnk--> environment. This is done both on a <a href="../../wp/m/Microscope.htm" title="Microscope">microscopic</a> and <!--del_lnk--> molecular level. Cell biology researches both single-celled organisms like <a href="../../wp/b/Bacteria.htm" title="Bacterium">bacteria</a> and specialized cells in multicellular organisms like <a href="../../wp/h/Human.htm" title="Human">humans</a>.<p>Understanding cell composition and how they function is fundamental to all of the biological sciences. Appreciating the similarities and differences between cell types is particularly important in the fields of cell and molecular biology. These fundamental similarities and differences provide a unifying theme, allowing the principles learned from studying one cell type to be extrapolated and generalized to other cell types.<p><a href="../../wp/g/Genetics.htm" title="Genetics">Genetics</a> is the <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">science</a> of <!--del_lnk--> genes, <!--del_lnk--> heredity, and the <!--del_lnk--> variation of <a href="../../wp/o/Organism.htm" title="Organism">organisms</a>. In modern research, genetics provides important tools in the investigation of the function of a particular gene, or the analysis of <!--del_lnk--> genetic interactions.
