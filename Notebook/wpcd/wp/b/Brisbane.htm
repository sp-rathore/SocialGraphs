      <p><b>Brisbane</b> (<!--del_lnk--> pronounced <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/&#x2C8;b&#x279;&#x26A;z.b&#x259;n/</span>) is the <!--del_lnk--> capital and most populous city of the <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australian</a> <!--del_lnk--> state of <!--del_lnk--> Queensland, and is the third largest city in Australia, with a population of just under 2.0 million and an urban <!--del_lnk--> agglomeration of over 2.4 million people. It is a city set close to the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>, and is situated beside the <!--del_lnk--> Brisbane River on plains between <!--del_lnk--> Moreton Bay and the <!--del_lnk--> Great Dividing Range in <!--del_lnk--> south-eastern Queensland.<p>Named in honour of <!--del_lnk--> Sir Thomas Brisbane, the city grew from a harsh <!--del_lnk--> penal colony established in 1824 at <!--del_lnk--> Redcliffe, 40 km to the north. The colony was moved to Brisbane in 1825 and free settlers were permitted from 1842. It was chosen as the capital of Queensland when it was proclaimed a separate colony in 1859. The city developed slowly until after <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, when it played a central role in the <!--del_lnk--> Allied campaign as the <!--del_lnk--> South West Pacific headquarters for <!--del_lnk--> General Douglas MacArthur.<p>More recently, Brisbane hosted the <!--del_lnk--> 1982 Commonwealth Games and <!--del_lnk--> 1988 World&#39;s Fair, as well as the <!--del_lnk--> Goodwill Games in 2001.<p>

      <p>The area now known as Brisbane was inhabited before European settlement by the Turrbul and Jagera people whose ancestors originally migrated to the region from across the <!--del_lnk--> Torres Strait.<p>In 1823 an exploration party led by <!--del_lnk--> John Oxley explored <!--del_lnk--> Moreton Bay and sailed up the <!--del_lnk--> Brisbane River as far as <!--del_lnk--> Goodna, some 20 km upstream from what is now <!--del_lnk--> Brisbane central business district.<p>In 1824, the colonial administration of <!--del_lnk--> New South Wales established a penal settlement at what is now <!--del_lnk--> Redcliffe, on the shores of Moreton Bay. However, the Redcliffe settlement was abandoned after only one year and the colony was moved south to a peninsula on the Brisbane River (today the <!--del_lnk--> Brisbane CBD), which offered a more reliable water supply. Non-convict European settlement of the Brisbane region commenced in 1838.<p><!--del_lnk--> Queensland was proclaimed a separate colony in June 1859 and Brisbane, which was named in honour of <!--del_lnk--> Sir Thomas Brisbane (who was, at that time, <!--del_lnk--> Governor of New South Wales), was chosen as its capital. However, Brisbane was not incorporated as a city until 1902. Over twenty small municipalities and shires were amalgamated in 1925, to form the City of Greater Brisbane which is governed by the <!--del_lnk--> Brisbane City Council.<p>Historic buildings include <!--del_lnk--> The Windmill, which was built by convicts in 1828. According to the <!--del_lnk--> heritage notice at the Windmill, it is Queensland&#39; oldest <!--del_lnk--> surviving building. The Windmill was originally intended for the grinding of grain. Another historic building is the <!--del_lnk--> Shrine of Remembrance, which was dedicated on <!--del_lnk--> 11 November <!--del_lnk--> 1930. The Shrine of Remembrance is Brisbane&#39;s main memorial of remembrance to Australia&#39;s war dead.<p>During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Brisbane played a central role in the <!--del_lnk--> Allied campaign when the AMP Building (now called <!--del_lnk--> MacArthur Central) was used as the <!--del_lnk--> South West Pacific headquarters for <!--del_lnk--> General Douglas MacArthur, the chief of the Allied Pacific forces. Approximately 1,000,000 US troops passed through Australia during the war, as the primary coordination point for the <!--del_lnk--> South West Pacific.<p>Brisbane staged both a successful <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth Games during 1982, and <!--del_lnk--> World&#39;s Fair during 1988. These events were accompanied by a scale of public expenditure, construction and development not previously seen in the state of <!--del_lnk--> Queensland.<p>In the new millennium, Brisbane is one of Australia&#39;s fastest growing centres, receiving large numbers of migrants from other <!--del_lnk--> Australian states and territories. Despite strong economic growth, Queensland government statistics show unemployment rates of over 12% amongst migrants to Brisbane statistical division from interstate and overseas.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Brisbane city centre is situated in the southeast corner of Queensland, Australia, at a <!--del_lnk--> latitude and <!--del_lnk--> longitude of <span class="plainlinksneverexpand"><!--del_lnk--> 27&deg;28&prime;S 153&deg;02&prime;E</span>. The city straddles the Brisbane River, and its eastern suburbs line the shores of Moreton Bay. The greater Brisbane region lies on the coastal plain east of the <!--del_lnk--> Great Dividing Range, although the urban area is dotted by large hills reaching up to 300 metres such as <!--del_lnk--> Mount Coot-tha, <!--del_lnk--> Mount Gravatt, <!--del_lnk--> Whites Hill and <!--del_lnk--> Stephens Mountain.<p>Generally, the city is a low-lying <!--del_lnk--> floodplain and susceptible to severe <!--del_lnk--> flooding. Many suburban creeks also criss-cross the city, increasing the risk of localised flooding. The city has suffered two major floods since colonisation, in 1893 and 1974. The <!--del_lnk--> 1974 Brisbane flood occurred partly as a result of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Cyclone Wanda&quot;. Continual non-stop heavy rain had fallen during the three weeks leading up to the flood, which occurred during the <!--del_lnk--> Australia Day weekend (26&ndash;27 January, <!--del_lnk--> 1974). The flood damaged many parts of the city, especially in the suburbs of <!--del_lnk--> Oxley, <!--del_lnk--> Bulimba, <!--del_lnk--> Rocklea, <!--del_lnk--> Coorparoo and <!--del_lnk--> New Farm. The <!--del_lnk--> City Botanic gardens were also inundated, leading to a new colony of <!--del_lnk--> mangroves to form in the City Reach of the Brisbane River.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Brisbane central business district is situated in a curve of a river. Covering only 2.2 square kilometres, it is easily walkable. The central streets are named for members of the <!--del_lnk--> House of Hanover. Streets named after female members (<!--del_lnk--> Adelaide, <!--del_lnk--> Alice, <!--del_lnk--> Ann, <!--del_lnk--> Charlotte, <!--del_lnk--> Elizabeth, <!--del_lnk--> Margaret, <!--del_lnk--> Mary) run parallel to <!--del_lnk--> Queen Street and <!--del_lnk--> Queen Street Mall (named in honour of <a href="../../wp/v/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a>) and perpendicular to streets named after male members (<!--del_lnk--> Albert, <!--del_lnk--> Edward, <!--del_lnk--> George, <!--del_lnk--> William).<p>Brisbane has a lower <!--del_lnk--> inner city population density than Australia&#39;s two largest cities, <a href="../../wp/s/Sydney.htm" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Melbourne.htm" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, although constant population growth occurring in Brisbane is closing the gap between Brisbane and Melbourne. The lower population density reflects the fact that most of Brisbane&#39;s housing stock consists of detached houses. Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks resulting in few <!--del_lnk--> terrace houses being constructed in Brisbane. The high density housing that did exist came in the form of miniature Queenslander-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles but are sometimes only 1/4 the size. These miniature Queenslanders are becoming scarce but can still be seen in the inner city subrubs. Multi residence accommodations (such as apartment blocks) are relative newcomers to Brisbane, with few such blocks built before <!--del_lnk--> 1970, other than in inner suburbs such as <!--del_lnk--> New Farm. Pre-1950 housing stock was often built in a distinctive architectural style known as a <!--del_lnk--> Queenslander, featuring timber construction with large <!--del_lnk--> verandahs and high ceilings. The relative cheapness of timber in South-East Queensland meant that until recently most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Many of these houses are elevated on stumps (incorrectly referred to as <i>stilts</i>), that were originally timber, but are now frequently replaced by steel or concrete.<p>Overall the city has a density of 379.4 people per square kilometre, which is comparable to that of <a href="../../wp/s/Sydney.htm" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>. Recently the density of the city and inner city neighbourhoods has increased with the construction of apartments, with the result that the population of the central business district has doubled over the last 5 years.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>
      <p>Brisbane has a typical <!--del_lnk--> subtropical climate with hot, humid summers and dry, mild winters. From late Spring through to early Autumn, thunderstorms are common over the greater Brisbane area, with the more severe events accompanied by large damaging hail stones, torrential rain and destructive winds.<p>The city&#39;s highest recorded temperature was 43.2 &deg;C (109.8 &deg;F) on the <!--del_lnk--> 26 January <!--del_lnk--> 1940, while the lowest temperature of 2.3 &deg;C (36.1 &deg;F) was recorded on <!--del_lnk--> 12 July <!--del_lnk--> 1894 and <!--del_lnk--> 2 July <!--del_lnk--> 1896. Brisbane&#39;s wettest day was <!--del_lnk--> 21 January <!--del_lnk--> 1887, when 465 mm (18.3 in) of rain fell on the city, the highest maximum daily rainfall of any of Australia&#39;s capital cities.<table class="wikitable" style="width: 75%; margin: 0 auto 0 auto;">

      <p>Unlike other Australian capital cities, a large portion of the greater metropolitan area of Brisbane is controlled by a single <!--del_lnk--> local government entity, the <!--del_lnk--> Brisbane City Council. Since the creation of the Brisbane City Council in <!--del_lnk--> 1925 the urban areas of Brisbane have expanded considerably past the City Council boundaries.<p>The City of Brisbane is divided into 26 wards, with each ward electing a Councillor as their community representative. The <!--del_lnk--> Lord Mayor of Brisbane and Councillors are elected every four years by popular vote, in which all residents must participate. The current Lord Mayor of Brisbane is <!--del_lnk--> Campbell Newman, who was elected to the position in <!--del_lnk--> March 2004.<p>Brisbane City Council is the largest local government body (in terms of population and budget) in Australia. The Council, formed by the merger of twenty smaller councils in 1925, has jurisdiction over an area of 1367 km&sup2;. The Council&#39;s annual budget is approximately $1.6 billion, and it has an asset base of $13 billion.<p>The Brisbane <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan area now covers parts of several adjoining <!--del_lnk--> local government areas including <!--del_lnk--> Beaudesert Shire, <!--del_lnk--> Caboolture Shire, <!--del_lnk--> Gold Coast City, <!--del_lnk--> Ipswich City, <!--del_lnk--> Logan City, <!--del_lnk--> Pine Rivers Shire, <!--del_lnk--> Redcliffe City and <!--del_lnk--> Redland Shire.<br clear="all" />

The government has invested in several biotechnology and research facilities at several universities in Brisbane. The <!--del_lnk--> Institute for Molecular Bioscience at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Queensland (UQ) Saint Lucia Campus is a large <!--del_lnk--> CSIRO and Queensland state government initiative for research and innovation that is currently being emulated at the <!--del_lnk--> Queensland University of Technology (QUT) Campus at Kelvin Grove with the establishment of the <!--del_lnk--> Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation (IHBI).<p>Brisbane is also considered one of the major business hubs in Australia. Most major Australian and International companies have either a major or minor contact office in Brisbane. Many <a href="../../wp/e/Electronics.htm" title="Electronics">electronics</a> companies also take advantage of the strategic port and airports by choosing to have distribution hubs in the city. <!--del_lnk--> LG, <!--del_lnk--> Panasonic, <!--del_lnk--> Samsung are just a few practical examples. <!--del_lnk--> DHL Global have their Oceanic distribution warehouse located in Brisbane, while <!--del_lnk--> Asia Pacific Aerospace their headquarters.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Port of Brisbane is on the lower reaches of the Brisbane River and on Fisherman&#39;s Island at the rivers mouth, and is the 3rd most important port in Australia for value of goods. <!--del_lnk--> Container freight, <a href="../../wp/s/Sugar.htm" title="Sugar">sugar</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Cereal.htm" title="Grain">grain</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a> and <!--del_lnk--> bulk liquids are the major exports. Most of the port facilities are less than three decades old and some are built on reclaimed <!--del_lnk--> mangroves and <!--del_lnk--> wetlands. The Port is a part of the <!--del_lnk--> Australia TradeCoast, the country&#39;s fastest-growing economic development area, is a marketing partnership between the Queensland Government, the city of Brisbane, Brisbane airport and its seaport, originally proposed by a UK marketer who had also developed the <!--del_lnk--> Amsterdam airport Area zone. Geographically, Australia TradeCoast occupies a huge swathe of land around the airport and port. Commercially, the area has attracted a mix of companies from throughout the Asia Pacific region.<p>Home grown major companies from Brisbane include <!--del_lnk--> Suncorp-Metway Limited, <!--del_lnk--> Flight Centre, <!--del_lnk--> SunSuper, <!--del_lnk--> Orrcon, <!--del_lnk--> Credit Union Australia, <!--del_lnk--> Donut King, <!--del_lnk--> Wotif.com, <!--del_lnk--> WebCentral, <!--del_lnk--> PIPE Networks, <!--del_lnk--> Mincom Ltd. and <!--del_lnk--> Virgin Blue are headquartered in Brisbane, while the city has regional presences of <!--del_lnk--> Alcan, <!--del_lnk--> Oracle, <!--del_lnk--> Boeing and <!--del_lnk--> Red Hat.<br clear="all" />

      <p>As Queensland&#39;s largest city and state capital, Brisbane has an extensive transportation network within the city, as well as connections to regional centres, interstate and to overseas destinations. Public Transport in Brisbane is provided by bus, rail and ferry services. Bus services are operated by public and private operators whereas trains and ferries are operated by public agencies. The <!--del_lnk--> Brisbane central business district (CBD) is the central hub for all public transport services with services focusing on <!--del_lnk--> Queen Street Bus Station, <!--del_lnk--> Roma Street and <!--del_lnk--> Central railway stations, and various city ferries wharves. Brisbane&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> CityCat high speed ferry service, popular with tourists and commuters, operates services along the <!--del_lnk--> Brisbane River and in this regard is unusual among Australian cities.<p>The CityTrain urban rail network consists of 7 suburban lines and covers mostly the west, north and east sides of the city. It also provides the route for an <!--del_lnk--> AirTrain service between the City and <!--del_lnk--> Brisbane Airport (the AirTrain, itself, is owned by a company). Since 2000, Brisbane has been developing a network of <!--del_lnk--> busways to provide faster bus services. &quot;<!--del_lnk--> TransLink&quot;, an integrated ticketing system operates across the public transport network.<p>The Brisbane River has created a barrier to transport. In total there are six road bridges, mostly concentrated in the inner city area. This has intensified the need for transport routes to focus on the inner city. There are also three railway bridges and one pedestrian bridge. The <!--del_lnk--> Eleanor Schonell Bridge is under construction between the University of Queensland and <!--del_lnk--> Dutton Park and is for use by buses, pedestrians and as a bicycle bridge. There are currently multiple tunnel and bridge projects underway as part of the <!--del_lnk--> TransApex plan.

      <p>Brisbane is served by several <!--del_lnk--> freeways. The <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Motorway connects the central city with the <!--del_lnk--> Gold Coast to the south. The <!--del_lnk--> Ipswich Motorway connects the city with Ipswich to the west via the southern suburbs, while the <!--del_lnk--> Western Freeway provides a connection between Brisbane&#39;s inner-west and the outer south-west, connecting with the Ipswich Motorway south of the Brisbane River. The <!--del_lnk--> Bruce Highway is Brisbane&#39;s main route north of the city to the rest of the State. The Bruce Highway terminates 1700km away in <!--del_lnk--> Cairns and passes through most major cities along the Queensland coast. The <!--del_lnk--> Gateway Motorway is a private <!--del_lnk--> toll road which connects the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coasts by providing an alternate route avoiding Brisbane&#39;s inner city area. The tollroad crosses the Brisbane River to the east of the city over the <!--del_lnk--> Gateway Bridge. The Gateway Motorway connects with Bruce Highway and the Pacific Motorway. A duplicate of the bridge is planned to be built in parallel to cope with the area&#39;s growing population.<p>Brisbane&#39;s population growth placed strains on South East Queensland&#39;s transport system. The State Government and Brisbane City Council have responded with infrastructure plans and increased funding for transportation projects, such as the <!--del_lnk--> South East Queensland Infrastructure Plan and Program. Most of the focus has been placed on expanding current road infrastructure, particularly tunnels and bypasses, as well as improving the public transport system.<p>The city is served by two airports. <!--del_lnk--> Brisbane Airport (IATA code: <i>BNE</i>) is the city&#39;s main airport and the third busiest in Australia. It is located at Eagle Farm, north-east of the city centre and provides domestic and international passenger services. <!--del_lnk--> Archerfield Airport (in Brisbane&#39;s southern suburbs) acts as a <!--del_lnk--> general aviation airport.<p><a id="Utilities" name="Utilities"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Utilities</span></h3>
      <p>Water storage, treatment and delivery for Brisbane is handled by <!--del_lnk--> SEQ Water, which sells on to <!--del_lnk--> Brisbane Water for distribution to the greater Brisbane area. Water for the area is stored in one of three dams; <!--del_lnk--> Wivenhoe, <!--del_lnk--> Somerset and <!--del_lnk--> North Pine, all of which are at all time lows, causing councils in the <!--del_lnk--> South East Queenland area to devise some of the strictest water restrictions in Australia. <!--del_lnk--> Brisbane Water also handles sewage treatment and recycled water distribution.<p>Electricity and Gas in Brisbane are handled by Energex, a state government organisation, and <!--del_lnk--> Origin Energy, a private company that also handles the gas line grid within the city.<p>Metropolitan Brisbane is serviced by all major and most minor telecommunications companies and their networks. Brisbane has the largest number of enabled <!--del_lnk--> DSL telephone exchanges in Queensland. An increasing number are also enabled with special hardware (<!--del_lnk--> DSLAMs) which enable ultra high speed <!--del_lnk--> ADSL2+ internet access. The Brisbane CBD also features a complete underground <!--del_lnk--> fibre optics network, with numerous connections to the inner suburbs provided by various service providers.<p>Cable via two major networks provided and serviced by <!--del_lnk--> Telstra and <!--del_lnk--> Optus. These provide both high speed internet as well as <!--del_lnk--> Pay TV services for the bulk of the city&#39;s metropolitan area.
