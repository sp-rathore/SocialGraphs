      <p>The <b>black panther</b> is the common name for a black specimen (a <!--del_lnk--> melanistic variant) of any of several <!--del_lnk--> species of <a href="../../wp/c/Cat.htm" title="Cat">cats</a>. Zoologically speaking, the term <i>panther</i> is synonymous with <i>leopard</i>. The <!--del_lnk--> genus name <i>Panthera</i> is a <!--del_lnk--> taxonomic category that contains all the species of a particular group of <!--del_lnk--> felids. In <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>, the term <i>panther</i> is commonly used for the <!--del_lnk--> puma; in <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin America</a> it is most often used to mean a <!--del_lnk--> jaguar. Elsewhere in the world it refers to the <!--del_lnk--> leopard (originally individual animals with longer tails were deemed panthers and others were leopards; it is a common misconception that the term panther necessarily refers a melanistic individual).<p><!--del_lnk--> Melanism is most common in jaguars (<i>Panthera onca</i>) - where it is due to a dominant gene mutation - and <!--del_lnk--> leopards (<i>Panthera pardus</i>) - where it is due to a <!--del_lnk--> recessive gene mutation. Close examination of one of these black cats will show that the typical markings are still there, and are simply hidden by the surplus of the <!--del_lnk--> black pigment <!--del_lnk--> melanin. Cats with <!--del_lnk--> melanism can co-exist with litter mates that do not have this condition. In cats that hunt mainly at night the condition is not detrimental. <!--del_lnk--> White panthers also exist, these being <!--del_lnk--> albino or <!--del_lnk--> leucistic individuals of the same three species.<p>It is probable that melanism is a favorable evolutionary <!--del_lnk--> mutation with a <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_selection.htm" title="Natural selection">selective advantage</a> under certain conditions for its possessor, since it is more commonly found in regions of dense forest, where light levels are lower. Melanism can also be linked to beneficial mutations in the immune system.<p>

      <p>These are the most common form of black panther in captivity and have been selectively bred for decades as exhibits or exotic pets (this inbreeding for the sake of appearance has adversely affected temperament). They are smaller and more lightly built than leopards. The spotted pattern is still visible on black leopards, especially from certain angles where the effect is that of printed <!--del_lnk--> silk. Skin colour is a mixture of blue black gray and purple with rosettes. A black panther (leopard) is able to hunt and kill animals outweighing them by more than 1,350 pounds but this is rare because of competition from tigers and lions.<p>Black leopards are reported from most densely-forested areas in south-western <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Myanmar.htm" title="Burma">Burma</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Assam and <a href="../../wp/n/Nepal.htm" title="Nepal">Nepal</a>; from <!--del_lnk--> Travancore and other parts of southern <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> and are said to be common in <!--del_lnk--> Java and the southern part of the <!--del_lnk--> Malay Peninsula where they may be more numerous than spotted leopards. They are less common in tropical <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>, but have been reported from <a href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia.htm" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> (formerly Abyssinia), the forests of Mount Kenya and the Aberdares. One was recorded by Peter Turnbull-Kemp in the equatorial forest of <a href="../../wp/c/Cameroon.htm" title="Cameroon">Cameroon</a>.<p>Adult black panthers (leopards) are more temperamental (nervous or vicious) than their spotted counterparts. It is a myth that their mothers often reject them at a young age because of their colour. In actuality, they are more temperamental because they have been inbred (e.g. brother/sister, father/daughter, mother/son matings) to preserve the coloration. The poor temperament has been bred into the strain as a side-effect of inbreeding. It is this poor temperament that leads to problems of maternal care in captivity as the proximity of humans stresses the mother. According to <!--del_lnk--> Funk And Wagnalls&#39; Wildlife Encyclopedia, black leopards are less fertile than normal leopards having average litters of 1.8, compared to 2.1. This may be due to their high-strung nature.<p>In the early 1980s, <a href="../../wp/g/Glasgow.htm" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> Zoo, <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> acquired a 10 year old black leopard from <a href="../../wp/d/Dublin.htm" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> Zoo, <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. She was exhibited for several years before moving to <a href="../../wp/m/Madrid.htm" title="Madrid">Madrid</a> Zoo, <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>. This leopard had a uniformly black coat profusely sprinkled with white hairs as though draped with spider webs. She was therefore nicknamed the Cobweb Panther. The condition appeared to be <!--del_lnk--> vitiligo and as she aged, the white became more extensive. Since then, other Cobweb Panthers have been reported and photographed in zoos.<p><a id="Black_Panther:_a_Melanistic_Jaguar" name="Black_Panther:_a_Melanistic_Jaguar"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Black Panther: a Melanistic Jaguar</span></h2>

      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> jaguars, the mutation is dominant hence black jaguars can produce both black and spotted cubs, but spotted jaguars only produce spotted cubs when bred together. In leopards, the mutation is recessive and some spotted leopards can produce black cubs (if both parents carry the gene in hidden form) while black leopards always breed true when mated together. In stuffed mounted specimens, black leopards often fade to a rusty colour, but black jaguars fade to chocolate brown. The black jaguar was considered a separate species by indigenous peoples.<p>In Harmsworth Natural History (1910), WH Hudson writes:<blockquote>
       <p>The jaguar is a beautiful creature, the ground-colour of the fur a rich golden-red tan, abundantly marked with black rings, enclosing one or two small spots within. This is the typical colouring, and it varies little in the temperate regions; in the hot region the Indians recognise three strongly marked varieties, which they regard as distinct species - the one described; the smaller jaguar, less aquatic in his habits and marked with spots, not rings; and, thirdly, the black variety. They scout the notion that their terrible &quot;black tiger&quot; is a mere melanic variation, like the black leopard of the Old World and the wild black rabbit. They regard it as wholly distinct, and affirm that it is larger and much more dangerous than the spotted jaguar; that they recognise it by its cry; that it belongs to the terra firma rather than to the water-side; finally, that black pairs with black, and that the cubs are invariably black. Nevertheless, naturalists have been obliged to make it specifically one with Felis onca, the familiar spotted jaguar, since, when stripped of its hide, it is found to be anatomically as much like that beast as the black is like the spotted leopard.</blockquote>
      <p>The gene is incompletely dominant. Individuals with two copies of the gene are darker (the black background colour is more dense) than individuals with just one copy whose background colour may appear to be dark charcoal rather than black.<p>A black jaguar called Diablo has been accidentally crossed with a lioness named Lola at Bear Creek Sanctuary, Barrie, <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a> resulting in a charcoal coloured &quot;black <!--del_lnk--> jaglion&quot; female as well as a tan coloured spotted jaglion male. It therefore cannot be said that the melanistic gene is dominant over lion colouration.<p><a id="Black_Panther:_a_Melanistic_Puma" name="Black_Panther:_a_Melanistic_Puma"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Black Panther: a Melanistic Puma</span></h2>
      <p>There are no authenticated cases of truly melanistic <!--del_lnk--> pumas. Black pumas have been reported in <!--del_lnk--> Kentucky, one of which had a paler belly. There have also been reports of glossy black pumas from <!--del_lnk--> Kansas and eastern <!--del_lnk--> Nebraska. These are known as the North American Black Panther (NABP). None have ever been photographed or shot in the wild, and none have been bred. There is wide conensus among breeders and biologists that the animal does not exist and is a <!--del_lnk--> cryptid. Sightings are current attributed to mistaken species identification by non feline experts, and memetic exaggeration of size.<p>In his &quot;Histoire Naturelle&quot; (1749), <!--del_lnk--> Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, wrote of the &quot;Black Cougar&quot;: &quot;M. de la Borde, King&rsquo;s physician at Cayenne, informs me, that in the [South American] Continent there are three species of rapacious animals; that the first is the jaguar, which is called the tiger; that the second is the couguar [sic], called the red tiger, on account of the uniform redness of his hair; that the jaguar is of the size of a large bull-dog, and weighs about 200 pounds (90&nbsp;kg); that the couguar is smaller, less dangerous, and not so frequent in the neighbourhood of Cayenne as the jaguar; and that both these animals take six years in acquiring their full growth. He adds, that there is a third species in these countries, called the black tiger, of which we have given a figure under the appellation of the black couguar.&quot;<p>&quot;The head,&quot; says M. de la Borde, &quot;is pretty similar to that of the common couguar; but the animal has long black hair, and likewise a long tail, with strong whiskers. He weighs not much above forty pounds. The female brings forth her young in the hollows of old trees.&quot; This black couguar is most likely a margay or ocelot, which are under forty pounds, live in trees, and do occur in a melanistic phase.<p>Another description of a black cougar was provided by Mr Pennant: &quot;Black tiger, or cat, with the head black, sides, fore part of the legs, and the tail, covered with short and very glossy hairs, of a dusky colour, sometimes spotted with black, but generally plain: Upper lips white: At the corner of the mouth a black spot: Long hairs above each eye, and long whiskers on the upper lip: Lower lip, throat, belly, and the inside of the legs, whitish, or very pale ash-colour: Paws white: Ears pointed: Grows to the size of a heifer of a year old: Has vast strength in its limbs.-- Inhabits Brasil and Guiana: Is a cruel and fierce beast; much dreaded by the Indians; but happily is a scarce species;&quot; (<i>Pennant&#39;s Synops. of quad.</i>, p 180). According to his translator Smellie (1781), the description was taken from two black cougars exhibited in London some years previously.<p><a id="Black_Pumas_In_the_United_States.3F_Mistaken_Identity_Candidates" name="Black_Pumas_In_the_United_States.3F_Mistaken_Identity_Candidates"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Black Pumas In the United States? Mistaken Identity Candidates</span></h4>
      <p>In Florida, a few melanistic <a href="../../wp/b/Bobcat.htm" title="Bobcat">bobcats</a> exist. They have been caught, and have also apparently been mistaken for panthers. Ulmer (1941) presents photographs and descriptions of two animals captured in Martin County in 1939 and 1940. In the photographs, they appear black, and one of the hunters called them black. However,<blockquote>
       <p>The Academy specimen, upon close examination, is far from black. The most heavily pigmented portions are the crown and dorsal area. In most lights these areas appear black, but at certain angles the dorsal strip has a decidedly mahogany tint. The mahogany coloring becomes lighter and richer on the sides. The underparts are lightest, being almost ferruginous in colour. The chin, throat and cheeks are dark chocolate-brown, but the facial stripes can be seen clearly. The limbs are dark mahogany. In certain lights the typical spot-pattern of the Florida bobcat can be distinctly seen on the side, underparts and limbs. The Bronx Park animal appears darker and the spots are not visible, although the poor light in the quarantine cage may have been the reason.</blockquote>
      <p>Adult male bobcats are between 28 to 47&quot; long (with a a short bobbed tail), and are between 18 to 24&quot; high at shoulder height. (Females are slightly smaller.) Florida pumas are between 23 to 32&quot; at shoulder height, and between 5 to 7&#39; <i>including tail</i>. Bobcats weight between 16 to 30 pounds, whereas Florida pumas are between 50 to 154 pounds.<p>Another explanation for black puma sightings is the <!--del_lnk--> jaguarundi, a cat very similar genetically to the puma, which grows around 30&quot; of body and 20&quot; of tail. Their coat goes through a reddish-brown phase and a dark grey phase. While their acknowledged natural range ends in southern Texas, a small breeding population was introduced to Florida in the 1940&#39;s, and there are rumors of people breeding them as pets there as well - in Central America they are known as relatively docile pets, as far as non-domesticated animals go. Jaguarundis hunting territory can extend to 100km wide for males, and it&#39;s quite possible that very small populations which rarely venture out of deep forests are responsible for many or most of the sightings. While they are significantly smaller than a puma, differently colored, and much lower to the ground (many note a resemblence to the weasel), a little <!--del_lnk--> memory bias combined with their secretive nature could explain many of the sightings in the southeastern US.<p>Another possibility are black <!--del_lnk--> jaguars, who are believed to have ranged North America in historical memory. Melanistic jaguars aren&#39;t common in nature, and more importantly, jaguars themselves were hunted to near extinction in the &#39;60&#39;s. However, while they do not look exactly like pumas, but they have the requisite size, and it&#39;s conceivable that there could be, for example, a breeding population hidden in the Louisiana bayou. The jaguar has had several photographically confirmed and many unconfirmed sightings in Arizona, New Mexico, and southwest Texas, but not outside that region.<p><a id="Citations" name="Citations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Citations</span></h2>
