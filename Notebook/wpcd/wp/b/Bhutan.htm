The entire country is mountainous except for an 8-10 mile (13-16&nbsp;km) wide strip of subtropical plains in the extreme south which is intersected by valleys known as the <!--del_lnk--> Duars. The elevation gain from the subtropical plains to the glacier-covered <a href="../../wp/h/Himalayas.htm" title="Himalaya">Himalayan</a> heights exceeds 23,000&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> feet (7,000&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> m). Its traditional economy is based on <!--del_lnk--> forestry, <!--del_lnk--> animal husbandry and <!--del_lnk--> subsistence agriculture however these account for less than 50% of a GDP now that Bhutan has become an exporter of <!--del_lnk--> hydroelectricity<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_economy"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. <!--del_lnk--> Cash crops, <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">tourism</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> development aid (the latter mostly from India) are also significant. An extensive census done in April, 2006 resulted in a population figure of 672,425. <!--del_lnk--> Thimphu is the capital and largest city.<p>Bhutan is one of the most isolated nations in the world; foreign influences and tourism are regulated by the government to preserve its traditional <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan Buddhist culture. Most Bhutanese follow either the <!--del_lnk--> Drukpa Kagyu or the <!--del_lnk--> Nyingmapa school of Tibetan Buddhism. The official language is <!--del_lnk--> Dzongkha (lit. &quot;the language of the <!--del_lnk--> dzong&quot;). Bhutan is often described as the last surviving refuge of traditional Himalayan Buddhist culture.<p>Bhutan is linked historically and culturally with its northern neighbour <a href="../../wp/t/Tibet.htm" title="Tibet">Tibet</a>. Yet politically and economically today&#39;s kingdom has drawn much closer to <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>.<p>Bhutan has been a <a href="../../wp/m/Monarchy.htm" title="Monarchy">monarchy</a> since 1907. The different <!--del_lnk--> dzongkhags were united under the leadership of the Trongsa Penlop. The current king, <!--del_lnk--> Jigme Singye Wangchuck, has made some moves toward constitutional government.<p>

      <p>&#39;Bhutan&#39; may be derived from the Sanskrit word &#39;Bhu-Uttan&#39; which means &#39;High Land&#39;. In another theory of sanskritisation, &#39;Bhots-ant&#39; means &#39;end of Tibet&#39; or &#39;south of Tibet&#39;. However some Bhutanese call their country &#39;Druk Yul&#39; and its inhabitants &#39;Drukpa&#39;. The Dzongkha (and Tibetan) name for the country is &#39;Druk Yul&#39; (Land of the Dragon). Because of the serenity and the virginity of the country and its landscapes, Bhutan today is sometimes referred to as the Last Shangri-La.<p>Historically, Bhutan was known by many names, such as &#39;Lho Mon&#39; (Southern Land of Darkness), &#39;Lho Tsendenjong&#39; (Southern Land of the Sandalwood), &#39;Lhomen Khazhi&#39; (Southern Land of Four Approaches), and &#39;Lho Men Jong&#39; (Southern Land of Medicinal Herbs).<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>Stone tools, weapons, and remnants of large stone structures provide evidence that Bhutan was inhabited as early as <!--del_lnk--> 2000 BC. Historians have theorised that the state of <i>Lhomon</i> (literally, &quot;southern darkness&quot;), or <i>Monyul</i> (&quot;Dark Land&quot;, a reference to the <!--del_lnk--> Monpa &ndash; the aboriginal peoples of Bhutan) may have existed between <!--del_lnk--> 500 BC and <a href="../../wp/a/Anno_Domini.htm" title="Anno Domini">AD</a>&nbsp;600. The names <i>Lhomon Tsendenjong</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Sandalwood Country), and <i>Lhomon Khashi</i>, or Southern Mon (country of four approaches) have been found in ancient Bhutanese and Tibetan chronicles.<p>The earliest transcribed event in Bhutan was the passage of the <!--del_lnk--> Buddhist saint Padmasambhava (also called <!--del_lnk--> Guru Rinpoche) in the 8th century. Bhutan&#39;s early history is unclear, because most of the records were destroyed after fire ravaged <!--del_lnk--> Punakha, the ancient capital in 1827. By the 10th century, Bhutan&#39;s political development was heavily influenced by its religious history. Various sub-sects of Buddhism emerged which were patronised by the various Mongol and Tibetan overlords. After the decline of the Mongols in the 14th century, these sub-sects vied with each other for supremacy in the political and religious landscape, eventually leading to the ascendancy of the Drukpa sub-sect by the 16th century.<p><a id="Between_17th_century_and_the_modern_age" name="Between_17th_century_and_the_modern_age"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Between 17th century and the modern age</span></h3>
      <p>Until the early 17th century, Bhutan existed as a patchwork of minor warring <!--del_lnk--> fiefdoms until unified by the <a href="../../wp/t/Tibet.htm" title="Tibet">Tibetan</a> lama and military leader <!--del_lnk--> Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal. To defend the country against intermittent Tibetan forays, Namgyal built a network of impregnable <i><!--del_lnk--> dzong</i> (fortresses), and <!--del_lnk--> promulgated a code of law that helped to bring local lords under centralised control. Many such <i>dzong</i> still exist. After Namgyal&#39;s death in 1651, Bhutan fell into anarchy. Taking advantage of the chaos, the Tibetans attacked Bhutan in 1710, and again in 1730 with the help of the <!--del_lnk--> Mongols. Both assaults were successfully thwarted, and an <!--del_lnk--> armistice was signed in 1759.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>In the 18th century, the Bhutanese invaded and occupied the kingdom of <!--del_lnk--> Cooch Behar to the south. In 1772, Cooch Behar appealed to the <a href="../../wp/b/British_East_India_Company.htm" title="British East India Company">British East India Company</a> who assisted them in ousting the Bhutanese, and later in attacking Bhutan itself in 1774. A peace treaty was signed in which Bhutan agreed to retreat to its pre-1730 borders. However, the peace was tenuous, and border skirmishes with the British were to continue for the next hundred years. The skirmishes eventually led to the <!--del_lnk--> Duar War (1864&ndash;1865), a confrontation over who would control the <!--del_lnk--> Bengal <!--del_lnk--> Duars. After Bhutan lost the war, the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Sinchula was signed between <!--del_lnk--> British India and Bhutan. As part of the <!--del_lnk--> reparations, the Duars were ceded to the <!--del_lnk--> United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in exchange for a rent of Rs.&nbsp;50,000. The treaty ended all hostilities between British India and Bhutan.<p>During the 1870s, power struggles between the rival valleys of <!--del_lnk--> Paro and <!--del_lnk--> Trongsa led to <!--del_lnk--> civil war in Bhutan, eventually leading to the ascendancy of <!--del_lnk--> Ugyen Wangchuck, the <i>ponlop</i> (governor) of <!--del_lnk--> Tongsa. From his power base in central Bhutan, Ugyen Wangchuck defeated his political enemies and united the country following several civil wars and rebellions in the period 1882&ndash;1885.<p>In 1907, an epochal year for the country, <!--del_lnk--> Ugyen Wangchuck was unanimously chosen as the hereditary king of the country by an assembly of leading Buddhist monks, government officials, and heads of important families. The British government promptly recognised the new monarchy, and in 1910 Bhutan signed a treaty which let Great Britain to &lsquo;guide&rsquo; Bhutan&#39;s foreign affairs.<p><a name="1950s_to_1970s"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1950s to 1970s</span></h3>

      <p>Bhutan has a continuing <!--del_lnk--> <b>immigration problem</b> with illegal immigration largely by people of Nepali descent. The first waves of migration by Nepalese into Bhutan in the 19th Century.. They were &#39;naturalized by registration&rsquo; by the 1958 Citizenship Act. More continued to settle illegally and this became exacerbated following the introduction of Bhutan&rsquo;s 5-Year plans in 1961 . From the late 1980s, the government cracked down on illegal immigration which resulted in considerable numbers of people leaving Bhutan. This led to mass demonstrations and violence resulting in even more people leaving the country. Eventually the &#39;refugee&rsquo;s&#39; were setup in the refugee camps in eastern Nepal funded by the UNHCR. They remain there to this day.<p><a id="Recent_Developments_to_the_present_day" name="Recent_Developments_to_the_present_day"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Recent Developments to the present day</span></h3>
      <p>In the recent years (1988 onwards) Nepalese immigrants as well as illegal immigrants have accused Bhutan of violating Human rights. The Bhutanese regime they allege to be responsible for atrocities and crime against her Nepali speaking minority population. The allegations range from rape, executions and eviction of over 100,000 of its minority population, which accounts almost 15% of its people. These allegations remain unproven and are vehemently denied by Bhutan. Most of these refugees settled in UN run refugee camps in south-eastern Nepal where they have remained for 15 years.<p>In 1998, King <!--del_lnk--> Jigme Singye Wangchuck introduced significant political reforms, transferring most of his powers to the <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister and allowing for impeachment of the King by a two-thirds majority of the National Assembly. In late 2003, the <!--del_lnk--> Bhutanese army successfully launched a large-scale operation to flush out anti-India insurgents who were operating training camps in southern Bhutan.<p>In 1999, the King also lifted a ban on television and the Internet, making Bhutan one of the last countries to have introduced the television. In his speech, he said that the television was a critical step to the modernization of Bhutan as well as a major contributor to the country&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Gross National Happiness (Bhutan is the only country to measure happiness) but warned against the misuse of the television that may erode traditional Bhutanese values.<p>A new <!--del_lnk--> constitution has been presented in early 2005 which will be put up for ratification by a <!--del_lnk--> referendum before coming into force. In December 2005, King <!--del_lnk--> Jigme Singye Wangchuck announced that he would step down as King of Bhutan in 2008. King Wangchuck said he would be succeeded by his son, the crown prince Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>The northern region consists of an arc of glaciated mountain peaks with an extremely cold climate at the highest elevations. Most peaks in the north are over 23,000&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> feet (7,000&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> m) above sea level; the highest point is claimed to be the <!--del_lnk--> Kula Kangri, at 24,780&nbsp;feet (7,553&nbsp;m), but detailed topographic studies claim Kula Kangri is wholly in <a href="../../wp/t/Tibet.htm" title="Tibet">Tibet</a> and modern Chinese measurements claim that <!--del_lnk--> Gangkhar Puensum, which has the distinction of being the <!--del_lnk--> highest unclimbed mountain in the world, is higher at 24,835&nbsp;feet (7,570&nbsp;m). Watered by snow-fed rivers, alpine valleys in this region provide <!--del_lnk--> pasture for livestock, tended by a sparse population of migratory shepherds. The <!--del_lnk--> Black Mountains in central Bhutan form a watershed between two major river systems: the <!--del_lnk--> Mo Chhu and the <!--del_lnk--> Drangme Chhu. Peaks in the Black Mountains range between 4,900 feet and 8,900 feet (1,500&nbsp;m and 2,700&nbsp;m) above sea level, and fast-flowing rivers have carved out deep gorges in the lower mountain areas. Woodlands of the central region provide most of Bhutan&#39;s forest production. The <!--del_lnk--> Torsa, <!--del_lnk--> Raidak, <!--del_lnk--> Sankosh, and <!--del_lnk--> Manas are the main rivers of Bhutan, flowing through this region.

      <p>In the south, the <!--del_lnk--> Shiwalik Hills are covered with dense, <!--del_lnk--> deciduous forests, <!--del_lnk--> alluvial lowland river valleys, and mountains up to around 4,900 feet (1,500&nbsp;m) above sea level. The foothills descend into the subtropical Duars plain. Most of the Duars is located in India, although a 6&ndash;9&nbsp;mile (10&ndash;15&nbsp;km) wide strip extends into Bhutan. The Bhutan Duars is divided into two parts: the northern and the southern Duars. The northern Duars, which abuts the Himalayan foothills, has rugged, sloping terrain and dry, <!--del_lnk--> porous soil with dense vegetation and abundant wildlife. The southern Duars has moderately fertile soil, heavy <!--del_lnk--> savannah grass, dense, mixed jungle, and freshwater springs. Mountain rivers, fed by either the melting snow or the monsoon rains, empty into the <!--del_lnk--> Brahmaputra river in India. Data released by the Ministry of agriculture showed that the country had a forest cover of 64% as of October 2005. The climate in Bhutan varies with altitude, from subtropical in the south to <!--del_lnk--> temperate in the highlands and <!--del_lnk--> polar-type climate, with year-round snow, in the north.

      <p>Though Bhutan&#39;s economy is one of the world&#39;s smallest, it has grown very rapidly with about 8% in 2005 and 14% in 2006. As of March 2006, Bhutan&#39;s per capita income was US$ 1,321 making it the highest in South Asia. Bhutan&#39;s standard of living grew and is one of the best performing in South Asia. Bhutan&#39;s economy is one of the world&#39;s smallest and least developed, and is based on <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>, <!--del_lnk--> forestry, and the sale of <!--del_lnk--> hydroelectric power to India. Agriculture provides the main livelihood for more than 80% of the population. Agrarian practices consist largely of <!--del_lnk--> subsistence farming and <!--del_lnk--> animal husbandry. Handicrafts, particularly weaving and the manufacture of religious art for home altars are a small cottage industry and a source of income for some. A landscape that varies from hilly to ruggedly mountainous has made the building of roads, and other <a href="../../wp/i/Infrastructure.htm" title="Infrastructure">infrastructure</a>, difficult and expensive. This, and a lack of access to the sea, has meant that Bhutan has never been able to benefit from significant trading of its produce. Bhutan currently does not have a <a href="../../wp/r/Rail_transport.htm" title="Rail transport">railway system</a>, though <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Railways.htm" title="Indian Railways">Indian Railways</a> plans to link up southern Bhutan with its vast network under an agreement signed in January 2005.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_IR"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The historic trade routes over the high Himalayas, which connected India to <a href="../../wp/t/Tibet.htm" title="Tibet">Tibet</a>, have been closed since the 1959 military takeover of Tibet (although smuggling activity still brings Chinese goods into Bhutan).<p>The industrial sector is minimal, production being of the <!--del_lnk--> cottage-industry type. Most development projects, such as road construction, rely on Indian contract labour. Agricultural produce includes rice, chilies, dairy (yak) products, buckwheat, barley, root crops, apples, and citrus and maize at lower elevations.

      <p>The population of Bhutan, once estimated at several million, has now been officially downgraded by the Bhutanese government to 750,000, after a census in the early nineties. An extensive census done in June of 2005 resulted in a further reduction of the population figure to 554,000. The government has yet to release demographic breakdown on the new population figures. Most believe that the population was artificially inflated in the seventies because of an earlier perception that nations with populations of less than a million would not be admitted to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>. Hence the United Nation population figures are much higher than the figures provided by the government.<p>The population density, 45 per square kilometre (117/sq.&nbsp;mi), makes Bhutan one of the least densely populated countries in Asia. Roughly 20% percent of the population lives in urban areas comprised of small towns mainly along the central valley and the southern border. This percentage is increasing rapidly as the pace of rural to urban migration has been picking up. The largest town is the capital, <!--del_lnk--> Thimphu, which has a population of 50,000. Other urban areas with significant population are <!--del_lnk--> Paro, and <!--del_lnk--> Phuentsholing.<p>Among the Bhutanese people, several principal ethnic groups may be distinguished. The dominant group are the <!--del_lnk--> Ngalops, a Buddhist group based in the western part of the country. Their culture is closely related to that of Tibet. Much the same could be said of the <!--del_lnk--> Sharchops (&quot;Easterners&quot;), who are associated with the eastern part of Bhutan (but who traditionally follow the <!--del_lnk--> Nyingmapa rather than the official <!--del_lnk--> Drukpa Kagyu form of <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan Buddhism). These two groups together are called <!--del_lnk--> Bhutanese. The remaining 15% of the population is ethnic Nepali, most of whom are Hindu.<p>The national language is <!--del_lnk--> Dzongkha, one of 53 languages in the <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan language family. The script, here called <i>Chhokey</i> (&quot;Dharma Language&quot;), is identical with the Tibetan script. The government classifies 19 related Tibetan languages as <!--del_lnk--> dialects of Dzongkha. <!--del_lnk--> Lepcha is spoken in parts of western Bhutan; <!--del_lnk--> Tshangla, a close relative of Dzongkha, is widely spoken in the eastern parts. <!--del_lnk--> Khengkha is spoken in central Bhutan. The <!--del_lnk--> Nepali language is widely spoken in the south. In the schools English is the medium of instruction and Dzongkha is taught as the national language. <!--del_lnk--> Ethnologue lists 24 languages currently spoken in Bhutan, all of them in the <!--del_lnk--> Tibeto-Burman family, except Nepali, an <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Aryan language. The languages of Bhutan are still not well-characterised, and several have yet to be recorded in an in-depth academic grammar. <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> now has official status as well.<p>The <a href="../../wp/l/Literacy.htm" title="Literacy">literacy rate</a> is only 42.2% (56.2% of males and 28.1% of females). People 14 years old and younger comprise 39.1%, while people between 15 and 59 comprise 56.9%, and those over 60 are only 4%. The country has a median age of 20.4 years. Bhutan has a <!--del_lnk--> life expectancy of 62.2 years (61 for males and 64.5 for females) according to the latest data from the <!--del_lnk--> World Bank.

      <p>While the Bhutanese are free to travel abroad, Bhutan is seen to be inaccessible to foreigners. The widespread misperception that Bhutan has set limits on tourist visas, the high tourist tariff and the requirement to go on packaged tours seem to create this impression.<p>The traditional dress for Ngalong and Sharchop men is the <i><!--del_lnk--> gho</i>, a knee-length robe tied at the waist by a cloth belt known as the <i><!--del_lnk--> kera</i>. Women wear an ankle-length dress, the <i><!--del_lnk--> kira</i>, which is clipped at one shoulder and tied at the waist. An accompaniment to the kira is a long-sleeved blouse, the <i>toego</i>, which is worn underneath the outer layer. Social status and class determine the texture, colours, and decorations that embellish the garments. Scarves and shawls are also indicators of social standings, as Bhutan has traditionally been a <!--del_lnk--> feudal society. Earrings are worn by females. Controversially, Bhutanese law now requires these garments for all Bhutanese citizens.<p><a href="../../wp/r/Rice.htm" title="Rice">Rice</a>, and increasingly <a href="../../wp/m/Maize.htm" title="Maize">corn</a>, are the staple foods of the country.

      <p>Bhutan&#39;s national sport is <!--del_lnk--> archery, and competitions are held regularly in most villages. It differs from <a href="../../wp/o/Olympic_Games.htm" title="Olympic Games">Olympic</a> standards not only in technical details such as the placement of the targets and atmosphere. There are two targets placed over 100 metres apart and teams shoot from one end of the field to the other. Each member of the team shoots two arrows per round. Traditional Bhutanese archery is a social event and competitions are organised between villages, towns, and amateur teams. There are usually plenty of food and drink complete with singing and dancing cheerleaders comprising wives and supporters of the participating teams. Attempts to distract an opponent include standing around the target and making fun of the shooter&#39;s ability.

      <p>Bhutan has numerous public holidays, most of which centre around traditional seasonal, secular and religious festivals. They include the <!--del_lnk--> winter solstice (around <!--del_lnk--> January 1, depending on the lunar calendar), the lunar New Year (February or March), the King&#39;s birthday and the anniversary of his coronation, the official start of monsoon season (<!--del_lnk--> September 22), National Day (<!--del_lnk--> December 17), and various Buddhist and Hindu celebrations. Even the secular holidays have religious overtones, including religious dances and prayers for blessing the day.<p>Masked dances and dance dramas are common traditional features at festivals, usually accompanied by traditional music. Energetic dancers, wearing colourful wooden or composition facemasks and stylised costumes, depict heroes, demons, death heads, animals, gods, and caricatures of common people. The dancers enjoy royal patronage, and preserve ancient folk and religious customs and perpetuate the ancient art of mask making.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan&quot;</div>
