      <p>In <a href="../../wp/g/Geography.htm" title="Geography">geography</a>, a <b>desert</b> is a <a href="../../wp/l/Landscape.htm" title="Landscape">landscape</a> form or region that receives very little <!--del_lnk--> precipitation. Generally deserts are defined as areas that receive an average annual precipitation of less than 250 mm (10 inches). The terminology used to define deserts is complex. &#39;True deserts&#39; where vegetation cover is exceedingly sparse, correspond to the &#39;hyperarid regions of the earth, where rainfall is exceedingly rare and infrequent. Deserts are however part of a wider classification of regions that, on an average annual basis, have a moisture deficit (i.e. they can potentially lose more than is received). These areas are collectively called &#39;<!--del_lnk--> drylands&#39; and extent over almost half of the earth&#39;s land surface. Because desert is a vague term, the use of &#39;dryland&#39;, and its subdivisions of hyper arid, arid, semiarid and dry-subhumid, is to be preferred, and is approved by the United Nations.<p>Deserts cover at least one-fifth of the Earth&#39;s land surface. Deserts are very arid (dry) and can have high temperatures in excess of 50&deg;C. Even though the desert is very hot in the day, it is extremely cold at night. Deserts have quite rough terrain, many sand dunes and present an overwhelmingly hostile environment. Humans that travel unprepared into deserts have a slim chance of survival due to the relative dearth of water.<p>Deserts have a reputation for supporting very little life, but in reality deserts often have high <a href="../../wp/b/Biodiversity.htm" title="Biodiversity">biodiversity</a>, including <a href="../../wp/a/Animal.htm" title="Animal">animals</a> that remain hidden during daylight hours to control body temperature or to limit moisture needs.<p>Desert landscapes have certain distinctive features. Deserts are often composed of <a href="../../wp/s/Sand.htm" title="Sand">sand</a> and <!--del_lnk--> rocky surfaces. <!--del_lnk--> Sand dunes called <!--del_lnk--> ergs and stony surfaces called Reg or <!--del_lnk--> hamada surfaces compose a minority of desert surfaces. Exposures of <!--del_lnk--> rocky terrain are typical, and reflect minimal soil development and sparseness of <a href="../../wp/v/Vegetation.htm" title="Vegetation">vegetation</a>. Bottom lands may be <a href="../../wp/s/Salt.htm" title="Salt">salt</a>-covered flats. <!--del_lnk--> Eolian (wind-driven) processes are major factors in shaping desert landscapes. <b>Cold deserts</b> (also known as polar deserts) have similar features but the main form of precipation is <a href="../../wp/s/Snow.htm" title="Snow">snow</a> rather than <a href="../../wp/r/Rain.htm" title="Rain">rain</a>. The largest cold desert is <a href="../../wp/a/Antarctica.htm" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> (composed of about 98 percent thick <a href="../../wp/c/Continent.htm" title="Continent">continental</a> <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_sheet.htm" title="Ice sheet">ice sheet</a> and 2 percent barren rock). The largest hot desert is the <!--del_lnk--> Sahara.<p>Deserts sometimes contain valuable mineral deposits that were formed in the arid environment or that were exposed by erosion. Because deserts are dry, they are ideal places for human artifacts and fossils to be preserved.<p>Deserts usually have an extreme temperature range. Most deserts have a low temperature at night. This is because the air is very dry (contains little moisture) and therefore holds little heat so as soon as the sun sets, the desert cools quickly. Also, cloudless skies increase the release of heat at night.<p>In the <!--del_lnk--> K&ouml;ppen climate classification system, deserts are classed as (BW).<p>

      <p>Most classifications rely on some combination of the number of days of <a href="../../wp/r/Rain.htm" title="Rain">rainfall</a>, the total amount of annual rainfall, temperature, <!--del_lnk--> humidity, or other factors. In <!--del_lnk--> 1953, <!--del_lnk--> Peveril Meigs divided desert regions on Earth into three categories according to the amount of precipitation they received. In this now widely accepted system, extremely arid lands have at least 12 consecutive months without rainfall, arid lands have less than 250 millimeters of annual rainfall, and semiarid lands have a mean annual precipitation of between 250 and 500 millimeters. Arid and extremely arid land are deserts, and semiarid grasslands generally are referred to as <!--del_lnk--> steppes.<p>However, lack of rainfall alone can&#39;t provide an accurate description of what a desert is. For example, <!--del_lnk--> Phoenix, Arizona receives less than 250 millimeters (10 inches) of precipitation per year, and is immediately recognized as being located in a desert. The <!--del_lnk--> North Slope of Alaska&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Brooks Range also receives less than 250 millimeters of precipitation per year, but is not generally recognized as a desert region.<p>The difference lies in something termed &quot;potential <!--del_lnk--> evapotranspiration.&quot; The water budget of an area can be calculated using the formula P-PE+/-S, wherein P is precipitation, PE is potential evapotranspiration rates and S is amount of surface storage of water. Evapotranspiration is the combination of water loss through atmospheric <!--del_lnk--> evaporation, coupled with the evaporative loss of water through the life processes of plants. Potential evapotranspiration, then, is the amount of water that <i>could</i> evaporate in any given region. <!--del_lnk--> Tucson, Arizona receives about 300 millimeters, (12 inches), of rain per year, however about 2500 millimeters, (100 inches), of water could evaporate over the course of a year. In other words, about 8 times more water could evaporate from the region than actually falls. Rates of evapotranspiration in other regions such as Alaska are much lower, so while these regions receive minimal precipitation, they should be designated as specifically different from the simple definition of a desert: a place where evaporation exceeds precipitation.<p>That said, there are different forms of deserts. Cold deserts can be covered in <a href="../../wp/s/Snow.htm" title="Snow">snow</a>; such locations don&#39;t receive much precipitation, and what does fall remains frozen as snow pack; these are more commonly referred to as <!--del_lnk--> tundra if a short season of above-freezing temperatures is experienced, or as an <!--del_lnk--> ice cap if the temperature remains below freezing year-round, rendering the land almost completely lifeless.<p>Most non-polar deserts are hot because they have little <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a>. Water tends to have a cooling, or at least a moderating, effect in environments where it is plentiful. In some parts of the world deserts are created by a <!--del_lnk--> rain shadow effect in which air masses lose much of their moisture as they move over a <!--del_lnk--> mountain range; other areas are arid by virtue of being very far from the nearest available sources of moisture (this is true in some middle-latitude landmass interior locations, particularly in <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a>).<p>Deserts are also classified by their geographical location and dominant weather pattern as trade wind, mid-latitude, rain shadow, coastal, monsoon, or <!--del_lnk--> polar deserts. Former desert areas presently in non-arid environments are paleodeserts.<p><a id="Montane_deserts" name="Montane_deserts"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Montane deserts</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Montane deserts are arid places with a very high <!--del_lnk--> altitude; the most prominent example is found north of the <a href="../../wp/h/Himalayas.htm" title="Himalaya">Himalaya</a> especially in Laddakh region of Jammu and Kashmir (India), in parts of the <!--del_lnk--> Kunlun Mountains and the <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan Plateau. Many locations within this category have elevations exceeding 3,000 meters (9,843 feet) and the thermal regime can be <!--del_lnk--> hemiboreal. These places owe their profound aridity (the average annual precipitation is often less than 40mm) to being very far from the nearest available sources of moisture. Deserts are normally cold.<p><a id="Rain_Shadow_Deserts" name="Rain_Shadow_Deserts"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Rain Shadow Deserts</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Rain shadow deserts form when tall mountain ranges block clouds from reaching areas in the direction the wind is going. As the air moves over the mountains, it cools and condenses, causing <!--del_lnk--> precipitation on the upwind side. <!--del_lnk--> Moisture almost never reaches the <!--del_lnk--> downwind side of the mountain, therefore causing a desert. When that air reaches the downwind side, the air is dry, because it has already lost all of its moisture. The air then warms and expands and blows across the desert. The warm air takes all the small amounts of moisture in the desert away.<p><a id="Desert_features" name="Desert_features"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Desert features</span></h2>

      <p><a href="../../wp/s/Sand.htm" title="Sand">Sand</a> covers only about 20 percent of Earth&#39;s deserts. Most of the sand is in <!--del_lnk--> sand sheets and sand seas&mdash;vast regions of undulating dunes resembling ocean waves &quot;frozen&quot; in an instant of time. In general, there are 6 forms of deserts:<ul>
       <li>Mountain and basin deserts;<li>Hamada deserts, which comprise of plateaux landforms;<li>Regs which consist of rock pavements;<li>Ergs which are formed by sand seas;<li>Intermontane Basins; and<li>Badlands which are located at the margins of arid lands comprising of clay-rich soil.</ul>
      <p>Nearly all desert surfaces are plains where <!--del_lnk--> eolian deflation&mdash;removal of fine-grained material by the wind&mdash;has exposed loose gravels consisting predominantly of <!--del_lnk--> pebbles but with occasional <!--del_lnk--> cobbles.<p>The remaining surfaces of arid lands are composed of exposed <!--del_lnk--> bedrock outcrops, desert soils, and <!--del_lnk--> fluvial deposits including <!--del_lnk--> alluvial fans, <!--del_lnk--> playas, desert <!--del_lnk--> lakes, and oases. Bedrock outcrops commonly occur as small mountains surrounded by extensive erosional plains.<p>There are several different types of dunes. Barchan dunes are produced by strong winds blowing across a level surface and are crescent-shaped. Longitudinal or seif dunes are dunes that are parallel to a strong wind that blows in one general direction. Transverse dunes run at a right angle to the constant wind direction. Star dunes are star-shaped and have several ridges that spread out around a point.<p><!--del_lnk--> Oases are vegetated areas moistened by <!--del_lnk--> springs, <!--del_lnk--> wells, or by <a href="../../wp/i/Irrigation.htm" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a>. Many are artificial. Oases are often the only places in deserts that support crops and permanent habitation.<p><a id="Vegetation" name="Vegetation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Vegetation</span></h3>

      <p>Most desert plants are drought- or salt-tolerant, such as <!--del_lnk--> xerophytes. Some store water in their leaves, roots, and stems. Other desert plants have long <!--del_lnk--> tap roots that penetrate to the water table if present. The stems and leaves of some plants lower the surface velocity of sand-carrying winds and protect the ground from erosion. Even small fungi and microscopic plant organisms found on the soil surface (so-called <i><!--del_lnk--> cryptobiotic soil</i>) can be a vital link in preventing erosion and providing support for other living organisms.<p>Deserts typically have a plant cover that is sparse but enormously diverse. The <!--del_lnk--> Sonoran Desert of the American Southwest has the most complex desert vegetation on Earth. The giant <!--del_lnk--> saguaro cacti provide nests for desert birds and serve as &quot;trees&quot; of the desert. Saguaro grow slowly but may live 200 years. When 9 years old, they are about 15 centimeters high. After about 75 years, the cacti develop their first branches. When fully grown, saguaro are 15 meters tall and weigh as much as 10 tons. They dot the Sonoran and reinforce the general impression of deserts as cactus-rich land.<p>Although cacti are often thought of as characteristic desert plants, other types of plants have adapted well to the arid environment. They include the <a href="../../wp/p/Pea.htm" title="Pea">pea</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Sunflower.htm" title="Sunflower">sunflower</a> families.

      <p>Rain does fall occasionally in deserts, and desert storms are often violent. A record 44 millimeters of rain once fell within 3 hours in the Sahara. Large Saharan storms may deliver up to 1 millimeter per minute. Normally dry stream channels, called <!--del_lnk--> arroyos or <!--del_lnk--> wadis, can quickly fill after heavy rains, and <!--del_lnk--> flash floods make these channels dangerous.<p>Though little rain falls in deserts, deserts receive runoff from ephemeral, or short-lived, streams fed considerable quantities of sediment for a day or two. Although most deserts are in basins with closed, or interior drainage, a few deserts are crossed by &#39;exotic&#39; rivers that derive their water from outside the desert. Such rivers infiltrate soils and evaporate large amounts of water on their journeys through the deserts, but their volumes are such that they maintain their continuity. The <!--del_lnk--> Nile River, the <!--del_lnk--> Colorado River, and the <a href="../../wp/y/Yellow_River.htm" title="Yellow River">Yellow River</a> are exotic rivers that flow through deserts to deliver their sediments to the sea. Deserts may also have underground springs, rivers, or reservoirs that lay close to the surface, or deep underground. Plants that have not completely adapted to sporadic rainfalls in a desert environment may tap into underground water sources that do not exceed the reach of their root systems.<p>Lakes form where rainfall or meltwater in interior drainage basins is sufficient. Desert lakes are generally shallow, temporary, and salty. Because these lakes are shallow and have a low bottom gradient, wind stress may cause the lake waters to move over many square kilometers. When small lakes dry up, they leave a salt crust or <!--del_lnk--> hardpan. The flat area of clay, silt, or sand encrusted with salt that forms is known as a playa. There are more than a hundred playas in North American deserts. Most are relics of large lakes that existed during the last <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_age.htm" title="Ice age">ice age</a> about 12,000 years ago. <!--del_lnk--> Lake Bonneville was a 52,000-square-kilometer lake almost 300 meters deep in Utah, Nevada, and Idaho during the Ice Age. Today the remnants of Lake Bonneville include Utah&#39;s <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Salt_Lake.htm" title="Great Salt Lake">Great Salt Lake</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Utah Lake, and <!--del_lnk--> Sevier Lake. Because playas are arid land forms from a wetter past, they contain useful clues to climatic change.<p>When the occasional precipitation does occur, it erodes the desert rocks quickly and powerfully. Winds are the other factor that erodes deserts - they are constant yet slow.<p>The flat terrains of hardpans and playas make them excellent race tracks and natural runways for airplanes and spacecraft. Ground-vehicle speed records are commonly established on <!--del_lnk--> Bonneville Speedway, a race track on the Great Salt Lake hardpan. Space shuttles land on <!--del_lnk--> Rogers Lake Playa at <!--del_lnk--> Edwards Air Force Base in California.<p><a id="Mineral_resources" name="Mineral_resources"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Trivia</span></h2>
