      <p>Pakistan&#39;s ethnic diversity is obvious and yet accurate numbers have been elusive. They constitute a variety of races and ethnic groups, although largely of <!--del_lnk--> Caucasoid stock. Most believe that the large majority of Pakistanis belong to the <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Aryan ethnic group. There are a substantial number of <a href="../../wp/i/Iranian_peoples.htm" title="Iranian peoples">Iranic peoples</a> and smaller numbers of <!--del_lnk--> Dravidians. These major ethnic groups are further broken down into several smaller ethnic groups: Pakistan&#39;s census and rough estimates vary, but the consensus is that the <!--del_lnk--> Punjabis are by far the largest group, and that Pukhtuns (also known as <!--del_lnk--> Pashtuns) and <!--del_lnk--> Sindhis are the next two largest groups The Punjabi population is estimated to comprise 44.15% of the national total. The <!--del_lnk--> Pukhtuns are the second-largest group at roughly 15.42%, followed by Sindhis at 14.1%. <!--del_lnk--> Seraikis, a group seen as transitional between Punjabis and Sindhis, make up 10.53% of the population. The remaining groups that comprise large percentages include the <!--del_lnk--> Muhajirs at 7.57% and the <!--del_lnk--> Balochis at 3.57%. The other main ethnic groups include the <!--del_lnk--> Brahui, <!--del_lnk--> Kashmiri, <!--del_lnk--> Hindko Pukhtuns, and the various peoples of the <!--del_lnk--> Northern Areas, who all together total roughly 4.66% of the total population.<p>In addition, over five million <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghan</a> refugees came to Pakistan during the <!--del_lnk--> Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and it is estimated that over three million remain, with a large proportion settling permanently in <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>. If added to the census, Afghan refugees would boost the percentage of the Pukhtuns and &quot;others&quot; categories.<p><a id="Religions" name="Religions"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Religions</span></h3>

      <p>Census data  indicates that over 97% of the population are <!--del_lnk--> Muslims. The <!--del_lnk--> Muslims are divided into different sects which are called <!--del_lnk--> Madhab i.e, schools of jurisprudence (also &#39;Maktab-e-Fikr&#39; (School of Thought) in <!--del_lnk--> Urdu). Nearly 77% of Pakistani Muslims are <!--del_lnk--> Sunni Muslims and 20% are <!--del_lnk--> Shi&#39;a Muslims. The nearly all Pakistani Sunni Muslims belong to <!--del_lnk--> Hanafi school with a small <!--del_lnk--> Hanbali school represented by <!--del_lnk--> Wahabis and <!--del_lnk--> Ahle Hadith. The Hanafi school is divided into <!--del_lnk--> Barelvis and <!--del_lnk--> Deobandis schools. While majority of Pakistani Shia Muslims belong to <!--del_lnk--> Ithna &#39;ashariyah school with significant minority of <!--del_lnk--> Nizari Khoja <!--del_lnk--> Ismailis (Aga Khanis) and a small <!--del_lnk--> Mustaali <!--del_lnk--> Dawoodi Bohra schools. By one estimate, in Pakistan, Muslims are divided into following schools: the Barelvis 48%, Deobandis 25%, Ithna Ashari 19%, Ahle Hadith 4%, Khojas 1%, Bohras 0.25%, and other smaller sects. The Ahle-e-Hadith are part of <!--del_lnk--> Hanbali school. Nearly 65% of the total seminaries (<!--del_lnk--> Madrasah) are run by Deobandis, 25 per cent by the Barelvis, six percent by the Ahle Hadith and three percent by various Shia organizations. <!--del_lnk-->  <!--del_lnk--> Zikris are considered to be a heretical sect by mainstream Muslims and are concentrated in <!--del_lnk--> Makran, <!--del_lnk--> Balochistan.<p>The difference among <!--del_lnk--> Sunni schools (<!--del_lnk--> Hanafi, <!--del_lnk--> Maliki, <!--del_lnk--> Shafi, and <!--del_lnk--> Hanbali) are small and they pray together in any Sunni <a href="../../wp/m/Mosque.htm" title="Mosque">Masjid</a>. In Pakistan, the Sunni Hanafi belonging to <!--del_lnk--> Barelvi and <!--del_lnk--> Deobandi schools also pray together in same Masjids.<p>There are small non-Muslim religious groups: <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christians</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Jews, <!--del_lnk--> Hindus, <!--del_lnk--> Sikhs, <!--del_lnk--> Qadianis, <!--del_lnk--> Parsis, <!--del_lnk--> Bahais and others 3%.

      <p>English is the <!--del_lnk--> official language, being widely used within the government, by the civil service and the officer ranks of the military. Pakistan&#39;s Constitution and laws are written in English. Many schools, and nearly all colleges and universities, use English as the <!--del_lnk--> medium of instruction.<p><a id="Urdu_.28National_Language.29" name="Urdu_.28National_Language.29"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Urdu <i>(National Language)</i></span></h4>
      <p>Urdu is the national language, the lingua franca of the people. It is widely used, both formally and informally, for personal letters as well as public literature, in the literary sphere and in the popular media. It is a required subject of study in all primary and secondary schools. It is the first language of most Muhajirs. Urdu&#39; is Pakistan&#39;s national language and has been promoted as a token of national unity, though less than 8% of Pakistanis speak it as their first language but it is spoken fluently as a second language by all literate Pakistanis. Urdu by origin is an &quot;Islamic version&quot; of Hindi language which was spoken for centuries in the neighbourhood of Delhi and it was known as Western Hindi, Hindvi, Dehlvi, Reekhta and Hindustani. It is written in a modified form of the Arabic alphabet and its basically Indic vocabulary has been enriched by borrowings from Arabic, Persian, English and other Indian languages. Urdu has drawn inspiration from Persian literature and has now an enormous stock of words. The first poetry in Urdu was by the Persian poet <!--del_lnk--> Amir Khusro (1253-1325) and the first Urdu book &quot;Woh Majlis&quot; was written in 1728 and the first time the word &quot;Urdu&quot; was used by Saraj-ud-din Aarzoo in 1751. Urdu was an official language in British India since 1835 and in India since 1947, where it is spoken by Muslim population, is one of the 15 national languages recognized by the constitution.<p><a id="Punjabi_.28Provincial_Language.29" name="Punjabi_.28Provincial_Language.29"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Punjabi <i>(Provincial Language)</i></span></h4>
      <p>Spoken as a first language by ~44% of Pakistanis, mostly in <!--del_lnk--> Punjab, Pakistan as well as by a large number of people in Karachi. It is an important language since Punjabi is spoken by about half of Pakistanis. However, Punjabi does not have any official status in Pakistan. The exact numbers of Punjabi speakers in Pakistan is hard to find since there are many dialects/languages, such as Seraiki, which some regard as part of Punjabi and others regard as separate language. Punjabi is spoken by almost 60% of the population in Pakistan. The standard Punjabi dialects is from Lahore, Sialkot, Gujranwala and Sheikupura districts of the Pakistani Punjab which was used by Waris Shah (1722-1798) in his famous book &quot;Heer&quot; and is also now days langueage of Punjabi literature, film and music; such as Lollywood. Other dialects are Multani or Siraiki in West and South, Pothowari in North, Dogri in the mountain areas and Shahpuri in Sargodha area.<p>Punjabi is very old language and it was known as Sanskrit in Vedic-period (ca 4000 B.C.), Pali, Prakart and Upbharnash in Ashok-period (273-32 B.C.) and Hindvi, Lahori and Multani under Muslim period (711-1857). Punjabi literature was principally spiritual in nature and has had a very rich oral tradition. The Great Sufi/Saint poetry has been the folklore of the Punjab and still sung with great love in any part of Punjab.<p>In India it is the official language of Punjab state and one of the 15 official languages recognized by the Indian constitution. It is also spoken in the neighboring states of Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. In addition about 25 percent of the people living in the New Delhi metropolitan area speak punjabi in everyday life. All told, there are about 25 million speakers in India.<p>Punjabi dialects:<p>Majhi This dialect is &quot;the standard Punjabi language&quot; and spoken in the heart of Punjab where most of the Punjabi population lives. The main districts are Lahore, Sheikhupura, Gujaranwala and Sialkot in Pakistani Punjab and Gurdaspur and Amritsar in Indian Punjab.<p>Jhangvi or Jangli This dialects is spoken in the central Pakistani Punjab, stretches from districts Khanewal to Jhang and includes Faisalabad and Chiniot.<p>Shahpuri This dialect is spoken in Sargodha, Khushab and Mandi Bahawaldin districts.<p>Pothowari The area where Pothowari is spoken extends in the north from Azad Kashmir (Mirpur) to as far south as Jhelum, Gujar Khan, Chakwal and Rawalpindi.<p>Hindko This dialect is spoken in districs of Peshawar, Attock, Nowshehra, Mansehra, Abbotabad and Murree.<p>Malwi Spoken in the eastern part of Indian Punjab. Main districts are Ludhiana, Ambala, Bathinda, Ganganagar, Maleerkotla Fazilka, Ferozepur. Malwa is the southern and central part of present day Indian Punjab. Also includes the Punjabi speaking northern areas of Haryana, viz. Ambala, Hissar, Sirsa, Kurukhetra etc.<p>Doabi The word &quot;Do Aabi&quot; means &quot;the land between two rivers&quot; and this dialect is spoken between the rivers of Beas and Sutlej. It includes Jalandhar and Hoshiarpur districts.<p>Siraiki /Multani Siraiki or Multani (also Lehndi by some) and perhaps differs from Punjabi more than any other dialect. Multani becomes more and more different as you move down south, as the influence of Sindhi increases, it is also known as Siraiki there. Siraiki itself is Sindhi word and means northern. See the map of Siraiki language: Siraiki Area&#39;s City of Mulatn, Bahawalpur, Rahimyar Khan, Rajanpur, Dera Ghazi Khan, Bhakkar, Dera Ismail Khan, Khanewal, Muzafargarh, Sukkur, Jaccobabad, Layyah and Mianwali.<p><a id="Pashto_.28Provincial_Language.29" name="Pashto_.28Provincial_Language.29"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Pashto <i>(Provincial Language)</i></span></h4>
      <p>Spoken as a first language by 15% of Pakistanis, mostly in the <!--del_lnk--> North-West Frontier Province and in <!--del_lnk--> Balochistan as well as by immigrants to the eastern provinces who are often not counted due to census irregularities. Additionally, Afghan refugees are often outside the census count, but appear to be largely Pashto speakers from Afghanistan. Pashto speakers are almost 8% of Pakistani population and more than 30% in Afghanistan. Pashto has no written literary traditions although it has a rich oral tradition. There are two major dialect patterns within which the various individual dialects may be classified; these are Pakhto, which is the northern (Peshawar) variety, and the softer Pashto spoken in southern areas. Khushal Khan Khatak (1613-1689) and Rehman Baba (1633-1708) were some big poets in Pashto language.<p><a id="Sindhi_.28Provincial_Language.29" name="Sindhi_.28Provincial_Language.29"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Sindhi <i>(Provincial Language)</i></span></h4>
      <p>Spoken as a first language by 14% of Pakistanis, mostly in <!--del_lnk--> Sindh. Sindhi has very rich literature and is used in schools. Sindhi language contains Arabic words and is affected by Arabic language to a great extent. The reason being Arab ruled Sindh for more than 150 years. Muhammad bin Qasim entered Sindh and conquered it in 712 AD. He remained here for three years and set up Arabic rule in the area. According to historians, the social fabric of Sindh comprises elements of Arabic society. Sindhi is spoken in Pakistan and is also one of the constitutional languages of India. It is spoken by about 20 million people in the southern Pakistani province of Sindh, Southern Pakistan, and by about 2&frac12; million more across the border in India. In Pakistan it is written in the Arabic script with several additional letters to accommodate special sounds. The largest Sindhi-speaking city is Hyderabad, Pakistan. Sindhi literature is also spiritual in nature and Shah Abdul Latif Bhattai (1689-1752) was one of its legendry poet who wrote Sassi Punnu, Umar Marwi in his famous book &quot;Shah jo Rasalo&quot;.<p><a id="Seraiki" name="Seraiki"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Seraiki</span></h4>
      <p>Related to Punjabi (See Classification, below) Spoken as a first language by 11% of Pakistanis, mostly in the Southern districts of <!--del_lnk--> Punjab, Pakistan (see <!--del_lnk--> Seraikis). All most 10% of the population of Pakistan speak Siraiki language. Dialects tend to blend into each other, into punjabi to the east, and Sindhi to the south. Until recently it was considered to be a dialect of Punajbi. 85% lexical similarity with Sindhi; 68% with Odki and Sansi. Dialects are Derawali, Khatki, Jangli or Jatki and Riasti or Bahawalpuri.<p><a id="Balochi_.28Provincial_Language.29" name="Balochi_.28Provincial_Language.29"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Balochi <i>(Provincial Language)</i></span></h4>
      <p>Spoken as a first language by 4% of Pakistanis, mostly in Balochistan. Sindh and southern Punjab. Baluchi language is spoken by almost 3% of the Pakistani population and is very close to the Persian language itself. The name BALUCHI or BALOCHI is not found before the 10th Century. It is believed that the language was brought to its present location in a series of migrations from Northern Iran, near the Caspian Shores. Rakshani is the major dialect group in terms of numbers. Sarhaddi, is a sub dialect of Rakshani. Other sub - dialects are qalati, Chagai-kharani, Panjguri. Eastern Hill Baluchi or Northern Baluchi is very different from the rest.<p><a id="Gujarati_.28Regional_Language.29" name="Gujarati_.28Regional_Language.29"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Gujarati <i>(Regional Language)</i></span></h4>
