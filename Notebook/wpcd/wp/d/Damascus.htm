      <p>In <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>, the city is called <span class="Unicode" lang="ar-Latn" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="DIN 31635 Arabic" xml:lang="ar-Latn">&#x62F;&#x645;&#x634;&#x642; &#x627;&#x644;&#x634;&#x627;&#x645;</span> <i>Dimashq ash-Sh&#x101;m</i>. Although this is often shortened to either <i>Dimashq</i> or <i>ash-Sh&#x101;m</i> by many, the citizens of Damascus, and of Syria and some other Arab neighbors, colloquially call the city <i>ash-Sh&#x101;m</i>. <i>Ash-Sh&#x101;m</i> is an Arabic term for <!--del_lnk--> north and for Syria. (Syria &mdash; particularly historical <!--del_lnk--> Greater Syria &mdash; is called <i>Bil&#x101;d ash-Sh&#x101;m</i> &mdash; <span class="Unicode" lang="ar-Latn" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="DIN 31635 Arabic" xml:lang="ar-Latn">&#x628;&#x644;&#x627;&#x62F; &#x627;&#x644;&#x634;&#x627;&#x645;</span>, &#39;country of the north&#39; &mdash; in Arabic.) It is possible that the name &#39;Damascus&#39; pre-dates the Aramaic era of the city, as reflected by its <a href="../../wp/h/Hebrew_language.htm" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> name, &#x5D3;&#x5DE;&#x5E9;&#x5E7; (<i>Dame&#x15B;eq</i>).<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>
      <p>Damascus lies about 80 km inland from the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>, sheltered by the <!--del_lnk--> Anti-Lebanon Mountains. It lies on a plateau 680 meters above sea-level.<p>The old city of Damascus, enclosed by the city walls, lies on the south bank of the river <!--del_lnk--> Barada. To the south-east, north and north-east it is surrounded by suburban areas whose history stretches back to the Middle Ages: <!--del_lnk--> Midan in the south-west, <!--del_lnk--> Sarouja and <!--del_lnk--> Imara in the north and north-west. These districts originally arose on roads leading out of the city, near the tombs of religious figures. In the nineteenth century outlying villages developed on the slopes of <!--del_lnk--> Jabal Qasioun, overlooking the city, already the site of the <!--del_lnk--> Salihiyye district centred around the important shrine of Sheikh <!--del_lnk--> Muhi al-Din ibn Arabi. These new districts were initially settled by Kurdish soldiery and Muslim refugees from the European regions of the Ottoman Empire which had fallen under Christian rule Thus they were known as <i>al-Akrad</i> <i>(the Kurds)</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> al-Muhajirin</i> <i>(the migrants)</i>. They lay two to three kilometres north of the old city.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>From the late nineteenth century on, a modern administrative and commercial centre began to spring up to the west of the old city, around the Barada, centred on the area known as <i>al-merjeh</i> or <i>the meadow</i>. <i>Al-Merjeh</i> soon became the name of what was initially the central square of modern Damascus, with the city hall on it. The courts of justice, post office and railway station stood on higher ground slightly to the south. A Europeanised residential quarter soon began to be built on the road leading between al-Merjeh and <!--del_lnk--> Salihiyye. The commercial and administrative centre of the new city gradually shifted northwards slightly towards this area.<p>In the twentieth century, newer suburbs developed north of the Barada, and to some extent to the south, invading the Ghouta oasis. From 1955 the new district of <!--del_lnk--> Yarmouk became a second home to thousands of Palestinian refugees. City planners preferred to preserve the Ghouta as far as possible, and in the later twentieth century some of the main areas of development were to the north, in the western Mezze district and most recently along the Barada valley in Dumar in the northwest and on the slopes of the mountains at Berze in the north-east. Poorer areas, often built without official approval, have mostly developed south of the main city.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Excavations at Tell Ramad on the outskirts of the city have demonstrated that Damascus has been inhabited as early as 8000 to 10,000 BC. It is due to this that Damascus is considered to be the oldest continually inhabited city in the world. However, Damascus is not documented as an important city until the coming of the <!--del_lnk--> Aramaeans, Semitic nomads who arrived from the <!--del_lnk--> Arabian peninsula. It is known that it was the Aramaeans who first established the water distribution system of Damascus by constructing canals and tunnels which maximized the efficiency of the Barada river. The same network was later improved by the Romans and the Umayyads, and still forms the basis of the water system of the old part of Damascus today. It was mentioned in <!--del_lnk--> Genesis 14 as existing at the time of the <!--del_lnk--> War of the Kings, although the historicity of this account has been questioned.<p>Damascus is designated as having been part of the ancient <!--del_lnk--> province of <!--del_lnk--> Amurru in the <!--del_lnk--> Hyksos Kingdom, from 1720 to 1570 BC. (MacMillan, pp. 30-31). Some of the earliest <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">Egyptian</a> records are from the <!--del_lnk--> 1350 BC <!--del_lnk--> Amarna letters, when Damascus-(called <i>Dimasqu</i>) was ruled by king <!--del_lnk--> Biryawaza. In 1100 BC, the city became the centre of a powerful Aramaean state called <!--del_lnk--> Aram Damascus. The Kings of Aram Damascus were involved in many wars in the area against the <!--del_lnk--> Assyrians and the <!--del_lnk--> Israelites. One of the Kings, <!--del_lnk--> Ben-Hadad II, fought <!--del_lnk--> Shalmaneser III at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Qarqar. The ruins of the Aramean town most probably lie under the eastern part of the old walled city. After <!--del_lnk--> Tiglath-Pileser III captured and destroyed the city in <!--del_lnk--> 732 BC, it lost its independence for hundreds of years, and it fell under the <!--del_lnk--> Neo-Babylonian rule of <!--del_lnk--> Nebuchadnezzar starting in 572 BC. The Babylonian rule of the city came to an end in 538 BC when the Persians under <!--del_lnk--> Cyrus captured the city and made it the capital of the Persian province of Syria.<p><a id="Greco-Roman" name="Greco-Roman"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Greco-Roman</span></h3>
      <p>Damascus first came under western control with the giant campaign of <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a> that swept through the near east. After the death of Alexander in 323 BC, Damascus became the site of a struggle between the <!--del_lnk--> Seleucid and <!--del_lnk--> Ptolemaic empires. The control of the city passed frequently from one empire to the other. <!--del_lnk--> Seleucus Nicator, one of Alexander&#39;s generals, had made <!--del_lnk--> Antioch the capital of his vast empire, a decision that led Damascus&#39; importance to decline compared with the newly founded Seleucid cities such as <!--del_lnk--> Latakia in the north.<p>In 64 BC, <!--del_lnk--> Pompey and the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a> annexed the western part of Syria. They occupied Damascus and subsequently incorporated it into the league of ten cities known as the <!--del_lnk--> Decapolis because it was considered such an important centre of Greco-Roman culture. According to the <!--del_lnk--> New Testament, <a href="../../wp/p/Paul_of_Tarsus.htm" title="Paul of Tarsus">St. Paul</a> was on the road to Damascus when he received a vision, was struck blind and as a result converted to <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>. In the year <!--del_lnk--> 37, <!--del_lnk--> Roman Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Caligula transferred Damascus into <!--del_lnk--> Nabataean control by decree. The Nabataean king <!--del_lnk--> Aretas IV Philopatris ruled Damascus from his capital <!--del_lnk--> Petra. However, around the year <!--del_lnk--> 106, Nabataea was conquered by the Romans, and Damascus returned to Roman control.<p>Damascus became a metropolis by the beginning of the second century and in 222 it was upgraded to a <i>colonia</i> by the Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Septimius Severus. With the coming of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Pax Romana</i>, Damascus and the Roman province of Syria in general began to prosper. Damascus&#39;s importance as a caravan city was evident with the trade routes from southern <!--del_lnk--> Arabia, <!--del_lnk--> Palmyra, <!--del_lnk--> Petra, and the silk routes from China all converging on it. The city satisfied the Roman demands for eastern luxuries.<p>Little remains of the architecture of the Romans, but the town planning of the old city did have a lasting effect. The Roman architects brought together the Greek and Aramaean foundations of the city and fused them into a new layout measuring approximately 1500 by 750 meters, surrounded by a city wall. The city wall contained seven gates, but only the eastern gate (Bab Sharqi) remains from the Roman period. Roman Damascus lies mostly at depths of up to five meters below the modern city.<p>According to the 1st century Jewish Historian Flavius Josephus in his twenty-one volume <i>Antiquities of the Jews</i> &quot;Nicolaus of Damascus, in the fourth book of his History, says thus: &quot;Abraham reigned at Damascus, being a foreigner, who came with an army out of the land above Babylon, called the land of the Chaldeans: but, after a long time, he got him up, and removed from that country also, with his people, and went into the land then called the land of Canaan, but now the land of Judea, and this when his posterity were become a multitude; as to which posterity of his, we relate their history in another work. Now the name of Abraham is even still famous in the country of Damascus; and there is shown a village named from him, The Habitation of Abraham.&quot; He is an important source for studies of immediate post-Temple Judaism<p><a id="From_the_Muslim_conquest_to_the_Fatimids" name="From_the_Muslim_conquest_to_the_Fatimids"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">From the Muslim conquest to the Fatimids</span></h3>
      <p>Damascus was conquered by the <!--del_lnk--> Caliph <!--del_lnk--> Umar I in <!--del_lnk--> 636. Immediately thereafter, the city&#39;s power and prestige reached its peak when it became the capital of the <!--del_lnk--> Umayyad Empire, which extended from <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> to <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> from <!--del_lnk--> 661 to <!--del_lnk--> 750. In <!--del_lnk--> 744, the last Umayyad caliph, <!--del_lnk--> Marwan II, moved the capital to <!--del_lnk--> Harran in the <!--del_lnk--> Jazira, and Damascus was never to regain the political prominence it had held in that period.<p>After the fall of the Umayyads and the establishment of the <a href="../../wp/a/Abbasid.htm" title="Abbasid">Abbasid</a> caliphate in <!--del_lnk--> 750, Damascus was ruled from <a href="../../wp/b/Baghdad.htm" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>, although in <!--del_lnk--> 858 <!--del_lnk--> al-Mutawakkil briefly established his residence there with the intention of transferring his capital there from <!--del_lnk--> Samarra. However, he soon abandoned the idea. As the Abbasid caliphate declined, Damascus suffered from the prevailing instability, and came under the control of local dynasties. In <!--del_lnk--> 875 the ruler of Egypt, <!--del_lnk--> Ahmad ibn Tulun, took the city, with Abbasid control being re-established only in <!--del_lnk--> 905. In <!--del_lnk--> 945 the <!--del_lnk--> Hamdanids took Damascus, and not long after it passed into the hands of <!--del_lnk--> Muhammad bin Tughj, founder of the <!--del_lnk--> Ikhshidid dynasty. In <!--del_lnk--> 968 and again in <!--del_lnk--> 971 the city was briefly captured by the <!--del_lnk--> Qaramita.<p><a id="Fatimids.2C_the_Crusades_and_the_Seljuks" name="Fatimids.2C_the_Crusades_and_the_Seljuks"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Fatimids, the Crusades and the Seljuks</span></h3>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 970, the <!--del_lnk--> Fatimid Caliphs in <a href="../../wp/c/Cairo.htm" title="Cairo">Cairo</a> gained control of Damascus. This was to usher in a turbulent period in the city&#39;s history, as the Berber troops who formed the backbone of the Fatimid forces became deeply unpopular among its citizens. The presence in Syria of the Qaramita and occasionally of Turkish military bands added to the constant pressure from the <!--del_lnk--> Bedouin. For a brief period from <!--del_lnk--> 978, Damascus was self-governing, under the leadership of a certain <!--del_lnk--> Qassam and protected by a citizen militia. However, the Ghouta was ravaged by the Bedouin and after a Turkish-led campaign the city once again surrendered to Fatimid rule. From 1029 to 1041 the Turkish military leader <!--del_lnk--> Anushtakin was governor of Damascus under the Fatimid caliph <!--del_lnk--> Al-Zahir, and did much to restore the city&#39;s prosperity.<p>It appears that during this period the slow transformation of Damascus from a Graeco-Roman city layout - characterised by blocks of <i><!--del_lnk--> insulae</i> &mdash; to a more familiar Islamic pattern took place: the grid of straight streets changed to a pattern of narrow streets, with most residents living inside <i>harat</i> closed off at night by heavy wooden gates to protect against criminals and the exactions of the soldiery.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>With the arrival of the <!--del_lnk--> Seljuk Turks in the late 11th century, Damascus again became the capital of independent states. It was ruled by a Seljuk dynasty from 1079 to 1104, and then by another Turkish dynasty - the <!--del_lnk--> Burid Emirs, who withstood a <!--del_lnk--> siege of the city during the <a href="../../wp/s/Second_Crusade.htm" title="Second Crusade">Second Crusade</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1148. In 1154 Damascus was conquered from the Burids by the famous <!--del_lnk--> Zengid Atabeg <!--del_lnk--> Nur ad-Din of <!--del_lnk--> Aleppo, the great foe of the <!--del_lnk--> Crusaders. He made it his capital, and following his death, it was acquired by <a href="../../wp/s/Saladin.htm" title="Saladin">Saladin</a>, the ruler of Egypt, who also made it his capital. Saladin rebuilt the citadel, and it is reported that under his rule the suburbs were as extensive as the city itself. It is reported by <!--del_lnk--> Ibn Jubayr that during the time of Saladin, Damascus welcomed seekers of knowledge and industrious youth from around the world, who arrived for the sake of &quot;undistracted study and seclusion&quot; in Damascus&#39; many colleges.<p>In the years following Saladin&#39;s death, there were frequent conflicts between different <!--del_lnk--> Ayyubid sultans ruling in Damascus and Cairo. <a href="../../wp/d/Damascus_steel.htm" title="Damascus steel">Damascus steel</a> gained a legendary reputation among the <!--del_lnk--> Crusaders, and patterned steel is still &quot;damascened&quot;.

      <p>Ayyubid rule (and independence) came to an end with the Mongol invasion of Syria in <!--del_lnk--> 1260, and Damascus became a provincial capital of the <!--del_lnk--> Mamluk Empire, ruled from Egypt, following the Mongol withdrawal.<p><a id="Timurlank" name="Timurlank"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Timurlank</span></h3>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1400 <a href="../../wp/t/Timur.htm" title="Timur">Timur</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Mongol conqueror, besieged Damascus. The Mamluk sultan dispatched a deputation from Cairo, including <!--del_lnk--> Ibn Khaldun, who negotiated with him, but after their withdrawal he put the city to sack. The Umayyad Mosque was burnt and men and women taken into slavery. A huge number of the city&#39;s artisans were taken to Timur&#39;s capital at <!--del_lnk--> Samarkand. These were the luckier citizens: many were slaughtered and their heads piled up in a field outside the north-east corner of the walls, where a city square still bears the name <i>burj al-ruus</i>, originally &quot;the tower of heads&quot;.<p>Rebuilt, Damascus continued to serve as a Mamluk provincial capital until <!--del_lnk--> 1516.<p><a id="The_Ottoman_conquest" name="The_Ottoman_conquest"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Ottoman conquest</span></h3>

      <p>In early <!--del_lnk--> 1516, the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Turks</a>, wary of the danger of an alliance between the Mamluks and the Persian <!--del_lnk--> Safavids, started a campaign of conquest against the Mamluk sultanate. On <!--del_lnk--> 21 September, the Mamluk governor of Damascus fled the city, and on <!--del_lnk--> 2 October the <!--del_lnk--> khutba in the Umayyad mosque was pronounced in the name of <!--del_lnk--> Selim I. The day after, the victorious sultan entered the city, staying for three months. On <!--del_lnk--> 15 December, he left Damascus by Bab al-Jabiya, intent on the conquest of Egypt. Little appeared to have changed in the city: one army had simply replaced another. However, on his return in October 1517, the sultan ordered the construction of a mosque, <!--del_lnk--> taqiyya and mausoleum at the shrine of Shaikh <!--del_lnk--> Muhi al-Din ibn Arabi in Salihiyya. This was to be the first of Damascus&#39; great Ottoman monuments.<p>The Ottomans remained for the next 400 years, except for a brief occupation by <!--del_lnk--> Ibrahim Pasha of <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> from <!--del_lnk--> 1832 to <!--del_lnk--> 1840. Because of its importance as the point of departure for one of the two great <!--del_lnk--> Hajj caravans to <a href="../../wp/m/Mecca.htm" title="Mecca">Mecca</a>, Damascus was treated with more attention by the <!--del_lnk--> Porte than its size might have warranted &mdash; for most of this period, <!--del_lnk--> Aleppo was more populous and commercially more important. In 1560 the Taqiyya al-Sulaimaniyya, a mosque and <!--del_lnk--> khan for pilgrims on the road to Mecca, was completed to a design by the famous Ottoman architect <!--del_lnk--> Sinan, and soon afterwards a <!--del_lnk--> madrasa was built adjoining it.<p>Perhaps the most notorious incident of these centuries was the massacre of Christians in <!--del_lnk--> 1860, when fighting between <!--del_lnk--> Druze and <!--del_lnk--> Maronites in <!--del_lnk--> Mount Lebanon spilled over into the city. Some thousands of Christians were killed, with many more being saved through the intervention of the Algerian exile <!--del_lnk--> Abd al-Qadir and his soldiers, who brought them to safety in Abd al-Qadir&#39;s residence and the citadel. The Christian quarter of the old city, including a number of churches, was burnt down. The Christian inhabitants of the notoriously poor and refractory Midan district outside the walls were, however, protected by their Muslim neighbours.<p><a id="Rise_of_Arab_nationalism" name="Rise_of_Arab_nationalism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Rise of Arab nationalism</span></h3>
      <p>In the early years of the twentieth century, nationalist sentiment in Damascus, initially cultural in its interest, began to take a political colouring, largely in reaction to the <!--del_lnk--> turkicisation programme of the <!--del_lnk--> Committee of Union and Progress government established in Istanbul in <!--del_lnk--> 1908. The hanging of a number of patriotic intellectuals by <!--del_lnk--> Jamal Pasha, governor of Damascus, in Beirut and Damascus in <!--del_lnk--> 1915 and <!--del_lnk--> 1916 further stoked nationalist feeling, and in <!--del_lnk--> 1918, as the forces of the <!--del_lnk--> Arab Revolt and the <!--del_lnk--> British army approached, residents fired on the retreating Turkish troops.<p><a id="Modern" name="Modern"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Modern</span></h3>

A military government under <!--del_lnk--> Shukri Pasha was named. Other British forces including <!--del_lnk--> T. E. Lawrence followed later that day, and <!--del_lnk--> Faisal ibn Hussein was proclaimed king of Syria. Political tension rose in November 1917, when the new <!--del_lnk--> Bolshevik government in <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> revealed the <!--del_lnk--> Sykes-Picot Agreement whereby Britain and France had arranged to partition the Arab east between them. A new Franco-British proclamation on 17 November promised the &quot;complete and definitive freeing of the peoples so long oppressed by the Turks.&quot; The <!--del_lnk--> Syrian Congress in March adopted a democratic constitution. However, the <!--del_lnk--> Versailles Conference had granted <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> a <!--del_lnk--> mandate over Syria, and in 1920 a French army crossed the Anti-Lebanon Mountains, defeated a small Syrian defensive expedition at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Maysalun and entered Damascus.

The area of the old city between <!--del_lnk--> Souk al-Hamidiyya and Souk Midhat Pasha was burned to the ground, with many deaths, and has since then been known as <i>al-Hariqa</i> (&quot;the fire&quot;). The old city was surrounded with barbed wire to prevent rebels infiltrating from the Ghouta, and a new road was built outside the northern ramparts to facilitate the movement of armoured cars.<p>In 1945 the French once more bombed Damascus, but on this occasion British forces intervened and the French agreed to withdraw, thus leading to the full independence of Syria in <!--del_lnk--> 1946.

      <p>Damascus has a wealth of historical sites dating back to many different periods of the city&#39;s history. Since the city has been built up with every passing occupation, it has become almost impossible to excavate all the ruins of Damascus that lie up to 8 feet below the modern level. The Citadel of Damascus is located in the northwest corner of the Old City. The <i>street called straight</i> (referred to in the conversion of <a href="../../wp/p/Paul_of_Tarsus.htm" title="Paul of Tarsus">St. Paul</a> in <!--del_lnk--> Acts 9:11), also known as the <i>Via Recta</i>, was the <!--del_lnk--> decumanus (East-West main street) of Roman Damascus, and extended for over 1500 meters. Today, it consists of the street of Bab Sharqi and the Souk Medhat Pasha, a covered market. The Bab Sharqi street is filled with small shops and leads to the old Christian quarter of Bab Touma (St. Thomas&#39;s Gate). Souq Medhat Pasha is also a main market in Damascus and was named after Medhat Pasha, the Ottoman governor of Damascus who renovated the Souq. At the end of the Bab Sharqi street, one reaches the House of <!--del_lnk--> Ananias, an underground chapel that was the cellar of Ananias&#39;s house.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Umayyad Mosque, also known as the Grand Mosque of Damascus, is one of the largest mosques in the world, and one of the oldest sites of continuous prayer since the rise of Islam. A shrine in the mosque is said to contain the head of <!--del_lnk--> John the Baptist.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The old city of Damascus is surrounded by ramparts on the northern and eastern sides and part of the southern side. There are eight extant city gates, the oldest of which dates back to the Roman period. These are, clockwise from the north of the citadel:<ul>
       <li>Bab al-Faraj (&quot;the gate of deliverance&quot;),<li>Bab al-Faradis (&quot;the gate of the orchards&quot;, or &quot;of the paradise&quot;)<li>Bab al-Salam (&quot;the gate of peace&quot;), all on the north boundary of the old city<li>Bab Touma (the &quot;Touma&quot; or &quot;Thomas gate&quot;) in the north-east corner, leading into the Christian quarter of the same name,<li>Bab Sharqi (&quot;eastern gate&quot;) in the east wall, the only one to retain its Roman plan<li>Bab Kisan in the south-east, from which tradition holds that Saint Paul made his escape from Damascus, lowered from the ramparts in a basket; this gate is now closed and a chapel marking the event has been built into the structure,<li>al-Bab al-Saghir (the small gate) in the south.<li>Bab al-Jabiya at the entrance to Souq Midhat Pasha, in the south-west.</ul>
