      <p><b>Sir David Frederick Attenborough</b>, <!--del_lnk--> OM, <!--del_lnk--> CH, <!--del_lnk--> CVO, <!--del_lnk--> CBE, <!--del_lnk--> FRS (born on <!--del_lnk--> May 8, <!--del_lnk--> 1926 in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>) is one of the world&#39;s best known <a href="../../wp/b/Broadcasting.htm" title="Broadcasting">broadcasters</a> and <!--del_lnk--> naturalists. Widely considered one of the pioneers of the <!--del_lnk--> nature documentary, he has written and presented eight major series (with a ninth in production) surveying nearly every aspect of life on Earth. He is also a former senior manager at the <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a>, having served as controller of <!--del_lnk--> BBC2 and director of programming for BBC Television in the 1960s and 1970s.<p>He is the younger brother of director and actor <!--del_lnk--> Richard Attenborough.<p>

      <p>Attenborough grew up in College House on the campus of <!--del_lnk--> University College, Leicester, where his father, <!--del_lnk--> Frederick, was <!--del_lnk--> principal.  He was the middle of three sons. During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> his parents also adopted two <!--del_lnk--> Jewish refugee girls from Europe.<p>Attenborough spent his childhood collecting <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil.htm" title="Fossil">fossils</a>, <!--del_lnk--> stones and other natural specimens. He received encouragement in this pursuit at age 7, when a young <!--del_lnk--> Jacquetta Hawkes admired his &#39;museum.&#39; A few years later, one of his adoptive sisters gave him a piece of <a href="../../wp/a/Amber.htm" title="Amber">amber</a> filled with prehistoric creatures; some 50 years later, this amber would be the focus of his programme &quot;The Amber Time Machine&quot;.<p>Attenborough was educated at <!--del_lnk--> Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys in <a href="../../wp/l/Leicester.htm" title="Leicester">Leicester</a> and then won a scholarship to <!--del_lnk--> Clare College, <a href="../../wp/u/University_of_Cambridge.htm" title="University of Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>, where he obtained a degree in Natural Sciences. In <!--del_lnk--> 1947, he was called up for <!--del_lnk--> National Service in the <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Navy.htm" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> and spent two years stationed in <!--del_lnk--> North Wales and the <!--del_lnk--> Firth of Forth.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1950, Attenborough married Jane Elizabeth Ebsworth Oriel; the marriage lasted until her death in <!--del_lnk--> 1997. The couple had two children, Robert and Susan.<p><a id="First_years_at_the_BBC" name="First_years_at_the_BBC"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">First years at the BBC</span></h2>
      <p>After leaving the Navy, Attenborough took a position editing children&#39;s science textbooks for a publishing company. He soon became disillusioned with the work, however, and in 1950 he applied for a job as a radio talks producer with the <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a>. Although he was rejected for this job, his CV later attracted the interest of <!--del_lnk--> Mary Adams, head of the &quot;talks&quot; (factual broadcasting) department of the BBC&#39;s fledging <a href="../../wp/t/Television.htm" title="Television">television</a> service. Attenborough, like most Britons at that time, did not own a television, and he had seen only one programme in his life. However, he accepted Adams&#39; offer of a three-month training course, and in 1952 he joined the BBC full time. Initially discouraged from appearing on camera because Adams thought his teeth were too big, he became a producer for the Talks Department, which handled all non-fiction broadcasts. His early projects included the quiz show <i>Animal, Vegetable, Mineral?</i> and a series about <a href="../../wp/f/Folk_music.htm" title="Folk music">folk music</a> presented by <!--del_lnk--> Alan Lomax.<p>Attenborough&#39;s association with <!--del_lnk--> natural history programmes began when he produced and presented the three-part series <i>The Pattern of Animals.</i> The studio-bound programme featured animals from <a href="../../wp/l/London_Zoo.htm" title="London Zoo">London Zoo</a>, with the naturalist <!--del_lnk--> Sir Julian Huxley discussing their use of <!--del_lnk--> camouflage, <!--del_lnk--> aposematism and courtship displays. Through this programme, Attenborough met Jack Lester, the curator of the zoo&#39;s <a href="../../wp/r/Reptile.htm" title="Reptile">reptile</a> house, and they decided to make a series about an animal-collecting expedition. The result was <i><!--del_lnk--> Zoo Quest</i>, first broadcast in <!--del_lnk--> 1954.<p><a id="BBC_administration" name="BBC_administration"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">BBC administration</span></h2>
      <p>From 1965 to 1969 Attenborough was Controller of <!--del_lnk--> BBC2. Among the programmes he commissioned during this time were <i><!--del_lnk--> Match of the Day</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Civilisation</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Ascent of Man</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Likely Lads</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Not Only... But Also</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Man Alive</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Masterclass</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Old Grey Whistle Test</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Money Programme</i>. He also initiated televised <!--del_lnk--> snooker. This diversity of programme types reflects Attenborough&#39;s belief that BBC2&#39;s output should be as varied as possible. In 1967, under his watch, BBC2 became the first television channel in the United Kingdom to broadcast in colour.<p>From <!--del_lnk--> 1969 to <!--del_lnk--> 1972 he was BBC Television&#39;s Director of Programmes (making him responsible overall for both <!--del_lnk--> BBC1 and BBC2), but turned down the offer to become <!--del_lnk--> Director General of the BBC. In 1972 he resigned his post and returned to programme making.<p><a id="Major_series" name="Major_series"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Major series</span></h2>
      <p>Foremost among Attenborough&#39;s TV documentary work as writer and presenter is the &#39;Life&#39; series, which begins with the trilogy: <i><a href="../../wp/o/Organism.htm" title="Life on Earth">Life on Earth</a></i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Living Planet</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Trials of Life</i>. These examine the world&#39;s organisms from the viewpoints of <!--del_lnk--> taxonomy, <a href="../../wp/e/Ecology.htm" title="Ecology">ecology</a> and stages of life respectively.<p>They were followed by more specialised surveys: <i><!--del_lnk--> Life in the Freezer</i> (about <a href="../../wp/a/Antarctica.htm" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>), <i><!--del_lnk--> The Private Life of Plants</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Life of Birds</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Life of Mammals</i> and his most recent, <i><!--del_lnk--> Life in the Undergrowth</i>, which concerned terrestrial invertebrates. <i><!--del_lnk--> Life in Cold Blood</i> (dealing with reptiles and <!--del_lnk--> amphibians) is currently in production and due for completion in <!--del_lnk--> 2008. The &#39;Life&#39; series as a whole currently comprises 74 programmes.<p>Attenborough has also written and/or presented other shorter productions. One of the first after his return to programme-making was <i>The Tribal Eye</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1976), which enabled him to expand on his interest in tribal art. Others include <i>The First Eden</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1987), about man&#39;s relationship with the natural habitats of the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean</a>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Lost Worlds, Vanished Lives</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1989), which demonstrated Attenborough&#39;s passion for discovering <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil.htm" title="Fossil">fossils</a>. In <!--del_lnk--> 2000, <i><!--del_lnk--> State of the Planet</i> examined the environmental crisis that threatens the ecology of the Earth. The naturalist also narrated two other significant series: <i><!--del_lnk--> The Blue Planet</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 2001) and <i><!--del_lnk--> Planet Earth</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 2006). The latter is the first natural history series to be made entirely in <!--del_lnk--> high-definition.<p>In May&ndash;June 2006, the BBC broadcast a major two-part environmental documentary as part of its &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Climate Chaos&quot; season of programmes on <a href="../../wp/g/Global_warming.htm" title="Global warming">global warming</a>. In <i><!--del_lnk--> Are We Changing Planet Earth?</i> and <i>Can We Save Planet Earth?</i>, Attenborough investigated the subject and put forward some potential solutions. He returned to the locations of some of his past productions and discovered the effect that climate change has had on them.<p><i>Life in Cold Blood</i> is intended to be Attenborough&#39;s last major series. In an interview to promote <i>Life in the Undergrowth</i>, he stated:<blockquote>
       <p>&quot;Once I have completed the reptiles series [...] that will be enough. It would complete the survey for me. I will have given a series to every group of animals and when that is done there would be 100 or so hours of DVDs on the shelf.&quot;</blockquote>
      <p>However, in a subsequent interview with <i><!--del_lnk--> Radio Times</i>, he said that he did not intend to retire completely and would probably continue to make occasional one-off programmes.<p><a id="Other_work" name="Other_work"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Other work</span></h2>
      <p>In 1975, the naturalist presented a BBC children&#39;s series entitled <i>Fabulous Animals</i>. This represented a diversion from Attenborough&#39;s usual fare, as it dealt with the creatures of myths and legends, such as the <!--del_lnk--> griffin and <!--del_lnk--> kraken. It was a studio-based production, with the presenter describing his subjects with the aid of large, ornately illustrated books.<p>From 1997 to 2005, Attenborough also narrated the long-running half-hour nature series <i><!--del_lnk--> Wildlife on One</i> on <!--del_lnk--> BBC One (variously retitled <i>Wildlife on Two</i>, <i>BBC Wildlife</i> and <i>Natural World</i> depending on the channel on which it is repeated), though his role has mainly been to introduce or narrate other people&#39;s film, and he rarely appears on camera.<p>Attenborough also serves on the advisory board of <i>BBC Wildlife</i> magazine.<p><a id="Achievements.2C_awards_and_recognition" name="Achievements.2C_awards_and_recognition"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Achievements, awards and recognition</span></h2>

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> 13 July <!--del_lnk--> 2006, Attenborough, along with his brother Richard, were awarded the titles of <!--del_lnk--> Distinguished Honorary Fellows of the University of Leicester &quot;in recognition of a record of continuing distinguished service to the University.&quot;  David Attenborough was previously awarded an <!--del_lnk--> Honorary <!--del_lnk--> Doctor of Letters degree by the university in 1970. <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1993, after discovering that the <!--del_lnk--> Mesozoic <a href="../../wp/r/Reptile.htm" title="Reptile">reptile</a> <i>Plesiosaurus conybeari</i> had not, in fact, been a true <a href="../../wp/p/Plesiosaur.htm" title="Plesiosaur">plesiosaur</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> paleontologist <!--del_lnk--> Robert Bakker renamed the species <i>Attenborosaurus conybeari</i> in Attenborough&#39;s honour. <p>Out of four <!--del_lnk--> extant species of <!--del_lnk--> echidna, one is named after him: <!--del_lnk--> Sir David&#39;s Long-beaked Echidna, <i>Zaglossus attenboroughi</i>, which inhabits the Cyclops mountains in the <!--del_lnk--> Papua province of <!--del_lnk--> New Guinea.<p>In June <!--del_lnk--> 2004, Attenborough and Sir <!--del_lnk--> Peter Scott were jointly profiled in the second of a three part BBC Two series, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Way We Went Wild</i>, about television wildlife presenters. Part three also featured Attenborough extensively. The next month, another BBC Two programme, <i>Attenborough the Controller</i>, recalled his time as Director of Programmes for BBC2.<p>In November 2005, London&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Natural History Museum announced a fundraising campaign to build a communications centre in Attenborough&#39;s honour. The museum intends to open the Sir David Attenborough Studio in 2008.<p>An <!--del_lnk--> opinion poll of 4900 Britons conducted by <i><!--del_lnk--> Reader&#39;s Digest</i> in 2006 showed Attenborough to be the most trusted celebrity in Britain. In a list compiled by the magazine <i><!--del_lnk--> New Statesman</i> in 2006, he was voted tenth in the list of &quot;Heroes of our time&quot;.<p>It is often suggested that David Attenborough&#39;s 50-year career at the BBC making natural history documentaries and travelling extensively throughout the world, has probably made him the most travelled person on Earth ever.<p>His contribution to broadcasting was recognised by the 60-minute documentary <i>Life on Air</i>, transmitted in 2002 to tie in with the publication of Attenborough&#39;s similarly titled autobiography. For the programme, the naturalist was interviewed at his home by his friend <!--del_lnk--> Michael Palin (someone who is almost as well-travelled). Attenborough&#39;s reminiscences are interspersed with memorable clips from his series, with contributions from his brother Richard as well as professional colleagues. <i>Life on Air</i> is available on DVD as part of <i>Attenborough in Paradise and Other Personal Voyages</i>.<p><a id="Favourite_Attenborough_moments" name="Favourite_Attenborough_moments"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Favourite Attenborough moments</span></h3>

      <p>Attenborough&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> accent and hushed, excited delivery have been the subject of frequent <!--del_lnk--> parodies by <!--del_lnk--> comedians, most notably <!--del_lnk--> Spike Milligan, <!--del_lnk--> Marty Feldman and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Goodies</i>. Especially apt for spoofing is Attenborough&#39;s pronunciation of the word &#39;here&#39; when using it to introduce a sentence, as in, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> He-eah, in the rain forest of the Amazon Basin...&quot;<p>Attenborough also appears as a character in <!--del_lnk--> David Ives&#39; play <i>Time Flies</i>, a comedy focusing on a romance between two <!--del_lnk--> mayflies.<p><a id="Views_and_advocacy" name="Views_and_advocacy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Views and advocacy</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Environmental_causes" name="Environmental_causes"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Environmental causes</span></h3>
      <p>From the beginning, Attenborough&#39;s major series have included some content regarding the impact of human society on the natural world. The last episode of <i>The Living Planet</i>, for example, focuses almost entirely on man&#39;s destruction of the environment and ways that it could be stopped or reversed. Despite this, his programmes have been criticised for not making their environmental message more explicit. Some <!--del_lnk--> environmentalists feel that programmes like Attenborough&#39;s give a false picture of idyllic wilderness and do not do enough to acknowledge that such areas are increasingly encroached upon by humans.<p>However, his closing message from <i>State of the Planet</i> was forthright:<blockquote>
       <p>&quot;The future of life on earth depends on our ability to take action. Many individuals are doing what they can, but real success can only come if there&#39;s a change in our societies and our economics and in our politics. I&#39;ve been lucky in my lifetime to see some of the greatest spectacles that the natural world has to offer. Surely we have a responsibility to leave for future generations a planet that is healthy, inhabitable by all species.&quot;</blockquote>
      <p>Since the 1980s, Attenborough has become increasingly outspoken in support of environmental causes. In <!--del_lnk--> 2005 and <!--del_lnk--> 2006 he backed a <!--del_lnk--> BirdLife International project to stop the killing of <a href="../../wp/a/Albatross.htm" title="Albatross">albatross</a> by longline fishing boats. He gave public support to <!--del_lnk--> WWF&#39;s campaign to have 220,000 square kilometres of <!--del_lnk--> Borneo&#39;s <a href="../../wp/r/Rainforest.htm" title="Rainforest">rainforest</a> designated a protected area. He also serves as a vice-president of <!--del_lnk--> Fauna and Flora International. In 2003 he launched an appeal to create a rainforest reserve in Ecuador in memory of Christopher Parsons OBE, the producer of <i>Life on Earth</i> and a personal friend, who had died the previous year. He later became Patron of the World Land Trust, and an active supporter.<p>Attenborough has repeatedly said that he considers human <!--del_lnk--> overpopulation to be the root cause of many environmental problems. Both his series <i>The Life of Mammals</i> and the accompanying book end with a plea for humans to curb population growth so that other species will not be crowded out.<p>He has recently written and spoken publicly about the fact that he now believes global warming is definitely real, and caused by humans. At the climax of the aforementioned &quot;Climate Chaos&quot; documentaries, the naturalist gives this summing up of his findings:<blockquote>
       <p>&quot;In the past, we didn&#39;t understand the effect of our actions. Unknowingly, we sowed the wind and now, literally, we are reaping the whirlwind. But we no longer have that excuse: now we do recognise the consequences of our behaviour. Now surely, we must act to reform it: individually and collectively; nationally and internationally &mdash; or we doom future generations to catastrophe.&quot;</blockquote>
      <p>In a 2005 interview with <i>BBC Wildlife</i> magazine, Attenborough said he considered <a href="../../wp/g/George_W._Bush.htm" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> to be the era&#39;s top &quot;environmental villain&quot;.<p><a id="Other_causes" name="Other_causes"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other causes</span></h3>
      <p>In May 2005, Attenborough was appointed as patron of the UK&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Blood Pressure Association, which provides information and support to people with <!--del_lnk--> hypertension. <p><a id="Religion_and_creationism" name="Religion_and_creationism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Religion and creationism</span></h3>
      <p>In a December 2005 interview with <!--del_lnk--> Simon Mayo on <!--del_lnk--> BBC Radio Five Live, Attenborough stated that he considers himself an <!--del_lnk--> agnostic. When asked whether his observation of the natural world has given him faith in a creator, he generally responds with some version of this story:<blockquote>
       <p>&quot;My response is that when Creationists talk about God creating every individual species as a separate act, they always instance hummingbirds, or orchids, sunflowers and beautiful things. But I tend to think instead of a parasitic worm that is boring through the eye of a boy sitting on the bank of a river in West Africa, [a worm] that&#39;s going to make him blind. And [I ask them], &#39;Are you telling me that the God you believe in, who you also say is an all-merciful God, who cares for each one of us individually, are you saying that God created this worm that can live in no other way than in an innocent child&#39;s eyeball? Because that doesn&#39;t seem to me to coincide with a God who&#39;s full of mercy.&quot;</blockquote>
      <p>He has explained that he feels the evidence all over the planet clearly shows evolution to be the best way to explain the diversity of life, and that &quot;as far as I&#39;m concerned, if there is a supreme being then He chose organic evolution as a way of bringing into existence the natural world.&quot;<p>Attenborough&#39;s documentaries exposed millions to the diversity of life on Earth, including, of course, viewers who subscribe to the belief that all life was spontaneously created by <a href="../../wp/g/God.htm" title="God">God</a>, known as <a href="../../wp/c/Creationism.htm" title="Creationism">creationism</a>. In his series, Attenborough rarely explicitly speaks about the mechanisms of <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">evolution</a>, except in <i>Life on Earth</i>, which was an entire series that was specifically devoted to it. Instead, he describes the advantages of each adaptation in high detail &mdash; why flowers are shaped in a certain way, why birds and animals migrate, how mechanisms of <!--del_lnk--> mimicry can serve as protection or to attract insects and animals, and so forth. As such, his work has been cited by some creationists as exemplary in that it does not &quot;shove evolution down the viewer&#39;s throat&quot;. Others have written to Attenborough and asked him to clearly refer to God as the creator of life.<p>In 2002, Attenborough joined an effort by leading clerics and scientists to oppose the inclusion of creationism in the curriculum of UK state-funded independent schools which receive private sponsorship, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Emmanuel Schools Foundation. One of Attenborough&#39;s more recent TV series, <i>The Life of Mammals</i>, makes numerous direct references to evolution, in particular that of <!--del_lnk--> humans.<p><a id="Work" name="Work"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Work</span></h2>
