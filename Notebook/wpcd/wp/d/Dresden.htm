      <p><b>Dresden</b> (<i><!--del_lnk--> Sorbian: Drje&#x17E;d&#x17A;any</i>; etymologically from Old Sorbian <i>Dre&#x17E;&#x10F;any</i>, meaning <i>people of the riverside forest</i>) is the <!--del_lnk--> capital city of the <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">German</a> Federal <!--del_lnk--> Free State of Saxony. It is situated in a valley on the <a href="../../wp/r/River.htm" title="River">River</a> <!--del_lnk--> Elbe. The city&#39;s population is 500,000 (2006) and the population in <!--del_lnk--> greater Dresden is 1.1 million. Dresden is part of the <!--del_lnk--> Saxon Triangle <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan area, with an overall population of over 3.2 million.<p>Dresden has a long history as the capital and royal residence for the <!--del_lnk--> Kings of Saxony, who for centuries furnished the city with extraordinary cultural and artistic splendor. The controversial <!--del_lnk--> Bombing of Dresden in World War II and 40 years of <!--del_lnk--> GDR changed the face of the city dramatically.<p>Since German re-unification, Dresden has been a cultural, political, and economic centre in the eastern part of the Federal Republic of Germany.<p>

      <p>Dresden lies on both banks of the river Elbe, mostly in the Dresden Elbe Valley Basin, with the further reaches of the eastern <!--del_lnk--> Ore Mountains to the south, the steep slope of the <!--del_lnk--> Lusatian granitic crust to the north and the <!--del_lnk--> Elbe Sandstone Mountains to the east at an altitude of about 113 meters. The northern parts of Dresden are in the West Lusatian highlands (Westlausiter Berg- und H&uuml;gelland). The depth influx valleys and the higher areas in the south of Dresden characterise the change to the eastern foothills of the Ore Mountains. The Elbe valley basin is a part of the Saxon <!--del_lnk--> Elbe Landscape. The highest point of Dresden is the Triebenberg, at about 384 meters in altitude. With a pleasant location and a mild climate on the Elbe, as well as Mediterranean architecture, Dresden was given the sobriquet &quot;Elbflorenz&quot; (Florence of the Elbe).<p>After a series of incorporation of larger country communities in the past, Dresden became the fourth largest city in area in Germany. Only <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin.htm" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>, <a href="../../wp/h/Hamburg.htm" title="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Cologne.htm" title="Cologne">Cologne</a> are larger in area.<p>The most important river in Dresden is the <!--del_lnk--> Elbe river, the only navigable body of water to flow through the city. There are also a number of tributaries such as the river <!--del_lnk--> Wei&szlig;eritz.<p><a id="Surroundings" name="Surroundings"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Surroundings</span></h3>

      <p>Due to the many rural districts it has incorporated, among other things, Dresden is one of the greenest cities in Europe, with 63% of the city being green areas and forests. The Dresden Heathland (&quot;Dresdner Heide&quot;) in the north of Dresden is a cohesive forest of 50 km&sup2; in size. There are four nature reserves in Dresden. The additional Special Areas of Conservation cover an area of 18 km&sup2;. The protected gardens, parkways, parks and old graveyards host 110 natural monuments in the city. The <!--del_lnk--> Dresden Elbe Valley is a world heritage site which is focused on the conservation of the cultural landscape in Dresden. One important part of that landscape is the Elbe meadows which cross the city, 20 kilometre long.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>

      <p>Most of the city is in the Elbe valley, where the micro-climate differs from that on the slopes and in the highlands. Klotzsche, at 227 metres above sea level, is one of the higher districts of the city. Klotzsche hosts Dresden weather station. According to experience, the weather in Klotzsche is about 1&deg; to 2&deg; Celsius colder than the inner city&#39;s climate. The average temperature in January is -0.7&deg; Celsius and in July 18&deg; Celsius. Summers are hotter in Dresden and winters are colder than the German average. Dresden lies in a climate zone of cold-moderate climate crossing over to a continental climate. The inner city&#39;s average monthly temperatures are almost the same as those in cities in southwest Germany. In hot summers, Dresden is between the hot Lusatia and the milder Ore Mountains. Both regions are characterised by strong winters: temperatures of -20&deg; Celsius are not unusual in Dresden. The driest months are February and March, with precipitation of 40 mm. Spring months have often been arid in the last couple of years (with less than 10 mm of precipitation). The most precipitation falls in July and August, at 60 mm.<p><a id="Flood_protection" name="Flood_protection"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Flood protection</span></h3>

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Due to its location on the banks of the Elbe and where some water sources from the Ore Mountains flow to, flood protection is an important aspect of the city&#39;s development. Large areas are kept free of buildings to provide a floodplain. Two additional trenches of about 50 metres in width have been built to keep the inner city free of water from the Elbe river by dissipate the water downstream the inner city&#39;s gorge portion. Flood regulation systems like <!--del_lnk--> detention basins and <!--del_lnk--> water reservoirs are almost all outside the city area.<p>However many locations and areas have to be defended by walls and sheet pilings. A number of districts in Dresden become waterlocked if the Elbe river is flooding some of its old <!--del_lnk--> bayous.<p><a id="City_structuring" name="City_structuring"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">City structuring</span></h3>

      <p>Dresden is a spacious city, not only due to the most recent incorporations in the 1990s. The districts of the city differ in their structure and appearance. Many parts of city still contain an old village core, while some quarters are almost completely preserved as rural settings. Other characteristic kinds of urban areas are the historic outskirts of the city, the former suburbs with dotted housing. In Socialist times a lot of apartment blocks were built . Not unsurprisingly, the districts in Dresden are a mix of all these kinds of area.<p>The original parts of the city are almost all in the districts of Altstadt (Old town) and Neustadt (New town). Growing outside the city walls, the historic outskirts were built in the 18th century. They were planned and constructed on the instruction of the Saxon monarchs, which is why the outskirts are often named after the sovereigns. From the 19th century the city only grew by incorporating other districts. Dresden was divided into the five city districts &quot;Mitte&quot; (centre), &quot;Ost&quot; (east), &quot;West&quot;, &quot;S&uuml;d&quot; (south) and &quot;Nord&quot; (north) between 1958 and 1991.<p>Since 1991 Dresden has been divided into ten districts called &quot;Ortsamtsbereich&quot; and nine former boroughs (&quot;Ortschaften&quot;) which have been incorporated. An &quot;Ortsamtsbereich&quot; hosts subunits of the Dresden community&#39;s political and administrative institutions. The &quot;Ortschaften&quot; are granted a higher degree of political self-rule. The district with the largest population is Blasewitz; the largest in area is Loschwitz. The largest &quot;Ortschaft&quot; is Sch&ouml;nfeld-Wei&szlig;ig covering an area called &quot;Sch&ouml;nfelder Hochland&quot; (Highlands of Sch&ouml;nfeld). The inner city includes the districts of Altstadt and Neustadt.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>An ancient <!--del_lnk--> Slavic settlement known as <b>Dre&#x17E;&#x10F;any</b> (&quot;<!--del_lnk--> alluvial forest dwellers&quot;) on the northern bank of the river was joined in <!--del_lnk--> 1206 by a German town on the southern bank, the heart of the present day <i>Altstadt</i> (&quot;old town&quot;), while the Slavic part is called Neustadt (&quot;new town&quot;). The founder of the city was <!--del_lnk--> Dietrich, Margrave of Meissen.<p>Since <!--del_lnk--> 1270, starting with <!--del_lnk--> Henry the Illustrious, Dresden became the capital of the margravate. After his death, however, the city became the property of the <!--del_lnk--> King of Bohemia and , later, the Margraves of <!--del_lnk--> Brandenburg. It was restored to the <!--del_lnk--> Wettin dynasty in about <!--del_lnk--> 1319. From <!--del_lnk--> 1485 it was the seat of the <!--del_lnk--> dukes of Saxony, and from <!--del_lnk--> 1547 the <!--del_lnk--> electors as well.<p>From <!--del_lnk--> 1697-<!--del_lnk--> 1706 and <!--del_lnk--> 1709-<!--del_lnk--> 1733 <!--del_lnk--> Elector Frederick Augustus I ruled from Dresden as King <!--del_lnk--> August the Strong of <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Poland</a>; the city is also known as <b>Drezno</b> in Poland. Because he planned to make Dresden the most important royal residence, Augustus set out to discover the <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">Chinese</a> secret of <!--del_lnk--> porcelain (&lsquo;white gold&#39;); under his rule, European porcelain was invented in Dresden and Mei&szlig;en. He gathered many of the best <!--del_lnk--> architects and <!--del_lnk--> painters from all over Europe to Dresden; the city also experienced a vibrant blossoming of musical life at this time, particularly under the direction of <!--del_lnk--> Johann Adolph Hasse. His reign marked the beginning of Dresden&#39;s emergence as a leading European city for technology and art. His son Frederick August II also reigned from Dresden as <!--del_lnk--> Augustus III of Poland from <!--del_lnk--> 1734-<!--del_lnk--> 1763: during his reign the city was seat of a <!--del_lnk--> treaty that ended the <!--del_lnk--> Second Silesian War, and suffered heavy destructions in the <!--del_lnk--> Seven Years&#39; War (<!--del_lnk--> 1756-1763).<p>Between <!--del_lnk--> 1806 and <!--del_lnk--> 1918 the city was the capital of the Kingdom of Saxony (which was a part of the <!--del_lnk--> German Empire from <!--del_lnk--> 1871). During the <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleonic_Wars.htm" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> the <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleon_I_of_France.htm" title="Napoleon">French emperor</a> made it his base of operation, winning here a famous <!--del_lnk--> battle on <!--del_lnk--> August 27 of that year.<p>During the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a>, the city became a major center of industry, including automobile production, food processing, and the production of medical equipment. The city also developed into an important centre for the international sale of art works and antiques. The city&#39;s population quadrupled from 95,000 in <!--del_lnk--> 1849 to 396,000 in <!--del_lnk--> 1900 as a result of industrialization.<p>In the early <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a> Dresden was particularly well-known for its camera works, such as <!--del_lnk--> Ihagee and Pentacon, which produced the <!--del_lnk--> Praktica, and the cigarette factories, one of which was in the impressive <i>Yenidze</i>, a building with a multicoloured glass roof shaped like a mosque which still stands today.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The city has suffered repeated destruction: by fire in <!--del_lnk--> 1491, from bombardment by the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Prussia in <!--del_lnk--> 1760, and during the suppression of the <!--del_lnk--> constitutionalist <!--del_lnk--> May Uprising in <!--del_lnk--> 1849 and the destructive Allied bombing raid of February <!--del_lnk--> 1945.<p><a id="World_War_II" name="World_War_II"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">World War II</span></h3>
      <p>The city was bombed by Allied forces in the early hours of <!--del_lnk--> Valentine&#39;s Day, 13-14 February 1945. The Altstadt (&quot;old town&quot;) side of the <!--del_lnk--> Elbe River, full of cultural treasures, was the most damaged. Because the raging fires stopped at the river, the newer Neustadt (&quot;new town&quot;) sustained less damage and became the older side of modern-day Dresden.<p>To the Allies, Dresden was 22nd on the RAF&#39;s list of top 100 military/industrial targets, and had a rail network which had been virtually untouched up to that point in the war. The German forces, however, fortified the city poorly, believing it strategically unimportant. Early in the war it had been considered too distant for the <!--del_lnk--> Allied bombers to reach in safety, but even after it had been bombed the majority of Dresden&#39;s anti-aircraft defenses were redeployed elsewhere in Germany.<p>Dresden&#39;s reputation for culture is better known than its highly developed optics industry. Dresden was the home of <!--del_lnk--> Zeiss Ikon (which became <!--del_lnk--> Praktica), for example. Optics factories in Dresden produced precision aiming devices during the war. In addition many peacetime factories, such as the cigarette factories, had been converted to ammunition factories as part of the policy of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> total war&quot;. These factories employed mainly local workers but also used Jewish slave labor. Some 300 Jews were kept as slave laborers at a camp in Dresden, of these the majority were killed before the war ended, along with almost all of the 6,000 Jews who lived in Dresden before the war (a famous survivor was Dresden native and writer <!--del_lnk--> Victor Klemperer). However these targets were not the main reason for the city being bombed. The <!--del_lnk--> Red Army was approaching from the East and Dresden was one of two key rail routes with <!--del_lnk--> marshalling yards. Although key industrial facilities were destroyed by the bombing, the main objective was to create a <!--del_lnk--> firestorm.<p>Civilian death estimates vary wildly, largely as a result of propaganda figures which received widespread publicity at the time. However the most recently available evidence from Friedrich Reichart of Dresden City Museum points to 25,000 deaths, fewer than the number that died in <a href="../../wp/h/Hamburg.htm" title="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>. Numbers between 25,000 &mdash; 140,000 have been used in official statistics, with the Communist authorities of Dresden increasing their estimates across time; estimates in Nazi Germany by the Ministry of Propaganda varied between 350,000 and 400,000. At that time, Dresden&#39;s population was 600,000, but up to 200,000 refugees were living in cramped apartments and passing through Dresden as the Russians were now only fifty miles away. The entire inner city (15 square kilometers) was utterly devastated, and other quarters were damaged to some degree.<p>Many of the higher estimates are based on a discredited TB47 report, which has been visibly altered by adding a zero to the end of the totals. However the West German Federal Archive in Koblenz discovered a genuine copy of TB47. The official &quot;Final Report and Situation (TB47)&quot; produced by Reich Commander of the Order Police a month after the bombings. &quot;TB47&quot; is probably a reasonable guide to the order of casualty numbers. It states definite figures of between 18,000 and 22,000 with estimates of final numbers of 25,000 and includes the interesting sentence &quot;Since rumors far exceed the reality, open use can be made of the actual figures.&quot;<p>Fortunately, much of the city&#39;s beauty has been restored, thanks to the zeal of the populace in recreating the architecture of old Dresden. Today Dresden has a strong partnership with the English city of <a href="../../wp/c/Coventry.htm" title="Coventry">Coventry</a>, which was heavily damaged by German air attacks. The camaraderie is deeply supported by the populace in both cities.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>After the Second World War, Dresden became a major industrial centre in <!--del_lnk--> socialist <!--del_lnk--> East Germany with a great deal of research infrastructure. Many important historic buildings were rebuilt, although the communists leaders of the city chose to reconstruct large areas of the city in a bland socialist modern style for economical and ideological reasons, namely to break away from the city&#39;s past as the royal capital of Saxony and a stronghold of the German bourgeoisie. However, some of the bombed-out ruins of churches were razed by Soviet authorities in the <!--del_lnk--> 1960s instead of being repaired.<p>Among East Germans, Dresden also earned the nickname &quot;the valley of the clueless&quot; because the city&#39;s location in a valley prevented its residents from watching West German TV, an illegal but popular pastime among East Germans.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 3 October <!--del_lnk--> 1989, (the so-called &quot;battle of Dresden&quot;), a convoy of trains carrying East German refugees from <a href="../../wp/p/Prague.htm" title="Prague">Prague</a> passed through Dresden on its way to <!--del_lnk--> West Germany.

      <p>Dresden has experienced dramatic changes since the reunification of Germany in the early 1990s. The city still has many of its wounds from the bombing raids of 1945 but Dresden has undergone significant reconstruction in recent years. The most important urban renewal/reconstruction project was the reconstruction of the <!--del_lnk--> Frauenkirche (&quot;Church of Our Lady&quot;) and the surrounding Neumarkt district. The church, once the city&#39;s symbol and considered the world&#39;s finest Protestant church, was rebuilt following German reunification in <!--del_lnk--> 1991 from the remaining pile of rubble of the original church&#39;s ruins thanks to private and corporate donations. It was completed in 2005, a year before Dresden&#39;s 800th birthday. The new Frauenkirche was rebuilt according to historical drawings and photographs and is now open to public service since <!--del_lnk--> Reformation Day <!--del_lnk--> 2005. Despite the inner city&#39;s almost total destruction in World War II, many areas in the central city have been restored to their former glory. The urban renewal process in Dresden will continue for many decades but public and government interest remains high and there are numerous large budget projects underway &mdash; both historic reconstructions and modern plans &mdash; that will continue the city&#39;s recent architectural renaissance.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 2002, torrential rains caused the <!--del_lnk--> Elbe to flood 9 m, past its <!--del_lnk--> 1845 record height, damaging many landmarks (See <!--del_lnk--> 2002 European flood). The destruction from this &quot;millennium flood&quot; is no longer visible, due to the rapidity of reconstruction. Disaster relief for the millennial flood came from around the world.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 2004 the United Nation&#39;s cultural organization <!--del_lnk--> UNESCO declared Dresden and the surrounding section of Elbe river valley to be a &quot;World Heritage&quot; site.<p>Dresden remains a major cultural centre of historical memory, owing to the city&#39;s destruction in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. Every year on <!--del_lnk--> 13 February, the anniversary of the major British fire-bombing raid that destroyed most of the city, tens of thousands of demonstrators gather to commemorate the event. Similar ceremonies held during the period of <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">communism</a> were specifically directed at demonizing the Western <!--del_lnk--> Allies, above all the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. Since reunification, the tone of the ceremonies has taken on a more neutral and pacifist tone. In recent years, however, <!--del_lnk--> right-wing <!--del_lnk--> extremist skinheads have tried to instrumentalize the event for their own political ends. Affiliated with the radical right <!--del_lnk--> National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD), they cite the bombing of Dresden in order to portray Germans as the real victims of the Second World War, and try to take advantage of <!--del_lnk--> anti-American sentiment to do it. In 2005, Dresden was host to the largest <!--del_lnk--> Neo-Nazi demonstration in the post-war history of Germany. Between five and eight thousand Neo-Nazis took part, mourning what they call the <!--del_lnk--> Allied bomb-<a href="../../wp/t/The_Holocaust.htm" title="Holocaust">holocaust</a> (German: <i>Alliierter Bombenholocaust</i>).<p><a id="Government_and_politics" name="Government_and_politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Government and politics</span></h2>

The ten <i>Ortsamtsbereiche</i> (districts) have a advisory councils which has to be heard in affairs of the district. The <i>Ortschaften</i> (former boroughs) still have smaller councils, which can decide even more freely in affairs of the <i>Ortschaften</i>.<p>The current city council of Dresden has 70 seats.

      <p>Dresden hosts the <!--del_lnk--> Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections) which is one of the world&#39;s most important museums and collections. The art collections consist of eleven museums of which the <!--del_lnk--> Gem&auml;ldegalerie Alte Meister and the <!--del_lnk--> Gr&uuml;nes Gew&ouml;lbe are the best known. The art collection is owned by the Free State of Saxony and mostly uses the Zwinger Palace and Dresden Castle. Some of the museums, such as the Mathematisch-Physikalischer Salon, exhibit art within the context of technology, such as precious globes, measuring equipment and chronographs which are artistically formed and perfect in function.<p>Other museums and collections owned by the Free State of Saxony in Dresden are:<ul>
       <li>The Landesmuseum f&uuml;r Vorgeschichte (State Museum of Prehistory)<li>The Staatliche Naturhistorische Sammlungen Dresden (State Collection of Natural History)<li>The Museum f&uuml;r V&ouml;lkerkunde Dresden (Museum of Ethnology)<li>The &quot;Universit&auml;tssammlung Kunst + Technik&quot; (Collection of Art and Technology of the Dresden University of Technology)<li>Verkehrsmuseum Dresden (Transport Museum)</ul>
      <p>The Deutsche Hygiene-Museum was found for mass education in hygiene, health, human biology and medicine. It stood in context of the Dresden industry of medicine and hygiene products and was founded by the industrialist Karl August Lingner, who produced <i>Odol</i> hygiene products. The museum&#39;s Transparent Woman, showing the organs of human beings as a see-through sculpture, became world famous. Dresden also hosts the Military Historical Museum of the Bundeswehr in the former garrison in the Albertstadt.<p>The former convention house of the <!--del_lnk--> farmer&#39;s estate (called the <!--del_lnk--> Landhaus) is now home of the Dresden City Museum, which exhibits a collection of historical objects and has a smaller collection of paintings. The city has some museums specialising in artists who lived in the city (for example the &quot;Carl Maria von Weber Museum&quot; and the <!--del_lnk--> K&uuml;gelgenhaus. Another museum, the <i>Technische Sammlungen</i> (Technical Collection) was established in the Pentacon building, the old factory where <i>Praktika</i> cameras were once built. The collection includes historic cameras, computing technology and entertainment technology.<p><a id="Architecture" name="Architecture"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Architecture</span></h3>
      <p>Although Dresden is often said to be a Baroque city, its architecture is influenced by more than one style.

      <p>The royal buildings are among the most impressive buildings in Dresden. The Dresden castle was once the home of the royal household. The wings of the building have been renewed, built upon and restored many times. Due to this segued integration of styles, the castle is made up of elements of the <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Baroque.htm" title="Baroque">Baroque</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Classicist styles.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Zwinger Palace is just on the other side of the road from the castle. It was built on the old stronghold of the city and was converted to a centre for the royal art collections and a place to hold festivals. Its gate (surmounted by a golden crown) by the moat is a very famous part of the building.<p>Another famous site is also on the former city wall: <!--del_lnk--> Br&uuml;hl&#39;s Terrace was a gift to <!--del_lnk--> Heinrich, count von Br&uuml;hl and became an ensemble of buildings. It was opened to the public in the 19th century; previously the whole area was closed off for the nobility. The ensemble includes the <!--del_lnk--> Albertinum, the <!--del_lnk--> St&auml;ndehaus and the Secundogenitur (home of the second son of the electors and kings).<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>August the Strong was very impressed by Venice with its <i><!--del_lnk--> Canale Grande</i> and decided to model the <!--del_lnk--> Dresden Elbe Valley on this example using the Elbe&#39;s ample bends. Nevertheless he initiated the creation of a <!--del_lnk--> cultural landscape which has been a World Heritage Site since 2004 and which differs from the <i>Canale Grande</i> with its meadows and forested yards. This landscape hosts vineyards not far away from the inner city. The World Heritage Site passes through almost the whole city. Due to conflicts involving a modern bridge to be built across the river at a sensitive spot, the site has been added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites.<p><!--del_lnk--> Pillnitz Castle was built as a summer residence in the style of <!--del_lnk--> Chinoiserie alongside the Elbe on the southern side and the slopes and vineyards on the other.<p><a id="Sacral_buildings" name="Sacral_buildings"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Sacral buildings</span></h4>

      </div>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Hofkirche was the church of the royal household. August the Strong, who wanted to became <!--del_lnk--> King of Poland, was forced to convert to the Catholic religion, as the Polish king had to be Catholic. At that time Dresden was strictly Protestant. August the Strong ordered the building of the Hofkirche (1739 to 1755) to establish a sign of religious importance in Dresden. The church is the cathedral &quot;Sanctissimae Trinitatis&quot; since 1980. The staggered facade is completed by two balustrades that are decorated width 74 statues of saints. The church hosts the crypt of the <!--del_lnk--> Wettin Dynasty.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Frauenkirche was build almost contemporaneously by the citizens of Dresden between 1726 and 1743. It is said to be the greatest cupola building in <!--del_lnk--> Central and <!--del_lnk--> North Europe. Furthermore, the Frauenkirche is the largest church in Dresden, leading Dresden to be one of the few places where a cathedral is not the largest Christian sacral building. The <!--del_lnk--> Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute in <!--del_lnk--> Venice is said to be an archetype for the Frauenkirche whose cupola firstly was planned to be a timber construction. In that era of the Dresden architecture style was enormously inspired by <!--del_lnk--> Venice and <!--del_lnk--> Florence especially by the landmarks in northern Italy.<p>The Kreuzkirche is another main church of the Protestants and is according to the location the oldest church of Dresden. The community of the Frauenkirche, which is in fact a few years older, is a former outskirt of the city. The Kreuzkirche has often been destroyed by conflagration and wars. The preserved style of architecture is that of the baroque edition supplemented by the elements of the <!--del_lnk--> Art Nouveau.<p><a id="Contemporary_architecture" name="Contemporary_architecture"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Contemporary architecture</span></h4>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Historicist buildings made their presence felt on the cityscape until the 1920s. One of the youngest buildings of that era is the Hygiene-Museum, which is designed in an impressively monumental style but employs plain facades and simple structures. It is often but wrongly attributed to the <!--del_lnk--> Bauhaus school.<p>The Bauhaus was, in fact, active in Dresden. It designed several public buildings of which the old part of the Saxon State Parliament is the most famous. Other modern architectural styles were built among more historical structures, especially along the razed city wall. The tower block at the Albertplatz is one of the buildings of the <!--del_lnk--> New Objectivity or <!--del_lnk--> Expressionist architecture that still exists. Garden cities and housing space collectives were developed in the 1920s and 1930s, raising the quality of life for of lower income residents.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The architectural plans of the <!--del_lnk--> National Socialist regime were not realised. As in Berlin, where Nazi architects planned the monumental restructuring of the city as &quot;Germania, Capital of the World&quot;, large-scale buildings next to the <!--del_lnk--> Gro&szlig;er Garten park were meant to establish Dresden as a subsidiary, regional capital. Some of the contemporary buildings were found to be &quot;un-German&quot;. Among them is the famous <i>Kugelhaus</i> (Globe House) which was torn down. Along with the older construction many modern buildings were destroyed in the Second World War.<p>Most of the present cityscape of Dresden was built up after 1945, a mix of reconstructed or repaired old buildings and new buildings of the modern and postmodern styles of the second half of the 20th century.<p>Under the German Democratic Republic, from 1945 and 1990, Dresden was planned and reconstituted as a model socialist city. Streets were arranged to keep chimneys of the industry in sight. Wide streets and squares were cut into the landscape. Central public spaces, such as the Altmarkt, were surrounded by neoclassical <!--del_lnk--> Socialist Realist structures of relatively high quality. Other structures were built with less sensitivity toward their historic or geographic context. (for example the housing block at Prager Stra&szlig;e) of industrial housing construction. Other buildings, including the the Kulturpalast or the Centrum-Warenhaus (a large department store), represent the <!--del_lnk--> international style. Much of the new public architecture was influenced by public outcry and protest; the Kulturpalast, for example, was first planned as monumental tower like the <!--del_lnk--> Warsaw Palace of Culture and Science but arranged in a flatter form in context of the historic buildings.<p>After 1990 and German reunification, new styles emerged. The Saxon State Parliament was under construction until 1993 and uses the old part of the former financial ministry in combination with a new wing of glass and steel in classic modern style. It represents the beginning of the so-called New Terrace (extending Bruel&#39;s Terrace). The youngest building of that ensemble alongside the river Elbe is the International Congress Centre Dresden which is a postmodern building mirroring motifs of the historic terrace and of the Elbe landscape.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Dresden is also known for a couple of technical buildings. Most of them were build in the second half of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century. A centre of technical buildings are the Schillerplatz and the K&ouml;rnerplatz. This two places are named after <!--del_lnk--> Friedrich Schiller and <!--del_lnk--> Carl Theodor K&ouml;rner and are connected by the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Blue Wonder&quot; Elbe bridge. This bridge is one of the oldest <!--del_lnk--> cantilever <!--del_lnk--> russ bridges in <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>. It is often said to be called Wonder due to the static without a pillar in the river or due to its colour, that changed from green to blue.<p>Nearby two mountain railways are connecting the K&ouml;rnerplatz with two quarters of villas. The <!--del_lnk--> Standseilbahn Dresden is <!--del_lnk--> funicular railway overcoming a height in difference of 95 metres. It connects Loschwitz and Wei&szlig;er Hirsch. The <!--del_lnk--> Schwebebahn Dresden is the oldest <!--del_lnk--> suspension railway of the world and connects Loschwitz and the upper parts of Loschwitz.<p>The city&#39;s building officer <!--del_lnk--> Hans Erlwein is the architect of a couple of industrial buildings that were build in the inner city. His storage building nearby the Semperoper is adapted to its neighbourhood by its dissected roof. Another building planned by Hans Erlwein is the slaughterhouse complex.

The wells only serve in a decorative function since there is a fresh water system in Dresden.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Artesian aquifer at Albertplatz is the only spring in Dresden that is run all-the-year due to its warm water. It was planned to produce fresh water for the Neustadt districts. About 3900 litre per hour are flowing upwards the 240 metre depth well naturally by pressure.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>A lot of the springs in Dresden are historic monuments like the &quot;Nymphenbad&quot; in the Zwinger or the &quot;Cholerabrunnen&quot;. The &quot;Cholerabrunnen&quot; was founded by Eugen von Gutschmid in thanks that Dresden was untroubled by the <a href="../../wp/c/Cholera.htm" title="Cholera">cholera</a> epidemics in the 1940s years.<p>Springs and fountains are also elements in contemporary cityspaces: Modern springs are arranged along the Prager Stra&szlig;e. Due to their styles of fountain, they are called &quot;blowballs&quot;. The springs alongside the Hauptbahnhof train station are above the glass ceiling of a underground parking.<p>The most famous sculpture in Dresden is the golden equestrian sculpture of August the Strong called the &quot;Goldener Reiter&quot; (Golden Cavalier) on the Neust&auml;dter Markt square. It shows August at the beginning of the Hauptstra&szlig;e (Main street) on its way to Warsaw where he was King of Poland in personal union.

      <p>Dresden&#39;s heterogene cityspace is strongly influencing the lifestyle in the city. Lifestyle in Dresden can be very urban and very rural in just a short distance. Dresden hosts a lot of events and concerts.<p>The inner city splits its function to a couple of districts. The historic town centre serves as the most important touristic area and offers a lot of restaurants, bars and pubs that are visited by tourists as well as by inhabitants. The Seevorstadt south of the historic town centre is the most important shopping area in Dresden. It is crossed by the famous Prager Stra&szlig;e shopping street with large department stores and smaller shops. The tangents of the Altmarkt, which is the oldest market place in Dresden, extend this shopping area into the town centre. The Seevorstadt with the main station and an important tram hub in close distances is also a very urban area of Dresden. The Neustadt is divided into the touristic Inner Neustadt, which also offers a lot of gastronomy and retails as well as important cultural institutions, and the Outer Neustadt which is very important in the night life of Dresden. The Outer Neustadt is the centre of subcultural and youth cultural Dresden with a lot of clubs, bars, small stages and alternative culture institutions.<p>Also green areas of Dresden are involved in the lifestyle. The huge Parks as well as the long Elbe meadows are used at day and at night for sport, party and cultural activities. Local recreation takes place in the National Park <!--del_lnk--> Saxon Switzerland, in the Eastern <!--del_lnk--> Ore Mountains or in the flat <!--del_lnk--> Moritzburg lakeland which are all not far away. The cultural landscape of the <!--del_lnk--> Dresden Elbe Valley is a world heritage site but also part of the everyday life of many inhabitants. The landscape crosses the city and is passed through by commuter traffic, used in leisure time or hosts habitation of ten thousands of residents.<p>Dresden is a city of undergraduates with an own infrastructure of event locations and cultural institutions. There are 16 student clubs in the Altstadt and S&uuml;dvorstadt near the Universities.<p>Due to the Elbe river, rowing and canoeing are leisure activities in Dresden. Dresden is a centre of chess and host city of the <!--del_lnk--> Chess Olympiad 2008. Night events in skating are proffered weekly in the summer period.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Habitation differs strongly in Dresden. In some cases old village cores are only a few minutes away from urban districts. The inner city is enormously displaced to the southern border of the city. The Outer Neustadt with the highest density of inhabitants is just a kilometre away from the Dresdner Heide forest in the North. The large area in the south eastern and its outskirts are the places of residence with the most inhabitants. Districts like Blasewitz or Striesen are arranged in chequer and are covered with dotted housings and small garden areas around the houses. The Elbe slopes are covered with expensive villas. There are also couple of <!--del_lnk--> Plattenbau areas in Dresden where good lifestyle and life standard is hard to receive.<p><a id="Infrastructure_and_economy" name="Infrastructure_and_economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Infrastructure and economy</span></h2>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1990 Dresden &mdash; an important industrial centre of East Germany &mdash; had to struggle with the economic collapse of the Soviet Union and the other export markets in eastern Europe. East Germany had been the richest Communist country but was faced with competition from western Germany after reunification. After 1990 a completely new <!--del_lnk--> law and <a href="../../wp/c/Currency.htm" title="Currency">currency</a> system was introduced in the wake of Communism&#39;s downfall, and eastern Germany&#39;s infrastructure was largely rebuilt with funds from western Germany. Dresden as a major urban centre has developed much faster and more consistently than most other regions in the former East Germany, but the city still faces many social and economic problems which stem from the collapse of the communist system, including high unemployment levels.<p><a id="Infrastructure" name="Infrastructure"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Infrastructure</span></h3>

      <p>Dresden has a large tramway network that is operated by the <!--del_lnk--> Dresden Transport Authority. Because the geological bedrock does not allow the building of underground railways, the tramway is very important in public transport in Dresden. The Transport Authority operates twelve lines on a 200 km network. On the major routes through the inner city, vehicles run every two minutes. The fleet is being renewed to replace the uncomfortable <!--del_lnk--> Czech Tatra trams. Today many of the low floor vehicles are up to 45 metres long and produced by <!--del_lnk--> Bombardier Transportation in <!--del_lnk--> Bautzen. The newest trams are vehicles of the <!--del_lnk--> Flexity Classic XXL series that are adjusted to the topography of Dresden.
