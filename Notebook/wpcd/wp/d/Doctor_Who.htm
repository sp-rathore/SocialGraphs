It has been recognised for its imaginative stories, creative low-budget <!--del_lnk--> special effects during its original run and pioneering use of electronic music (originally produced by the <!--del_lnk--> BBC Radiophonic Workshop). In Britain and elsewhere, the show has become a <!--del_lnk--> cult television favourite on a par with <i><a href="../../wp/s/Star_Trek.htm" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a></i> and has influenced generations of British television professionals, many of whom grew up watching the series.

      <p><i>Doctor Who</i> first appeared on BBC television at 5:15 p.m. (<!--del_lnk--> GMT) on <!--del_lnk--> November 23, <!--del_lnk--> 1963. The programme was born out of discussions and plans that had been going on for a year. The <a href="../../wp/b/BBC_television_drama.htm" title="BBC television drama">Head of Drama</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Sydney_Newman.htm" title="Sydney Newman">Sydney Newman</a>, was mainly responsible for developing it, with contributions by the Head of the Script Department (later Head of Serials), <!--del_lnk--> Donald Wilson, staff writer <!--del_lnk--> C. E. &#39;Bunny&#39; Webber, writer <!--del_lnk--> Anthony Coburn, <!--del_lnk--> story editor <!--del_lnk--> David Whitaker and initial <!--del_lnk--> producer, <!--del_lnk--> Verity Lambert. The series&#39; distinctive, haunting title theme was composed by <!--del_lnk--> Ron Grainer and realised by <!--del_lnk--> Delia Derbyshire of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop.<p>The BBC drama department&#39;s Serials division produced the programme for twenty-six seasons, broadcast on <!--del_lnk--> BBC One. Falling viewing numbers, a decline in the public perception of the show and a less prominent transmission slot saw production suspended in 1989 by <!--del_lnk--> Jonathan Powell, Controller of BBC One. Although it was for all intents and purposes cancelled (series co-star <!--del_lnk--> Sophie Aldred said in the documentary <i>Doctor Who: More Than 30 Years in the TARDIS</i> that she was told it was cancelled), the BBC maintained the series was merely &quot;on hiatus&quot; and insisted the show would return.<p>While in-house production had ceased, the BBC was hopeful of finding an independent production company to re-launch the show. <!--del_lnk--> Philip Segal, a British <!--del_lnk--> expatriate who worked for <!--del_lnk--> Columbia Pictures&#39; television arm in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, approached the BBC about such a venture. Segal&#39;s negotiations eventually led to a <!--del_lnk--> television movie. The <!--del_lnk--> movie was broadcast on the <!--del_lnk--> Fox Network in 1996 as a co-production between Fox, <!--del_lnk--> Universal Pictures, the <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> BBC Worldwide. However, although the film was successful in the UK (with 9.1 million viewers), it was less so in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> (possibly due to poor scheduling) and did not lead to a series.<p>Although <!--del_lnk--> licensed media such as novels and audio plays provided new stories, the programme remained dormant until 2003. In September of that year, BBC Television announced the production of a new in-house series after several years of unsuccessful attempts by BBC Worldwide to find backing for a feature film version. The new incarnation of the series is executive-produced by writer <!--del_lnk--> Russell T. Davies and <!--del_lnk--> BBC Wales Head of Drama/<!--del_lnk--> BBC Television Controller of Drama Commissioning <!--del_lnk--> Julie Gardner.<p>The new programme debuted with the episode <i><!--del_lnk--> Rose</i> on BBC One on <!--del_lnk--> March 26, <!--del_lnk--> 2005 and the show has since been sold to many other countries (see <a href="#Viewership" title="">Viewership</a>). The programme debuted on the American <!--del_lnk--> Sci-Fi Channel on <!--del_lnk--> March 17, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, one year after the Canadian and UK showings. The BBC subsequently commissioned two more series and Christmas specials. <!--del_lnk--> Series 2 has finished its run in the UK and will be followed by <i>The Runaway Bride</i> in December. <!--del_lnk--> Series 2 began airing in the US on the <!--del_lnk--> Sci-Fi Channel on <!--del_lnk--> September 29, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, followed by the CBC on <!--del_lnk--> October 9.<p><a id="Format" name="Format"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Format</span></h2>
      <p><i>Doctor Who</i> originally ran for <!--del_lnk--> 26 seasons on BBC1, from <!--del_lnk--> November 23, <!--del_lnk--> 1963 until <!--del_lnk--> December 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1989. During the original run, each weekly episode formed part of a story (or &quot;<!--del_lnk--> serial&quot;) &mdash; usually of four to six parts in earlier years and three to four in later years. Three notable exceptions were the epic <i><!--del_lnk--> The Daleks&#39; Master Plan</i> (1965&ndash;66), which aired in 12 episodes (plus an earlier one-episode teaser, <i><!--del_lnk--> Mission to the Unknown</i>, featuring none of the regular cast); the 10-episode serial <i><!--del_lnk--> The War Games</i> (1969); and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Trial of a Time Lord</i> which ran for 14 episodes (containing four stories often referred to by individual titles, and connected by framing sequences) during <!--del_lnk--> Season 23 (1986).<p>The programme was intended to be educational and for family viewing on the early Saturday evening schedule. Initially, it alternated stories set in the past, which would teach younger audience members about history, with stories set either in the future or in outer space to teach them about science. This was also reflected in the Doctor&#39;s original companions, one of whom was a science teacher and another a history teacher.<p>However, science fiction stories came to dominate the programme and the &quot;historicals&quot;, which were not popular with the production team, were dropped after <i><!--del_lnk--> The Highlanders</i> (1967). While the show continued to use historical settings, they were generally used as a backdrop for science fiction tales, with one exception: <i><!--del_lnk--> Black Orchid</i> (1982) set in 1920s Britain.<p>The early stories were more serial-like in nature, with the narrative of one story flowing into the next, and each episode having its own title, although produced as distinct stories with their own production codes. Following <i><!--del_lnk--> The Gunfighters</i> (1966), however, each serial was given its own title, with the individual parts simply being assigned episode numbers. What to name these earlier stories is often <!--del_lnk--> a subject of fan debate.<p>Writers during the original run included <!--del_lnk--> Terry Nation, <!--del_lnk--> Henry Lincoln, <a href="../../wp/d/Douglas_Adams.htm" title="Douglas Adams">Douglas Adams</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Robert Holmes, <!--del_lnk--> Terrance Dicks, <!--del_lnk--> Dennis Spooner, <!--del_lnk--> Eric Saward, <!--del_lnk--> Malcolm Hulke, <!--del_lnk--> Christopher H. Bidmead, <!--del_lnk--> Stephen Gallagher, <!--del_lnk--> Brian Hayles, <!--del_lnk--> Chris Boucher, <!--del_lnk--> Marc Platt and <!--del_lnk--> Ben Aaronovitch.<p>The serial format changed for the 2005 revival, with each series consisting of thirteen 45-minute, self-contained episodes (60 minutes with adverts on commercial channels overseas). This includes three two-parters and a loose story arc per season whose elements are brought together in the season finale.<p>Over 700 <i>Doctor Who</i> instalments have been televised since 1963, ranging from 25-minute episodes (the most common format), to 45-minute episodes for a single season in 1985, to two feature-length productions (1983&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> The Five Doctors</i> and the <!--del_lnk--> 1996 television movie). <i>Doctor Who</i>, having already completed 723 episodes, will surpass the number of individual instalments of the <i><a href="../../wp/s/Star_Trek.htm" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a></i> franchise (726 episodes over five programmes) during the 2007 series.<p>The current series is filmed in 576i25 <!--del_lnk--> DigiBeta widescreen format and then <!--del_lnk--> filmised to give a 25p image in post-production using a Snell and Wilcox Alchemist Platinum.<p><a id="Public_consciousness" name="Public_consciousness"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Public consciousness</span></h2>
      <p>The programme rapidly became a national institution, the subject of countless jokes, newspaper mentions and other popular culture references. Many renowned actors asked for or were offered and accepted <!--del_lnk--> guest starring roles in various stories.<p>However, with popularity came controversy over the show&#39;s suitability for children. The moral campaigner <!--del_lnk--> Mary Whitehouse made a series of complaints to the BBC in the 1970s over its sometimes frightening or gory content. Ironically, her actions made the programme even more popular, especially with children. <!--del_lnk--> John Nathan-Turner, who produced the series during the 1980s, was heard to say that he looked forward to Whitehouse&#39;s comments, as the show&#39;s ratings would increase soon after she had made them. During the 1970s, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Radio Times</i>, the BBC&#39;s listings magazine, announced that a child&#39;s mother said the theme music terrified her son. The <i>Radio Times</i> was apologetic, but the theme music remained.<p>There were more complaints about the programme&#39;s content than its music. During <!--del_lnk--> Jon Pertwee&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> second season as the Doctor, in the serial <i><!--del_lnk--> Terror of the Autons</i> (1971), images of murderous plastic dolls, daffodils killing unsuspecting victims and blank-featured android policemen marked the apex of the show&#39;s ability to frighten children. Other notable moments in that decade included the Doctor apparently being drowned by Chancellor Goth in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Deadly Assassin</i> (1976), and the allegedly negative portrayal of Chinese people in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Talons of Weng-Chiang</i> (1977).<p>It has been said that watching <i>Doctor Who</i> from a position of safety &quot;<!--del_lnk--> behind the sofa&quot; (as the <i>Doctor Who</i> exhibition at the <!--del_lnk--> Museum of the Moving Image in London was titled) and peering cautiously out to see if the frightening part was over is one of the great shared experiences of British childhood. The phrase has become a common phrase in association with the programme and occasionally elsewhere.<p><a id="The_Doctor" name="The_Doctor"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Doctor</span></h2>

      <p>The character of the Doctor was initially shrouded in mystery. All that was known about him in the programme&#39;s early days was that he was an eccentric alien traveller of great intelligence who battled injustice while exploring time and space in an unreliable old time machine called the <!--del_lnk--> TARDIS. The TARDIS is much larger on the inside than on the outside and, due to a chronic malfunction, stuck in the shape of a 1930s-style British <!--del_lnk--> police box.<p>However, not only did the initially irascible and slightly sinister Doctor quickly mellow into a more compassionate figure, it was eventually revealed that he had been &quot;on the run&quot; from his own people, the <!--del_lnk--> Time Lords of the planet <!--del_lnk--> Gallifrey.<p>Like all Time Lords, the Doctor has the ability to &quot;<!--del_lnk--> regenerate&quot; his body when near death, allowing for the convenient recasting of the lead actor. While a Time Lord can regenerate twelve times, the Doctor has gone through this process and its resulting after-effects on nine occasions, with each of his incarnations having his own quirks and abilities:<ol>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> First Doctor, played by <!--del_lnk--> William Hartnell (1963&ndash;1966)<li><!--del_lnk--> Second Doctor, played by <!--del_lnk--> Patrick Troughton (1966&ndash;1969)<li><!--del_lnk--> Third Doctor, played by <!--del_lnk--> Jon Pertwee (1970&ndash;1974)<li><!--del_lnk--> Fourth Doctor, played by <!--del_lnk--> Tom Baker (1974&ndash;1981)<li><!--del_lnk--> Fifth Doctor, played by <!--del_lnk--> Peter Davison (1981&ndash;1984)<li><!--del_lnk--> Sixth Doctor, played by <!--del_lnk--> Colin Baker (1984&ndash;1986)<li><!--del_lnk--> Seventh Doctor, played by <!--del_lnk--> Sylvester McCoy (1987&ndash;1989, 1996)<li><!--del_lnk--> Eighth Doctor, played by <!--del_lnk--> Paul McGann (1996)<li><!--del_lnk--> Ninth Doctor, played by <!--del_lnk--> Christopher Eccleston (2005)<li><!--del_lnk--> Tenth Doctor, played by <!--del_lnk--> David Tennant (2005&ndash;present)</ol>
      <p>Other actors have also played the Doctor, though rarely more than once (see the <!--del_lnk--> list of actors who have played the Doctor for details).<p>Despite these shifts in personality, the Doctor has always remained an intensely curious and highly moral adventurer, who would rather solve problems with his wits than through violence.<p>Throughout the programme&#39;s long history certain controversial revelations about the Doctor have been made. For example, in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Brain of Morbius</i> (1976), it was hinted that the <!--del_lnk--> First Doctor may not have been the Doctor&#39;s first incarnation; throughout the <!--del_lnk--> Seventh Doctor&#39;s era it was hinted that the Doctor was more than just an ordinary Time Lord, and in the 1996 television movie it was revealed that the Doctor is actually half-human on his mother&#39;s side. By the time of the 2005 series, the <!--del_lnk--> Ninth Doctor had become the last known surviving Time Lord.<p><a id="Companions" name="Companions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Companions</span></h2>
      <p>The Doctor almost always shares his adventures with up to three <!--del_lnk--> companions (the only exception in the original series being <i>The Deadly Assassin</i>, in which he travels alone). The idea of the companion is to provide a <!--del_lnk--> surrogate with whom the audience can identify and to further the story by asking questions and getting into trouble. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes &mdash; or loves &mdash; on worlds they have visited. Some have even died during the course of the series.<p>There are some disputes as to the definition of a companion, but fans mostly agree that at least thirty (including <!--del_lnk--> K-9 Marks I and II) meet the criteria for &quot;companion&quot; status in the television series, with <!--del_lnk--> others being established in the various spin-offs. For further details, see the notes in <!--del_lnk--> List of Doctor Who supporting characters.<p>&quot;Companion&quot; is more generally used as a technical term in fandom; the press normally refers to them either as companions or assistants. The series does not apply the term consistently to those travelling with the Doctor, with him just as often introducing them simply as his friends. In the 2005 series, the <!--del_lnk--> Ninth Doctor states he &quot;employed <!--del_lnk--> Rose [Tyler] as his companion&quot; and then was promptly asked if it was sexual.<p>Despite the fact that the majority of the Doctor&#39;s companions are young, attractive females, the production team for the 1963&ndash;1989 series maintained a longstanding taboo against any overt romantic involvement in the TARDIS: for example, <!--del_lnk--> Peter Davison, as the <!--del_lnk--> Fifth Doctor, was not allowed to put his arm around either <!--del_lnk--> Sarah Sutton (<!--del_lnk--> Nyssa) or <!--del_lnk--> Janet Fielding (<!--del_lnk--> Tegan). However, that has not prevented fans from speculating about possible romantic involvements, most notably between the <!--del_lnk--> Fourth Doctor and the Time Lady <!--del_lnk--> Romana (whose actors, <!--del_lnk--> Tom Baker and <!--del_lnk--> Lalla Ward, shared a romance and brief marriage). The taboo was controversially broken in the 1996 television movie when the <!--del_lnk--> Eighth Doctor was shown kissing companion <!--del_lnk--> Grace Holloway. The 2005 series played with this idea by having various characters think that the Ninth Doctor and Rose (played by <!--del_lnk--> Billie Piper) were a couple, which they vehemently denied (see also <!--del_lnk--> &quot;The Doctor and romance&quot;).<p>Previous companions have reappeared in the series, usually for anniversary specials. One former companion, <!--del_lnk--> Sarah Jane Smith (played by <!--del_lnk--> Elisabeth Sladen), together with the robotic dog <!--del_lnk--> K-9, appeared in <!--del_lnk--> an episode of the 2006 series more than twenty years after their last appearances in the 20th Anniversary story <i><!--del_lnk--> The Five Doctors</i> (1983).<p><!--del_lnk--> Freema Agyeman will play <!--del_lnk--> Martha Jones, the Doctor&#39;s next companion after Rose. Apart from her name, the casting of family members and the information that she will be a medical student, no details are currently available about her character. She will not appear in <!--del_lnk--> the 2006 Christmas special.<p><a id="Adversaries" name="Adversaries"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Adversaries</span></h2>
      <p>When Sydney Newman commissioned the series, he specifically did not want to perpetuate the clich&eacute; of the &quot;bug-eyed monster&quot; of science fiction. However, <!--del_lnk--> monsters were a staple of <i>Doctor Who</i> almost from the beginning and were popular with audiences.<p>Notable adversaries of the Doctor include the <!--del_lnk--> Autons, the <!--del_lnk--> Cybermen, the <!--del_lnk--> Sontarans, the <!--del_lnk--> Sea Devils, the <!--del_lnk--> Ice Warriors, the <!--del_lnk--> Yeti, the <!--del_lnk--> Silurians, the <!--del_lnk--> Slitheen and <!--del_lnk--> the Master, a rival Time Lord with a thirst for universal conquest. Of all the monsters and villains, the ones that most secured the series&#39; place in the public&#39;s imagination were the <!--del_lnk--> Daleks. The Daleks are lethal mutants in tank-like mechanical armour from the planet <!--del_lnk--> Skaro. Their chief role in the great scheme of things, as they frequently remark in their instantly recognisable metallic voices, is to &quot;Exterminate!&quot; <!--del_lnk--> Davros, the Daleks&#39; creator, also became a recurring villain after he was introduced.<p>The Daleks were created by writer <!--del_lnk--> Terry Nation (who intended them as an allegory of the <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">Nazis</a>) and BBC designer <!--del_lnk--> Raymond Cusick. The Daleks&#39; debut in the programme&#39;s second serial, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Daleks</i> (1963&ndash;64), caused a tremendous reaction in the viewing figures and the public, putting <i>Doctor Who</i> on the cultural map. A Dalek even appeared on a postage stamp celebrating British popular culture in 1999, photographed by <!--del_lnk--> Lord Snowdon.<p><a id="Music" name="Music"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Music</span></h2>

      <p>The original 1963 arrangement of the <i>Doctor Who</i> theme, as composed by Ron Grainer and realised by <!--del_lnk--> Delia Derbyshire at the <!--del_lnk--> BBC Radiophonic Workshop, is widely regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, working from tape loops of an individually struck piano string and individual test <!--del_lnk--> oscillators and filters. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of <!--del_lnk--> Season 17 (1979&ndash;80).<p>A more modern and dynamic arrangement was composed by <!--del_lnk--> Peter Howell for <!--del_lnk--> Season 18 (1980), which was in turn replaced by <!--del_lnk--> Dominic Glynn&#39;s arrangement for Season 23&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> The Trial of a Time Lord</i> (1986). <!--del_lnk--> Keff McCulloch provided the new arrangement for the <!--del_lnk--> Seventh Doctor&#39;s era which lasted from <!--del_lnk--> Season 24 (1987) until the series&#39; suspension in 1989. For the new series in 2005, <!--del_lnk--> Murray Gold provided a new arrangement which featured samples from the 1963 original with further elements added.<p>In the early 1970s, <!--del_lnk--> Jon Pertwee, who had played the <!--del_lnk--> Third Doctor, recorded a version of the <i>Doctor Who Theme</i> with spoken lyrics, titled, &quot;Who Is The Doctor&quot;. In 1988 the band <!--del_lnk--> The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (later known as <!--del_lnk--> The KLF) released the single &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Doctorin&#39; the Tardis&quot; under the name <!--del_lnk--> The Timelords, which reached No. 1 in the UK. Others who have covered or reinterpreted the theme include <!--del_lnk--> Orbital, the Australian string ensemble <!--del_lnk--> Fourplay, <!--del_lnk--> The Pogues, <!--del_lnk--> Pink Floyd and the comedians <!--del_lnk--> Bill Bailey and <!--del_lnk--> Mitch Benn, and satirised on <i><!--del_lnk--> The Chaser&#39;s War on Everything</i>. The theme tune has also appeared on many compilation CDs and has made its way into <!--del_lnk--> mobile phone ring tones. Fans have also produced and distributed their own remixes of the theme.<p>A <!--del_lnk--> soundtrack CD of Gold&#39;s music for the new series is currently in production. A release date has been set for 4th December.<!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Viewership" name="Viewership"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Viewership</span></h2>
      <p><i>Doctor Who</i> has always appeared on the BBC&#39;s mainstream <!--del_lnk--> BBC One channel, drawing audiences of many millions of viewers. It was most popular in the late 1970s, with audiences frequently as high as 12 million. During the <!--del_lnk--> ITV network strike of 1979, viewership peaked at 16 million. No first-run episode of <i>Doctor Who</i> has ever drawn fewer than three million viewers on BBC One, although its late 1980s performance of three to five million viewers was seen as poor at the time, and was according to the BBC Board of Control, a leading cause of the programme&#39;s 1989 suspension. Some fans considered this disingenuous, since the programme was scheduled against the <!--del_lnk--> soap opera <i><a href="../../wp/c/Coronation_Street.htm" title="Coronation Street">Coronation Street</a></i>, the most popular show at the time. The BBC One broadcast of <i><!--del_lnk--> Rose</i>, the first episode of the 2005 revival, drew an average audience of 10.81 million, third highest for BBC One that week and seventh across all channels. The 2005 series had an average audience of 7.95 million viewers, and the 2006 series achieved an average audience of about 7.71 million in the context of declining year-to-year viewership for all television channels. The episode <i><!--del_lnk--> Rise of the Cybermen</i> managed sixth place in the charts across the week with 9.22 million viewers. The all-time highest chart placing for an episode of <i>Doctor Who</i> is fifth, for episode two of <i><!--del_lnk--> The Ark in Space</i> in 1975.<p>The programme also gained a <!--del_lnk--> strong following in Australia, possibly as a result of the close connection between the BBC and Australia&#39;s major public broadcaster, the <!--del_lnk--> ABC. The latest repeat of the classic series in Australia ran from September 2003 to February 2006, and the revived series has also been shown on <!--del_lnk--> ABC and <!--del_lnk--> UK.TV.<p>The series also has a fan base in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, where it was shown in syndication from the 1970s to the 1990s, particularly on <!--del_lnk--> PBS stations (see <!--del_lnk--> Doctor Who in America). <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> was the first country outside the UK to screen <i>Doctor Who</i> beginning in September 1964, and continued to screen the series for many years, including the new series from 2005. In <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>, the series debuted in January 1965, but the CBC only aired the first twenty-six episodes. <!--del_lnk--> TVOntario picked up the show in the 1976 beginning with <i><!--del_lnk--> Inferno</i> and aired it through to Season 24 in 1991. TVO&#39;s schedule ran several years behind the BBC&#39;s throughout this period. In the 1970s TVO airings were bookended by a host who would introduce the episode and then, after the episode concluded, try to place it in an educational context in keeping with TVO&#39;s status as an educational channel. The airing of <i><!--del_lnk--> The Talons of Weng Chiang</i> resulted in controversy for TVOntario as a result of accusations that the story was <!--del_lnk--> racist. Consequently the story was not rebroadcast. CBC began showing the series again in 2005.<p>Only four episodes have ever had their premiere showings on channels other than BBC One. The 1983 twentieth anniversary special <i><!--del_lnk--> The Five Doctors</i> had its debut on <!--del_lnk--> November 23 (the actual date of the anniversary) on the <a href="../../wp/c/Chicago.htm" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> <!--del_lnk--> PBS station <!--del_lnk--> WTTW in the United States and various other PBS members two days prior to its BBC One broadcast. The 1988 story <i><!--del_lnk--> Silver Nemesis</i> was broadcast with all three episodes edited together in compilation form on <!--del_lnk--> TVNZ in New Zealand in November, after the first episode had been shown in the UK but before the final two instalments had aired there. Finally, the 1996 television movie premiered on <!--del_lnk--> May 12 on <!--del_lnk--> CITV in <!--del_lnk--> Edmonton, Canada, fifteen days before the BBC One showing, and two days before it aired on <!--del_lnk--> Fox in the USA.<p>A wide selection of serials is available from BBC Video on <!--del_lnk--> VHS and <a href="../../wp/d/DVD.htm" title="DVD">DVD</a>, on sale in the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States.

      <p>Between about 1967 and 1978, large amounts of older material stored in the BBC&#39;s video tape and film libraries were destroyed or <!--del_lnk--> wiped. This included many old episodes of <i>Doctor Who</i>, mostly stories featuring the first two Doctors &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> William Hartnell and <!--del_lnk--> Patrick Troughton. Archives are complete from the programme&#39;s move to colour television (starting from <!--del_lnk--> Jon Pertwee&#39;s time as the Doctor), although a few Pertwee episodes have required substantial restoration and a handful have only been recovered in black and white. In all, <!--del_lnk--> 108 of 253 episodes produced during the first six years of the programme are not held in the BBC&#39;s archives.<p>Some episodes have been returned to the BBC from the archives of other countries who bought copies for broadcast, or by private individuals who got them by various means. Early colour videotape recordings made off-air by fans have also been retrieved, as well as excerpts filmed off the television screen onto 8 mm <!--del_lnk--> cine film and clips that were shown on other programmes. Audio versions of all of the lost episodes exist from home viewers who made tape recordings of the show.<p>In addition to these, there are photographs made by photographer <!--del_lnk--> John Cura, who was hired by the BBC to document the filming of many of their most popular programmes during the 1950s and 1960s, including <i>Doctor Who</i>. These have been used in fan reconstructions of the serials. These amateur reconstructions have been tolerated by the BBC, provided they are not sold for profit and are distributed as low quality VHS copies.<p>One of the most sought-after lost episodes is Part Four of the last William Hartnell serial, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Tenth Planet</i> (1966), which ends with the <!--del_lnk--> First Doctor transforming into the <!--del_lnk--> Second. The only portion of this in existence, barring a few poor quality silent 8 mm clips, is the few seconds of the regeneration scene, thanks to it having been shown on the children&#39;s magazine show <i><a href="../../wp/b/Blue_Peter.htm" title="Blue Peter">Blue Peter</a></i>. With the approval of the BBC, efforts are now under way to restore as many of the episodes as possible from the extant material. Starting in the early 1990s, the BBC began to release audio recordings of missing serials on cassette and compact disc, with linking narration provided by former series actors. &quot;Official&quot; reconstructions have also been released by the BBC on VHS, on <!--del_lnk--> MP3 <!--del_lnk--> CD-ROM and as a special feature on a DVD. The BBC, in conjunction with animation studio <!--del_lnk--> Cosgrove Hall has reconstructed the missing Episodes 1 and 4 of <i><!--del_lnk--> The Invasion</i> (1968) in animated form, using remastered audio tracks and the comprehensive stage notes for the original filming, for the serial&#39;s DVD release in November 2006.<p>In April 2006, the long running BBC children&#39;s television magazine <i><a href="../../wp/b/Blue_Peter.htm" title="Blue Peter">Blue Peter</a></i> launched a challenge to find these missing episodes with the promise of a full scale <!--del_lnk--> Dalek model.<br clear="all" />

      <p><i>Doctor Who</i> has appeared on stage numerous times. In the early 1970s, <!--del_lnk--> Trevor Martin played the role in <i><!--del_lnk--> Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday</i> which also featured former companion actress <!--del_lnk--> Wendy Padbury (Pertwee&#39;s Doctor made a cameo appearance via film). In the early 1990s, Jon Pertwee and Colin Baker both played the Doctor at different times during the run of a musical play entitled <i><!--del_lnk--> Doctor Who - The Ultimate Adventure</i>. For two performances while Pertwee was ill, <!--del_lnk--> David Banks (best known for playing various <!--del_lnk--> Cybermen) played the Doctor. Other original plays have been staged as amateur productions, with other actors playing the Doctor, while <!--del_lnk--> Terry Nation wrote <i><!--del_lnk--> The Curse of the Daleks</i>, a stage play mounted in the late 1960s, but without the Doctor.<p>The Doctor has also appeared in two cinema films: <i><!--del_lnk--> Dr. Who and the Daleks</i> in 1965 and <i><!--del_lnk--> Daleks - Invasion Earth 2150 AD</i> in 1966. Both were essentially retellings of existing stories on the big screen, with a larger budget and numerous alterations to the series concept. In these films, <!--del_lnk--> Peter Cushing played a human scientist named <!--del_lnk--> Dr. Who, who travelled with his two granddaughters and other companions in a time machine he invented. Due to this and numerous other changes (not to mention the storylines that duplicated televised episodes), the movies are not regarded as part of the ongoing continuity of the series, although the Cushing version of the character would reappear in both comic strip and literary form, the latter attempting to reconcile the film continuity with that of the series.<p>A pilot episode for a potential spin-off series, <i><!--del_lnk--> K-9 and Company</i>, was aired in 1981 with <!--del_lnk--> Elisabeth Sladen reprising her role as companion <!--del_lnk--> Sarah Jane Smith and <!--del_lnk--> John Leeson as the voice of <!--del_lnk--> K-9, but was not picked up as a regular series.<p><i>Doctor Who</i> books have been published from the mid-sixties through to the present day. The Doctor has also appeared in many audio plays and in webcasts.<p>Following the success of the 2005 series produced by Russell T. Davies, the BBC commissioned Davies to produce a 13-part spin-off series titled <i><!--del_lnk--> Torchwood</i> (an <!--del_lnk--> anagram of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;), set in modern-day Britain and investigating alien activities and crime. The series debuted on <!--del_lnk--> BBC Three on <!--del_lnk--> 22 October <!--del_lnk--> 2006. <!--del_lnk--> John Barrowman reprises his role of <!--del_lnk--> Jack Harkness from the 2005 series of <i>Doctor Who</i>. It was shot in Summer and Autumn 2006. <!--del_lnk--> Eve Myles, who was in the 2005 <i>Doctor Who</i> episode <i><!--del_lnk--> The Unquiet Dead</i>, also stars.<p>A new K-9 children&#39;s series, <i><!--del_lnk--> K-9 Adventures</i>, is being produced, but not by the BBC.<p><i><!--del_lnk--> The Sarah Jane Adventures</i>, starring Elisabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane Smith, has been developed by <!--del_lnk--> CBBC; a special will air in early 2007, with a full series to follow later in the year.<p><a id="Charity_episodes" name="Charity_episodes"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Charity episodes</span></h3>
      <p>In 1993, coinciding with the series&#39; 30th anniversary, a charity special entitled <i><!--del_lnk--> Dimensions in Time</i> was produced in aid of Children in Need, featuring all of the surviving actors who played the Doctor and a number of previous companions. Not taken seriously by many, the story had the <!--del_lnk--> Rani opening a hole in time, cycling the Doctor and his companions through his previous incarnations and menacing them with monsters from the show&#39;s past. It also featured a crossover with the soap opera <i><a href="../../wp/e/EastEnders.htm" title="EastEnders">EastEnders</a></i>, the action taking place in the latter&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Albert Square location and around <!--del_lnk--> Greenwich, including the <i><!--del_lnk--> Cutty Sark</i>. The special was one of several special 3D programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system that made use of the <!--del_lnk--> Pulfrich effect requiring glasses with one darkened lens; the picture would look perfectly normal to those viewers who watched without the glasses.<p>In 1999, another special, <i><!--del_lnk--> Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death</i>, was made for <!--del_lnk--> Red Nose Day and later released on <!--del_lnk--> VHS. An affectionate <!--del_lnk--> parody of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional serial format, complete with <!--del_lnk--> cliffhangers. (The version released on <a href="../../wp/v/Video.htm" title="Video">video</a> was split into only two episodes.) In the story, the Doctor (<!--del_lnk--> Rowan Atkinson) encounters both <!--del_lnk--> the Master (<!--del_lnk--> Jonathan Pryce) and the <!--del_lnk--> Daleks. During the special the Doctor is forced to regenerate several times, with his subsequent incarnations played by, in order, <!--del_lnk--> Richard E. Grant, <!--del_lnk--> Jim Broadbent, <!--del_lnk--> Hugh Grant, and <!--del_lnk--> Joanna Lumley. The script was written by comedy writer <!--del_lnk--> Steven Moffat, who contributed two scripts to the 2005 series and one for the 2006 series.<p>As noted above, on <!--del_lnk--> November 18, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, an untitled <!--del_lnk--> 7-minute &quot;mini-episode&quot;, set in the immediate aftermath of <i><!--del_lnk--> The Parting of the Ways</i> and leading directly into <i><!--del_lnk--> The Christmas Invasion</i>, was shown as part of the Children in Need <!--del_lnk--> telethon.<p><a id="Spoofs" name="Spoofs"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Spoofs</span></h3>
