      <p><b>The Cathedral Church of Christ, Blessed Mary the Virgin and St Cuthbert of Durham</b>, which is almost always referred to as <b>Durham Cathedral</b>, in the city of <a href="../../wp/d/Durham.htm" title="Durham">Durham</a>, <!--del_lnk--> County Durham, <!--del_lnk--> North East England, was founded in 1093 and remains a centre for <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christian</a> worship today.

      <p>The seed of Durham takes its origins from the Diocese of <!--del_lnk--> Lindisfarne, set up by <!--del_lnk--> Saint Aidan at the behest of <a href="../../wp/o/Oswald_of_Northumbria.htm" title="Oswald of Northumbria">King Oswald</a> around AD <!--del_lnk--> 635. The see lasted until AD <!--del_lnk--> 664 at which point it was translated to <!--del_lnk--> York. The see was then reinstated in AD <!--del_lnk--> 678 by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The community of <!--del_lnk--> Lindisfarne produced many Saints, of which <!--del_lnk--> Saint Cuthbert is central to the development of Durham Cathedral.<p>After repeated Viking raids the monks fled Lindisfarne in AD <!--del_lnk--> 875, transferring St Cuthbert&#39;s relics wherever they went. The diocese of Lindisfarne remained itinerant until AD <!--del_lnk--> 882 when a community was established in <!--del_lnk--> Chester-le-Street. The see had its seat here until AD <!--del_lnk--> 995 further incursions once again caused the monks to move with the relics. According to local legened, the monks followed two milk maids who were searching for a dun (i.e. brown) cow and were led into a <!--del_lnk--> peninsula formed by a loop in the <!--del_lnk--> River Wear. At this point Cuthbert&#39;s coffin became immovable and this was taken as sign that the new shrine should be built here. A more prosaic set of reasons for the selection of the peninsula is its highly defensible position, and that a community established here would enjoy the protection of the Earl of Northumberland, as the bishop at this time, Aldhune, had strong family links with the earls.<p>Initially, a very simple temporary structure was built to house the relics of Cuthbert made from nearby trees. The shrine was then transfered to a sturdier, probably wooden, building known as the White Church. This church was then itself replaced three years later in AD <!--del_lnk--> 998 by a stone building also known as the White Church; by AD <!--del_lnk--> 1017 only the west tower was unfinished. Durham soon became a site of pilgrimage, encouraged by the growing cult of Saint Cuthbert. <a href="../../wp/c/Canute_the_Great.htm" title="Canute the Great">King Canute</a> was one early pilgrim, granting many priviliges and much land to the Durham community. The defendable position, flow of money from prilgrims and power embodied in the church at Durham ensured that a town formed around the cathedral, establishing the early core of the modern city.<p><a id="Medieval" name="Medieval"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Medieval</span></h3>
      <p>The present cathedral was initially designed and built under the first Prince Bishop, <!--del_lnk--> William of St. Carilef. Construction began in <!--del_lnk--> 1093, although William died before completion of this phase in <!--del_lnk--> 1135, passing responsibility to his successor <!--del_lnk--> Ranulf Flambard (who also built Flamwell Bridge, the first crossing of the <!--del_lnk--> River Wear, in the town). The building is notable for the <!--del_lnk--> ribbed vault of the <!--del_lnk--> nave roof, with pointed transverse arches supported on relatively slender composite piers alternated with massive drum columns, and <!--del_lnk--> flying buttresses or lateral abutments concealed within the <!--del_lnk--> triforium over the aisles. These features appear to be precursors to the <!--del_lnk--> Gothic architecture of Northern France a few decades later, doubtless due to the <!--del_lnk--> Norman stonemasons responsible, although the building is considered <!--del_lnk--> Romanesque overall. It was the skilled use of the pointed arch and ribbed vault which made it possible to cover far more elaborate and complicated ground plans than hitherto. The buttressing made it possible both to build taller buildings and to open up the intervening wall spaces to create larger windows<p><!--del_lnk--> Saint Cuthbert&#39;s tomb lies at the East, and was once an elaborate monument of green marble and gold.<p>In the twelfth century, Bishop <!--del_lnk--> Hugh de Puiset added the <i>Galilee Chapel</i> at the West end of the cathedral. Also known as <i>The <!--del_lnk--> Lady Chapel</i>, the Galilee Chapel holds the remains of the <!--del_lnk--> Venerable Bede and of <!--del_lnk--> Bishop Langley, the latter of whose tombs blocked the Great West Door of the cathedral.<p>William of St. Carilef, Ranulf Flambard and <!--del_lnk--> Hugh de Puiset are all buried in the cathedral&#39;s <i>Chapter House</i>, which lies opposite the cloisters and dates from <!--del_lnk--> 1140.<p>The thirteenth century saw the construction of the <i>Chapel of the Nine Altars</i>, at the Eastern end of the cathedral, beginning under <!--del_lnk--> Richard le Poore (<!--del_lnk--> 1228-<!--del_lnk--> 1237). The central tower of this time was destroyed by lightning, so the current tower dates from the fifteenth century.<p><a id="Dissolution" name="Dissolution"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Dissolution</span></h3>
      <p>Cuthbert&#39;s tomb was destroyed on the orders of <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_VIII_of_England.htm" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1538, but survives as a modest stone affair. Two years later, in <!--del_lnk--> 1540, the <!--del_lnk--> Benedictine <!--del_lnk--> monastery at Durham was <!--del_lnk--> dissolved, although the <!--del_lnk--> cloisters are well preserved architecturally, and its last <!--del_lnk--> prior - <!--del_lnk--> Hugh Whitehead - became the cathedral&#39;s first <!--del_lnk--> dean.<p><a name="1600-1900"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1600-1900</span></h3>
      <p>In 1650, Durham Cathedral was converted into a prisoner of war camp, and held Scots POWs from the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Dunbar (Sept 3, 1650). As many as five thousand prisoners died en route to the Cathedral or while there. Their bodies were buried in unmarked graves. The survivors were shipped to the <!--del_lnk--> West Indies, <!--del_lnk--> Virginia and <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts. One hundred and fifty Scots POWs were shipped to <!--del_lnk--> Berwick, Maine in December 1650.<p>The Chapel of the Nine Altars features a large <!--del_lnk--> rose window originally from the <!--del_lnk--> 1600s and rebuilt in the 18th century, and a statue of <!--del_lnk--> William Van Mildert, the last Prince Bishop (<!--del_lnk--> 1826-<!--del_lnk--> 1836) and driving force behind the foundation of <!--del_lnk--> Durham University.<p><a name="20th_century"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">20th century</span></h3>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1986, the Cathedral - together with the nearby Castle - became a <a href="../../wp/w/World_Heritage_Site.htm" title="World Heritage Site">World Heritage Site</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> UNESCO committee classified the Cathedral under criteria C (ii) (iv) (vi), reporting &quot;<i>Durham Cathedral is the largest and most perfect monument of &#39;Norman&#39; style architecture in England</i>&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> View full report (PDF)).<p>Today, the Cathedral remains seat of the Bishop of Durham, an <!--del_lnk--> Anglican church in the <!--del_lnk--> diocese of Durham. Durham Cathedral has also been featured in the <a href="../../wp/h/Harry_Potter.htm" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> films as <!--del_lnk--> Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where it had a spire added onto the top of the famous towers to make it look less prominent. Interior views of the Cathedral were featured in the 1998 film <i><!--del_lnk--> Elizabeth</i>.<p><a id="Quotations" name="Quotations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Quotations</span></h2>
      <p>&quot;Durham is one of the great experiences of Europe to the eyes of those who appreciate architecture, and to the minds of those who understand architecture.
