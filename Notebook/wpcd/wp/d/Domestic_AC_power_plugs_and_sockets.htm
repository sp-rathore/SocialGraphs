Many plugs make no distinction between the live and neutral contacts, and in some cases they have two live contacts. The contacts may be <!--del_lnk--> brass, <a href="../../wp/t/Tin.htm" title="Tin">tin</a> or <a href="../../wp/n/Nickel.htm" title="Nickel">nickel</a> plated.<p><b>Power sockets</b> are female electrical connectors that have slots or holes which accept the pins or blades of power plugs inserted into them and deliver electricity to the plugs.

      <p>In most countries, household power is <!--del_lnk--> single-phase electric power, in which a single live conductor brings <a href="../../wp/a/Alternating_current.htm" title="Alternating current">alternating current</a> into a house, and a neutral returns it to the power supply. Many plugs and sockets include a third contact used for a protective earth ground, which only carries current in case of a fault in the connected equipment.<p><a id="Live_or_Phase" name="Live_or_Phase"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Live or Phase</span></h3>
      <p>The <b>live</b> contact (also known as <b>phase</b>, <b>hot</b> or <b>active</b>) carries <a href="../../wp/a/Alternating_current.htm" title="Alternating current">alternating current</a> from the power source to the equipment. The voltage varies by country, as set by national standards. In some installations, there may be two live conductors, either being two phases from a <!--del_lnk--> three-phase system or being both phases from a <!--del_lnk--> split phase system. Some plug/socket combinations are designed in a way that a plug can be inserted only one possible way &mdash; this is referred to as a <i>polarized</i> plug (not to be confused with positive and negative polarity). Others allow the plug to be inserted with live and neutral either way round &mdash; this is referred to as an <i>unpolarized</i> plug. Furthermore even if live and neutral can only connect one way, in some countries it is common to wire them without regard for which is which. This can be hazardous with some equipment in which the neutral is connected directly to the chassis.<p><a id="Neutral" name="Neutral"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Neutral</span></h3>
      <p>The <b>neutral</b> contact returns current from the equipment back to the power source or distribution panel. It is in most (but not all) cases referenced to the earth. Except under fault conditions it does not pose a danger because the voltage between the neutral contact and the earth is close to zero, but is nevertheless treated as live in most installation practices because it can develop a high voltage under fault conditions.<p>The main danger posed by the neutral is the voltage can rise as high as the voltage on the live conductor if a broken neutral cable in the wiring disconnects the neutral but leaves the live conductor connected. Another possibility is that the live and neutral may be reversed or crossed by improper installation.<p><!--del_lnk--> Neutral and earth (ground) are closely related and are usually connected at some point. However extra connections between the neutral and the earth should be avoided unless the relevant jurisdiction&#39;s regulations allow it. Connecting neutral and earth at more than one point can sometimes create a dangerous <!--del_lnk--> ground loop in the system.<p><a id="Earth.2FGround" name="Earth.2FGround"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Earth/Ground</span></h3>
      <p>The <b>earth</b> contact (known as <b>ground</b> in <a href="../../wp/a/American_English.htm" title="American English">American English</a>) is only intended to carry <!--del_lnk--> electric current when connected to equipment that has developed an insulation fault (except for <!--del_lnk--> EMI/RFI filters which do cause a small current down the earth). The earth connection was added to modern plugs because, if a live wire or other component in a device touches the metal casing, anybody touching the device may receive a dangerous <!--del_lnk--> electric shock. In many countries devices with metal cases must have the case connected to the earth contact. This reduces but does not eliminate the possibility of the case developing a high voltage relative to the earth and grounded metalwork.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>It is a common misconception that the purpose of the earth connection is to take fault currents safely to earth. The primary purpose of the earthing system is to cause a fuse to blow or a breaker or a <!--del_lnk--> residual-current device (RCD) to trip to automatically disconnect the power supply to any device or cable which develops a wiring fault. The secondary purpose is to hold all touchable metal in a house to the same voltage to prevent electrical shocks when touching two metal objects at the same time.<p>There are two main approaches to the problem of how to disconnect power when a live wire comes into contact with metalwork attached to the earthing system. One way is to get the resistance through the fault path and back to the supply very low by having a metallic connection from the earth back to the supply transformer (a <!--del_lnk--> TN system). Then when a fault happens a very high current will flow rapidly blowing a fuse (or tripping a <!--del_lnk--> MCB).<p>Where such a direct connection is not used (a <!--del_lnk--> TT system) the resistance of the fault path back to the supply is almost invariably far higher and as a result the fault current is generally too low to reliably blow fuses (or trip <!--del_lnk--> MCBs). Therefore an RCD must normally be used to disconnect the fault.<p>The neutral core could in theory be used as a ground, but this would be dangerous if the core broke, so this is not normally used in building wiring or portable appliances. It is, however, used in some other situations with special precautions. For instance, in Switzerland, sockets in houses with the old two wire installation have the ground and neutral contacts connected together, probably supposing, that the professionally maintained house installation is much more reliable than plugged-in device. Also using the neutral as a ground prevents the use of RCDs.<p><a id="Differences_in_terminology" name="Differences_in_terminology"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Differences in terminology</span></h3>

      <p>When <a href="../../wp/e/Electricity.htm" title="Electricity">electricity</a> was first introduced into the household, it was primarily used for lighting. At that time, many electricity companies operated a split-tariff system where the cost of electricity for lighting was lower than that for other purposes. This led to low-power appliances (such as vacuum cleaners and hair driers) being connected to the light fitting. The picture to the right shows a 1909 electric <!--del_lnk--> toaster with a <!--del_lnk--> light bulb socket plug.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>However, as electricity became a common method of heating houses and operating labour-saving appliances, a means of connection to the electric system other than using a light socket was needed. The original two prong electrical plug and socket were invented by <!--del_lnk--> Harvey Hubbell and <!--del_lnk--> patented in 1904. <p>The three prong plug was invented in 1928 by Philip F. Labre, while he was going to school at the <!--del_lnk--> Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE). It is said that his landlady had a cat which would knock over her fan when it came in the window. When she plugged the fan back in, she would get an <!--del_lnk--> electric shock. Philip figured out that if the plug was grounded, the electricity would go to earth through the plug rather than his landlady. He applied for and was issued a patent for grounding receptacle and plug on <!--del_lnk--> June 5, <!--del_lnk--> 1928. As the need for safer installations became apparent, earthed three-contact systems were made mandatory in most industrial countries.<p><a id="Proliferation_of_standards" name="Proliferation_of_standards"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Proliferation of standards</span></h2>
      <p>The reason that there are now over a dozen different styles of plugs and wall outlets is that when European countries adopted 220-240V electricity, for nationalistic reasons they developed their own unique national plug designs instead of agreeing on a European standard plug. In contrast, the 38 different countries which adopted the American 110-120V standard electricity also adopted the U.S. type A and B plugs. Most countries elsewhere in the world were once colonies of European nations and usually adopted the standards of their colonial governments at the time electricity was introduced. In many other countries there is no single national standard and multiple voltages, frequencies and plug designs are in use, creating extra complexity and potential safety problems for users.<p>However, in recent years most countries have settled on one of a few <i>de facto</i> standards, although there are legacy installations of obsolete wiring in most countries of the world. Some buildings have wiring that has been in use for almost a century and which pre-dates all modern standards.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>To minimize the difficulty of designing for different national standards, many manufacturers of electrical devices like <!--del_lnk--> personal computers have adopted the practice of putting a single world-standard <!--del_lnk--> IEC connector on the device, and supplying for each country a <!--del_lnk--> power cord equipped with a standard IEC connector on one end and a national power plug at the other. The device itself is designed to adapt to a wide range of voltage and frequency standards.<p><a id="World_maps_by_plug.2Fsocket_and_voltage.2Ffrequency" name="World_maps_by_plug.2Fsocket_and_voltage.2Ffrequency"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">World maps by plug/socket and voltage/frequency</span></h2>
      <p>There are two basic standards for voltage and frequency in the world. One is the North American standard of 110-120 volts at 60 Hz, which uses plugs A and B, and the other is the European standard of 220-240 volts at 50 Hz, which uses plugs C through M. The differences arose for historical reasons.<p>In the United States, <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Edison.htm" title="Thomas Edison">Thomas Edison</a>, the inventor of the first practical electric light bulb, insisted on using 110 volts <!--del_lnk--> direct current (DC) rather than <a href="../../wp/a/Alternating_current.htm" title="Alternating current">alternating current</a> (AC) for his electric system in <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a>. However, <!--del_lnk--> George Westinghouse, who built the first large hydro-electric plants at <a href="../../wp/n/Niagara_Falls.htm" title="Niagara Falls">Niagara Falls</a>, decided to use AC instead of DC because it could be stepped up or stepped down in voltage using <!--del_lnk--> transformers. The electrical genius <!--del_lnk--> Nicola Tesla advised him that 240 V at 60 Hz was optimum, but authorities would not let him use more than 110 V for distribution. Eventually Edison switched his 110 V DC system over to AC as well, and so 110 V at 60 Hz became the American electrical standard, despite the fact it required conductors twice as large to carry the same amount of power as 240 V.<p>In Europe, the German company <!--del_lnk--> AEG built the first generating facilities, and chose 50 Hz because it fit better into the metric system of powers of ten (1, 10, 100). Unfortunately, 50 Hz is less efficient than 60 Hz because generators are 20% less efficient and transformers must be 30% bigger to step the voltage up and down. However, AEG had a virtual monopoly in Europe so their standard spread to the rest of the continent and eventually to Britain. Originally Europe was electrified at 110-120 V like North America, but after <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, regulators decided to increase it to 220-240 V to reduce the amount of copper used for wiring.<p>American regulators would have liked to double the voltage as well, but there were far more household electrical appliances than in Europe. They compromised by adopting a <!--del_lnk--> split phase 240 V system, supplying 120 V on two live conductors going into each household with a single neutral. Small appliances ran on 120 V, big ones on 240 V. It was more complicated but saved copper and was backward-compatible with existing appliances. The original plugs could be used with the system, as well.<p>Countries on other continents have adopted one of these two voltage standards, although some countries use variations or a mixture of standards. The outline maps below show the different plug types, voltages and frequencies used around the world, colour-coded for easy reference.<p>See also <!--del_lnk--> List of countries with mains power plugs, voltages and frequencies for specific places.<br clear="all" />

      <p>Electrical plugs and their sockets differ by country in shape, size, and type of connectors. The type used in each country is set by national standards legislation.  In this article each type is designated by a letter, plus a short comment in parentheses giving its country of origin and number of contacts. Subsections then detail the subtypes of each type as used in different parts of the world.<p>Note that IEC Class I refers to earthed equipment. IEC Class II refers to unearthed equipment protected by double insulation. See <!--del_lnk--> Appliance classes.<p><a id="Type_A_.28North_American.2FJapanese_2-pin.29" name="Type_A_.28North_American.2FJapanese_2-pin.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Type A (North American/Japanese 2-pin)</span></h3>

       <dt>NEMA 1-15 (North American 15&nbsp;A/125&nbsp;V ungrounded)</dl>
      <p>Standardized by the U.S. <!--del_lnk--> National Electrical Manufacturers Association  and adopted by 38 other countries, this simple plug with two flat parallel pins, or blades, is used in most of <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a> and on the west coast of <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a> on devices not requiring a ground connection, such as lamps and &quot;double-insulated&quot; small appliances. NEMA 1-15 sockets have been prohibited in new construction in the United States and Canada since 1965, but remain in many older homes and are still sold &quot;for replacement use only&quot;. Type A plugs are still very common because they are compatible with type B sockets.<p>Early designs could be inserted either way, but modern ones prevent the neutral pin from being inserted into the live socket by making it wider than the live one, referred to as a <i>polarized plug</i>. (Note that this is not the same as positive/negative polarization in a <!--del_lnk--> direct current system.) New polarized plugs will not fit in old type A sockets, but both old and new type A plugs will fit in new type A and type B sockets. Some devices that do not distinguish between neutral and live, such as sealed <!--del_lnk--> electronic power supplies, are still sold with both pins narrow. When attaching a new polarized plug to a cord, it is useful to remember that the most common type of two-conductor cord for low-power use in North America has smooth insulation on the &quot;hot&quot; side and ribbed insulation on the &quot;neutral&quot; side.<dl>
       <dt>JIS 8303, Class II (Japanese 15&nbsp;A/100&nbsp;V ungrounded)</dl>
      <p>The <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japanese</a> plug and socket are identical to NEMA&nbsp;1-15. However, the Japanese system incorporates stricter dimensional requirements for the plug housing, different marking requirements, and mandatory testing and approval by <!--del_lnk--> MITI or <!--del_lnk--> JIS. <p>Some Japanese outlets are non-polarized &mdash; the slots in the sockets are the same size - and will only accept non-polarized plugs. Japanese plugs should be able to fit into North American outlets without trouble, but North American appliances with polarized plugs may require adapters or replacement non-polarized plugs to connect to Japanese outlets.<p>Japanese standard wire sizes and the resulting current ratings are somewhat different from those used elsewhere in the world. Japanese voltage is only 100 volts - lower than American voltage - and the frequency in eastern Japan is only 50 hertz instead of 60, so even if a North American plug can be inserted into a Japanese socket, it does not always mean the device will work properly.<p><a id="Type_B_.28American_3-pin.29" name="Type_B_.28American_3-pin.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Type B (American 3-pin)</span></h3>

      <p>The type B plug has two flat parallel blades like type A, but has a round <!--del_lnk--> ground or earthing pin (American standard NEMA 5-15/<a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canadian</a> standard CSA 22.2, N&ordm;42). It is rated for 15 amps at 125 volts. The ground pin is longer than the live and neutral blades, so the device is grounded before the power is connected. The neutral blade in the type B socket is wider than the live one to prevent type A plugs being inserted upside-down, but type B plugs often have both pins narrow since the ground pin enforces polarity.<p>The 5-15 socket is standard in all of North America (Canada, the United States and Mexico). It is also used in Central America, the Caribbean, the west coast of South America, Japan, parts of Korea, and Taiwan.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>With type B plugs, if you look directly at a socket with the ground socket at a bottom, the neutral slot is on the left, and the live slot is on the right. They may also be installed with the ground at the top or on either side, but the sockets going clockwise are always ground, neutral, live. The plug has the same connections going counterclockwise. If the plug is polarized, the widest pin is the neutral connector.<p>Due to the low power (1.8KW) available from a 120V 15A socket a number of other <!--del_lnk--> NEMA connector for higher currents and 240 V supplies are also commonly encountered in North American homes.<dl>

      <p>This two-pin plug is probably the single most widely used international plug, popularly known as the <!--del_lnk--> Europlug.

It is described in CEE&nbsp;7/16. and is also defined in <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italian</a> standard CEI&nbsp;23-5 and <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russian</a> standard <!--del_lnk--> GOST 7396<p>The Europlug is used in Class II applications throughout continental Europe (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Greece, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Poland, The Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria). It is also used in Turkey, the Middle East, most of Africa and South America (Brazil), as well as the former Soviet republics, and many developing nations.<p>This plug is intended for use with devices that require 2.5&nbsp;A or less.

      <p>India has standardised on a plug which was originally defined in British standard <!--del_lnk--> BS 546. It has three large round pins in a triangular pattern. The BS 546 standard is also used in parts of Africa (Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria), the Middle East (Kuwait, Qatar), and parts of Asia and the Far East that were electrified by the British. This type was also previously used in <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, but has been phased out in favour of the 15&nbsp;A version there. This 5&nbsp;A plug, along with its 2&nbsp;A cousin, is sometimes used in the UK for centrally switched domestic lighting circuits, in order to distinguish them from normal power circuits.<dl>

      <p>This plug is sometimes referred to as type M, but it is in fact merely the 15&nbsp;A version of the plug above, though its pins are much larger at 7.05&nbsp;mm &times; 21.1&nbsp;mm. Live and neutral are spaced 25.4&nbsp;mm apart, and earth is 28.6&nbsp;mm away from each of them. Although the 5&nbsp;A version is standard in <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/Nepal.htm" title="Nepal">Nepal</a>, and <a href="../../wp/n/Namibia.htm" title="Namibia">Namibia</a>, the 15&nbsp;A version is also used in these countries for larger appliances. Some countries like <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> use it as the main domestic plug and socket type, where sockets almost always have an on&ndash;off switch built into them. The Type M is almost universally used in the UK for indoor dimmable theatre and architectural lighting installations. It is also often used for non-dimmed but centrally controlled sockets within such installations. The main reason for doing this is that fused plugs, while convenient for domestic wiring (as they allow 32&nbsp;A socket circuits to be used safely), are not convenient if the plugs and sockets are in hard to access locations (like lighting bars) or if using chains of extension leads (since it is hard to figure out which fuse has blown). Both of these situations are common in theatre wiring.

The reason for incompatibility is that earthing in the E socket is accomplished with a round male pin permanently mounted in the socket.

It has earthing clips on both sides to connect with the CEE&nbsp;7/4 socket and a female contact to accept the earthing pin of the type&nbsp;E socket. Nowadays, when appliances are sold with type&nbsp;E/F plugs attached, the plugs are CEE&nbsp;7/7 and non-rewirable.

Better-quality replacements are standard CEE&nbsp;7/7 and are compatible with both Schuko and French standard sockets.<p>Note that the CEE&nbsp;7/7 plug is polarized to prevent the live and neutral connections from being reversed when used with a type&nbsp;E outlet, but allows polarity reversal when inserted into a type&nbsp;F socket. The plug is rated at 16&nbsp;A.

Earth is 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;23&nbsp;mm.<p>The plug is unusual in that it has a fuse inside, for protection, in addition to a circuit breaker in the distribution panel. The fuse is required to protect the flex, as British wiring standards allow very high-current circuits to the socket. Accepted practice is to choose the smallest standard fuse (3 A, 5 A, or 13&nbsp;A) that will allow the appliance to function. Using a 13 A fuse on an appliance with thin flex is considered bad practice.<p>The earth pin is required to open shutters over the live and neutral pins on most sockets to prevent children from inserting metal objects into them, and also prevents the use of plugs made to other standards. On plugs for <!--del_lnk--> Class II appliances that do not require an earth, the pin is often <!--del_lnk--> plastic. It is possible to open the shutters with a screwdriver to insert other plug types but this should be avoided as such plugs will not have a fuse.<p>BS&nbsp;1363 was published in 1962 and since that time it has gradually replaced the earlier standard (type&nbsp;D) (<!--del_lnk--> BS 546). Despite being capable of carrying a maximum load of 13&nbsp;A, it is considered a very safe system.<p><a id="Type_H_.28Israeli_3-pin.29" name="Type_H_.28Israeli_3-pin.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Type H (Israeli 3-pin)</span></h3>

      <p>This plug, defined in SI&nbsp;32 (IS16A-R), is unique to <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israel</a> and is incompatible with all other sockets. It has three flat pins to form a Y-shape. &quot;Live&quot; and &quot;Neutral&quot; are spaced 19&nbsp;mm apart. The type H plug is rated at 16&nbsp;A but in practice the inadequate flat pins cause it to overheat when connecting large appliances. In 1989 the SI&nbsp;32 was revised to use three round 4&nbsp;mm pins in the same locations as the older standard. Sockets are manufactured to accept both flat and round pins in order to be compatible with both old and new plugs. This also allows the type H socket to accommodate type C plugs which are used in Israel for non grounded appliances. Older sockets, from about the 1970s have both flat and round holes for &quot;Live&quot; and &quot;Neutral&quot; in order to accept type C plugs. As of 2006, &quot;pure&quot; type H sockets (for 3 flat pins) that do not accept type C plugs are very rare in Israel.<p>This plug is also used in the areas controlled by the <!--del_lnk--> Palestinian National Authority in the <a href="../../wp/w/West_Bank.htm" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> and all of the <a href="../../wp/g/Gaza_Strip.htm" title="Gaza Strip">Gaza Strip</a>.<p><a id="Type_I_.28Australian.2FChinese_2.2F3-pin.29" name="Type_I_.28Australian.2FChinese_2.2F3-pin.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Type I (Australian/Chinese 2/3-pin)</span></h3>

      <p>This plug, used in <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, and <a href="../../wp/p/Papua_New_Guinea.htm" title="Papua New Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>, has an earthing pin and two flat pins forming an upside down V-shape.  There is an unearthed version of this plug as well, with no earthing pin. The flat blades measure 6.5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;1.6&nbsp;mm and are set 30&deg; to the vertical on a nominal pitch of 13.7&nbsp;mm. Australian wall sockets almost always have switches on them for extra safety, as in the UK.<p>There are several AS/NZS 3112 plug variants,  including one with a wider earth pin is used for devices drawing up to 15&nbsp;A; sockets supporting this pin will also accept 10&nbsp;A plugs. Additionally, there exists a 20&nbsp;A variant, in which all three pins are oversized and 25 and 32&nbsp;A variants with the 20&nbsp;A larger pins and the earthing pin forming an inverted &quot;L&quot; for the 25&nbsp;A and a horizontal &quot;U&quot; for the 32&nbsp;A (note that the 5 variants {10; 15; 20; 25 &amp; 32 ampere sockets} will accommodate all the plugs that are equal or of a lesser current carring capacity but not a higher value; i.e. a 10&nbsp;A plug will be accommodated by all sockets but a 20 A plug will only be accommodated by a 20: 25 and 32&nbsp;A outlet).<p>Australia&#39;s standard plug/socket system was originally codified as standard C112 (floated provisionally in 1937, and adopted as a formal standard in 1938), which was superseded by <!--del_lnk--> AS&nbsp;3112 in 1990. As of 2005, the latest major update is AS/NZS&nbsp;3112:2004, which mandated insulated pins  by 2005. However, equipment and cords made before 2003 can still be used.<dl>
       <dt>CPCS-CCC (Chinese 10&nbsp;A/250&nbsp;V)</dl>
      <p>Although the Chinese plug is slightly different (the pins are 1&nbsp;mm longer) the Australian plug can be inserted into the socket used in the <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">mainland China</a>. The standard for Chinese plugs and sockets was set out in GB&nbsp;2099.1&ndash;1996 and GB&nbsp;1002&ndash;1996. As part of China&#39;s commitment for entry into the <!--del_lnk--> WTO, the new CPCS (Compulsory Product Certification System) has been introduced, and compliant Chinese plugs have been awarded the CCC (China Compulsory Certification) Mark by this system. The plug is three wire, grounded, rated at 10&nbsp;A, 250&nbsp;V and used for Class 1 applications.<p>In China, the sockets are installed upside down, relative to the Australian one shown in the picture. However, the positions of the live and neutral contacts are <i>reversed</i> from those of the Australian plug. With devices conforming to current standards this is not too serious, as neutral is generally treated the same as live in appliance design. However with older or non-complying equipment this difference can be dangerous.<p>China also uses American/Japanese &quot;Type A&quot; sockets and plugs for Class-II appliances. However, the voltage across the pins of a Chinese socket will always be 220, no matter what the plug type.<dl>

The pin lengths and wiring are the same as those for the Chinese version. The most important difference from the Australian plug is that the Argentinian plug is wired with the live and neutral contacts <b>reversed</b> from those of the Australian plug.<p><a id="Type_J_.28Swiss_3-pin.29" name="Type_J_.28Swiss_3-pin.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Type J (Swiss 3-pin)</span></h3>

(ASE1011/1959 SW10A-R) This plug is similar to the type C europlug (CEE&nbsp;7/16), except that it has an earth pin off to one side. Swiss sockets can take Swiss plugs or europlugs (CEE&nbsp;7/16). This connector system is rated for up to 10 amperes. There is also a less common variant with 3 square pins rated for 16&nbsp;A. Above 16&nbsp;A, equipment must either be wired permanently to the electrical supply system with appropriate branch circuit protection, or connected to the mains with an appropriate high power industrial connector.<p>Switzerland also has a two-pin plug, with the same pin shape, size and spacing as the SEV&nbsp;1011&#39;s live and neutral pins, but with a more flattened hexagonal form. It fits into both Swiss sockets (round and hexagonal) and CEE&nbsp;7/16 sockets, and is rated for up to 10&nbsp;A.<dl>

      <p>The Danish standard plug is described in DS section 107-2-D1 (SRAF1962/DB 16/87 DN10A-R). The plug is similar to the type F Schuko plug except that it has an earthing pin instead of earthing clips. The Danish socket will also accept the type C CEE&nbsp;7/16 Europlug or type E/F CEE&nbsp;7/17 Schuko-French hybrid plug. Type F CEE&nbsp;7/4 (Schuko), type E/F CEE&nbsp;7/7 (Schuko-French hybrid), and earthed type E French plugs will also fit in the socket but should not be used because the earth contact will not connect. A variation of this plug intended for use only on surge protected computer circuits has been introduced. The current rating on both plugs is 10&nbsp;A.<p>Adapter plugs exist to allow connection of CEE&nbsp;7/7 prongs to non-computer outlets. These usually are not sold at the local supermarket so visitors wishing to be safe should contact an electrician.<p>Since the early 1990s grounded outlets have been required in all new electric installations in Denmark.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italian</a> earthed plug/socket standard, CEI&nbsp;23-16/VII, includes two models rated at 10&nbsp;A and 16&nbsp;A that differ in contact diameter and spacing. Both are symmetrical, allowing the live and neutral contacts to be inserted in either direction. CEE&nbsp;7/16 (type C) unearthed Europlugs are also in common use, and standardized in Italy as CEI&nbsp;23-5. Appliances with CEE&nbsp;7/7 Schuko-French plugs are often sold in Italy, but not every socket will accept them. Adapters are commonly used to connect CEE&nbsp;7/7 plugs to CEI&nbsp;23-16/VII sockets.<dl>
       <dt>CEI 23-16/VII (Italian 10&nbsp;A/250&nbsp;V)</dl>
      <p>The 10 ampere style extends CEE&nbsp;7/16 by adding a central earthing pin. Thus, CEI&nbsp;23-16-VII 10&nbsp;A sockets can accept CEE&nbsp;7/16 Europlugs. This is the plug shown in the illustrations. Outside of Italy, this plug is found in <a href="../../wp/l/Libya.htm" title="Libya">Libya</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia.htm" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Chile.htm" title="Chile">Chile</a>, various countries in <a href="../../wp/n/North_Africa.htm" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>, and occasionally in old buildings in <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>.<dl>
       <dt>CEI 23-16/VII (Italian 16&nbsp;A/250&nbsp;V)</dl>
      <p>The 16 ampere style looks like a bigger version of the 10&nbsp;A style. The pins are a couple of <!--del_lnk--> millimetres further apart, and all three are slightly thicker. The packaging on these plugs in Italy may claim they are a &quot;North European&quot; type. They were also referred to as <i>industriale</i> (&quot;industrial&quot;) although this is not a correct definition.<dl>
       <dt>Variations in sockets</dl>
      <p>Two types of sockets are in common use in modern installations in Italy. One type has a central round hole and two 8-shaped holes above and below. This design allows the connection of both styles of type L plugs (CEI 23-16/VII 10&nbsp;A and 16&nbsp;A) and the type C CEE 7/16 Europlug. The advantage of this socket type is its small footprint.<p>The other type looks like a type F socket, but adds a central grounding hole. This design accepts CEE&nbsp;7/7 (type E/F) plugs, in addition to type C and type L 10&nbsp;A plugs; its disadvantage is that it is twice as large as a normal type L socket. Some of these sockets also have extra holes to accept type L 16&nbsp;A plugs.<p>Older installations often have sockets that are limited to either the 10&nbsp;A or the 16&nbsp;A style plug, requiring the use of an adapter if the other style needs to be connected.<p><a id="Type_M_.28see_D.29" name="Type_M_.28see_D.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Type M (see D)</span></h3>

      <p>Sockets that take a variety of incompatible plug types are often seen in developing countries where electrical standards are either lacking or unenforced. These sockets may accept both 120 V and 240 V plugs raising a significant risk of devices being be damaged by the wrong voltage. Sometimes they have one or more earth holes to allow 3 pin plugs, but there is a good chance that the ground contact may not actually be connected to earth and the ground contact certainly will not mate with schuko or french plugs. Great care should be taken to avoid incompatible voltage and grounding connections when using such outlets. Multi-standard devices designed to auto-adapt to different voltage and frequency standards, and which do not require a ground contact are best used with these sockets.<p><a id="Safety_notes" name="Safety_notes"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_AC_power_plugs_and_sockets&quot;</div>
