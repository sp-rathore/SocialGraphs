      <p>The period is named after <!--del_lnk--> Devon, a county in southwestern England, where Devonian outcrops are common. While the <!--del_lnk--> rock beds that define the start and end of the period are well identified, the exact dates are uncertain. According to the <!--del_lnk--> International Commission on Stratigraphy (Ogg, 2004), the Devonian extends from the end of the <a href="../../wp/s/Silurian.htm" title="Silurian">Silurian</a> Period 416.0 &plusmn; 2.8 <!--del_lnk--> million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the <a href="../../wp/c/Carboniferous.htm" title="Carboniferous">Carboniferous</a> Period 359.2 &plusmn; 2.5 Mya (in <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>, the beginning of the <!--del_lnk--> Mississippian subperiod of the Carboniferous) (ICS 2004).<p>The Devonian is also known as the <b>Age of Fishes</b>, but the term is out of favour. While fish underwent a major radiation it was only one of several major <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">evolutionary</a> landmarks during the period, and other lifeforms were more common.<p>The Devonian has also erroneously been characterized as a <b>Greenhouse Age</b>, due to <!--del_lnk--> sampling bias: most of the early Devonian-age discoveries came from the <!--del_lnk--> strata of <!--del_lnk--> western Europe and eastern <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>, which at the time straddled the <!--del_lnk--> Equator as part of the supercontinent of Euramerica where <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil.htm" title="Fossil">fossil</a> signatures of widespread reefs indicate tropical <a href="../../wp/c/Climate.htm" title="Climate">climates</a> that were warm and moderately humid.<p>In nineteenth-century texts the Devonian has been called the <b>Old Red Age</b>, after the red and brown terrestrial deposits known in the United Kingdom as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Old Red Sandstone&quot; in which these early discoveries were found.<p><a id="Devonian_subdivisions" name="Devonian_subdivisions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Devonian subdivisions</span></h2>

      <p>The Devonian period was a time of great <a href="../../wp/p/Plate_tectonics.htm" title="Plate tectonics">tectonic</a> activity, as <!--del_lnk--> Laurasia and <!--del_lnk--> Gondwanaland drew closer together.<p>The continent <!--del_lnk--> Euramerica (or Laurussia) was created in the early Devonian by the collision of <!--del_lnk--> Laurentia and <!--del_lnk--> Baltica, which rotated into the natural dry zone along the <!--del_lnk--> Tropic of Capricorn, which is formed as much in Paleozoic times as nowadays by the convergence of two great airmasses, the <!--del_lnk--> Hadley cell and the <!--del_lnk--> Ferrel cell. In these near-deserts, the <!--del_lnk--> Old Red Sandstone sedimentary beds formed, made red by the oxidized iron (<!--del_lnk--> hematite) characteristic of drought conditions.<p>Near the <!--del_lnk--> equator, <!--del_lnk--> Pangaea began to consolidate from the <a href="../../wp/p/Plate_tectonics.htm" title="Tectonic plates">plates</a> containing <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>, further raising the northern <!--del_lnk--> Appalachian Mountains and forming the <!--del_lnk--> Caledonian Mountains in <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Scandinavia.<p>The west coast of Devonian North America, by contrast, was a passive margin with deep silty embayments, river deltas and estuaries, in today&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Idaho and <!--del_lnk--> Nevada; an approaching volcanic <!--del_lnk--> island arc reached the steep slope of the continental shelf in Late Devonian times and began to uplift deep water deposits, a collision that was the prelude to the mountain-building episode of Mississippian times called the <!--del_lnk--> Antler orogeny <!--del_lnk--> .<p>The southern <a href="../../wp/c/Continent.htm" title="Continent">continents</a> remained tied together in the <!--del_lnk--> supercontinent of Gondwana. The remainder of modern Eurasia lay in the Northern Hemisphere. Sea levels were high worldwide, and much of the land lay submerged under shallow seas, where tropical <!--del_lnk--> reef organisms lived.<p>The deep, enormous <!--del_lnk--> Panthalassa (the &quot;universal ocean&quot;) covered the rest of the <a href="../../wp/p/Planet.htm" title="Planet">planet</a>. Other minor oceans were <!--del_lnk--> Paleo-Tethys, <!--del_lnk--> Proto-Tethys, <!--del_lnk--> Rheic Ocean, and <!--del_lnk--> Ural Ocean (which was closed during the collision with <!--del_lnk--> Siberia and Baltica).<p><a id="Devonian_biota" name="Devonian_biota"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Devonian biota</span></h2>

      <p>Sea levels in the Devonian were generally high. Marine faunas continued to be dominated by <!--del_lnk--> bryozoa, diverse and abundant <!--del_lnk--> brachiopods and <!--del_lnk--> corals. Lily-like <!--del_lnk--> crinoids were abundant, and <!--del_lnk--> trilobites were still fairly common, but less diverse than in earlier periods. The <!--del_lnk--> ostracoderms were joined in the mid-Devonian by the first jawed fishes, the great armored <!--del_lnk--> placoderms, as well as the first sharks and <!--del_lnk--> ray-finned fish. The first shark, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Cladoselache</i>, appeared in the oceans during the Devonian period. They became abundant and diverse. In the late Devonian the <!--del_lnk--> lobe-finned fish appeared, giving rise to the first <!--del_lnk--> tetrapods.<p><a id="Reefs" name="Reefs"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Reefs</span></h3>
      <p>A great barrier reef, now left high and dry in the <!--del_lnk--> Kimberley Basin of northwest <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>, once extended a thousand kilometers, fringing a Devonian continent. Reefs in general are built by various <!--del_lnk--> carbonate-secreting organisms that have the ability to erect wave-resistant frameworks close to sea level. The main contributors of the Devonian reefs were unlike modern reefs, which are constructed mainly by corals and calcareous <!--del_lnk--> algae. They were composed of calcareous algae and coral-like <!--del_lnk--> stromatoporoids, and tabulate and <!--del_lnk--> rugose corals, in that order of importance.<p><a id="Terrestrial_biota" name="Terrestrial_biota"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Terrestrial biota</span></h3>
      <p>By the Devonian Period, life was well underway in its colonization of the land. The <a href="../../wp/b/Bacteria.htm" title="Bacterium">bacterial</a> and algal mats were joined early in the period by primitive <a href="../../wp/p/Plant.htm" title="Plant">plants</a> that created the first recognizable <a href="../../wp/s/Soil.htm" title="Soil">soils</a> and harbored some arthropods like <!--del_lnk--> mites, <!--del_lnk--> scorpions and <!--del_lnk--> myriapods. Early Devonian plants did not have roots or leaves like the plants most common today, and many had no vascular tissue at all. They probably spread largely by vegetative growth, and did not grow much more than a few centimeters tall.<p>By the Late Devonian, forests of small, primitive plants existed: <!--del_lnk--> lycophytes, sphenophytes, <a href="../../wp/f/Fern.htm" title="Fern">ferns</a>, and progymnosperms had <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">evolved</a>. Most of these plants have true roots and leaves, and many were quite tall. The tree-like ancestral fern <i><!--del_lnk--> Archaeopteris</i>, grew as a large tree with true <a href="../../wp/w/Wood.htm" title="Wood">wood</a>. These are the oldest known trees of the world&#39;s first forests. By the end of the Devonian, the first seed-forming plants had appeared. This rapid appearance of so many plant groups and growth forms has been called the &quot;Devonian Explosion&quot;. The primitive arthropods co-evolved with this diversified terrestrial vegetation structure. The evolving co-dependence of insects and seed-plants that characterizes a recognizably modern world had its genesis in the late Devonian. The development of soils and plant root systems probably led to changes in the speed and pattern of <!--del_lnk--> erosion and sediment deposition.<p>The &#39;greening&#39; of the continents acted as a <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> <!--del_lnk--> sink, and <a href="../../wp/e/Earth%2527s_atmosphere.htm" title="Earth&#39;s atmosphere">atmospheric</a> levels of this <!--del_lnk--> greenhouse gas may have dropped. This may have cooled the climate and led to a massive <!--del_lnk--> extinction event. see <!--del_lnk--> Late Devonian extinction.<p>Also in the Devonian, both <a href="../../wp/v/Vertebrate.htm" title="Vertebrate">vertebrates</a> and arthropods were solidly established on the land.<p><a id="Fungal_life" name="Fungal_life"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Fungal life</span></h3>
      <p>While the marine <!--del_lnk--> fungi remained in the <a href="../../wp/o/Ocean.htm" title="Ocean">oceans</a> and diversified into <a href="../../wp/n/Nature.htm" title="Nature">Nature</a>&#39;s recyclers, land fungi were also recycling the land, decomposing both <a href="../../wp/p/Plant.htm" title="Plants">plants</a>&#39; and <!--del_lnk--> animals&#39; dead bodies. Also, due to more terrestrial plants and animals appearance, fungi flourished.<p><a id="Late_Devonian_extinction" name="Late_Devonian_extinction"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Late Devonian extinction</span></h2>

      <p>A major extinction occurred at the boundary that marks the beginning of the last phase of the Devonian period, the Famennian faunal stage, (the Frasnian-Famennian boundary), about 364 million years ago, when all the fossil agnathan fishes suddenly disappeared. A second strong pulse closed the Devonian period. The Late Devonian extinction was one of five major extinction events in the history of the Earth&#39;s biota, more drastic than the familiar extinction event that closed the Cretaceous.<p>The Devonian extinction crisis primarily affected the marine community, and selectively affected shallow warm-water organisms rather than cool-water organisms. The most important group to be affected by this extinction event were the reef-builders of the great Devonian reef-systems .<p>Amongst the severely affected marine groups were the brachiopods, trilobites, ammonites, conodonts, and acritarchs, as well as jawless fish, and all placoderms. Freshwater species, including our tetrapod ancestors, were less affected.<p>Reasons for the late Devonian extinctions are still speculative.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devonian&quot;</div>
