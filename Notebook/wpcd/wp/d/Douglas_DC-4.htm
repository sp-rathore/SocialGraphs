      <p>The <b>DC-4</b> is a four-engined airliner developed by the <!--del_lnk--> Douglas Aircraft Company. It served extensively during the <!--del_lnk--> Second World War in a military role, and after the war for civilian airlines.<p>

      <p>The designation DC-4 was used by Douglas Aircraft Company when developing the <!--del_lnk--> DC-4E as a large, four-engined type to complement its forthcoming <!--del_lnk--> DC-3 design. It was intended to fulfill <!--del_lnk--> United Airlines&#39; requirement for a long-range passenger airliner. The DC-4E (E stands for experimental) emerged as a 52-passenger airliner with a fuselage of unusually wide cross-section for its day and a triple fin tail unit, similar to that later used by <!--del_lnk--> Lockheed on its <!--del_lnk--> Constellation.<p>The DC-4E first flew on <!--del_lnk--> June 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1938, and was used by United Air Lines for test flights. But the type proved to be ahead of its time - it was complicated to maintain and uneconomical to operate. The sponsoring airlines, <!--del_lnk--> Eastern and United, decided to ask instead for a smaller and simpler derivative but before the definitive DC-4 could enter service the outbreak of the Second World War meant production was channelled to the <!--del_lnk--> United States Army Air Forces and the type given the military designation <b><!--del_lnk--> C-54</b>. Additional versions used by the US Navy were designated <b>R5D</b>. The first aircraft, a C-54, flew from <!--del_lnk--> Clover Field in <!--del_lnk--> Santa Monica, California on <!--del_lnk--> February 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1942.<p><a id="Production" name="Production"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Production</span></h2>
      <p>The DC-4 had a notable innovation in that its nose-wheel landing gear allowed it to introduce a fuselage of constant cross-section. This lent itself to easy stretching into the later <b><!--del_lnk--> DC-6</b> and <b><!--del_lnk--> DC-7</b>. 1,163 DC-4s were built for the United States military services between 1942 and 1946. Douglas continued to develop the type during the war in preparation for a return to airline services when peace returned. However, the type&#39;s sales prospects were hit by the offloading of 500 wartime C-54s and R5Ds onto the civil market. DC-4&#39;s were a favorite of &quot;start up&quot; airlines (aka-nonschedueled or supplemental carriers) such as Great Lakes Airlines, North American Airlines, Universal Airlines, Transocean Airlines, etc. In the 1950&#39;s, Transocean Airlines (Oakland, California) was the largest operator of the DC-4.<p>Douglas built just 74 new-build aircraft before production ceased on <!--del_lnk--> August 9, <!--del_lnk--> 1947. Pressurization was available as an option, but all civilian DC-4s were built unpressurised.<p><a id="Derivatives" name="Derivatives"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Derivatives</span></h2>
      <p><b>DC4M North Star/Argonaut</b>. 71 DC-4s were built by <!--del_lnk--> Canadair under the designations <b>North Star</b>, <b>DC-4M</b>, <b>C-4</b>, and <b>C-5</b>. With the exception of the single C-5, these were all powered by <!--del_lnk--> Rolls-Royce Merlin engines and 51 of them were pressurized. The <!--del_lnk--> Royal Canadian Air Force, <!--del_lnk--> Trans-Canada Air Lines, <!--del_lnk--> Canadian Pacific Air Lines and <!--del_lnk--> BOAC operated these aircraft, the latter under the type name &quot;Argonaut&quot;.<p>Starting in 1959, 20 DC-4s found new life as <!--del_lnk--> ATL-98 Carvairs. The Carvair was designed to carry 22 passengers and 5 automobiles. This was accomplished by extending the fuselage, moving the cockpit above the fuselage, adding a side-opening nose, and enlarging the vertical stabilizer to offset the larger forward fuselage. These planes served as flying ferries well into the seventies.<p>The DC-4 proved a popular type and several remain in service today, particularly in the USA where it proved popular as charter/freight plane.<p><a id="Other_versions" name="Other_versions"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other versions</span></h3>
