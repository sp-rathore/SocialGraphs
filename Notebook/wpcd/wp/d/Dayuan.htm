The country of Dayuan is generally accepted as relating to the <!--del_lnk--> Ferghana Valley.<p>These Chinese accounts describe the Dayuan as urbanized dwellers with <!--del_lnk--> Caucasian features, living in walled cities and having &quot;customs identical to those of the <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Bactrians&quot;, a Hellenistic kingdom that was ruling <!--del_lnk--> Bactria at that time in today&rsquo;s northern Afghanistan. The Dayuan are also described as manufacturers and great lovers of wine.<p>The Dayuan were probably the descendants of the Greek colonies that were established by <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a> in <!--del_lnk--> Ferghana in 329 BCE, and prospered within the Hellenistic realm of the <!--del_lnk--> Seleucids and <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Bactrians, until they were isolated by the migrations of the <!--del_lnk--> Yueh-Chih around 160 BCE. It has also been suggested that the name &ldquo;Yuan&rdquo; was simply a transliteration of the words &ldquo;<!--del_lnk--> Yona&rdquo;, or &ldquo;<!--del_lnk--> Yavana&rdquo;, used throughout antiquity in Asia to designate Greeks (&ldquo;<!--del_lnk--> Ionians&rdquo;), so that Dayuan (lit. &ldquo;Great Yuan&rdquo;) would mean &quot;Great Ionians&quot;.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The interaction between the Dayuan and the Chinese is historically crucial, since it represents one of the first major contacts between an urbanized <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Aryan culture and the Chinese civilization, opening the way to the formation of the <!--del_lnk--> Silk Road that was to link the East and the West in material and cultural exchange from the 1st century BCE to the 15th century.<p>

      <p>The region of Ferghana was conquered by <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a> in 329 BCE and became his most advanced base in Central Asia. He founded the fortified city of <!--del_lnk--> Alexandria Eschate (Lit. &ldquo;Alexandria the Furthest&rdquo;) in the southwestern part of the <!--del_lnk--> Ferghana valley, on the southern bank of the river <!--del_lnk--> Syr Darya (ancient <!--del_lnk--> Jaxartes), at the location of the modern city of <!--del_lnk--> Khujand (also called Khozdent, formerly Leninabad), in the state of <a href="../../wp/t/Tajikistan.htm" title="Tajikistan">Tajikistan</a>. Alexander built a 6 kilometer long brick wall around the city and, as for the other cities he founded, had a garrison of his retired veterans and wounded settle there.<p>The whole of <!--del_lnk--> Bactria, <!--del_lnk--> Transoxiana and the area of <!--del_lnk--> Ferghana remained under the control of the Hellenistic <!--del_lnk--> Seleucid Empire until 250 BCE. The region then wrested independence under the leadership of its governor <!--del_lnk--> Diodotus of Bactria, to become the <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Bactrian Kingdom.<p><a id="Greco-Bactrian_kingdom_.28250.E2.80.93160_BCE.29" name="Greco-Bactrian_kingdom_.28250.E2.80.93160_BCE.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Greco-Bactrian kingdom (250&ndash;160 BCE)</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Bactrians held their territory, and according to the Greek historian <!--del_lnk--> Strabo even went beyond Alexandria Eschate and <i>&quot;extended their empire as far as the <!--del_lnk--> Seres (<a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>) and the <!--del_lnk--> Phryni&quot;</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Strabo XI.XI.I). There are indications that they may have led expeditions as far as <!--del_lnk--> Kashgar in <!--del_lnk--> Chinese Turkestan, leading to the first known contacts between China and the West around 200 BC. Various statuettes and representations of Greek soldiers have been found north of the <!--del_lnk--> Tien Shan, and are today on display in the museum of <!--del_lnk--> Urumqi (Boardman).<p>Around 160 BC, the area of Ferghana seems to have been invaded by <!--del_lnk--> Saka tribes (called the Sai-Wang by the Chinese). The Sai-Wang, originally settled in the <!--del_lnk--> Ili valley in the general area of Lake <a href="../../wp/i/Issyk_Kul.htm" title="Issyk Kul">Issyk Kul</a>, were retreating southward after having been dislodged by <!--del_lnk--> Yuezhi (who themselves were fleeing from the <!--del_lnk--> Xiongnu):<div class="thumb tright">

Dayuan had probably by then become a caste of nomadic people ruling over a pre-existing agricultural population.<p>Also in 106&ndash;101 BCE, during their conflict against China, the country of Dayuan is said to have been an ally with the neighbouring tribes of the Kang-Kiu (<!--del_lnk--> Sogdians). The Chinese also record the name of the king of Dayuan as &quot;Mu-Kua&quot;, a Saka name rendered in Greek as Mauakes or Maues (another Scythian ruler by the name of <!--del_lnk--> Maues is known as a ruler of the <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Scythian kingdom in northern India in the 1st century BCE).<p><a id="Yuezhi_by-pass_.28155_BCE.29" name="Yuezhi_by-pass_.28155_BCE.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Yuezhi by-pass (155 BCE)</span></h3>

      <p>Around 130 BCE, at the time of <a href="../../wp/z/Zhang_Qian.htm" title="Zhang Qian">Zhang Qian</a>&rsquo;s embassy to Central Asia, the Dayuan were described as inhabitants of a region corresponding to the <!--del_lnk--> Ferghana, to the west of the Chinese empire. &ldquo;The capital of the kingdom of Dayuan is the city of Guishan (<!--del_lnk--> Khujand), distant from <!--del_lnk--> Chang&#39;an 12,550 <!--del_lnk--> li. The kingdom contains 60,000 families, comprising a population of 300,000, with 60,000 trained troops, a Viceroy, and a National Assistant Prince. The seat of the Governor General lies to the east at a distance of 4,031 li.&rdquo; (Han Shu)<p>To their south-west were the territories of the <!--del_lnk--> Yuezhi, with the <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Bactrians further south still, beyond the <!--del_lnk--> Oxus. &ldquo;The great Yueh-chih is situated about 2000 or 3000 li west of Dayuan; they dwell north of the river Kuei (<!--del_lnk--> Oxus). To the south of them there is <!--del_lnk--> Daxia (<!--del_lnk--> Bactrians), to the west, Anxis (<!--del_lnk--> Parthians); to the north Kanzhu (<!--del_lnk--> Sogdians).&rdquo; (<!--del_lnk--> Shiji, 123.5b)<p>The Shiji then explains that the Yueh-Chih originally inhabited the area <i>East</i> of the Dayuan, in the <!--del_lnk--> Tarim Basin, before they suffered a crushing defeat against the Xiongnu and their leader <!--del_lnk--> Mao-tun in 176 BCE, forcing them to go beyond the territory of the Dayuan and resettle in the West by the banks of the <!--del_lnk--> Oxus, between the territory of the Dayuan and <!--del_lnk--> Bactria to the south.<p><a id="Urbanized_city-dwellers" name="Urbanized_city-dwellers"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Urbanized city-dwellers</span></h3>
      <p>The customs of the Dayuan are said by <a href="../../wp/z/Zhang_Qian.htm" title="Zhang Qian">Zhang Qian</a> to be identical to those of the Bactrians in the south, who actually formed the <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Bactrian Kingdom at that time.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>&ldquo;Their customs (the Bactrians) are the same as those of Dayuan. The people have fixed abodes and live in walled cities and regular houses like the people of Dayuan. They have no great kings or heads, but everywhere in their walled cities and settlements they have installed small kings.&rdquo; (<!--del_lnk--> Shiji, 123.3b)<p>They are described as town-dwellers, as opposed to other populations such as the <!--del_lnk--> Yuezhi, the <!--del_lnk--> Wun-Sun or the <!--del_lnk--> Xiongnu who were nomads. &ldquo;They (the Dayuan) have walled cities and houses; the large and small cities belonging to them, fully seventy in number, contain an aggregate population of several hundreds of thousands&hellip;There are more than seventy other cities in the country.&rdquo; (Han Shu)<p><a id="Appearance_and_Culture" name="Appearance_and_Culture"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Appearance and Culture</span></h3>
      <p>The Shiji comments on the Caucasian-like appearance and the culture of the people around Dayuan: &ldquo;The peoples west of Dayuan to Anxi (Parthia) have deep sunken eyes, and bushy beards and whiskers. They are clever traders, and dispute about the division of a farthing. Women are honorably treated among them, and their husbands are guided by them in their decisions.&rdquo; (<!--del_lnk--> Shiji, 123)<p>They were great manufacturers and lovers of <a href="../../wp/w/Wine.htm" title="Wine">wine</a>, a characteristic often associated with <!--del_lnk--> Greeks: &ldquo;Round about Dayuan they make wine from <!--del_lnk--> grapes. Wealthy people store up as much as 10,000 stones and over in their cellars, and keep it for several tens of years without spoiling. The people are fond of wine.&rdquo; (<!--del_lnk--> Shiji, 123).<p><a id="Influence" name="Influence"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Influence</span></h3>
      <p>According to the Shiji, grapes and <!--del_lnk--> alfalfa were introduced to China from Dayuan following Zhang Qian&#39;s embassy: &quot;The Han envoys brought back grape and alfalfa seeds to China, and the emperor for the first time tried growing these plants in areas of rich soil.&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> Shiji, 123) These were probably <i><!--del_lnk--> Vitis vinifera</i> <!--del_lnk--> , as wild vine &quot;mountain grapes&quot; like <i><!--del_lnk--> Vitis thunbergii</i> were being used for wine making in China before that time <!--del_lnk--> .<p>The Shiji also claims that metal <!--del_lnk--> casting was introduced to the Dayuan region by Han <!--del_lnk--> deserters: &quot;... the casting of coins and vessels was formerly unknown. Later, however, when some of the Chinese soldiers attached to the Han embassies ran away and surrendered to the people of the area, they taught them how to cast metal and manufacture weapons.&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> Shiji, 123)<p><a id="Relations_with_China" name="Relations_with_China"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Relations with China</span></h3>
      <p>Following the reports of Zhang Qian (who was originally sent to obtain an alliance with the <!--del_lnk--> Yuezhi against the <!--del_lnk--> Xiongnu, in vain), the Chinese emperor <!--del_lnk--> Wudi became interested in developing commercial relationships with the sophisticated urban civilizations of Ferghana, Bactria and Parthia: &ldquo;The Son of Heaven on hearing all this reasoned thus: Ferghana (Dayuan) and the possessions of Bactria and Parthia are large countries, full of rare things, with a population living in fixed abodes and given to occupations somewhat identical with those of the Chinese people, but with weak armies, and placing great value on the rich produce of China&rdquo; (<!--del_lnk--> Shiji, 123)<p>The Chinese subsequently sent numerous embassies, around ten every year, to these countries and as far as <!--del_lnk--> Seleucid Syria. &ldquo;Thus more embassies were dispatched to An-si [<!--del_lnk--> Parthia], An-ts&#39;ai [the Aorsi, or <!--del_lnk--> Alans], Li-kan [Syria under the <!--del_lnk--> Seleucids], T&#39;iau-chi [<!--del_lnk--> Chaldea], and Shon-tu [<a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>]&hellip; As a rule, rather more than ten such missions went forward in the course of a year, and at the least five or six.&rdquo; (<!--del_lnk--> Shiji, 123)<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The Chinese were also strongly attracted by the tall and powerful horses (&quot;heavenly horses&quot;) in the possession of the Dayuan, which were of capital importance to fight the nomad Xiongnu. After the refusal of the Dayuan to offer them enough horses, the Chinese sent an army in 104 BC/BCE under general <!--del_lnk--> Li Guangli. They failed, essentially through lack of preparation and because they underestimated their adversaries: &ldquo;The army of Yuan is weak; if we attack it with no more than three thousand Chinese soldiers using crossbows, we shall be sure to vanquish it completely.&rdquo; (<!--del_lnk--> Shiji, 123)<p>They then sent a second army of 100,000 men to subdue them and finally obtained 3,000 horses through negotiation, although they did not manage to take the Dayuan capital: &ldquo;On its arrival there the Chinese army consisted of thirty thousand men. An army of Yuan gave battle, the victory being gained by the efficiency of the Chinese archery; and this caused the Yuan army to take refuge in their bulwarks and mount the city walls&hellip; After all, the Chinese were unable to enter the inner city, and, abandoning further action, the army was led back.&rdquo; (<!--del_lnk--> Shiji, 123)<p>Contacts with the West were re-established following the peace treaty with the Yuan. Ambassadors were once again sent to the West, caravans were sent to Bactria.<p><a id="An_era_of_East-West_trade_and_cultural_exchange" name="An_era_of_East-West_trade_and_cultural_exchange"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">An era of East-West trade and cultural exchange</span></h2>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Silk Road essentially came into being from the 1st century BC/BCE, following the efforts of China to consolidate a road to the Western world, both through direct settlements in the area of the <!--del_lnk--> Tarim Basin and diplomatic relations with the countries of the Dayuan, Parthians and Bactrians further west.<p>Intense trade followed soon, confirmed by the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Roman</a> craze for Chinese <!--del_lnk--> silk (supplied by the Parthians) from the 1st century BC, to the point that the <!--del_lnk--> Senate issued, in vain, several edicts to prohibit the wearing of silk, on economic and moral grounds. This is attested by at least three significant authors:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Strabo (64/ 63 BCE&ndash;c. 24 CE).<li><!--del_lnk--> Seneca the Younger (c. 3 BCE&ndash;65 CE).<li><!--del_lnk--> Pliny the Elder (23&ndash;79 CE).</ul>
      <p>This is also the time when the <!--del_lnk--> Buddhist faith and the <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Buddhist culture started to travel along the Silk Road, penetrating China from around the 1st century BCE.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayuan&quot;</div>
