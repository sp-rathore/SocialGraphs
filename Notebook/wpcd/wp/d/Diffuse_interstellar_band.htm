      <p><b>Diffuse interstellar bands</b> (DIBs) are <!--del_lnk--> absorption features seen in the <!--del_lnk--> spectra of <!--del_lnk--> astronomical objects in the <a href="../../wp/g/Galaxy.htm" title="Galaxy">Galaxy</a>. They are caused by the absorption of light by the <!--del_lnk--> interstellar medium. About 100 bands are seen, in <a href="../../wp/u/Ultraviolet.htm" title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a>, <!--del_lnk--> visible and <!--del_lnk--> infrared wavelengths.<p>The origin of DIBs was unknown and hotly disputed for many years, but currently they seem likely to be due mostly to <!--del_lnk--> polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other large <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon.htm" title="Carbon">carbon</a>-bearing molecules..<p>

      <p>Much astronomical work relies on the study of <!--del_lnk--> spectra - the light from <!--del_lnk--> astronomical objects dispersed using a <!--del_lnk--> prism or, more usually, a <!--del_lnk--> diffraction grating. A typical stellar spectrum will consist of a <!--del_lnk--> continuum, containing <!--del_lnk--> absorption lines, each of which is attributed to a particular <a href="../../wp/a/Atom.htm" title="Atom">atomic</a> <!--del_lnk--> energy level transition in the atmosphere of the star.<p>All astronomical objects are affected by <!--del_lnk--> extinction, the absorption of <a href="../../wp/p/Photon.htm" title="Photon">photons</a> by the <!--del_lnk--> interstellar medium. Interstellar absorption predominantly affects the whole spectrum in a continuous way, rather than causing absorption lines, but in <!--del_lnk--> 1921, astronomers first observed a number of line-like absorption features which seemed to be interstellar in origin.<p>Their interstellar nature was shown by the fact that the strength of the observed absorption was roughly proportional to the extinction, and that in objects with widely differing <!--del_lnk--> radial velocities the absorption bands were not affected by <!--del_lnk--> Doppler shifting, implying that the absorption was not occurring in or around the object concerned. The name Diffuse Interstellar Band, or DIB for short, was coined to reflect the fact that the absorption features are much broader than the normal absorption lines seen in stellar spectra.<p>The first DIBs observed were those at wavelengths 578.0 and 579.7&nbsp;nanometres. Other strong DIBs are seen at 628.4, 661.4 and 443.0&nbsp;nm. The 443.0&nbsp;nm DIB is particularly broad at about 1.2&nbsp;nm across - typical intrinsic stellar absorption features are 0.1 nm or less across.<p>Later <!--del_lnk--> spectroscopic studies at higher <!--del_lnk--> spectral resolution and sensitivity revealed more and more DIBs; a catalogue of them in <!--del_lnk--> 1975 contained 25 known DIBs, and a decade later the number known had more than doubled. Today over 300 have been detected, but none - identified.<p>In recent years, very high resolution <!--del_lnk--> spectrographs on the world&#39;s most powerful <a href="../../wp/t/Telescope.htm" title="Telescope">telescopes</a> have been used to observe and analyse DIBs. Spectral resolutions of 0.005&nbsp;nm are now routine using instruments at observatories such as the <!--del_lnk--> European Southern Observatory at <!--del_lnk--> Cerro Paranal, <a href="../../wp/c/Chile.htm" title="Chile">Chile</a>, and the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Australian Observatory in <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>, and at these high resolutions, many DIBs are found to contain considerable sub-structure.<p><a id="The_nature_of_the_carrier" name="The_nature_of_the_carrier"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The nature of the carrier</span></h2>
      <p>The great problem with DIBs, apparent from the earliest observations, was that their central wavelengths did not correspond with any known <!--del_lnk--> spectral lines of any <!--del_lnk--> ion or <!--del_lnk--> molecule, and so the material which was responsible for the absorption could not be identified. A large number of theories were advanced as the number of known DIBs grew, and determining the nature of the absorbing material (the &#39;carrier&#39;) became a crucial problem in <!--del_lnk--> astrophysics.<p>One important observational result is that the strengths of most DIBs are not correlated with each other. This means that there must be many carriers, rather than one carrier responsible for all DIBs. Also significant is that the strength of DIBs is broadly correlated with the extinction. Extinction is caused by <!--del_lnk--> dust in the interstellar medium, and so DIBs are likely to be also due to dust or something related to it.<p>The existence of sub-structure in DIBs supports the idea that they are caused by molecules. In a molecule containing, say, three <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon.htm" title="Carbon">carbon</a> atoms, some of the carbon will be in the form of the <!--del_lnk--> carbon-13 <!--del_lnk--> isotope, so that while most molecules will contain three <!--del_lnk--> carbon-12 atoms, some will contain two C<sup>12</sup> atoms and one C<sup>13</sup> atom, much less will contain one C<sup>12</sup> and two C<sup>13</sup>s, and a very small fraction will contain three C<sup>13</sup> molecules. Each of these forms of the molecule will create an absorption line at a slightly different rest wavelength.<p>The most likely candidate molecules for producing DIBs are thought to be large carbon-bearing molecules, which are common in the interstellar medium. <!--del_lnk--> Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, long carbon-chain molecules, and <!--del_lnk--> fullerenes are all potentially important. However, fully identifying the molecules responsible for each DIB is still very much a work in progress.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_interstellar_band&quot;</div>
