      <p>In physical <a href="../../wp/g/Geography.htm" title="Geography">geography</a>, a <b>dune</b> is a <!--del_lnk--> hill of <a href="../../wp/s/Sand.htm" title="Sand">sand</a> built by <!--del_lnk--> eolian processes. Bare dunes are subject to shifting location and size based on their interaction with the wind. The &quot;valley&quot; or trough between dunes is called a <i>slack</i>. A &quot;dune field&quot; is an area covered by extensive sand dunes. Large dune fields are known as <!--del_lnk--> ergs.<p>Some coastal areas have one or more sets of dunes running parallel to the shoreline directly inland from the <a href="../../wp/b/Beach.htm" title="Beach">beach</a>. In most such cases the dunes are important in protecting the land against potential ravages by storm waves from the <a href="../../wp/s/Sea.htm" title="Sea">sea</a>. Although the most widely distributed dunes are those associated with coastal regions, the largest complexes of dunes are found inland in dry regions and associated with ancient <!--del_lnk--> lake or <a href="../../wp/s/Sea.htm" title="Sea">sea</a> beds.<p>Dunes also form under the action of water flow (<!--del_lnk--> alluvial processes), on sand or <!--del_lnk--> gravel beds of <a href="../../wp/r/River.htm" title="River">rivers</a>, <!--del_lnk--> estuaries and the sea-bed.<p>The word &#39;dune&#39; derives from a <!--del_lnk--> medieval <!--del_lnk--> Germanic or <!--del_lnk--> Norse word - &quot;<i>dun</i>&quot;, a hill.<p>

      <p>The most common dune form on Earth (and on Mars) is the crescentic dune. Crescent-shaped mounds generally are wider than long. The slipface is on the dune&#39;s concave side. These dunes form under winds that blow from one direction, and they also are known as barchans, or transverse dunes. Some types of crescentic dunes move faster over <a href="../../wp/d/Desert.htm" title="Desert">desert</a> surfaces than any other type of dune. A group of dunes moved more than 100 meters per year between 1954 and 1959 in the <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">People&#39;s Republic of China</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Ningxia Province; similar rates have been recorded in the Western Desert of <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>. The largest crescentic dunes on Earth, with mean crest-to-crest widths of more than 3 kilometers, are in China&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Taklamakan Desert.<p><a id="Linear" name="Linear"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Linear</span></h3>
      <p>Straight or slightly sinuous sand ridges typically much longer than they are wide are known as linear dunes. They may be more than 160 kilometers long. Linear dunes may occur as isolated ridges, but they generally form sets of parallel ridges separated by miles of sand, gravel, or rocky interdune corridors. Some linear dunes merge to form Y-shaped compound dunes. Many form in bidirectional wind regimes. The long axes of these dunes extend in the resultant direction of sand movement.<p><a id="Star" name="Star"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Star</span></h3>
      <p>Radially symmetrical, star dunes are pyramidal sand mounds with slipfaces on three or more arms that radiate from the high centre of the mound. They tend to accumulate in areas with multidirectional wind regimes. Star dunes grow upward rather than laterally. They dominate the <!--del_lnk--> Grand Erg Oriental of the Sahara. In other deserts, they occur around the margins of the <!--del_lnk--> sand seas, particularly near topographic barriers. In the southeast <!--del_lnk--> Badain Jaran Desert of China, the star dunes are up to 500 meters tall and may be the tallest dunes on Earth.<p><a id="Dome" name="Dome"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Dome</span></h3>

      <p>U-shaped mounds of sand with convex noses trailed by elongated arms are parabolic dunes. Sometimes these dunes are called U-shaped, <!--del_lnk--> blowout, or hairpin dunes, and they are well known in coastal deserts. Unlike crescentic dunes, their crests point upwind. The elongated arms of parabolic dunes follow rather than lead because they have been fixed by vegetation, while the bulk of the sand in the dune migrates forward.<p><a id="Longitudinal_and_transverse_dunes" name="Longitudinal_and_transverse_dunes"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Longitudinal and transverse dunes</span></h3>

      </div>
      <p>Longitudinal dunes, also called Seif dunes, elongate parallel to the prevailing wind, possibly caused by a larger dune having its smaller sides blown away. Seif dunes are sharp-crested and are common in the Sahara. They range up to 300 m (900 ft) in height and 300 km (200 mi) in length.<p>Seif dunes are thought to develop from barchans if a change of wind direction occurs. The new wind direction will lead to the development of a new wing and the overdevelopment of one of the original wings. If the prevailing wind then becomes dominant for a lengthy period of time the dune will revert to its barchan form, with one exaggerated wing. Should the strong wind then return the exaggerated wing will further extend so that eventually it will be supplied with sand when the prevailing wind returns. The wing will continue to grow under both wind conditions, thus producing a seif dune. On a seif dune the slip face develops on the side facing away from the strong wind, while the slip face of a barchan faces the direction of movement. In the sheltered troughs between highly developed seif dunes barchans may be formed because the wind is unidirectional.<p>A transverse dune is perpendicular to the prevailing wind, probably caused by a steady buildup of sand on an already existing minuscule mound.<p><a id="Reversing_dunes" name="Reversing_dunes"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Reversing dunes</span></h3>

      <p>Occurring wherever winds periodically reverse direction, reversing dunes are varieties of any of the above shapes. These dunes typically have major and minor slipfaces oriented in opposite directions.<p>All these dune shapes may occur in three forms: simple, compound, and complex. Simple dunes are basic forms with a minimum number of slipfaces that define the geometric type. Compound dunes are large dunes on which smaller dunes of similar type and slipface orientation are superimposed, and complex dunes are combinations of two or more dune types. A crescentic dune with a star dune superimposed on its crest is the most common complex dune. Simple dunes represent a wind regime that has not changed in intensity or direction since the formation of the dune, while compound and complex dunes suggest that the intensity and direction of the wind has changed.<p><a id="Dune_types" name="Dune_types"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Dune types</span></h2>

      <p>Sub-aqueous (<!--del_lnk--> underwater) dunes form on a bed of sand or gravel under the actions of water flow. They are ubiquitous in natural <!--del_lnk--> channels such as rivers and estuaries, and also form in engineered <a href="../../wp/c/Canal.htm" title="Canal">canals</a> and pipelines. Dunes move downstream as the upstream slope is eroded and the sediment deposited on the downstream or lee slope.<p>These dunes most often form as a continuous &#39;train&#39; of dunes, showing remarkable similarity in <!--del_lnk--> wavelength and height.<p>Dunes on the bed of a channel significantly increase flow resistance, their presence and growth playing a major part in river <!--del_lnk--> flooding.<p><a id="Lithified_dunes" name="Lithified_dunes"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Lithified dunes</span></h3>
      <p>A <!--del_lnk--> lithified (consolidated) sand dune is a type of <!--del_lnk--> sandstone that is formed when a marine or eolian sand dune becomes compacted and hardened. Once in this form, water passing through the rock can carry and deposit minerals, which can alter the hue of the rock. Cross-bedded layers of stacks of lithified dunes can produce the cross-hatching patterns, such as those seen in <a href="../../wp/z/Zion_National_Park.htm" title="Zion National Park">Zion National Park</a>.<p>A local slang term used for these consolidated dunes is &quot;slickrock&quot;, a name that was introduced by pioneers of the old west because their steel-rimmed wagon wheels could not gain purchase on the rock.<p><a id="Coastal_dunes" name="Coastal_dunes"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Coastal dunes</span></h3>

      <p>Dunes form on coasts where the backshore can support and onshore winds encourage the accumulation of sand blown inland from off a beach. Any part of the upper beach, once dry, can lose sand to the wind, especially if the sand is fine, and dune formation proceeds in the direction towards which the predominant wind direction is blowing.<p>Dunes provide <!--del_lnk--> privacy and shelter from the <a href="../../wp/w/Wind.htm" title="Wind">wind</a>.<p><a id="Ecological_succession_on_coastal_dunes" name="Ecological_succession_on_coastal_dunes"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Ecological succession on coastal dunes</span></h4>
      <p>As a dune forms, plant <!--del_lnk--> succession occurs. The conditions on an <i>embryo dune</i> are harsh, with <!--del_lnk--> salt spray from the sea carried on strong winds. The dune is well drained and often dry. Rotting <!--del_lnk--> seaweed, brought in by storm waves adds nutrients to allow <!--del_lnk--> pioneer species to colonize the dune. These pioneer species are <!--del_lnk--> marram grass, <!--del_lnk--> sea wort grass and other sea grasses in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">UK</a>. These plants are well adapted to the harsh conditions of the fore-dune, typically having deep roots which reach the <!--del_lnk--> water table, <!--del_lnk--> root nodules that produce <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen.htm" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a> compounds, and protected <!--del_lnk--> stoma, reducing <!--del_lnk--> transpiration. Also, the deep roots bind the sand together, and the dune grows into a <!--del_lnk--> fore dune as more sand is blown over the grasses. The grasses add <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen.htm" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a> to the soil, meaning other, less hardy plants can then colonize the dunes. Typically these are <!--del_lnk--> heathers and <!--del_lnk--> gorses. These too are adapted to the low soil water content and have small, prickly leaves which reduce transpiration. Heathers add <a href="../../wp/h/Humus.htm" title="Humus">humus</a> to the soil, but have a <!--del_lnk--> pH of lower than 7, so make the soil slightly <!--del_lnk--> acidic. Heathers are usually replaced by <!--del_lnk--> coniferous trees which can tolerate the low <!--del_lnk--> pH. Coniferous forests and <!--del_lnk--> heathland are common <!--del_lnk--> climax communities for sand dune systems.<p>Young dunes are called <!--del_lnk--> yellow dunes, dunes which have high humus content are called <!--del_lnk--> grey dunes. Leaching occurs on the dunes, washing humus into the slacks, and the slacks may be much more developed than the exposed tops of the dunes.<p>For the <a href="../../wp/s/Snow.htm" title="Snow">snow</a> analogue to a sand dune see <!--del_lnk--> sastruga.<p><a id="Desertification" name="Desertification"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Desertification</span></h2>

      <p>One of the biggest problems posed by sand dunes is their encroachment on human habitats. Sand dunes move through a few different means, all of them helped along by wind. One way that dunes can move is through <!--del_lnk--> saltation, where sand particles skip along the ground like a rock thrown across a pond might skip across the water&#39;s surface. When these skipping particles land, they may knock into other particles and cause them to skip as well. With slightly stronger winds, particles collide in mid-air, causing <!--del_lnk--> sheet flows. In a major <!--del_lnk--> dust storm, dunes may move tens of meters through such sheet flows. And like snow, sand <a href="../../wp/a/Avalanche.htm" title="Avalanche">avalanches</a>, falling down the steep slopes of the dunes that face away from the winds, also moving the dunes forward.<p>Sand threatens buildings and crops in Africa, the Middle East and China. Drenching sand dunes with oil stops their migration, but this approach is highly destructive to the dunes habitat and uses a finite resource. <!--del_lnk--> Sand fences might also work, but researchers are still analyzing optimum fence designs. Preventing sand dunes from overwhelming cities and agricultural areas has become a priority for the <!--del_lnk--> United Nations Environment Programme.<p><a id="Examples" name="Examples"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Examples</span></h2>

      <p>Dunes can likely be found in any environment where there is a substantial atmosphere, winds, and dust to be blown. Dunes are common on <!--del_lnk--> Mars, and have also been observed in the equatorial regions of <!--del_lnk--> Titan by the <!--del_lnk--> Cassini probe&#39;s radar.<p>Titan&#39;s dunes include large expanses with modal lengths of about 20-30 km. The regions are not topographically confined, resembling sand seas. These dunes are interpreted to be longitudinal dunes whose crests are oriented parallel to the dominant wind direction, which generally indicates west-to-east wind flow. The sand is likely composed of hydrocarbon particles, possibly with some water ice mixed in.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune&quot;</div>
