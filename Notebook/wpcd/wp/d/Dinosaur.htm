      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> taxon <b>Dinosauria</b> was formally named by the <!--del_lnk--> English <!--del_lnk--> palaeontologist <!--del_lnk--> Richard Owen in 1842 as &quot;a distinct tribe or suborder of Saurian reptiles&quot;. The term is derived from the <!--del_lnk--> Greek words &delta;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;&#x3CC;&sigmaf; (<i>deinos</i> meaning &quot;terrible&quot;, &quot;fearsome&quot; or &quot;formidable&quot;) and &sigma;&alpha;&#x3CD;&rho;&alpha; (<i>saura</i> meaning &quot;lizard&quot; or &quot;reptile&quot;). Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.<p>Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed. Some were <a href="../../wp/h/Herbivore.htm" title="Herbivore">herbivorous</a>, others <a href="../../wp/c/Carnivore.htm" title="Carnivore">carnivorous</a>. Some dinosaurs were <!--del_lnk--> bipeds, some were <!--del_lnk--> quadrupeds, and others, such as <i><a href="../../wp/a/Ammosaurus.htm" title="Ammosaurus">Ammosaurus</a></i> and <i><a href="../../wp/i/Iguanodon.htm" title="Iguanodon">Iguanodon</a></i>, could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.<p><b>Dinosaur <!--del_lnk--> synapomorphies</b><p>All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral <!--del_lnk--> archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.<p>Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the <!--del_lnk--> manus (&#39;hand&#39;), reduced number of digits on the <!--del_lnk--> pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate <!--del_lnk--> acetabulum (hip socket with a hole at its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all <!--del_lnk--> tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.<p><b>Other shared anatomical features</b><p>Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a <!--del_lnk--> diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.<p>The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or &#39;underslung&#39;. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other &#39;sprawled&#39; reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.<div class="thumb tleft">

      </div>
      <p><b>Taxonomic definition</b><p>Under <!--del_lnk--> phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of <i><a href="../../wp/t/Triceratops.htm" title="Triceratops">Triceratops</a></i> and modern <!--del_lnk--> birds. They are divided into <a href="../../wp/o/Ornithischia.htm" title="Ornithischia">Ornithischia</a> (<i>bird-hipped</i>) and <a href="../../wp/s/Saurischia.htm" title="Saurischia">Saurischia</a> (<i>lizard-hipped</i>), depending upon <!--del_lnk--> pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) <!--del_lnk--> pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only. Ornithischia includes all <!--del_lnk--> taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with <i>Triceratops</i> than with Saurischia, while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with <i>birds</i> than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of <i><!--del_lnk--> Megalosaurus</i> and <i><a href="../../wp/i/Iguanodon.htm" title="Iguanodon">Iguanodon</a></i>, because these were two of the three genera cited by Richard Owen when he recognized the Dinosauria.<p>There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that <a href="../../wp/b/Bird.htm" title="Bird">birds</a> are the descendants of <a href="../../wp/t/Theropoda.htm" title="Theropoda">theropod</a> dinosaurs. Using the strict <!--del_lnk--> cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds <i>are</i> dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern <a href="../../wp/b/Bird.htm" title="Bird">birds</a> are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup <!--del_lnk--> Maniraptora, which are <!--del_lnk--> coelurosaurs, which are <a href="../../wp/t/Theropoda.htm" title="Theropoda">theropods</a>, which are <a href="../../wp/s/Saurischia.htm" title="Saurischia">saurischians</a>, which are dinosaurs.<p>However, referring to birds as &#39;avian dinosaurs&#39; and to all other dinosaurs as &#39;non-avian dinosaurs&#39; is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among <!--del_lnk--> ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older <!--del_lnk--> Linnaean classification system, which accepts <!--del_lnk--> paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use <!--del_lnk--> cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.<p>For clarity, this article will use &#39;dinosaur&#39; as a synonym for &#39;non-avian dinosaur&#39;, and &#39;bird&#39; as a synonym for &#39;avian dinosaur&#39; (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of <i><a href="../../wp/a/Archaeopteryx.htm" title="Archaeopteryx">Archaeopteryx</a></i> and modern birds). The term &#39;non-avian dinosaur&#39; will be used for emphasis as needed. It should be noted that this article&#39;s definition of &#39;bird&#39; differs from the definition common in everyday language; to most non-scientists, a &#39;bird&#39; is simply a two-legged animal with wings and feathers.<p><a id="Size" name="Size"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Size</span></h3>
      <p>While the evidence is incomplete, it is clear that, as a group, dinosaurs were large. Even by dinosaur standards, the <!--del_lnk--> sauropods were gigantic. For much of the dinosaur era, the smallest sauropods were larger than anything else in their habitat, and the largest were an <!--del_lnk--> order of magnitude more massive than anything else that has since walked the Earth. Giant prehistoric <a href="../../wp/m/Mammal.htm" title="Mammal">mammals</a> such as the <i><a href="../../wp/i/Indricotherium.htm" title="Indricotherium">Indricotherium</a></i> and the Columbian <a href="../../wp/m/Mammoth.htm" title="Mammoth">mammoth</a> were dwarfed by the giant sauropods, and only a handful of modern aquatic animals approach or surpass them in size &mdash; most notably the <!--del_lnk--> blue whale, which reaches up to 190,000 kg (209 tons) and 33.5 m (110 ft) in length.<p>Most dinosaurs, however, were much smaller than the giant sauropods. Current evidence suggests that dinosaur average size varied through the Triassic, early Jurassic, late Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. According to paleontologist Bill Erickson, estimates of median dinosaur weight range from 500 kg to 5 <!--del_lnk--> tonnes; a recent study of 63 dinosaur genera yielded an average weight greater than 850 kg &mdash; comparable to the weight of a grizzly bear &mdash; and a median weight of nearly 2 tons, or about as much as a giraffe. This contrasts sharply with the size of modern mammals; on average, mammals weigh only 863 grams, or about as much as a large rodent. The smallest dinosaur was bigger than two-thirds of all current mammals; the majority of dinosaurs were bigger than all but 2% of living mammals.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p><b>Largest and smallest dinosaurs</b><p>Only a tiny percentage of animals ever fossilize, and most of these remain buried in the earth. Few of the specimens that are recovered are complete skeletons, and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare. Rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar, better-known species is an inexact art, and reconstructing the muscles and other organs of the living animal is, at best, a process of educated guesswork. As a result, scientists will probably never be certain of the <!--del_lnk--> largest and smallest dinosaurs.<div class="thumb tright">

The largest <a href="../../wp/h/Herbivore.htm" title="Herbivore">herbivorous</a> specimens on record were all discovered in the 1970s or later, and include the massive <i><!--del_lnk--> Argentinosaurus</i>, which may have weighed 80,000&ndash;100,000 kg (88&ndash;121 tons); the longest, the 40 m (130 ft) long <i><!--del_lnk--> Supersaurus</i>; and the tallest, the 18 m (60 ft) <i><a href="../../wp/s/Sauroposeidon.htm" title="Sauroposeidon">Sauroposeidon</a></i>, which could have reached a sixth-floor window.

      <p>Interpretations of dinosaur behaviour are generally based on the pose of body fossils and their <!--del_lnk--> habitat, <!--del_lnk--> computer simulations of their <!--del_lnk--> biomechanics, and comparisons with modern animals in similar <!--del_lnk--> ecological niches.

However, there is general agreement that some behaviors which are common in crocodiles and birds, dinosaurs&#39; closest living relatives, were also common among dinosaurs.<p>The first perceived direct evidence of <!--del_lnk--> herding behaviour was the 1878 discovery of 31 <i><a href="../../wp/i/Iguanodon.htm" title="Iguanodon">Iguanodon</a></i> dinosaurs which were thought to have perished together in <!--del_lnk--> Bernissart, <a href="../../wp/b/Belgium.htm" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>, after they fell into a deep, flooded <!--del_lnk--> sinkhole and drowned. Despite the deposition of those skeletons being now regarded as more gradual, other, well supported, mass death sites were subsequently discovered. Those, along with multiple trackways, suggest that <!--del_lnk--> herd or <!--del_lnk--> pack behaviour was common in many dinosaur species. Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that <!--del_lnk--> duck-bills (hadrosaurids) may have moved in great herds, like the <!--del_lnk--> American Bison or the African <!--del_lnk--> Springbok. Sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species, at least in <a href="../../wp/o/Oxford.htm" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>, England, and others kept their young in the middle of the herd for defense according to trackways at Davenport Ranch, <!--del_lnk--> Texas. Dinosaurs may have congregated in herds for defense, for <!--del_lnk--> migratory purposes, or to provide protection for their young.<p><!--del_lnk--> Jack Horner&#39;s 1978 discovery of a <i><a href="../../wp/m/Maiasaura.htm" title="Maiasaura">Maiasaura</a></i> (&quot;good mother dinosaur&quot;) <!--del_lnk--> nesting ground in <!--del_lnk--> Montana demonstrated that parental care continued long after birth among the <!--del_lnk--> ornithopods. There is also evidence that other Cretaceous-era dinosaurs, like the <!--del_lnk--> Patagonian sauropod <i><a href="../../wp/s/Saltasaurus.htm" title="Saltasaurus">Saltasaurus</a></i> (1997 discovery), had similar nesting behaviors, and that the animals congregated in huge nesting colonies like those of <a href="../../wp/p/Penguin.htm" title="Penguin">penguins</a>. The <a href="../../wp/m/Mongolia.htm" title="Mongolia">Mongolian</a> <!--del_lnk--> maniraptoran <i><a href="../../wp/o/Oviraptor.htm" title="Oviraptor">Oviraptor</a></i> was discovered in a <a href="../../wp/c/Chicken.htm" title="Chicken">chicken</a>-like <!--del_lnk--> brooding position in 1993, which may mean it was covered with an insulating layer of feathers that kept the <!--del_lnk--> eggs warm. Trackways have also confirmed parental behaviour among sauropods and ornithopods from the <!--del_lnk--> Isle of Skye in northwestern <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>. Nests and eggs have been found for most major groups of dinosaurs, and it appears likely that dinosaurs communicated with their young, in a manner similar to modern birds and crocodiles.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> crests and frills of some dinosaurs, like the <!--del_lnk--> marginocephalians, <!--del_lnk--> theropods and <!--del_lnk--> lambeosaurines, may have been too fragile to be used for active defense, so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and <!--del_lnk--> territorialism. The nature of dinosaur <!--del_lnk--> communication also remains enigmatic, and is an active area of research. For example, recent evidence suggests that the hollow crests of the lambeosaurines may have functioned as <!--del_lnk--> resonance chambers used for a wide range of <!--del_lnk--> vocalizations.<p>From a behavioural standpoint, one of the most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the <!--del_lnk--> Gobi Desert in 1971. It included a <i><a href="../../wp/v/Velociraptor.htm" title="Velociraptor">Velociraptor</a></i> attacking a <i><a href="../../wp/p/Protoceratops.htm" title="Protoceratops">Protoceratops</a></i>, proving that dinosaurs did indeed attack and eat each other. While <!--del_lnk--> cannibalistic behaviour among <!--del_lnk--> theropods is no surprise, this too was confirmed by tooth marks from Madagascar in 2003.<p>There seem to have been no burrowing species of dinosaur and few climbing species. This is somewhat surprising when compared to the later mammalian radiation in the <!--del_lnk--> Cenozoic, which included many species of these types. As to how the animals moved, <!--del_lnk--> biomechanics has provided significant insight. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs&#39; skeletal structure have demonstrated how fast dinosaurs could run, whether <!--del_lnk--> diplodocids could create <!--del_lnk--> sonic booms via <!--del_lnk--> whip-like tail snapping, whether giant theropods had to slow down when rushing for food to avoid fatal injuries, and if sauropods could float.<p><a id="Evolution_of_dinosaurs" name="Evolution_of_dinosaurs"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Evolution of dinosaurs</span></h2>

      <p>Dinosaurs diverged from their <!--del_lnk--> archosaur ancestors approximately 230 million years ago during the Middle to Late <a href="../../wp/t/Triassic.htm" title="Triassic">Triassic</a> period, roughly 20 million years after the <!--del_lnk--> Permian-Triassic extinction event wiped out an estimated 95% of all life on Earth. <!--del_lnk--> Radiometric dating of fossils from the early dinosaur <!--del_lnk--> genus <i><!--del_lnk--> Eoraptor</i> establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time.

      <p>The field of dinosaur research has enjoyed a surge in activity that began in the 1970s and is ongoing.

      <p><i>Main article</i>: <!--del_lnk--> Dinosaur classification<p>Dinosaurs (including birds) are <!--del_lnk--> archosaurs, like modern <!--del_lnk--> crocodilians. Archosaurs&#39; <!--del_lnk--> diapsid skulls have two holes located where the jaw muscles attach, called <!--del_lnk--> temporal fenestrae. Most reptiles (including birds) are diapsids; mammals, with only one temporal fenestra, are called <!--del_lnk--> synapsids; and <a href="../../wp/t/Turtle.htm" title="Turtle">turtles</a>, with no temporal fenestra, are <!--del_lnk--> anapsids. Anatomically, dinosaurs share many other archosaur characteristics, including teeth that grow from sockets rather than as direct extensions of the jawbones. Within the archosaur group, dinosaurs are differentiated most noticeably by their gait. Dinosaur legs extend directly beneath the body, whereas the legs of lizards and crocodylians sprawl out to either side. All dinosaurs were land animals.<p>Many other types of reptiles lived at the same time as the dinosaurs. Some of these are commonly, but incorrectly, thought of as dinosaurs, including <a href="../../wp/p/Plesiosaur.htm" title="Plesiosaur">plesiosaurs</a> (which are not closely related to the dinosaurs) and <!--del_lnk--> pterosaurs, which developed separately from reptilian ancestors in the late Triassic period.<p>Collectively, dinosaurs are usually regarded as a <!--del_lnk--> superorder or an unranked <!--del_lnk--> clade. They are divided into two <!--del_lnk--> orders, the <i><a href="../../wp/s/Saurischia.htm" title="Saurischia">Saurischia</a></i> and the <i><a href="../../wp/o/Ornithischia.htm" title="Ornithischia">Ornithischia</a></i>, on the basis of their hip structure. Saurischians (&#39;lizard-hipped&#39;, from the <!--del_lnk--> Greek <i>sauros</i> (<i>&sigma;&alpha;&upsilon;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</i>) meaning &#39;lizard&#39; and <i>ischion</i> (<i>&iota;&sigma;&chi;&iota;&omicron;&nu;</i>) meaning &#39;hip joint&#39;) are dinosaurs that originally retained the hip structure of their ancestors. They include all the <a href="../../wp/t/Theropoda.htm" title="Theropoda">theropods</a> (bipedal <a href="../../wp/c/Carnivore.htm" title="Carnivore">carnivores</a>) and <!--del_lnk--> sauropods (long-necked <a href="../../wp/h/Herbivore.htm" title="Herbivore">herbivores</a>). Ornithischians (&#39;bird-hipped&#39;, from the <!--del_lnk--> Greek <i>ornitheos</i> (<i>&omicron;&rho;&nu;&iota;&theta;&epsilon;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;</i>) meaning &#39;of a bird&#39; and <i>ischion</i> (<i>&iota;&sigma;&chi;&iota;&omicron;&nu;</i>) meaning &#39;hip joint&#39;) is the other dinosaurian order, most of which were <!--del_lnk--> quadrupedal herbivores. (<b>NB:</b> the terms &quot;lizard hip&quot; and &quot;bird-hip&quot; are misnomers &mdash; birds evolved from dinosaurs with &quot;lizard hips&quot;.)<center>

      <p>A vigorous debate on the subject of temperature regulation in dinosaurs has been ongoing since the 1960s. Originally, scientists broadly disagreed as to whether dinosaurs were capable of regulating their body temperatures at all. More recently, dinosaur <!--del_lnk--> endothermy has become the consensus view, and debate has focused on the mechanisms of temperature regulation.<p>After dinosaurs were discovered, paleontologists first posited that they were <!--del_lnk--> ectothermic creatures: &quot;terrible <!--del_lnk--> lizards&quot; as their name suggests. This supposed cold-bloodedness implied that dinosaurs were relatively slow, sluggish organisms, comparable to modern reptiles, which need external sources of heat in order to regulate their body temperature. Dinosaur ectothermy remained a prevalent view until <!--del_lnk--> Robert T. &quot;Bob&quot; Bakker, an early proponent of dinosaur endothermy, published an influential paper on the topic in 1968.<p>Modern evidence indicates that dinosaurs thrived in cooler temperate climates, and that at least some dinosaur species must have regulated their body temperature by internal biological means (perhaps aided by the animals&#39; bulk). Evidence of <!--del_lnk--> endothermism in dinosaurs includes the discovery of <!--del_lnk--> polar dinosaurs in Australia and <a href="../../wp/a/Antarctica.htm" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> (where they would have experienced a cold, dark six-month winter), the discovery of dinosaurs whose feathers may have provided regulatory insulation, and analysis of blood-vessel structures that are typical of endotherms within dinosaur bone. Skeletal structures suggest that theropods and other dinosaurs had active lifestyles better suited to an endothermic cardiovascular system, while sauropods exhibit fewer endothermic characteristics. It is certainly possible that some dinosaurs were endothermic while others were not. Scientific debate over the specifics continues.<p>Complicating the debate is the fact that warm-bloodedness can emerge based on more than one mechanism. Most discussions of dinosaur endothermy tend to compare them to average birds or mammals, which expend energy to elevate body temperature above that of the environment. Small birds and mammals also possess <!--del_lnk--> insulation, such as <!--del_lnk--> fat, <!--del_lnk--> fur, or <a href="../../wp/f/Feather.htm" title="Feather">feathers</a>, which slows down heat loss. However, large mammals, such as elephants, face a different problem because of their relatively small ratio of surface area to volume (<!--del_lnk--> Haldane&#39;s principle). This ratio compares the volume of an animal with the area of its skin: as an animal gets bigger, its surface area increases more slowly than its volume. At a certain point, the amount of heat radiated away through the skin drops below the amount of heat produced inside the body, forcing animals to use additional methods to avoid overheating. In the case of elephants, they are hairless, and have large ears which increase their surface area, and have behavioural adaptations as well (such as using the trunk to spray water on themselves and mud wallowing). These behaviors increase cooling through evaporation.<p>Large dinosaurs would presumably have had to deal with similar issues; their body size suggest they lost heat relatively slowly to the surrounding air, and so could have been what are called <!--del_lnk--> inertial homeotherms, animals that are warmer than their environments through sheer size rather than through special adaptations like those of birds or mammals. However, so far this theory fails to account for the vast number of dog- and goat-sized dinosaur species which made up the bulk of the ecosystem during the Mesozoic period.<p><a id="Feathered_dinosaurs_and_the_bird_connection" name="Feathered_dinosaurs_and_the_bird_connection"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Feathered dinosaurs and the bird connection</span></h3>

      <p><i><a href="../../wp/a/Archaeopteryx.htm" title="Archaeopteryx">Archaeopteryx</a></i>, the first good example of a &quot;feathered dinosaur&quot;, was discovered in 1861. The initial specimen was found in the <!--del_lnk--> Solnhofen limestone in southern Germany, which is a <i><!--del_lnk--> lagerst&auml;tte</i>, a rare and remarkable geological formation known for its superbly detailed fossils. Archaeopteryx is a <!--del_lnk--> transitional fossil, with features clearly intermediate between those of modern reptiles and birds. Brought to light just two years after Darwin&#39;s seminal <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Origin_of_Species.htm" title="The Origin of Species">The Origin of Species</a></i>, its discovery spurred the nascent debate between proponents of <!--del_lnk--> evolutionary biology and <a href="../../wp/c/Creationism.htm" title="Creationism">creationism</a>.

Most of these specimens were unearthed in the <!--del_lnk--> Liaoning province in northeastern <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, which was part of an island continent during the Cretaceous period. Though feathers have been found only in the <!--del_lnk--> lagerst&auml;tte of the <!--del_lnk--> Yixian Formation and a few other places, it is possible that non-avian dinosaurs elsewhere in the world were also feathered. The lack of widespread fossil evidence for feathered non-avian dinosaurs may be due to the fact that delicate features like skin and feathers are not often preserved by <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil.htm" title="Fossil">fossilization</a> and thus are absent from the fossil record.<p>The feathered dinosaurs discovered so far include <i><!--del_lnk--> Beipiaosaurus</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Caudipteryx</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Dilong</i>, <i><a href="../../wp/m/Microraptor.htm" title="Microraptor">Microraptor</a></i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Protarchaeopteryx</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Shuvuuia</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Sinornithosaurus</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Sinosauropteryx</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Jinfengopteryx</i>. Dinosaur-like birds like <i><!--del_lnk--> Confuciusornis</i>, which are anatomically closer to modern avians, have also been discovered. All of these specimens come from the same formation in northern China. The <!--del_lnk--> dromaeosauridae family in particular seems to have been heavily feathered, and at least one dromaeosaurid, <i><!--del_lnk--> Cryptovolans</i>, may have been capable of flight.<p><b>Skeleton</b><div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Because feathers are often associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the <!--del_lnk--> missing link between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent the more important link for <!--del_lnk--> paleontologists. Furthermore, it is increasingly clear that the relationship between birds and dinosaurs, and the evolution of flight, are more complex topics than previously realized. For example, while it was once believed that birds evolved from dinosaurs in one linear progression, some scientists, most notably <!--del_lnk--> Gregory S. Paul, conclude that dinosaurs such as the <!--del_lnk--> dromaeosaurs may have evolved from birds, losing the power of flight while keeping their feathers in a manner similar to the modern ostrich and other <!--del_lnk--> ratites.<p>Comparison of bird and dinosaur skeletons, as well as <!--del_lnk--> cladistic analysis, strengthens the case for the link, particularly for a branch of theropods called <!--del_lnk--> maniraptors. Skeletal similarities include the <!--del_lnk--> neck, <!--del_lnk--> pubis, <!--del_lnk--> wrist (semi-lunate <!--del_lnk--> carpal), <!--del_lnk--> arm and <!--del_lnk--> pectoral girdle, <!--del_lnk--> shoulder blade, <!--del_lnk--> clavicle and <!--del_lnk--> breast bone.<p><b>Reproductive biology</b><div class="thumb tright">

      <p>A discovery of features in a <i><a href="../../wp/t/Tyrannosaurus.htm" title="Tyrannosaurus rex">Tyrannosaurus rex</a></i> <!--del_lnk--> skeleton recently provided even more evidence that dinosaurs and birds evolved from a common ancestor and, for the first time, allowed paleontologists to establish the sex of a dinosaur. When laying eggs, female birds grow a special type of bone in their limbs. This <!--del_lnk--> medullary bone, which is rich in calcium, forms a layer inside the hard outer bone that is used to make eggshells. The presence of endosteally-derived bone tissues lining the interior marrow cavities of portions of the <i><a href="../../wp/t/Tyrannosaurus.htm" title="Tyrannosaurus rex">Tyrannosaurus rex</a></i> specimen&#39;s hind limb suggested that <i>T. rex</i> used similar reproductive strategies, and revealed the specimen to be female.<p>A dinosaur embryo was found without teeth, suggesting that some parental care was required to feed the young dinosaur. It is also possible that the adult dinosaurs regurgitated into a young dinosaur&#39;s mouth to provide sustenance, a behaviour that is also characteristic of numerous modern bird species.<p><b>Lungs</b><p>Large meat-eating dinosaurs had a complex system of air sacs similar to those found in modern birds, according to an investigation which was led by <!--del_lnk--> Patrick O&#39;Connor of <!--del_lnk--> Ohio University. The lungs of theropod dinosaurs (carnivores that walked on two legs and had birdlike feet) likely pumped air into hollow sacs in their <!--del_lnk--> skeletons, as is the case in birds. &quot;What was once formally considered unique to birds was present in some form in the ancestors of birds&quot;, O&#39;Connor said. The study was funded in part by the <!--del_lnk--> National Science Foundation.<p><b>Heart and sleeping posture</b><p>Modern <!--del_lnk--> computerized tomography (CT) scans of dinosaur chest cavities (conducted in 2000) found the apparent remnants of complex four-chambered hearts, much like those found in today&#39;s mammals and birds. A recently discovered <!--del_lnk--> troodont fossil demonstrates that the dinosaurs slept like certain modern birds, with their heads tucked under their arms. This behaviour, which may have helped to keep the head warm, is also characteristic of modern birds.<p><b>Gizzard</b><p>Another piece of evidence that birds and dinosaurs are closely related is the use of <!--del_lnk--> gizzard stones. These stones are swallowed by animals to aid digestion and break down food and hard fibres once they enter the stomach. When found in association with <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil.htm" title="Fossil">fossils</a>, gizzard stones are called <!--del_lnk--> gastroliths. Because a particular stone could have been swallowed at one location before being carried to another during migration, paleontologists sometimes use the stones found in dinosaur stomachs to establish possible <!--del_lnk--> migration routes.<p><a id="Evidence_for_Cenozoic_dinosaurs" name="Evidence_for_Cenozoic_dinosaurs"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Evidence for Cenozoic dinosaurs</span></h3>
      <p>In 2002, paleontologists Zielinski and Budahn reported the discovery of a single <!--del_lnk--> hadrosaur leg bone fossil in the San Juan Basin, New Mexico. The formation in which the bone was discovered has been dated to the early <a href="../../wp/p/Paleocene.htm" title="Paleocene">Paleocene</a> epoch approximately 64.5 million years ago. If the bone was not re-deposited into that <!--del_lnk--> stratum by weathering action, it would provide evidence that some dinosaur populations may have survived at least a half million years into the Cenozoic Era.<p><a id="Bringing_dinosaurs_back_to_life" name="Bringing_dinosaurs_back_to_life"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Bringing dinosaurs back to life</span></h3>

      <p>There has been much speculation about the use of technology to bring dinosaurs back to life. In <!--del_lnk--> Michael Crichton&#39;s book <i><!--del_lnk--> Jurassic Park</i> (later adapted into a <!--del_lnk--> movie), which popularized the idea, scientists use blood from fossilized <!--del_lnk--> mosquitos that have been suspended in <a href="../../wp/a/Amber.htm" title="Amber">tree sap</a> since the Mesozoic to reconstruct the <a href="../../wp/d/DNA.htm" title="DNA">DNA</a> of dinosaurs, filling chromosomal gaps with modern <a href="../../wp/f/Frog.htm" title="Frog">frog</a> genes. It is probably impossible to resurrect dinosaurs in this manner. One problem with the amber extraction method is that DNA decays over time by exposure to air, water and radiation, making it unlikely that such an approach would recover any useful DNA (DNA decay can be measured by a <!--del_lnk--> racemization test).<p>The successful extraction of ancient DNA from dinosaur fossils has been reported on two separate occasions, but upon further inspection and <!--del_lnk--> peer review, neither of these reports could be confirmed. However, a functional visual <!--del_lnk--> peptide of a (theoretical) dinosaur has been inferred using analytical phylogenetic reconstruction methods on gene sequences of still-living related species (reptiles and birds).<p>Even if dinosaur DNA could be reconstructed, it would be exceedingly difficult to &quot;grow&quot; dinosaurs using current technology since no closely related species exist to provide <!--del_lnk--> zygotes or a suitable environment for <!--del_lnk--> embryonic development.<p><a id="Soft_tissue_in_dinosaur_fossils" name="Soft_tissue_in_dinosaur_fossils"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Soft tissue in dinosaur fossils</span></h3>
      <p>One of the best examples of soft tissue impressions in a fossil dinosaur was discovered in <!--del_lnk--> Petraroia, <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>. The discovery was reported in 1998, and described the specimen of a small, very young <!--del_lnk--> coelurosaur, <i><!--del_lnk--> Scipionyx samniticus</i>. The fossil includes portions of the intestines, colon, liver, muscles, and windpipe of this immature dinosaur.<p>In the March 2005 issue of <i><!--del_lnk--> Science</i>, Dr. Mary Higby Schweitzer and her team announced the discovery of flexible material resembling actual soft tissue inside a 68-million-year-old <i><a href="../../wp/t/Tyrannosaurus.htm" title="Tyrannosaurus rex">Tyrannosaurus rex</a></i> leg <!--del_lnk--> bone from the <!--del_lnk--> Hell Creek Formation in <!--del_lnk--> Montana. After recovery, the tissue was rehydrated by the science team.<p>When the fossilized bone was treated over several weeks to remove mineral content from the fossilized bone marrow cavity (a process called demineralization), Schweitzer found evidence of intact structures such as <!--del_lnk--> blood vessels, bone matrix, and connective tissue (bone fibers). Scrutiny under the microscope further revealed that the putative dinosaur soft tissue had retained fine structures (microstructures) even at the cellular level. The exact nature and composition of this material are not yet clear, although many news reports immediately linked it with the movie <i><!--del_lnk--> Jurassic Park</i>. Interpretation of the artifact is ongoing, and the relative importance of Dr. Schweitzer&#39;s discovery is not yet clear.<p><a id="Extinction_theories" name="Extinction_theories"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Extinction theories</span></h2>

      <p>The sudden <!--del_lnk--> mass extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs, around 65 million years ago, is one of the most intriguing mysteries in <a href="../../wp/p/Paleontology.htm" title="Paleontology">paleontology</a>.

      </div>
      <p>The asteroid collision theory, which was first proposed by <!--del_lnk--> Walter Alvarez in the late 1970s, links the <!--del_lnk--> extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous period to a <!--del_lnk--> bolide impact approximately 65.5 million years ago. Alvarez proposed that a sudden increase in <a href="../../wp/i/Iridium.htm" title="Iridium">iridium</a> levels, recorded around the world in the period&#39;s rock stratum, was direct evidence of the impact. The bulk of the evidence now suggests that a 5-15 km wide <!--del_lnk--> bolide hit in the vicinity of the <!--del_lnk--> Yucat&aacute;n Peninsula, creating the 170&nbsp;km-wide <!--del_lnk--> Chicxulub Crater and triggering the <!--del_lnk--> mass extinction. Scientists are not certain whether dinosaurs were thriving or declining before the impact event. Some scientists propose that the meteorite caused a long and unnatural drop in Earth&#39;s atmospheric temperature, while others claim that it would have instead created an unusual heat wave.<p>Although the speed of extinction cannot be deduced from the fossil record alone, various models suggest that the extinction was extremely rapid. The consensus among scientists who support this theory is that the impact caused extinctions both directly (by <a href="../../wp/h/Heat.htm" title="Heat">heat</a> from the meteorite impact) and also indirectly (via a worldwide cooling brought about when matter ejected from the impact crater reflected thermal radiation from the sun).<p><a id="Multiple_collisions.E2.80.94the_Oort_cloud" name="Multiple_collisions.E2.80.94the_Oort_cloud"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Multiple collisions&mdash;the Oort cloud</span></h3>
      <p>While similar to Alvarez&#39;s impact theory (which involved a single asteroid or comet), this theory proposes that a stream of comets was dislodged from the <!--del_lnk--> Oort cloud due to the gravitational disruption caused by a passing star. One or more of these objects then collided with the Earth at approximately the same time, causing the worldwide extinction. As with the impact of a single asteroid, the end result of this comet bombardment would have been a sudden drop in global temperatures, followed by a protracted cool period.<p><a id="Environment_changes" name="Environment_changes"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Environment changes</span></h3>
      <p>At the peak of the dinosaur era, there were no polar ice caps, and sea levels are estimated to have been from 100 to 250 metres (330 to 820 feet) higher than they are today. The planet&#39;s temperature was also much more uniform, with only 25 degrees Celsius separating average polar temperatures from those at the equator. On average, atmospheric temperatures were also much warmer; the poles, for example, were 50 &deg;C warmer than today.<p>The atmosphere&#39;s composition during the dinosaur era was vastly different as well. Carbon dioxide levels were up to 12 times higher than today&#39;s levels, and oxygen formed 32 to 35% of the atmosphere, as compared to 21% today. However, by the late <a href="../../wp/c/Cretaceous.htm" title="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>, the environment was changing dramatically. Volcanic activity was decreasing, which led to a cooling trend as levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide dropped. Oxygen levels in the atmosphere also started to fluctuate and would ultimately fall considerably. Some scientists hypothesize that climate change, combined with lower oxygen levels, might have led directly to the demise of many species. If the dinosaurs had respiratory systems similar to those commonly found in modern birds, it may have been particularly difficult for them to cope with reduced respiratory efficiency, given the enormous oxygen demands of their very large bodies.<p><a id="History_of_discovery" name="History_of_discovery"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">History of discovery</span></h2>

      <p><i><!--del_lnk--> Megalosaurus</i> was the first dinosaur to be formally described, in 1677, when part of a bone was recovered from a <!--del_lnk--> limestone <!--del_lnk--> quarry at <!--del_lnk--> Cornwell near <a href="../../wp/o/Oxford.htm" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>. This bone fragment was identified correctly as the lower extremity of the <!--del_lnk--> femur of an animal larger than anything living in modern times. The second dinosaur species to be identified, <i><a href="../../wp/i/Iguanodon.htm" title="Iguanodon">Iguanodon</a></i>, was discovered in 1822 by the English geologist <!--del_lnk--> Gideon Mantell, who recognized similarities between his fossils and the bones of modern <!--del_lnk--> iguanas. Two years later, the Rev <!--del_lnk--> William Buckland, a professor of <a href="../../wp/g/Geology.htm" title="Geology">geology</a> at <!--del_lnk--> Oxford University, unearthed more fossilized bones of <i>Megalosaurus</i> and became the first person to describe dinosaurs in a <!--del_lnk--> scientific journal.<p>The study of these &quot;great fossil lizards&quot; soon became of great interest to European and American scientists, and in 1842 the English paleontologist <!--del_lnk--> Richard Owen coined the term &quot;dinosaur&quot;. He recognized that the remains that had been found so far, <i>Iguanodon</i>, <i>Megalosaurus</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Hylaeosaurus</i>, shared a number of distinctive features, and so decided to present them as a distinct taxonomic group. With the backing of <!--del_lnk--> Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, the husband of <a href="../../wp/v/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a>, Owen established the <!--del_lnk--> Natural History Museum in <!--del_lnk--> South Kensington, <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, to display the national collection of dinosaur fossils and other biological and geological exhibits.<p>In 1858, the first known American dinosaur was discovered, in <!--del_lnk--> marl pits in the small town of <!--del_lnk--> Haddonfield, New Jersey (although fossils had been found before, their nature had not been correctly discerned). The creature was named <i><!--del_lnk--> Hadrosaurus foulkii</i>, after the town and the discoverer, <!--del_lnk--> William Parker Foulke. It was an extremely important find; <i>Hadrosaurus</i> was the first nearly complete dinosaur skeleton found and it was clearly a <!--del_lnk--> bipedal creature. This was a revolutionary discovery as, until that point, most scientists had believed dinosaurs walked on four feet, like other lizards.

The feud probably originated when Marsh publicly pointed out that Cope&#39;s reconstruction of an <i><!--del_lnk--> Elasmosaurus</i> skeleton was flawed; Cope had inadvertently placed the <a href="../../wp/p/Plesiosaur.htm" title="Plesiosaur">plesiosaur</a>&#39;s head at what should have been the animal&#39;s tail end. The fight between the two scientists lasted for over 30 years, ending in 1897 when Cope died after spending his entire fortune on the dinosaur hunt. Marsh won the contest primarily because he was better funded through a relationship with the <!--del_lnk--> US Geological Survey. Unfortunately, many valuable dinosaur specimens were damaged or destroyed due to the pair&#39;s rough methods; for example, their diggers often used <!--del_lnk--> dynamite to unearth bones (a method modern paleontologists would find appalling). Despite the pair&#39;s unrefined methods, their contributions to paleontology were vast; Marsh unearthed 86 new species of dinosaur and Cope discovered 56, for a total of 142 new species.
