      <p>Eisenhower was born to a <!--del_lnk--> German American family in <!--del_lnk--> Denison, Texas, the third of seven sons born to <!--del_lnk--> David Jacob Eisenhower and <!--del_lnk--> Ida Elizabeth Stover, and their only child born in Texas. He was named David Dwight and was called Dwight. Later, the order of his given names was switched (according to the staff at the Eisenhower Library and Museum, the name switch occurred upon Eisenhower&#39;s matriculation at West Point). The Eisenhower family is of <!--del_lnk--> Pennsylvania Dutch descent. His ancestors were <!--del_lnk--> Mennonites who fled from Germany to Switzerland in the 17th century. Hans Nicol Eisenhauer and family came to Lancaster, Pennsylvania in 1741. The family joined the <!--del_lnk--> River Brethren and were pacifists during the nation&#39;s wars. They joined some 300 River Brethren in creating a colony in Kansas. After a brief sojourn in Texas the family re-settled in <!--del_lnk--> Abilene, Kansas, in 1892. Eisenhower&#39;s father was a college educated engineer.  Eisenhower graduated from Abilene High School in 1909.<p>Eisenhower married <!--del_lnk--> Mamie Geneva Doud (1896&ndash;1979), of <a href="../../wp/d/Denver%252C_Colorado.htm" title="Denver, Colorado">Denver, Colorado</a>, on <!--del_lnk--> July 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1916. They had two children, Doud Dwight Eisenhower (1917&ndash;1921), whose tragic death in childhood from scarlet fever haunted the couple, and John Sheldon David Doud Eisenhower (born 1922). <!--del_lnk--> John Eisenhower served in the <!--del_lnk--> United States Army, then became an author and served as U.S. Ambassador to <a href="../../wp/b/Belgium.htm" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>. John&#39;s son, <!--del_lnk--> David Eisenhower, after whom <!--del_lnk--> Camp David is named, married <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_Nixon.htm" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>&#39;s daughter <!--del_lnk--> Julie in 1968.<p><a id="Religion" name="Religion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h3>
      <p>When Eisenhower was 5, his parents became followers of the Bible Students, whose members later took the name <!--del_lnk--> Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses. The Eisenhower home served as the local Bible Student&#39;s meeting Hall from 1896 to 1915, when Eisenhower&#39;s father stopped regularly associating due to his disappointment at the WatchTower&#39;s failed prediction that Armageddon would occur in October 1914 and 1915. Ike&#39;s father received a Jehovah&#39;s Witness funeral when he died in the 1940s. Ike&#39;s mother continued as an active Jehovah&#39;s Witness until her death. Ike and his brothers also stopped associating regularly after 1915. He enjoyed a close relationship with his mother throughout her lifetime. In later years, Eisenhower became a communicant in the <!--del_lnk--> Presbyterian church in 1953; in his retirement years, he was a member of the Gettysburg Presbyterian Church.<p><a id="Early_military_career" name="Early_military_career"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Early military career</span></h2>

      <p>After the <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japanese</a> <a href="../../wp/a/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor.htm" title="Attack on Pearl Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbour</a>, Eisenhower was assigned to the General Staff in Washington, where he served until June 1942 with responsibility for creating the major war plans to defeat Japan and <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>. He was appointed Deputy Chief in charge of Pacific Defenses under the Chief of War Plans Division, General <!--del_lnk--> Leonard T. Gerow, and then succeeded Gerow as Chief of the War Plans Division. Then he was appointed Assistant Chief of Staff in charge of Operations Division under Chief of Staff General <!--del_lnk--> George C. Marshall. It was his close association with Marshall which finally brought Eisenhower to senior command positions. Marshall recognized his great organizational and administrative abilities.<p>In 1942, Eisenhower was appointed Commanding General, <!--del_lnk--> European Theatre of Operations (ETOUSA) and was based in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>. In November, he was also appointed <!--del_lnk--> Supreme Commander Allied (Expeditionary) Force of the <!--del_lnk--> North African Theatre of Operations (NATOUSA) through the new operational Headquarters <!--del_lnk--> A(E)FHQ. The word &quot;expeditionary&quot; was dropped soon after his appointment for security reasons. In February 1943, his authority was extended as commander of AFHQ across the Mediterranean basin to include the <!--del_lnk--> British 8th Army, commanded by General Bernard Law Montgomery. The 8th Army had advanced across the <!--del_lnk--> Western Desert from the east and was ready for the start of the <!--del_lnk--> Tunisia Campaign. Eisenhower gained his fourth star and gave up command of ETOUSA to be commander of NATOUSA. After the capitulation of <!--del_lnk--> Axis forces in <a href="../../wp/n/North_Africa.htm" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>, Eisenhower remained in command of the renamed <!--del_lnk--> Mediterranean Theatre of Operations (MTO), keeping the operational title and continued in command of NATOUSA redesignated MTOUSA. In this position he oversaw the <!--del_lnk--> invasion of Sicily and the <!--del_lnk--> invasion of the Italian mainland.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>In December 1943, it was announced that Eisenhower would be Supreme Allied Commander in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>. In January 1944, he resumed command of ETOUSA and the following month was officially designated as the <!--del_lnk--> Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force (<!--del_lnk--> SHAEF), serving in a dual role until the end of hostilities in Europe in May 1945. In these positions he was charged with planning and carrying out the Allied <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Normandy.htm" title="Battle of Normandy">assault on the coast of Normandy</a> in June 1944 under the code name <!--del_lnk--> Operation Overlord, the liberation of western Europe and the invasion of <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>. A month after the Normandy <!--del_lnk--> D-Day on <!--del_lnk--> June 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1944, the <!--del_lnk--> invasion of southern France took place, and control of the forces which took part in the southern invasion passed from the AFHQ to the SHAEF. From then until the <!--del_lnk--> end of the War in Europe on <!--del_lnk--> May 8, <!--del_lnk--> 1945, Eisenhower through SHAEF had supreme command of all operational Allied forces<sup>2</sup>, and through his command of ETOUSA, administrative command of all U.S. forces, on the <!--del_lnk--> Western Front north of the <!--del_lnk--> Alps.<p>As recognition of his senior position in the Allied command, on <!--del_lnk--> December 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1944, he was promoted to <!--del_lnk--> General of the Army equivalent to the rank of <!--del_lnk--> Field Marshal in most European armies. In this and the previous high commands he held, Eisenhower showed his great talents for leadership and diplomacy. Although he had never seen action himself, he won the respect of front-line commanders. He dealt skillfully with difficult subordinates such as <!--del_lnk--> Omar Bradley and <!--del_lnk--> George Patton and allies such as <a href="../../wp/w/Winston_Churchill.htm" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, Field Marshal <!--del_lnk--> Bernard Montgomery and General <!--del_lnk--> Charles de Gaulle. He had fundamental disagreements with Churchill and Montgomery over questions of strategy, but these rarely upset his relationships with them. He negotiated with <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> <!--del_lnk--> Marshal Zhukov, and such was the confidence that President <a href="../../wp/f/Franklin_D._Roosevelt.htm" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> had in him, he sometimes worked directly with <a href="../../wp/j/Joseph_Stalin.htm" title="Joseph Stalin">Stalin</a>.<p>Eisenhower was offered the <a href="../../wp/m/Medal_of_Honor.htm" title="Medal of Honor">Medal of Honour</a> for his leadership in the European Theatre but refused it, saying that it should be reserved for bravery and valor.<p>It was never a certainty that <i>Overlord</i> would succeed. The tenuousness surrounding the entire decision including the timing and the location of the Normandy invasion might be summarized by a short speech that Eisenhower wrote in advance, in case he might need it. In it, he took full responsibility for catastrophic failure, should that be the final result. Long after the successful landings on D-Day and the <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a> broadcast of Eisenhower&#39;s brief speech concerning them, the never-used second speech was found in a shirt pocket by an aide. It read:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>Following the <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">German</a> <!--del_lnk--> unconditional surrender on <!--del_lnk--> May 8, <!--del_lnk--> 1945, Eisenhower was appointed Military Governor of the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Occupation Zone, based in <!--del_lnk--> Frankfurt am Main. Germany was divided into four Occupation Zones, one each for the U.S., Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. In addition, upon full discovery of the <!--del_lnk--> death camps that were part of the <!--del_lnk--> Final Solution (<a href="../../wp/t/The_Holocaust.htm" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>), he ordered camera crews to comprehensively document evidence of the atrocity so as to prevent any doubt of its occurrence. He made the controversial decision to reclassify German <!--del_lnk--> prisoners of war (POWs) in U.S. custody as <!--del_lnk--> Disarmed Enemy Forces (DEFs). As DEFs, they could be compelled to serve as unpaid <!--del_lnk--> conscript labor. An unknown number may have died in custody as a consequence of malnutrition, exposure to the elements, and lack of medical care (see <i><!--del_lnk--> Eisenhower and German POWs</i>). Eisenhower was an early supporter of the <!--del_lnk--> Morgenthau Plan to permanently remove Germany&#39;s industrial capacity to wage future wars. In November 1945 he approved the distribution of 1000 free copies of <!--del_lnk--> Morgenthau&#39;s book <i>Germany is Our Problem</i>, which promoted and described the plan in detail, to American military officials in occupied Germany. Historian <!--del_lnk--> Stephen Ambrose draws the conclusion that, despite Eisenhowers later claims that the act was not an endorsement of the Morgenthau plan, Eisenhower both approved of the plan and had previously given Morgenthau at least some of his ideas on how Germany should be treated.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Eisenhower served as Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army from 1945-48. In December 1950, he was named Supreme Commander of the <a href="../../wp/n/NATO.htm" title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> (NATO), and given operational command of NATO forces in Europe. Eisenhower retired from active service on <!--del_lnk--> May 31, <!--del_lnk--> 1952, upon entering politics. He wrote <i><!--del_lnk--> Crusade in Europe</i>, widely regarded as one of the finest U.S. military memoirs. During this period Eisenhower served as president of <!--del_lnk--> Columbia University from 1948 until 1953, though he was on leave from the university while he served as <a href="../../wp/n/NATO.htm" title="NATO">NATO</a> commander.<p>After his many wartime successes, General Eisenhower returned to the U.S. a great hero. Not long after his return, a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Draft Eisenhower&quot; movement in the Republican party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the <!--del_lnk--> the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of isolationist Senator <!--del_lnk--> Robert A. Taft. Eisenhower defeated Taft for the nomination but came to an agreement that Taft would stay out of foreign affairs while Eisenhower followed a conservative domestic policy. Eisenhower&#39;s campaign was a crusade against the <a href="../../wp/h/Harry_S._Truman.htm" title="Harry S. Truman">Truman</a> administration&#39;s policies regarding &quot;<a href="../../wp/k/Korea.htm" title="Korea">Korea</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">Communism</a> and Corruption.&quot; Eisenhower promised to go to Korea himself and end the war and maintain both a strong NATO abroad against Communism and a corruption-free frugal administration at home. He and his running mate <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_Nixon.htm" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> easily defeated <!--del_lnk--> Adlai Stevenson in a landslide, marking the first Republican return to the <!--del_lnk--> White House in 20 years.

As it was believed that large cities would be targets in a possible future war, the highways were designed to evacuate them.<p><a id="Dynamic_Conservatism" name="Dynamic_Conservatism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Dynamic Conservatism</span></h3>
      <p>Throughout his presidency, Eisenhower preached a doctrine of Dynamic Conservatism. Although he maintained a conservative economic policy, he continued all the major <!--del_lnk--> New Deal programs still in operation, especially <!--del_lnk--> Social Security. He expanded its programs and rolled them into a new cabinet level agency, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, while extending benefits to an additional 10 million more workers. His cabinet, consisting of several corporate executives and one labor leader, was dubbed by one journalist, &quot;Eight millionaires and a plumber.&quot; Eisenhower was extremely popular, winning his second term with 457 of the 530 votes in the <!--del_lnk--> Electoral College, and 57.6% of the popular vote.<p><a id="Eisenhower_Doctrine" name="Eisenhower_Doctrine"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Eisenhower Doctrine</span></h3>
      <p>After the <!--del_lnk--> Suez Crisis, the United States became the protector of most Western interests in the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>. As a result, Eisenhower proclaimed the &quot;Eisenhower Doctrine&quot; in January 1957, in relation to the Middle East, the U.S. would be &quot;prepared to use armed force...[to counter] aggression from any country controlled by international communism.&quot; On July 15 1958, he sent just under 15,000 soldiers to Lebanon (a combined force of Army and Marine Corps) in a non-combat peace keeping mission to stabilize the pro-Western government. They left in October, 1958.<p><a id="Civil_Rights" name="Civil_Rights"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Civil Rights</span></h3>
      <p>Eisenhower supported the 1954 <!--del_lnk--> Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka U.S. Supreme Court decision, in which segregated (&quot;separate but equal&quot;) schools were ruled to be unconstitutional. The very next day he told District of Columbia officials to make Washington a model for the rest of the country in integrating Negro and white public school children. Liberal critics complained Eisenhower was never enthusiastic about civil rights, but he did propose to Congress the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960 and signed those acts into law. They constituted the first significant civil rights acts since the 1870s. He also sent soldiers to Little Rock to integrate their schools, and admitted multi-racial Hawaii as a state in 1959.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Little Rock Central High School crisis of 1957 involved state refusal to honour a federal court order to integrate the schools. Eisenhower placed the Arkansas National Guard under federal control and sent Army troops to escort <!--del_lnk--> nine black students into the all-white school; this incident did not occur without violence. Eisenhower and Arkansas governor <!--del_lnk--> Orval Faubus engaged in tense arguments during this tumultuous period in history.<p><a id="States_admitted_to_the_Union" name="States_admitted_to_the_Union"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">States admitted to the Union</span></h3>

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> January 17, <!--del_lnk--> 1961, Eisenhower gave his final televised speech from the <!--del_lnk--> Oval Office. In his farewell speech to the nation, Eisenhower raised the issue of the Cold War and role of the U.S. armed forces. He described the Cold War saying: &quot;We face a hostile ideology global in scope, atheistic in character, ruthless in purpose and insidious in method...&quot; and warned about what he saw as unjustified government spending proposals and continued with a warning that &quot;we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the <!--del_lnk--> military-industrial complex... Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.&quot;<p>After Eisenhower left office his reputation declined, and he was seen as having been a &quot;do-nothing&quot; President. This was partly because of the contrast between Eisenhower and his young activist successor, <a href="../../wp/j/John_F._Kennedy.htm" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>, but also because of his reluctance to support the <a href="../../wp/c/Civil_rights.htm" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a> movement to the degree that more liberal individuals would have preferred to stop <!--del_lnk--> McCarthyism, even though he opposed McCarthy&#39;s tactics and claims<!--del_lnk--> . Such omissions were held against him during the liberal climate of the 1960s and 1970s. Since that time, however, Eisenhower&#39;s reputation has risen because of his non-partisan nature, his wartime leadership, his action in <!--del_lnk--> Arkansas, his being the last President to balance the budget (before the second <a href="../../wp/b/Bill_Clinton.htm" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> term), and an increasing appreciation of how difficult it is today to maintain a prolonged peace. In <!--del_lnk--> recent surveys of historians, Eisenhower often is ranked in the top 10 among all U.S. Presidents.<p>Eisenhower retired to the place where he and Mamie had spent much of their post-war time, a working farm adjacent to the battlefield at <!--del_lnk--> Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The Gettysburg farm is a <!--del_lnk--> National Historic Site <!--del_lnk--> . In retirement, he did not completely retreat from political life; he spoke at the <!--del_lnk--> 1964 Republican National Convention and appeared with <!--del_lnk--> Barry Goldwater in a Republican campaign commercial from Gettysburg.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Because of legal issues related to holding a military rank while in a civilian office, Eisenhower resigned his permanent commission as <!--del_lnk--> General of the Army before entering the office of President of the United States. Upon completion of his Presidential term, his commission on the retired list was reactivated and Eisenhower again was commissioned a five-star general in the United States Army.<p>Eisenhower died at 12:25 p.m. on <!--del_lnk--> March 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1969, at <!--del_lnk--> Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington D.C., of <!--del_lnk--> congestive heart failure at the age of 78. He lies alongside his wife and their first child, who died in childhood, in a small chapel called the Place of Meditation, at the <!--del_lnk--> Eisenhower Presidential Library, located in Abilene.

      <p>Eisenhower&#39;s picture was on the <!--del_lnk--> dollar coin from 1971 to 1979.
