      <p>Wildtype flies have red eyes, are yellow-brown in colour, and have transverse black rings across their abdomen. They exhibit <!--del_lnk--> sexual dimorphism: females are about 2.5 millimetres long; males are slightly smaller and the back of their bodies is darker. Males are easily distinguished from females based on colour differences (males have a distinct black patch at the abdomen, less noticeable in recently emerged flies (see fig)) and the sexcombs (a row of dark bristles on the <!--del_lnk--> tarsus of the first leg). Furthermore, males have a cluster of spiky hairs (claspers) surrounding the anus and genitals used to attach to the female during mating. There are extensive images at <!--del_lnk--> Fly Base.<p><a id="Life_cycle" name="Life_cycle"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Life cycle</span></h2>

      <p>The developmental period for <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> varies with temperature, as with all cold-blooded species. The shortest development time (egg to adult), 7 days, is achieved at 28&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> &deg;C.  Development times increase at higher temperatures (30&nbsp;&deg;C, 11 days) due to heat stress. Under ideal conditions, the development time at 25&nbsp;&deg;C is 8.5 , at 18&nbsp;&deg;C it takes 19 days and at 12&nbsp;&deg;C it takes over 50 days. Under crowded conditions, development time increases , while the emerging flies are smaller. Females lay some 400 eggs (embryos), about five at a time, into rotting fruit or other suitable material such as decaying <!--del_lnk--> mushrooms and <!--del_lnk--> sap fluxes. The eggs, which are about 0.5 millimetres long, hatch after 12-15 h (at 25&nbsp;&deg;C). The resulting <!--del_lnk--> larvae grow for about 4 days (at 25&nbsp;&deg;C) while <!--del_lnk--> molting twice (into 2nd- and 3rd-instar larvae), at about 24 and 48 h after eclosion. During this time, they feed on the microorganisms that decompose the fruit, as well as on the sugar of the fruit themselves. Then the larvae encapsulate in the <!--del_lnk--> puparium and undergo a four-day-long <!--del_lnk--> metamorphosis (at 25&nbsp;&deg;C), after which the adults eclose (emerge).<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Females become receptive to courting males at about 8-12 hours after emergence. Males perform a sequence of five behavioural patterns to court females. First, males orient themselves while playing a courtship song by horizontally extending and vibrating their wings. Soon after, the male positions itself at the rear of the female&#39;s adbdomen in a low posture to tap and lick the female genitalia. Finally, the male curls its abdomen, and attempts copulation. Females can reject males by moving away from males and extruding their ovipositor. The average duration of copulation, when successful, lasts 10 minutes, during which males transfer hundreds of very long sperm in seminal fluid to the female. Females store the sperm, which may need to compete with other males&#39; stored sperm to fertilize eggs.<p>The D. melanogaster lifespan is about 30 days at 29&nbsp;&deg;C.<p><a id="Model_organism_in_genetics" name="Model_organism_in_genetics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Model organism in genetics</span></h2>
      <p><i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is the most studied <a href="../../wp/o/Organism.htm" title="Organism">organism</a> in biological research, particularly in genetics and developmental biology. There are several reasons:<ul>
       <li>It is small and easy to grow in the laboratory<li>It has a short generation time (about 2 weeks) and high productivity (females can lay 500 eggs in 10 days)<li>The mature larvae show giant chromosomes in the salivary glands called <!--del_lnk--> polytene chromosomes - &quot;puffs&quot; indicate regions of transcription and hence gene activity.<li>It has only 4 pairs of <!--del_lnk--> chromosomes: 3 autosomal, and 1 sex.<li>Males do not show meiotic <!--del_lnk--> recombination, facilitating genetic studies.<li>Genetic transformation techniques have been available since 1987.<li>Its compact <!--del_lnk--> genome was <!--del_lnk--> sequenced in 1998.</ul>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Charles W. Woodworth is credited with being the first to breed <i>Drosophila</i> in quantity and for suggesting to <!--del_lnk--> W. E. Castle that they might be used for genetic research during his time at <!--del_lnk--> Harvard University. Beginning in 1910, fruit flies helped <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Hunt Morgan accomplish his studies on heredity. &quot;Thomas Hunt Morgan and colleagues extended <a href="../../wp/g/Gregor_Mendel.htm" title="Gregor Mendel">Mendel</a>&#39;s work by describing X-linked inheritance and by showing that genes located on the same chromosome do not show independent assortment. Studies of X-linked traits helped confirm that genes are found on chromosomes, while studies of linked traits led to the first maps showing the locations of genetic loci on chromosomes&quot; (Freman 214). The first maps of <i>Drosophila</i> <!--del_lnk--> chromosomes were completed by <!--del_lnk--> Alfred Sturtevant.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>During oogenesis, cytoplasmic bridges called &quot;ring canals&quot; connect the forming oocyte to nurse cells. Nutrients and developmental control molecules move from the nurse cells into the oocyte. In the figure to the left, the forming oocyte can be seen to be covered by follicular support cells.<p>After fertilization of the oocyte the early embryo or (<!--del_lnk--> syncytial embryo) undergoes rapid DNA replication and 13 nucelar divisions until approximately 5000 to 6000 nuclei accumulate in the unseparated cytoplasm of the embryo. By the end of the 8th division most nuclei have migrated to the surface, surrounding the yolk sac (leaving behind only a few nuclei, which will become the yolk nuclei). After the 10th division the pole cells form at the posterior end of the embryo, segregating the germ line from the syncytium. Finally, after the 13th division cell membranes slowly invaginate, dividing the syncytium into individual somatic cells. Once this process is completed gastrulation starts.<p>Nuclear division in the early <i>Drosophila</i> embryo happens so quickly there are no proper checkpoints so mistakes may be made in division of the <a href="../../wp/d/DNA.htm" title="DNA">DNA</a>. To get around this problem the nuclei which have made a mistake detach from their <!--del_lnk--> centrosomes and fall into the centre of the embryo (yolk sac) which will not form part of the fly.<p>The gene network (transcriptional and protein interactions) governing the early development of the fruitfly embryo is one of the best understood gene networks to date. Especially the patterning along the antero-posterior (AP) and dorso-ventral (DV) axes (See under <!--del_lnk--> morphogenesis).<p>The egg undergoes well-characterized morphogenetic movements during gastrulation and early development, including germ-band extension, formation of several furrows, ventral invagination of the mesoderm, posterior and anterior invagination of endoderm (gut), as well as extensive body segmentation  until finally hatching from the surrounding cuticle into a 1st-instar larva. During the larval development (molting), the imaginal disks form, which are in essence the anlagen for the entire adult body. Cells of the imaginal disks are set aside early and mature over time into adult body structures, especially during pupation, whereas most other cells in the larva undergo <!--del_lnk--> apoptosis.<p><a id="Behavioral_genetics_and_neuroscience" name="Behavioral_genetics_and_neuroscience"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Behavioural genetics and neuroscience</span></h2>
      <p>In 1971 Ron Konopka and Seymour Benzer published a paper titled &quot;Clock mutants of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>&quot; in which they described the first mutations that affected an animal&#39;s behaviour. Wild-type flies show an activity rhythm of with a frequency of about a day (24 hours). They found mutants with faster and slower rhythms as well as broken rhythms - flies that move and rest in random spurts. Work over the following 30 years has shown that these mutations (and others like them) affect a group of genes and their products that comprise a biochemical or <!--del_lnk--> biological clock. This clock is found in a wide range of fly cells, but the clock-bearing cells that control activity are several dozen neurons in the fly&#39;s central brain.<p>Since then Benzer, his students, and many others have used behavioural screens to isolate genes involved in vision, olfaction, audition, learning/memory, courtship, pain and other processes such as longevity.<p>The first learning and memory mutants (<i>dunce</i>, <i>rutabaga</i> etc) were isolated by William &quot;Chip&quot; Quinn while in Benzer&#39;s lab, and were eventually shown to encode components of an intracellular signalling pathway involving cylic AMP, protein kinase A and a transcription factor known as CREB. These molecules were shown to be also involved in synaptic plasticity in <i>Aplysia</i> and mammals.<p>Male flies sing to the females during courtship using their wing to generate sound.<p>Furthermore, <i>Drosophila</i> has been used in neuropharmacological research, including studies of cocaine and alcohol in the labs of Jay Hirsh and Ulrike Heberlein. <p><a id="Vision_in_Drosophila" name="Vision_in_Drosophila"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Vision in <i>Drosophila</i></span></h2>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> compound eye of the fruit fly contains 800 unit eyes or <!--del_lnk--> ommatidia, and are one of the most advanced among insects. Each ommatidium contains 8 photoreceptor cells (R1-8), support cells, pigment cells, and a cornea. Wild-type flies have reddish pigment cells, which serve to absorb excess blue light so the fly isn&#39;t blinded by ambient light.<p>Each photoreceptor cell consists of two main sections, the cell body and the rhabdomere. The cell body contains the <!--del_lnk--> nucleus while the rhabdomere is made up of toothbrush-like stacks of membrane called <!--del_lnk--> microvilli. Each microvillus is 1 mm to 1.5 mm in length and 50 <!--del_lnk--> nm in diameter. The membrane of the rhabdomere is packed with about 100 million <!--del_lnk--> rhodopsin molecules, the visual protein that absorbs light. The rest of the visual proteins are also tightly packed into the microvillar space, leaving little room for <!--del_lnk--> cytoplasm.<p>The photoreceptors in <i>Drosophila</i> express a variety of <!--del_lnk--> rhodopsin <!--del_lnk--> isoforms. The R1-R6 photoreceptor cells express Rhodopsin1 (Rh1) which absorbs blue light (480 nm). The R7 and R8 cells express a combination of either Rh3 or Rh4 which absorb UV light (345 nm and 375 nm), and Rh5 or Rh6 which absorb blue (437 nm) and green (508 nm) light respectively. Each <!--del_lnk--> rhodopsin molecule consists of an opsin protein covalently linked to a <!--del_lnk--> carotenoid chromophore, 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinal. <div class="thumb tright">

       <br /> As in <a href="../../wp/e/Eye.htm" title="Eye">vertebrate vision</a>, visual transduction in <a href="../../wp/i/Invertebrate.htm" title="Invertebrate">invertebrates</a> occurs via a G protein-coupled pathway. However, in <!--del_lnk--> vertebrates the <!--del_lnk--> G protein is transducin, while the <!--del_lnk--> G protein in invertebrates is Gq (dgq in <i>Drosophila</i>). When <!--del_lnk--> rhodopsin (Rh) absorbs a <a href="../../wp/p/Photon.htm" title="Photon">photon</a> of light its chromophore, 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinal, is isomerized to all-trans-3-hydroxyretinal. Rh undergoes a conformational change into its active form, metarhodopsin. Metarhodopsin activates Gq, which in turn activates a <!--del_lnk--> phospholipase C&beta; (PLC&beta;) known as NorpA.<p>PLC&beta; hydrolyzes <!--del_lnk--> phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>), a <!--del_lnk--> phospholipid found in the <!--del_lnk--> cell membrane, into soluble <!--del_lnk--> inositol triphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and <!--del_lnk--> diacylgycerol (DAG), which stays in the <!--del_lnk--> cell membrane. DAG or a derivative of DAG causes a <a href="../../wp/c/Calcium.htm" title="Calcium">calcium</a> selective <!--del_lnk--> ion channel known as <!--del_lnk--> TRP (transient receptor potential) to open and <a href="../../wp/c/Calcium.htm" title="Calcium">calcium</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Sodium.htm" title="Sodium">sodium</a> flows into the cell. IP<sub>3</sub> is thought to bind to <!--del_lnk--> IP<sub>3</sub> receptors in the <!--del_lnk--> subrhabdomeric cisternae, an extension of the <!--del_lnk--> endoplasmic reticulum, and cause release of <a href="../../wp/c/Calcium.htm" title="Calcium">calcium</a>, but this process doesn&#39;t seem to be essential for normal vision. <p><a href="../../wp/c/Calcium.htm" title="Calcium">Calcium</a> binds to proteins such as <!--del_lnk--> calmodulin (CaM) and an eye-specific <!--del_lnk--> protein kinase C (PKC) known as InaC. These proteins interact with other proteins and have been shown to be necessary for shut off of the light response. In addition, proteins called <!--del_lnk--> arrestins bind metarhodopsin and prevent it from activating more Gq.<p>A <a href="../../wp/p/Potassium.htm" title="Potassium">potassium</a>-dependent <!--del_lnk--> sodium/calcium exchanger known as NCKX30C pumps the <a href="../../wp/c/Calcium.htm" title="Calcium">calcium</a> out of the cell. It uses the inward sodium gradient and the outward potassium gradient to extrude calcium at a <!--del_lnk--> stoichiometry of 4 Na<sup>+</sup>/ 1 Ca<sup>++</sup>, 1 K<sup>+</sup>.<p>TRP, InaC, and PLC form a signaling complex by binding a scaffolding protein called InaD. InaD contains five binding domains called <!--del_lnk--> PDZ domains which specifically bind the C termini of target proteins. Disruption of the complex by mutations in either the PDZ domains or the target proteins reduces the efficiency of signaling. For example, disruption of the interaction between InaC, the protein kinase C, and InaD results in a delay in inactivation of the <!--del_lnk--> light response.<p>Unlike <a href="../../wp/v/Vertebrate.htm" title="Vertebrate">vertebrate</a> metarhodopsin, <a href="../../wp/i/Invertebrate.htm" title="Invertebrate">invertebrate</a> metarhodopsin can be converted back into <!--del_lnk--> rhodopsin by absorbing a <a href="../../wp/p/Photon.htm" title="Photon">photon</a> of orange light (580 nm).<p>Approximately two-thirds of the <i>Drosophila</i> brain (about 200,000 neurons total) is dedicated to visual processing. Although the spatial resolution of their vision is significantly worse than that of humans, their temporal resolution is approximately ten times better.<p><a id="Drosophila_flight" name="Drosophila_flight"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Drosophila</i> flight</span></h2>
      <p>The wings of a fly are capable of beating at up to 220 times per second. Flies fly via straight sequences of movement interspersed by rapid turns called <!--del_lnk--> saccades. During these turns, a fly is able to rotate 90 degrees in fewer than 50 milliseconds.<p><i>Drosophila</i>, and probably many other flies, have optic nerves which lead directly to the wing muscles (while in other insects they always lead to the brain first), making it possible for them to react even more quickly.<p>It was long thought that the characteristics of <i>Drosophila</i> flight were dominated by the <!--del_lnk--> viscosity of the air, rather than the <!--del_lnk--> inertia of the fly body. However, recent research by <!--del_lnk--> Michael Dickinson and <!--del_lnk--> Rosalyn Sayaman has indicated that flies perform banked turns, where the fly accelerates, slows down while turning, and accelerates again at the end of the turn. This indicates that inertia is the dominant force, as is the case with larger flying animals.<p><a id="Courtship_and_mating_rituals" name="Courtship_and_mating_rituals"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Courtship and mating rituals</span></h2>
      <p>When two <i>drosophila melanogaster</i> of the opposite sex encounter one another, they often first exhibit &quot;cleaning behavior&quot;. After this behaviour is engaged for some time, the male will proceed towards the rear of the female from either the left or right side. He will then begin a &quot;dance&quot; in which he describes a semi-circle around the female. During this dance the male may or may not vibrate his wings. If the female is not receptive, she will move away and courtship ends. If she is receptive however, the male will approach her rear and make contact with her using his <!--del_lnk--> proboscis. The female may then scissor her wings and allow the male to mount. When intercourse has finished, the female will dislodge the male with a violent kicking of her hind legs.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila_melanogaster&quot;</div>
