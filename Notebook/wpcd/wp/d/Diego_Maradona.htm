      <p><b>Diego Armando Maradona</b> (born <!--del_lnk--> October 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1960), is a former <a href="../../wp/a/Argentina.htm" title="Argentina">Argentine</a> <a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Football (soccer)">football</a> player. He is regarded by many as the greatest footballer of all time , as well as one of the most controversial. Maradona, like many South American footballers, came from poor beginnings; in his case from a shanty town known as Villa Fiorito, just outside of <a href="../../wp/b/Buenos_Aires.htm" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a>. He won various trophies with <!--del_lnk--> Boca Juniors, <!--del_lnk--> FC Barcelona and <!--del_lnk--> SSC Napoli over the course of his career. During an international career that included 91 caps and 34 goals, he played in four <a href="../../wp/f/FIFA_World_Cup.htm" title="FIFA World Cup">FIFA World Cup</a> tournaments, inspiring the Argentina national team to <!--del_lnk--> victory over West Germany in 1986, in which he collected the Golden Ball award as best player. A controversial figure, he was suspended for 15 months in 1991 after a failed doping test for <!--del_lnk--> cocaine in Italy, and then again for <!--del_lnk--> ephedrine during the 1994 World Cup.<p>After retirement from football on October 30, 1997 , he suffered ill-health and weight gain subsequent to a long-standing problem with cocaine abuse. However, a stomach stapling operation helped control his weight gain, and, after overcoming his cocaine addiction, he became a TV host in <a href="../../wp/a/Argentina.htm" title="Argentina">Argentina</a> .<p>

      <p>Maradona had a short, strong physique and could withstand physical pressure well. His strong legs and low centre of gravity gave him an advantage in short sprints . This is illustrated by his two goals against Belgium in the <!--del_lnk--> 1986 World Cup. He was a strategist, a team player, as well as highly technical with the ball, and could manage himself effectively in limited spaces, attracting defenders only to quickly dash out of the melee (as in the second goal against England), or give an assist to a free teammate. Being short, but strong, he could hold the ball long enough with a defender on his back to wait for a teamate making a run or to find a gap for a quick shot.<p>One of Maradona&#39;s trademark moves was <!--del_lnk--> dribbling full-speed as a left wing, and on reaching the opponent&#39;s goal line, delivering accurate passes to his teammates that many times proved lethal. Another trademark was the <i><!--del_lnk--> Rabona</i> or reverse-cross pass (shot behind the leg that holds all the weight), with which he provided several assists, such as the powerful cross for <!--del_lnk--> Ram&oacute;n D&iacute;az&#39;s header in the 1980 friendly against <!--del_lnk--> Switzerland. He was also a dangerous <!--del_lnk--> free kick taker.<p><a id="Early_years" name="Early_years"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Early years</span></h2>
      <p>Diego Armando Maradona was born in <!--del_lnk--> Villa Fiorito, a <!--del_lnk--> shantytown on the southern outskirts of <a href="../../wp/b/Buenos_Aires.htm" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a> , to a poor family that had moved from <!--del_lnk--> Corrientes Province. He was the first son after three daughters. He has two younger brothers, <!--del_lnk--> Hugo (<i>el Turco</i>) and Eduardo (Lalo), both of whom were also professional footballers.<p>At age 10, Maradona was spotted by a talent scout while he was playing in his neighbourhood club <i>Estrella Roja</i>. He became a staple of <i>Los Cebollitas</i> (The Little Onions), the junior team of Buenos Aires side <!--del_lnk--> Argentinos Juniors.  As a ball-boy at the age of 12, in first division games, he amused spectators by showing his wizardry with the ball during the halftime intermissions. <p><a id="Club_career" name="Club_career"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Club career</span></h2>

      <p>Maradona made his professional debut on <!--del_lnk--> October 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1976 ten days before his sixteenth birthday, with Argentinos Juniors , where he played between 1976 and 1981 before his &pound;1.0m transfer to the club that he supported, <!--del_lnk--> Boca Juniors, where he played during the remainder of the 1981 season and 1982 and secured his first league title.<p>After the <!--del_lnk--> 1982 World Cup, in June, Maradona was transferred to <!--del_lnk--> FC Barcelona in <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> for a then <!--del_lnk--> World Record &pound;5.0m. In 1983, under coach <!--del_lnk--> C&eacute;sar Luis Menotti, Barcelona and Maradona won the <!--del_lnk--> Copa del Rey (Spain&#39;s annual national cup competition), beating <!--del_lnk--> Real Madrid. However, Maradona had a difficult tenure in Barcelona ; first a bout with <!--del_lnk--> hepatitis, and then an ill-timed tackle by <!--del_lnk--> Athletic Bilbao&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Andoni Goikoetxea that put Maradona&#39;s career on the line ; Maradona&#39;s physical strength and willpower made it possible for him to be back on the pitch after only 14 weeks. It is said that while playing for Barcelona, Maradona was introduced to cocaine, to which he would become addicted. <p><a id="The_Napoli_era" name="The_Napoli_era"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Napoli era</span></h3>

      </div>
      <p>Maradona got into frequent disputes with Barcelona&#39;s directors, especially club president <!--del_lnk--> Josep Llu&iacute;s Nu&ntilde;ez and in 1984 he demanded a transfer out of <!--del_lnk--> Nou Camp. He subsequently went to <!--del_lnk--> Serie A and <!--del_lnk--> SSC Napoli for another record fee, &pound;6.9m, and became an adored star among the club&#39;s fans, as he elevated the team to its most successful era. Napoli won their only <!--del_lnk--> Italian Championships (1986/87 and 1989/1990), a <!--del_lnk--> Coppa Italia (1987), a <!--del_lnk--> UEFA Cup (1989) and an <!--del_lnk--> Italian Supercup (1990). Napoli were also runners-up in the Italian Championship twice (1987/88 and 1988/89).<p>In <!--del_lnk--> Naples, Maradona was present throughout a transformation of the local club. They had traditionally been overshadowed by the teams from the industrial cities in the north, but Maradona&#39;s arrival (along with <!--del_lnk--> Careca and others) brought them a first <!--del_lnk--> scudetto in 1987 , followed by a second in 1990, and cup successes. However, he also faced a scandal there regarding an illegitimate <!--del_lnk--> son and was the object of some suspicion over his friendship with the <!--del_lnk--> Camorra, the local <!--del_lnk--> mafia.<p>Maradona left Napoli in 1992, after serving a 15-month ban for failing the <!--del_lnk--> drug test for <!--del_lnk--> cocaine, and played for <!--del_lnk--> Sevilla FC (1992&ndash;93), <!--del_lnk--> Newell&#39;s Old Boys (1993) and <!--del_lnk--> Boca Juniors (1995&ndash;97).  He also attempted to work as a <!--del_lnk--> coach on two short stints, leading <!--del_lnk--> Mandiy&uacute; of <!--del_lnk--> Corrientes (1994) and <!--del_lnk--> Racing Club (1995) without much success. He retired from football on <!--del_lnk--> October 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1997; his 37th birthday.<br clear="all" />

At age 18, he played the <!--del_lnk--> Football World Youth Championship for Argentina, and was the star of the tournament, shining in their 3&ndash;1 final win over the <!--del_lnk--> USSR team.<p><a name="1982_World_Cup"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1982 World Cup</span></h3>
      <p>Maradona played his first <!--del_lnk--> World Cup tournament in 1982. In the first round, Argentina, the defending champions, lost to <!--del_lnk--> Belgium. Although the team convincingly beat <!--del_lnk--> Hungary and <!--del_lnk--> El Salvador to progress to the second round, they were defeated in the second round by <!--del_lnk--> Italy, the eventual winners. Maradona played in all five matches without being substituted, scoring twice against Hungary, but was sent off with 5 minutes remaining in the game against Brazil for serious foul play.<p><a name="1986_World_Cup"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1986 World Cup</span></h3>
      <p>Maradona captained the Argentine national team to victory in the <!--del_lnk--> 1986 FIFA World Cup, the team winning the final against <!--del_lnk--> West Germany. Throughout the 1986 World Cup, Maradona asserted his dominance and was the best player of the tournament. He played every minute of every game, scored 5 goals and made 5 assists. However, it was the two goals he scored in the quarter-final game against <!--del_lnk--> England which cemented his legend. Action replay footage showed that the first <!--del_lnk--> goal was scored with the aid of his <!--del_lnk--> hand. He later claimed it was the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Hand of God&quot; and described it as &quot;a little with the head of Maradona and a little with the hand of God,&quot; implying that God was ultimately responsible for the goal, because the <!--del_lnk--> referee had missed the handball offense. However, on <!--del_lnk--> 22 August <!--del_lnk--> 2005 Maradona acknowledged on his television show that he hit the ball with his hand purposely and that he immediately knew the goal was illegitimate. He recalled thinking right after the goal that<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>After the game, Maradona was confronted about his goal. He was quoted saying to the reporters &quot;Even if there was a hand, it must have been the hand of God.&quot; Thus giving him and his goal the nickname, the Hand of God, or in his own language, <i>la mano de dios</i>.<p>In contrast, Maradona&#39;s second goal in the England game was a display of Maradona&#39;s talented dribbling ability. He picked up the ball in his own half, swiveled around and ran more than half the length of the field, dribbling past five English players (<!--del_lnk--> Glenn Hoddle, <!--del_lnk--> Peter Reid, <!--del_lnk--> Kenny Sansom, <!--del_lnk--> Terry Butcher, and <!--del_lnk--> Terry Fenwick) as well as goalkeeper <!--del_lnk--> Peter Shilton. This goal was voted <!--del_lnk--> Goal of the Century in a 2002 online poll conducted by <a href="../../wp/f/FIFA.htm" title="FIFA">FIFA</a>. Argentina held on to defeat England 2-1 in that game, knocking them out of the tournament. The two goals were ranked 6th in the <!--del_lnk--> 100 Greatest Sporting Moments in 2002 by the UK&#39;s Channel 4 television channel.<p>He followed this with two other goals in the semi-final against <!--del_lnk--> Belgium. In the final, the opposing <!--del_lnk--> German side attempted to subdue him by double-marking but he nevertheless found the space to give the final service to <!--del_lnk--> Jorge Burruchaga for the winning goal. Argentina beat West Germany 3-2 and Maradona lifted the World Cup trophy after dominating the tournament like no other player, before or since.<p><a name="1990_World_Cup"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1990 World Cup</span></h3>
      <p>Maradona captained Argentina again in the <!--del_lnk--> 1990 FIFA World Cup. An ankle injury affected his overall performance, and he was much less dominant than four years earlier. In the round of 16 match against <!--del_lnk--> Brazil, he assisted <!--del_lnk--> Claudio Caniggia on the winning goal (1-0) that allowed his team to advance to the next round. Argentina then faced <!--del_lnk--> Yugoslavia in quarterfinals, with the match ending 0-0 after 120 minutes, and Argentina advancing on penalty kicks. Maradona missed one of the penalty kicks, but his team still won 3-2. He scored Argentina&#39;s final penalty in the semi-final shoot-out win against the host nation Italy. In the final, Argentina lost 1-0 to West Germany due to a dubious penalty decision in the 85th minute.<p><a name="1994_World_Cup"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1994 World Cup</span></h3>
      <p>He arrived at the <!--del_lnk--> 1994 FIFA World Cup and played two games (scoring one goal) before being sent home after failing a <!--del_lnk--> drug test for <!--del_lnk--> ephedrine <!--del_lnk--> doping. In his autobiography, Maradona argued that the test result was due to his personal trainer giving him the power drink Rip Fuel. The US version, unlike the Argentinian, contained the chemical and Maradona claimed that, having run out of his Argentinian dosage, his trainer bought the US drink, not realizing the difference in formula. FIFA subsequently expelled him from USA &#39;94 and the Argentinians, affected by his absence, went home in the second round. Maradona has also separately claimed that he had an agreement, on which FIFA later reneged, to allow him to use the drug for weight loss before the competition in order to be able to play, so that the World Cup would not lose prestige because of his absence. This allegation was never proved, and many attribute his comment (&quot;they cut off my legs&quot;) to Diego&#39;s anger at being suspended.<p><a id="Retirement_and_honours" name="Retirement_and_honours"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Retirement and honours</span></h2>
      <p>In 2000, Maradona published his autobiography <i>Yo Soy El Diego</i> (&quot;I am <i>The Diego</i>&quot;), which became an instant <!--del_lnk--> bestseller  in his home country. Later, in 2002, Maradona donated the Cuban royalties of his book to &quot;the Cuban people and Fidel.&quot; <p>Also in 2000, while Napoli retired the number 10 jersey in his honour, FIFA conducted an <!--del_lnk--> poll on the <a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">Internet</a>, to find the <i>Player of the Century</i>. Maradona, with 53.6% of the votes, was a clear winner. After Brazilian commentators claimed the voting was flawed (as a younger internet demographic would have likely seen Maradona play, but not Pele), FIFA appointed a &quot;Football Family&quot; committee of football experts, which voted to elect <a href="../../wp/p/Pel%25C3%25A9.htm" title="Pel&eacute;">Pel&eacute;</a> to the title. Maradona protested at the change of decision procedure and declared he would not attend the ceremony if Pele was chosen. Eventually, two awards were made, one to each of the pair: Maradona accepted his prize, but left the awards ceremony without waiting to see Pel&eacute; receive his accolade. <p>In 2001, the <!--del_lnk--> Argentine Football Association (AFA) asked FIFA for authorization to <!--del_lnk--> retire the <!--del_lnk--> jersey number 10 as an homage to Maradona. FIFA did not grant the request, even though Argentine officials have maintained that FIFA hinted that it would. <p>Maradona has won other polls, including a 2002 FIFA poll in which his second goal against England was chosen as the <!--del_lnk--> best goal ever scored in a World Cup; he also won the most votes in a poll to determine the All-Time Ultimate World Cup Team.<p><!--del_lnk--> Asociaci&oacute;n Atl&eacute;tica Argentinos Juniors named the team&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> stadium after Maradona on <!--del_lnk--> December 26, <!--del_lnk--> 2003.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 22 June <!--del_lnk--> 2005, it was announced that Maradona would return to <!--del_lnk--> Boca Juniors as a sports vice president in charge of managing the First Division roster (after a disappointing <!--del_lnk--> 2004&ndash;05 season, which coincided with Boca&#39;s centenary) . His contract began <!--del_lnk--> 1 August <!--del_lnk--> 2005, and one of his first recommendations proved to be very effective: he was the one who decided to hire <!--del_lnk--> Alfio Basile as the new coach. With Maradona having a close relationship with the players, Boca went on to win the 2005 <!--del_lnk--> Apertura title, the 2006 <!--del_lnk--> Clausura title, the <!--del_lnk--> 2005 <!--del_lnk--> Copa Sudamericana and the <!--del_lnk--> 2005 <!--del_lnk--> Recopa Sudamericana.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 15 August <!--del_lnk--> 2005, Maradona made his debut as host of a talk-variety show on Argentine television, <!--del_lnk--> La Noche del 10 (&quot;The Night of the no. 10&quot;). His main guest on opening night was <a href="../../wp/p/Pel%25C3%25A9.htm" title="Pel&eacute;">Pel&eacute;</a>; the two had a friendly chat, showing no signs of past differences. In subsequent evenings, he led the ratings on all occasions but one. Most guests were drawn from the worlds of football and show business, including <!--del_lnk--> Zidane, <!--del_lnk--> Ronaldo and <!--del_lnk--> Hern&aacute;n Crespo, but also included interviews with other notable personalities such as <a href="../../wp/f/Fidel_Castro.htm" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Mike Tyson.<p>During 2006, Maradona remained aloof of day-to-day activities and was seen mostly on game days, cheering the Boca from his private box in the <i>Bombonera</i>. On August 26, 2006, it was announced that Maradona was quitting his position in the club Boca Juniors because of disagreements with the AFA, who selected Basile to be the new coach of the <!--del_lnk--> Argentina National Football Team.<p>The award-winning <!--del_lnk--> Serbian filmmaker <!--del_lnk--> Emir Kusturica is creating a documentary about Maradona&#39;s life, entitled <i><!--del_lnk--> Maradona</i>. The film is currently in post-production, and its release is anticipated in <!--del_lnk--> 2006. Italian-Australian actor <!--del_lnk--> Marco Leonardi has been confirmed to play the prolific footballer in the film.<p>In September 2006, Maradona, in his famous blue and white number 10, was the captain for Argentina in a 3-day World Cup of Indoor Football tournament in Spain. Against Spain, Maradona set up the first goal for Argentina with a lob over the top of the defense for his teammate to head it home.<p><a id="Personal_agents" name="Personal_agents"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Personal agents</span></h2>
      <p>Jorge Cyterszpiller, a childhood friend, was Maradona&#39;s first agent. He set up <i>Maradona Producciones</i> but did not score any major successes with merchandising, as counterfeiters would quickly imitate any product that came on the market. On his advice, Maradona started charging for interviews, a move that generated some controversy.<p>After breaking up with Cyterszpiller, Maradona hooked up with Guillermo Coppola, a bank employee who had started representing players as a hobby and was already a major agent in the mid-1980s. Coppola oversaw the biggest contracts of Maradona&#39;s career, but also was involved in the drug scandals of the early 1990s. Maradona and Coppola parted ways acrimoniously, and they still refer to the end of their relations as an &quot;open wound&quot;.<p><a id="Personal_life" name="Personal_life"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Personal life</span></h2>
      <p>Maradona married long-time fianc&eacute;e Claudia Villafa&ntilde;e on <!--del_lnk--> November 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1989 in Buenos Aires, after the birth of their daughters, Dalma Nerea (b. 1987) and Giannina Dinorah (b. 1989). In his autobiography, Maradona admits he was not always faithful to Claudia, even though he refers to her as the love of his life.<p>Maradona and Villafa&ntilde;e <!--del_lnk--> divorced in 2004. Daughter Dalma has since asserted that the divorce was the best solution for all, as her parents remained on friendly terms. They traveled together to Napoli for a series of homages in June 2005  and were seen together on many other occasions, including the Argentina matches during <!--del_lnk--> 2006 FIFA World Cup.<p>During the divorce proceedings, Maradona admitted he was the father of <!--del_lnk--> Diego Sinagra (b. <!--del_lnk--> Naples, 1986), as was claimed by the youth&#39;s mother Cristiana Sinagra. (The Italian courts had so ruled in 1993, after Maradona refused to undergo <a href="../../wp/d/DNA.htm" title="DNA">DNA</a> tests for proving or disproving his paternity.) Diego Jr. met Maradona for the first time in May 2003 after tricking his way onto a golf course in Naples where Maradona was playing. <p>After the divorce, Claudia embarked on a career as a theatre producer, and Dalma is seeking an acting career; she has expressed her desire to attend the <!--del_lnk--> Actor&#39;s Studio in <!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles.<p> <p><a id="Drug_abuse_and_health_situation" name="Drug_abuse_and_health_situation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Drug abuse and health situation</span></h2>
      <p>Maradona has had a series of health problems since retirement. Since the 1990s, Maradona has been battling a <!--del_lnk--> cocaine <!--del_lnk--> addiction, which included spells in <a href="../../wp/s/Switzerland.htm" title="Switzerland">Swiss</a> and Cuban <!--del_lnk--> detox clinics. Between 2002 and 2005, Maradona spent most of his time in Cuba.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> April 18, <!--del_lnk--> 2004, doctors reported that Maradona had suffered a major <a href="../../wp/m/Myocardial_infarction.htm" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a> following a cocaine overdose; he was admitted to intensive care in a Buenos Aires hospital. Scores of fans gathered around the clinic. Days after the heart attack, a nurse was caught taking photos of Maradona with a <!--del_lnk--> mobile phone and was promptly fired by the hospital managers.<p>After he showed improvement, Maradona was taken off the respirator on <!--del_lnk--> April 23 and remained in intensive care for several days before being discharged on <!--del_lnk--> April 29. He returned to Cuba in May.<p>Maradona has always had a tendency to put on weight, and suffered increasingly with <!--del_lnk--> obesity from the end of his playing career until undergoing <!--del_lnk--> gastric bypass surgery in a clinic in <!--del_lnk--> Cartagena de Indias, <a href="../../wp/c/Colombia.htm" title="Colombia">Colombia</a> on <!--del_lnk--> March 6, <!--del_lnk--> 2005. When Maradona resumed public appearances shortly thereafter, he displayed a notably thinner figure.<br clear="both" />

      <p>During the nineties, Diego Maradona supported the presidency of <!--del_lnk--> neoliberal <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Menem in Argentina. In more recent years, Maradona has shown more sympathy to <!--del_lnk--> left-wing ideologies. He became friends with <a href="../../wp/f/Fidel_Castro.htm" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a> while in treatment in <a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>.

      <p>Ever since 1986, it is common for Argentines abroad to hear Maradona&#39;s name as a token of recognition, even in remote places. In Argentina, Maradona is often talked about in terms reserved for legends. In the Argentine film <i>El Hijo de la Novia</i> (&quot;The bride&#39;s son&quot;), an actor who plays a fake <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic</a> <!--del_lnk--> priest says to a bar patron: &quot;they idolized him and then crucified him&quot;. When scolded by a friend for taking the prank too far, the fake priest retorts: &quot;But I was talking about Maradona&quot;.<p>In Buenos Aires, fans organized the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Church of Maradona.&quot; Maradona&#39;s 43rd birthday in 2003 marked the start of the Year 43 D.D. - &quot;Despu&eacute;s de Diego&quot; or After Diego - for its founding 200 members. Tens of thousands more  have become members via the church&#39;s official web site.<p>Hounded for years by the press, Maradona even fired a <!--del_lnk--> compressed-air rifle against reporters who, so he claimed, invaded his privacy.

      <p>Maradona still generates controversy in England. In 1988, he played in an invitational game at London&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Wembley Stadium celebrating the centenary of the English Football League. Maradona was part of the &#39;Rest of the World XI&#39; playing against the English League XI. Each time that Maradona touched the ball he was subject to angry chants and boos from the crowd. It was reported that he received threats while in England.<p>A columnist for the sports daily <i>Ol&eacute;</i> welcomed Maradona&#39;s hosting a TV show in 2005, noting that &quot;for the first time, he seems to have found his place in the world outside the football pitch&quot;.<p>A television commercial for Brazilian soft drink <!--del_lnk--> Guaran&aacute; Antarctica portrayed Maradona as a member of the Brazilian national football team, including wearing the yellow jersey and singing the Brazilian national anthem with Brazilian caps <!--del_lnk--> Kak&aacute; and <!--del_lnk--> Ronaldo. He wakes up crying that it was a nightmare.<p>In May 2006, Maradona agreed to take part in UK&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Soccer Aid (a program to raise money for <!--del_lnk--> Unicef). Maradona showed his skill with the ball and even scored a penalty.<p><a id="Career_statistics" name="Career_statistics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Career statistics</span></h2>
