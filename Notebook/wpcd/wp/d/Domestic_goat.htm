      <p>The <b>domestic goat</b> <i><b>(Capra aegagrus hircus)</b></i> is a <!--del_lnk--> domesticated subspecies of the <!--del_lnk--> wild goat of <!--del_lnk--> Southwest Asia and <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Europe. The goat is a member of the bovidae family and is closely related to the <!--del_lnk--> sheep, both being in the <!--del_lnk--> goat antelope subfamily caprinae.<p>Domestic goats are one of the oldest domesticated species. For thousands of years, goats have been used for their <a href="../../wp/m/Milk.htm" title="Milk">milk</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Meat.htm" title="Meat">meat</a>, hair, and skins all over the world. In the last century they have also gained some popularity as <!--del_lnk--> pets.<p>Female goats are referred to as <i><b>does</b></i> or <i><b>nannies</b></i>, intact males as <i><b>bucks</b></i> or <i><b>billies</b></i>; their offspring are <i><b>kids</b></i>. <!--del_lnk--> Castrated males are <i><b>wethers</b></i>.

      <p><a id="Etymology" name="Etymology"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Etymology</span></h2>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Modern English word <i>goat</i> comes from the <!--del_lnk--> Old English <i>gat</i> which meant <i>she-goat</i> which itself derived from <!--del_lnk--> Proto-Germanic <i>*gaitaz</i> (compare <!--del_lnk--> Old Norse and <a href="../../wp/d/Dutch_language.htm" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a> <i>geit</i>, <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a> <i>Gei&szlig;</i> and <!--del_lnk--> Gothic <i>gaits</i> all meaning <i>goat</i>) ultimately from <!--del_lnk--> Proto-Indo-European <i>*ghaidos</i> meaning <i>young goat</i> but also <i>play</i> (compare Latin <i>h&aelig;dus</i> meaning <i>kid</i>). The word for <i>male goat</i> in Old English was <i>bucca</i> (which now exists as the word <i><!--del_lnk--> buck</i>, meaning certain male herbivores) until a shift to <i>he-goat/she-goat</i> occurred in the late 12th century. <i>Nanny goat</i> originated in the 18th century and billy goat in the 19th.<p>The domestic goat&#39;s most often seen colour is of an ivory hue, and the rarest colors are of an &quot;cyanish&quot; hue<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p>Goats seem to have been first domesticated roughly 10,000 years ago in the <!--del_lnk--> Zagros Mountains of <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a>. Ancient cultures and <a href="../../wp/t/Tribe.htm" title="Tribe">tribes</a> began to keep them for easy access to <a href="../../wp/m/Milk.htm" title="Milk">milk</a>, hair, meat, and skins. Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that wandered on hills or other grazing areas, often tended by <!--del_lnk--> goatherds who were frequently children or <!--del_lnk--> adolescents, similar to the more widely known <!--del_lnk--> shepherd. These methods of <!--del_lnk--> herding are still used today.<p>Historically, goathide has been used for water and <a href="../../wp/w/Wine.htm" title="Wine">wine</a> bottles in both traveling and transporting wine for sale. It has also been used to produce <!--del_lnk--> parchment, which was the most common material used for <a href="../../wp/w/Writing.htm" title="Writing">writing</a> in Europe until the invention of the <!--del_lnk--> printing press.<p><a id="Reproduction" name="Reproduction"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Reproduction</span></h2>
      <p>In some climates goats, like humans, are able to <!--del_lnk--> breed at any time of the year. In northern climates and among the Swiss breeds, the breeding season commences as the day length shortens, and ends in early spring. Does of any breed come into heat every 21 days for 2&ndash;48 hours. A doe in heat typically flags her tail often, stays near the buck if one is present, becomes more vocal, and may also show a decrease in appetite and milk production for the duration of the heat.<p>Bucks (intact males) of Swiss and northern breeds come into rut in the fall as with the doe&#39;s heat cycles. Rut is characterized by a decrease in appetite, <!--del_lnk--> obsessive interest in the does, a strong heat.<div class="thumb tleft">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>In addition to live breeding, <!--del_lnk--> artificial insemination has gained popularity among goat <!--del_lnk--> breeders, as it allows for rapid improvement because of breeder access to a wide variety of <!--del_lnk--> bloodlines.<p><!--del_lnk--> Gestation length is approximately 150 days. <!--del_lnk--> Twins are the usual result, with single and <!--del_lnk--> triplet births also common. Less frequent are litters of <!--del_lnk--> quadruplet, <!--del_lnk--> quintuplet, and even <!--del_lnk--> sextuplet kids. Birthing, known as <i>kidding</i>, generally occurs uneventfully with few complications. The mother often eats the <!--del_lnk--> placenta, which, with its oxytocin, gives her much needed nutrients, helps staunch her bleeding, and is believed by some to reduce the lure of the birth scent to predators.<p><i>Freshening</i> (coming into milk production) occurs at kidding. Milk production varies with the breed, age, quality, and diet of the doe; dairy goats generally produce between 660 to 1,800 L (1,500 and 4,000 lb) of milk per 305 day <!--del_lnk--> lactation. On average, a good quality dairy doe will give at least 6 lb (2.7&nbsp;L) of milk per day while she is in milk, although a first time milker may produce less, or as much as 16 lb (7.3&nbsp;L) or more of milk in exceptional cases. Meat, fibre, and <!--del_lnk--> pet breeds are not usually milked and simply produce enough for the kids until <!--del_lnk--> weaning.<p><a id="Feeding_goats" name="Feeding_goats"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Feeding goats</span></h2>
      <p>Goats are reputed to be willing to eat almost anything. Many farmers use inexpensive (i.e. not purebred) goats for brush control, leading to the use of the term &quot;brush goats.&quot; (Brush goats are not a variety of goat, but rather a function they perform.) Because they prefer weeds (e.g. multiflora rose, thorns, small trees) to clover and grass, they are often used to keep fields clear for other animals. The digestive systems of a goat allow nearly any organic substance to be broken down and used as nutrients.<div class="thumb tright">
       <div class="thumbinner" style="width:182px;"><a class="internal" href="../../images/39/3903.jpg.htm" title="A goat feeding on weeds."><img alt="A goat feeding on weeds." class="thumbimage" height="180" longdesc="/wiki/Image:GoatEatingWeeds.jpg" src="../../images/39/3903.jpg" width="180" /></a><div class="thumbcaption">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Contrary to this reputation, they are quite fastidious in their habits, preferring to browse on the tips of woody shrubs and trees, as well as the occasional broad leaved plant. It can fairly be said that goats will eat almost anything in the botanical world. Their plant diet is extremely varied and includes some species which are toxic or detrimental to cattle and sheep. This makes them valuable for controlling <a href="../../wp/w/Weed.htm" title="Weed">noxious weeds</a> and clearing brush and undergrowth. They will seldom eat soiled food or water unless facing <!--del_lnk--> starvation. This is one of the reasons why goat rearing is most often <!--del_lnk--> free ranging since stall-fed goat rearing involves extensive upkeep and is seldom commercially viable.<p>Goats do not actually consume <!--del_lnk--> garbage, <!--del_lnk--> tin cans, or <a href="../../wp/c/Clothing.htm" title="Clothing">clothing</a>, although they will occasionally eat items made primarily of plant material, which can include wood. Their reputation for doing so is most likely due to their intensely inquisitive and intelligent nature: they will explore anything new or unfamiliar in their surroundings. They do so primarily with their <!--del_lnk--> prehensile upper lip and tongue. This is why they investigate clothes and sometimes washing powder boxes by nibbling at them.<p>The digestive physiology of a very young kid is essentially the same as that of a <!--del_lnk--> monogastric animal. Milk digestion begins in the <!--del_lnk--> abomasum, the milk having bypassed the rumen via closure of the reticular/esophageal groove during suckling. At birth the rumen is undeveloped, and as the kid begins to consume solid feed, the rumen increases in size and in its capacity to absorb nutrients.<p>Goats will consume, on average, 4.5 pounds of dry matter per 100 lbs of body weight per day.<p><a id="Goat_Uses" name="Goat_Uses"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Goat Uses</span></h2>
      <p>A goat is said to be truly useful both when alive and dead, providing meat and milk while the skin provides hide. A <!--del_lnk--> charity is involved in providing goats to <a href="../../wp/p/Poverty.htm" title="Poverty">impoverished</a> people in Africa. The main reason cited was that goats are easier to manage than <a href="../../wp/c/Cattle.htm" title="Cattle">cattle</a> and have multiple uses.<p><a id="Meat" name="Meat"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Meat</span></h3>
      <p>The taste of goat meat, called <i>chevon</i> (which, like many meat names, is from the <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a> word for the animal, in this case <i>ch&egrave;vre</i>), is similar to that of lamb meat. However, some feel that it has a similar taste to <!--del_lnk--> veal or <!--del_lnk--> venison, depending on the age and condition of the goat. It can be prepared in a variety of ways including <!--del_lnk--> stewed, <!--del_lnk--> baked, <!--del_lnk--> grilled, <!--del_lnk--> barbecued, <!--del_lnk--> minced, <!--del_lnk--> canned, or made into <!--del_lnk--> sausage. Goat <!--del_lnk--> jerky is also another popular variety. In India, the rice-preparation of mutton <!--del_lnk--> Biryani uses goat meat as its primary ingredients to produce a rich taste.<p>Nutritionally, it is healthier than <!--del_lnk--> mutton as it is lower in fat and <!--del_lnk--> cholesterol, and comparable to <a href="../../wp/c/Chicken.htm" title="Chicken">chicken</a>. It also has more minerals than chicken, and is lower in total and <!--del_lnk--> saturated fats than other meats. Chevon is therefore classified as a <!--del_lnk--> white meat. One reason for the leanness is that goats do not accumulate fat deposits or &quot;marbling&quot; in their muscles; chevon must ideally be cooked longer and at lower temperatures than other red meats. It is popular in the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, <!--del_lnk--> South Asia, Africa, northeastern <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> West Indies, and <a href="../../wp/b/Belize.htm" title="Belize">Belize</a>. Chevon, as yet, is not popular in most western nations, though it is among the fastest growing sectors of the livestock industry in the US, mainly due to <!--del_lnk--> immigrants.<p>Other parts of the goat including organs are also equally edible. Special delicacies include the <a href="../../wp/b/Brain.htm" title="Brain">brain</a> and <!--del_lnk--> liver. The head and legs of the goat are <!--del_lnk--> smoked and used to prepare unique <!--del_lnk--> spicy dishes and <a href="../../wp/s/Soup.htm" title="Soup">soup</a>.<p>One of the most popular goats grown for meat is the South African Boer, introduced into the United States in the early 1990s. The New Zealand Kiko is also considered a meat breed, as is the <!--del_lnk--> Myotonic or &quot;fainting&quot; goat, a breed originally identified in Tennessee.<p><a id="Milk_and_cheese" name="Milk_and_cheese"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Milk and cheese</span></h3>
      <p>Some goats are bred for <!--del_lnk--> dairy purposes. The milk can be drunk fresh; it is commonly processed into <a href="../../wp/c/Cheese.htm" title="Cheese">cheese</a>, and small commerical operations offer goat <a href="../../wp/b/Butter.htm" title="Butter">butter</a> and <!--del_lnk--> ice cream. Contrary to popular belief, goats&#39; milk is not naturally bad tasting. When handled properly, from clean and healthy goats, in a sanitary manner, and cooled quickly, the flavor is unremarkable and inoffensive. Also, it is necessary to separate the strong-smelling buck from the dairy does, as his scent will rub off on them and will taint the milk.<p>Goats&#39; milk is more easily digested by humans than cows&#39; milk. It contains less <!--del_lnk--> lactose, so is less likely to trigger <!--del_lnk--> lactose intolerance. The milk is naturally homogenized since it lacks the <a href="../../wp/p/Protein.htm" title="Protein">protein</a> <!--del_lnk--> agglutinin. The <!--del_lnk--> curd is much smaller and more digestible. For these reasons, goats&#39; milk is recommended for infants and people who have difficulty with cows&#39; milk.<p><!--del_lnk--> Goat cheese is commonly known as <i>ch&egrave;vre</i>, after the <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a> word for &quot;goat&quot;. Some varieties include <!--del_lnk--> Rocamadour and <!--del_lnk--> feta.<p><a id="Fiber" name="Fiber"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Fibre</span></h3>
      <p>Some goats are bred for the <!--del_lnk--> fibre from their coats. Most goats have softer insulating hairs nearer the skin, and longer <!--del_lnk--> guard hairs on the surface. The desirable fibre for the <!--del_lnk--> textile industry is the former, and it goes by several names (mohair, fleece, goat wool, cashmere, etc., explained below). The coarse guard hairs are worthless as they cannot be spun or dyed. The proportion and texture varies between <!--del_lnk--> breeds, and has been a target of <!--del_lnk--> selective breeding for millennia.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Cashmere goat produces a fibre, <!--del_lnk--> cashmere wool, which is one of the best in the world. It is very fine and soft. Most goats produce cashmere fibre to some degree, however the Cashmere goat has been specially bred to produce a much higher amount of it with fewer guard hairs.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Angora breed produces long, curling, lustrous locks of <!--del_lnk--> mohair. The entire body of the goat is covered with mohair and there are no guard hairs. The locks constantly grow and can be four inches or more in length.<p>Goats do not have to be <!--del_lnk--> slaughtered to harvest the wool, which is instead <!--del_lnk--> sheared (cut from the body) in the case of Angora goats, or combed, in the case of Cashmere goats. However, the Angora goat usually gets shorn twice a year with an average yield of about 10 pounds while the Cashmere goat grows its fibre once a year and it takes about a week to comb out by hand, yielding only about 4 ounces.<p>The fibre is made into products such as sweaters and doll&#39;s hair. Both cashmere and mohair are warmer per ounce than <!--del_lnk--> wool and are not scratchy or itchy or as allergenic as wool sometimes is. Both fibers command a higher price than wool, compensating for the fact that there is less fibre per goat than there would be wool per sheep.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> South Asia, cashmere is called <i>pashmina</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Persian <i>pashmina</i> = fine wool) and these goats are called <!--del_lnk--> <i>pashmina</i> goats (often mistaken for sheep). Since these goats actually belong to the upper <a href="../../wp/k/Kashmir_region.htm" title="Kashmir">Kashmir</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Laddakh region, their wool came to be known as cashmere in the West. The <i>pashmina</i> <!--del_lnk--> shawls of Kashmir with their intricate embroidery are very famous.<p><a id="Skin" name="Skin"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Skin</span></h3>
      <p>Goat skin is still used today to make <!--del_lnk--> gloves, <!--del_lnk--> boots, and other products that require a soft hide. <i>Kid gloves</i>, popular in <!--del_lnk--> Victorian times, are still made today. The <!--del_lnk--> Black Bengal breed, native to <a href="../../wp/b/Bangladesh.htm" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, provides high-quality skin.

      <p>Goat <!--del_lnk--> breeders&#39; clubs frequently hold <!--del_lnk--> shows, where goats are judged on traits relating to <!--del_lnk--> conformation, <!--del_lnk--> udder quality, evidence of high production/ longevity, build/muscling (meat goats and pet goats) and fiber production/fiber (fibre goats). People who show their goats usually keep registered stock and the offspring of award winning animals command a higher price. Registered goats, in general, are usually higher priced if for no other reason than that records have been kept proving their ancestry and the production and other data of their sires, dams, and other ancestors. A registered doe is usually less of a gamble than buying a doe at random (as at an auction or sale barn) because of these records and the reputation of the breeder.<p>Children&#39;s clubs such as <!--del_lnk--> 4-H also allow goats to be shown. Children&#39;s shows often include a <!--del_lnk--> showmanship class, where the cleanliness and presentation of both the animal and the exhibitor as well as the handler&#39;s ability and skill in handling the goat are scored. In a showmanship class, conformation is irrelevant since this is not what is being judged.<p>Various <b>Dairy Goat Scorecards</b> (milking does) &mdash; are systems used for judging shows in the U.S. The American Dairy Goat Association (ADGA) scorecard for an adult doe is as follows:<p>General Appearance: 35 points (the doe should be strong in the feet, legs, and back, while showing good breed character and appropriate stature for her age and breed.)<p>Dairy Character: 20 points (the doe should be lean and angular, have ribs which are flexible but strong, and have smooth, pliable skin. These characteristics have been proven to result in high milk production.)<p>Body Capacity: 10 points (the doe should be large and strong with a wide, deep barrel).<p>Mammary System: 35 points (udder should be productive and very well attached so as to be held up high away from possible injury, teats should be of a good size and shape for easy milking).<p>In all the perfect dairy goat would score all 100 points, and this is the standard by which the goats are judged. Young stock and bucks are judged by different scorecards which place more emphasis on the other three categories; general appearance, body capacity, and dairy character.<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> The American Goat Society (AGS) has a similar, but not identical scorecard that is used in their shows. The miniature dairy goats may be judged by either of the two scorecards.</ul>
      <p>The <b>Angora Goat scorecard</b> used by the Colored Angora Goat Breeder&#39;s Association or CAGBA (which covers the white and the colored goats) is as follows:<p>Fleece- 70 points<p>Completeness of cover and Uniformity: 8 points (Fineness, length, type of lock and covering, adequate covering of mohair over the entire body, neither too much nor too little on the face).<p>Luster and Handle of Fleece: 8 points (Good, bright type of mohair, silky feeling)<p>Density and Yield: 8 points (Number of fibers per unit area, determined by the amount of skin exposed when the fleece is parted).<p>Fineness: 14 points (Finer mohair generally is more desirable, uniformity over entire fleece).<p>Character and Style: 6 points (Equivalent to one inch per month or more, uniform over entire body).<p>Freedom from Kemp: 10 points (Kemp fibers are large, opaque, &quot;hairy&quot; fibers most commonly found at the withers, along the spine and around the tail and britch.<p>Body- 50 points<p>Size and weight for age: 8 points (Minimum weight for yearling bucks-80 lbs, yearling does-60 lbs).<p>Constitution and Vigor: 8 points (Width and depth of chest, fullness of heartgirth and spring of ribs).<p>Conformation: 11 points (Width and depth of body, straightness of back, width of loin, straightness of legs).<p>Amount of bone: 8 points (Indicated by the size of the bone below the knees and hocks. Should be clean and in proportion to the size of the animal. Strength of feet and legs).<p>Angora Breed Type: 15 points (Indicated by head, horns, ears and topknot. Horns should be wide set and should spiral out and back. Wattles highly discouraged).<p>Physical Disqualifications- Disqualify the animal Deformed mouth, broken down pasturns, deformed feet, crooked legs, abnormalities of testicles, missing testicles, more than 3 inch split in scrotum, close set distorted horns, or roached back.<p>The perfect Angora goat would score a 120 on the total points.

      <p>Goats are <!--del_lnk--> ruminants. They have four stomachs consisting of the <!--del_lnk--> rumen, the <!--del_lnk--> reticulum, the <!--del_lnk--> omasum, and the abomasum.<p>Goats have horizontal slit-shaped <!--del_lnk--> pupils. The narrower the pupil, the more accurate the <!--del_lnk--> depth perception of <!--del_lnk--> peripheral vision is, so narrowing it in one direction would increase depth perception in that plane <!--del_lnk--> <!--del_lnk--> . Animals with pupils like goats and sheep may have evolved horizontal pupils because better vision in the vertical plane may be beneficial in mountainous environments. <!--del_lnk--> .<p>Some breeds of sheep and goats appear superficially similar, but goat tails point up, whereas sheep tails hang down (and hence may be <!--del_lnk--> docked).<p><a id="Gallery" name="Gallery"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Gallery</span></h2>

      <p>Goats are mentioned many times in the <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">Bible</a>. A goat was a considered a clean animal by <!--del_lnk--> Jewish dietary laws and was slaughtered for an honored guest. It was also acceptable for some kinds of sacrifices. Goat hair curtains were used in the tent that contained the tabernacle (Exodus 25.4). On <!--del_lnk--> Yom Kippur, the festival of the Day of Atonement, two goats were chosen and lots were drawn for them. One was sacrificed and the other allowed to escape into the wilderness, symbolically carrying with it the sins of the community. From this comes the word &quot;<!--del_lnk--> scapegoat&quot;. A leader or king was sometimes compared to a male goat leading the flock. In the <!--del_lnk--> New Testament <a href="../../wp/j/Jesus.htm" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> likened true followers of himself to sheep and false followers to goats.<p><a id="Popular_culture" name="Popular_culture"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Popular culture</span></h2>
