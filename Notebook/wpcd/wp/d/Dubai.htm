      <p>There are many archaeological sites in the Emirate of Dubai. The most famous of these is the Al Qusais settlement which dates back to the period 2600 BC to 2000 BC. A second settlement is in the Al Sofouh area near the present Dubai Media and Internet City. It is a round tomb that dates back to the period 2500 BC to 2000 BC and it is part of the Umm Al Nar civilization which inhabited this region during this period. A third location is the Hatta Valley, 115km south-east of Dubai city near the Omani border. In this location a few stones, called sharlos, with different images and writings dating back to the third millenium were found. They are now kept in the Dubai Museum.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>The oldest place where the name of Dubai was mentioned is in Arabic book called &quot;Mojam Ma Ostojam men Asmae Al belaad wal Mawadhea&quot; (&#x645;&#x639;&#x62C;&#x645; &#x645;&#x627; &#x627;&#x633;&#x62A;&#x639;&#x62C;&#x645; &#x645;&#x646; &#x623;&#x633;&#x645;&#x627;&#x621; &#x627;&#x644;&#x628;&#x644;&#x627;&#x62F; &#x648;&#x627;&#x644;&#x645;&#x648;&#x627;&#x636;&#x639;) by Abdullah Bin Abdu Aziz Al Bakri Al Andalasi in the year 1095 AD as a name of a vast place. Later, in the year 1587 AD, the Venetian pearl merchant Gaspero Balbi mentioned the name of Dubai as one of the places where its people work in the field of pearl diving.<p>There are records of the town of Dubai from 1799. Earlier in the 18th century the Al Abu Falasa lineage of <!--del_lnk--> Bani Yas clan established itself in Dubai which was a dependent of the settlement of <a href="../../wp/a/Abu_Dhabi.htm" title="Abu Dhabi">Abu Dhabi</a> until 1833.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 8 January <!--del_lnk--> 1820, the <!--del_lnk--> sheikh of Dubai was a signatory to the <!--del_lnk--> British sponsored &quot;General <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Peace&quot; (the General Maritime Treaty).<p>In 1833, the <!--del_lnk--> Al Maktoum <!--del_lnk--> dynasty of the Bani Yas tribe left the settlement of Abu Dhabi and took over the town of Dubai, &quot;without resistance&quot;. From that point on, Dubai, a newly independent emirate, was constantly at odds with the emirate of Abu Dhabi. An attempt by the <!--del_lnk--> Qawasim to take over Dubai was thwarted. In 1835, Dubai and the rest of the <!--del_lnk--> Trucial States signed a maritime truce with Britain and a &quot;Perpetual Maritime Truce&quot; about two decades later. Dubai came under the protection of the United Kingdom (keeping out the Ottoman Turks) by the Exclusive Agreement of 1892. Like four of its neighbours, <a href="../../wp/a/Abu_Dhabi.htm" title="Abu Dhabi">Abu Dhabi</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Ras al-Khaimah, <!--del_lnk--> Sharjah and <!--del_lnk--> Umm al-Qaiwain, its position on the route to India made it an important location.<p>In March 1892, the <!--del_lnk--> Trucial States (or <!--del_lnk--> Trucial Oman) were created.<p>The rulers of Dubai fostered trade and commerce, unlike the town&#39;s neighbours. The town of Dubai was an important port of call for foreign tradesmen (chiefly <!--del_lnk--> Indians), who settled in the town. Until the 1930s, the town was known for its <a href="../../wp/p/Pearl.htm" title="Pearl">pearl</a> exports.<p>After the <!--del_lnk--> devaluation of the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf Rupee in 1966, Dubai joined the newly independent state of <a href="../../wp/q/Qatar.htm" title="Qatar">Qatar</a> to set up a new monetary unit, the Qatar/Dubai <!--del_lnk--> riyal. Oil was discovered 120 <!--del_lnk--> kilometres off the coast of Dubai, after which the town granted oil concessions.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 2 December <!--del_lnk--> 1971 Dubai, together with Abu Dhabi and five other emirates, formed the United Arab Emirates after former protector Britain left the <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Gulf.htm" title="Persian Gulf">Persian Gulf</a> in 1971. In 1973, Dubai joined the other emirates to adopt a single, uniform <a href="../../wp/c/Currency.htm" title="Currency">currency</a>: the UAE <!--del_lnk--> dirham.<p>The following is a list of rulers of Dubai, going back at least to 1833.<ul>
       <li>... - <!--del_lnk--> 9 June <!--del_lnk--> 1833 Sheikh `Ubayd ibn Said<li><!--del_lnk--> 9 June <!--del_lnk--> 1833 - 1852 Sheikh Maktoum I ibn Bati ibn Suhayl (d. 1852)<li>1852 - 1859 Sheikh Said I ibn Bati (d. 1859)<li>1859 - <!--del_lnk--> 22 November <!--del_lnk--> 1886 Sheikh Hushur ibn Maktoum (d. 1886)<li><!--del_lnk--> 22 November <!--del_lnk--> 1886 - <!--del_lnk--> 7 April <!--del_lnk--> 1894 Sheikh Rashid I ibn Maktoum (d. 1894)<li><!--del_lnk--> 7 April <!--del_lnk--> 1894 - <!--del_lnk--> 16 February <!--del_lnk--> 1906 Sheikh Maktoum II ibn Hushur (b. 18.. - d. 1906)<li><!--del_lnk--> 16 February <!--del_lnk--> 1906 - November 1912 Sheikh Bati ibn Suhayl (b. 1851 - d. 1912)<li>November 1912 - <!--del_lnk--> 15 April <!--del_lnk--> 1929 <!--del_lnk--> Sheikh Saeed II bin Maktum (1st time) (b. 1878 - d. 1958)<li><!--del_lnk--> 15 April <!--del_lnk--> 1929 - <!--del_lnk--> 18 April <!--del_lnk--> 1929 Sheikh Mani ibn Rashid<li><!--del_lnk--> 18 April <!--del_lnk--> 1929 - September 1958 Sheikh Saeed II bin Maktum (2nd time)<li>September 1958 - <!--del_lnk--> 7 October <!--del_lnk--> 1990 Sheikh <!--del_lnk--> Rashid II ibn Said Al Maktoum (b. 1912 - d. 1990)<li><!--del_lnk--> 7 October <!--del_lnk--> 1990 - <!--del_lnk--> 4 January <!--del_lnk--> 2006 <!--del_lnk--> Sheikh Maktoum III bin Rashid Al Maktoum (b. 1943 - d. 2006)<li><!--del_lnk--> 4 January <!--del_lnk--> 2006 - Present <!--del_lnk--> Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (b. 1949)</ul>
      <p>The current ruler of Dubai is H.H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. Like the preceding ruler, his older brother H.H. Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum, he is also the Vice President and the Prime Minister of the UAE.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>
      <p>Dubai is unusual in that its population is comprised mainly of <!--del_lnk--> expatriates, with UAE nationals (Emiratis) constituting the minority. The majority of these expatriates come from <!--del_lnk--> South Asia and <!--del_lnk--> South East Asia. A quarter of the population reportedly trace their origins to neighbouring <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a>. Dubai is also home to some 100,000 British and other western expatriates. The UAE government does not allow any form of <!--del_lnk--> naturalization or <!--del_lnk--> permanent residence to expatriates. However, foreigners are permitted to purchase and own property without a local partner or sponsor.<p>Nearly all of the commercial establishments are run by expatriates with a silent local <!--del_lnk--> partner who merely &quot;rents&quot; the business license for a negotiated annual fee without taking part in any capital investment. The numerous free trade zones allow for full expatriate ownership.<p>There is an increasing number of &quot;freehold&quot; <!--del_lnk--> villas and apartments on <!--del_lnk--> artificial islands such as the <!--del_lnk--> Palm Islands and in many parts of Dubai for example The Greens, Dubai Marina, International City, etc. Ownership is either permanent or on a 99 year lease depending on which area&mdash;freehold areas were announced in the press in July 2006. Ownership or lease of a completed residence allows the owner to apply for (but not guarantee) a residency visa on a three year renewable basis. The Federal Government does not state whether foreigners may or may not own property and has left individual emirates to formulate their own property laws.<div class="thumb tright">

Dubai is the only emirate that has <!--del_lnk--> Hindu temples and a Sikh <!--del_lnk--> Gurdwara.<p>In early 2001, ground was broken for the construction of several additional churches on a parcel of land in <!--del_lnk--> Jebel Ali donated by the government of Dubai to four <!--del_lnk--> Protestant congregations and a <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic</a> congregation. Construction on the first Greek Orthodox Church in Dubai (to be called St. Mary&#39;s) began at the end of 2005. The land for the construction of the church was also donated by the government to the <!--del_lnk--> Greek Orthodox community of Dubai.<p>Financial support to non-Muslim groups from the Dubai government comes in the form of donated land for the construction of churches and other religious facilities, including cemeteries. They are permitted to raise money from among their congregants and to receive financial support from abroad. Christian churches are permitted to openly advertise church functions.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>
      <p>Oil reserves in Dubai are less than one-twentieth those of <a href="../../wp/a/Abu_Dhabi.htm" title="Abu Dhabi">Abu Dhabi</a>, and oil income represents a small proportion of the emirate&#39;s income.<p>Dubai and its twin across the Dubai <!--del_lnk--> creek, Deira (independent at that time), became important ports of call for Western <!--del_lnk--> manufacturers. Most of the new city&#39;s banking and financial centres were headquartered in the port area. Dubai maintained its importance as a trade route through the 1970s and 1980s. The city of Dubai has a <!--del_lnk--> free trade in <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a> and until the 1990s was the hub of a &quot;brisk <!--del_lnk--> smuggling trade&quot; of gold <!--del_lnk--> ingots to India, where gold import was restricted.<p>Today, Dubai is an important tourist destination and port (<!--del_lnk--> Jebel Ali, constructed in the 1970s, has the largest man-made harbour in the world), but also increasingly developing as a hub for service industries such as <!--del_lnk--> IT and <a href="../../wp/f/Finance.htm" title="Finance">finance</a>, with the new <!--del_lnk--> Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). Transport links are bolstered by its rapidly-expanding <!--del_lnk--> Emirates Airline, founded by the government in 1985 and still state-owned; based at Dubai International Airport, it carried over 12 million passengers in fiscal year 2005.<p>The government has set up industry-specific <!--del_lnk--> free zones throughout the city. <!--del_lnk--> Dubai Internet City, now combined with <!--del_lnk--> Dubai Media City as part of TECOM (Dubai Technology, Electronic Commerce and Media Free Zone Authority) is one such enclave whose members include IT firms such as <!--del_lnk--> EMC Corporation, <!--del_lnk--> Oracle Corporation, <a href="../../wp/m/Microsoft.htm" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> IBM, and media organisations such as <!--del_lnk--> MBC, <!--del_lnk--> CNN, <!--del_lnk--> Reuters, <!--del_lnk--> ARY and <!--del_lnk--> AP. <!--del_lnk--> Dubai Knowledge Village (KV),an education and training hub, is also set up to complement the Free Zone&rsquo;s other two clusters, Dubai Internet City and Dubai Media City, by providing the facilities to train the clusters&#39; future knowledge workers. Internet access is restricted in most areas of Dubai with a proxy server filtering out sites deemed to be against cultural and religious values of the UAE - this includes any .il (Israeli) domains.

      <p>The aspirations of the ruling sheikh are reflected by the ultra-modern architecture of the city; home to iconic <!--del_lnk--> skyscrapers such as <!--del_lnk--> Emirates Towers, which are the 12th and 24th tallest buildings in the world, and the <!--del_lnk--> Burj al-Arab located on its very own island in the <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Gulf.htm" title="Persian Gulf">Persian Gulf</a> and currently the tallest hotel in the world.<p><!--del_lnk--> Emaar Properties is currently constructing what will become the world&#39;s tallest structure, the <!--del_lnk--> Burj Dubai. The final height of the skyscraper is a closely guarded secret - an indication of the developer&#39;s resolve to attain the title of the world&#39;s tallest building and its intention to hold on to it for as long as possible - but estimates so far point to a height upwards of 810m. Burj Dubai is expected to be completed in 2008. Burj Dubai&#39;s neighbour is another behemoth under construction: the world&#39;s largest shopping mall - the <!--del_lnk--> Dubai Mall.<p>Also under construction is what is planned to become Dubai&#39;s new Central Business District, named <!--del_lnk--> Business Bay. The project, when completed, will feature a phenomenal 500 skyscrapers built around an artificial extension of the existing Dubai Creek.<p>In February 2005, the construction of <!--del_lnk--> Dubai Waterfront was announced, it will be 2&frac12; times the size of <!--del_lnk--> Washington D.C., roughly seven times the size of the island of <!--del_lnk--> Manhattan. Dubai Waterfront will be a mix of canals and islands full of hotels and residential areas that will add 800 km (500 miles) of man-made waterfront. It will also contain <!--del_lnk--> Al Burj, another one of the tallest buildings in the world.<p>Dubai has also launched <!--del_lnk--> Dubiotech. This is a new park to be targeted at Biotech companies working in <!--del_lnk--> pharma, medical fields, <a href="../../wp/g/Genetics.htm" title="Genetics">genetic research</a> and even <!--del_lnk--> biodefense. The aim of this park is to foster the growth of this sector in Dubai and to utilize the region&#39;s talent in addressing this rapidly growing sector.<p>The International Media Production Zone is a project targeted at creating a hub for printers, publishers, media production companies, and related industry segments. Launched in 2003, the project is scheduled to be completed in 2006.<p>A new project was announced on <!--del_lnk--> May 1, <!--del_lnk--> 2006 by the authorities. It is named <!--del_lnk--> Bawadi and will consist of a 27 billion US-dollar investment intended to increase Dubai&#39;s number of hotel rooms by 29,000, doubling it from the current figure offers now. The largest complex will be called <!--del_lnk--> Asia, Asia and will be the largest hotel in the world with more than 6,500 rooms.<p>The first villa freehold properties that were occupied by non-UAE nationals were The Meadows, The Springs, and The Lakes (high-end neighbourhoods designed by Emaar Properties, collectively called Emirates Hills).<p>Expatriates of various nationalities have been pouring capital into Dubai in the past several years, greatly contributing to the city&#39;s prosperity. Iranian expatriates alone are estimated to have invested up to US$200 Billion in Dubai.<p>Dubai interests have also purchased large amounts of real estate in foreign countries, in particular snapping up trophy properties in global centers like New York and London. Purchases in 2005 included New York&#39;s 230 Park Avenue (formerly known as the New York Central Building or the Helmsley Building) and <!--del_lnk--> Essex House on <!--del_lnk--> Central Park South.<p>See the Dubai Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing&#39;s list of developments <!--del_lnk-->  in Dubai for more information.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p><a id="Construction" name="Construction"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Construction</span></h3>
      <p>Since 2000, Dubai&#39;s municipality has initiated a plethora of construction phases and plans across the entire city of Dubai, predominantly in the Mina Seyahi area, located further from <!--del_lnk--> Jumeirah, towards Jebel Ali. In many areas, it is not easy to see Dubai&#39;s sky without at least one crane in your view; Industry experts cautiously estimate that 15% to 25% of the world&#39;s cranes are in Dubai. Construction in Dubai and the UAE in general is a much faster process than in any Western country. This is partly because labourers from the <!--del_lnk--> Indian subcontinent accept lower wages than those from other countries.<p>One of the main reasons for the boom in construction in Dubai is its drive to diversify the economy. The Dubai government does not want to depend on its oil reserves which are largely believed to become exhausted by 2010 and, as such, has diversified its economy to attract revenues in the form of expanding commercial and corporate activity. Tourism is also being promoted at a staggering rate with the construction of <!--del_lnk--> Dubailand and other projects that include the making of mammoth shopping malls, theme parks, resorts, stadiums and various other tourist attractions.<p>Another reason for the construction boom is the recent reversal of a law in 2002 that allows non-nationals of the UAE to own property (not land) in Dubai (albeit <!--del_lnk--> freehold and 99 year leases are actually sold to people with ownership still remaining with private companies). The larger of the property tycoons are Al Nakheel and Emaar Properties. In Dubai, demand is currently outstripping supply by a significant margin and is showing no signs of slowing in the near future. Rents have skyrocketed with the recent inflow of professionals and companies from around the world who are attracted by Dubai&#39;s no-tax benefits although rises have been capped to 15% per annum up to 2006 under a directive from Sheikh Mohammad. Legislation in this area is still developing as the property market for foreigners is relatively new.<p><a id="Human_rights_and_labour" name="Human_rights_and_labour"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Human rights and labour</span></h2>
      <p>People born in the United Arab Emirates are not considered citizens unless their parents are citizens. Thus those born in the UAE to expatriates are also considered expatriates. The massive construction projects currently in Dubai have required more construction workers than there are citizens of the city (note: over 80% of Dubai&#39;s population consists of expatriates/non-citizens). This has led to massive importation of low-wage workers, mostly from <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>. Most of these workers are forced to give up their passports upon entering Dubai, making it very difficult to return home. <!--del_lnk--> NPR reports that workers &quot;typically live eight to a room, sending home a portion of their salary to their families, whom they don&#39;t see for years at a time.&quot; Others report that their salary has been withheld to pay back loans, making them little more than <!--del_lnk--> indentured servants. The BBC has reported that &quot;local newspapers often carry stories of construction workers allegedly not being paid for months on end. They are not allowed to move jobs and if they leave the country to go home they will almost certainly lose the money they say they are owed. The names of the construction companies concerned are not published in the newspapers for fear of offending the often powerful individuals who own them.&quot;.<p>In December 2005, the Indian <!--del_lnk--> consulate in Dubai submitted a report to the <!--del_lnk--> Government of India detailing labour problems faced by Indian expatriates in the emirate. The report highlighted delayed payment of wages, substitution of <!--del_lnk--> employment contracts, premature termination of services and excessive working hours as being some of the challenges faced by Indian workers in the city.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 21 March <!--del_lnk--> 2006, tensions boiled over at the construction site of the <!--del_lnk--> Burj Dubai as workers upset over low wages and poor working conditions rioted, damaging cars, offices, computers, and construction tools. A Dubai Interior Ministry official said the rioters caused approximately one million U.S. dollars in damage. On <!--del_lnk--> March 22 most workers returned to work but refused to work. The work stoppage also caused workers building a new terminal at <!--del_lnk--> Dubai International Airport to strike.<p>The alleged labour injustices in Dubai have attracted the attention of various Human Rights groups. <!--del_lnk--> Mafi Wasta, for example, is a website created specifically for the purpose of persuading the government of the UAE to sign up to 2 of the ILO&#39;s (International Labour Organization) 7 core conventions - namely 87 and 98 - which allows for labour unions. The site lists examples of human rights violations in the country. Human Rights Watch said that the men were treated &quot;less than human&quot;.<p>However, the UAE government has denied any kind of labour injustices and has stated that the watchdog&#39;s (Human Rights Watch) accusations were misguided. Towards the end of March 2006, the government announced steps to allow construction unions. UAE labour minister Ali al-Kaabi said: &quot;Labourers will be allowed to form unions.&quot;<p><!--del_lnk--> Prostitution, though illegal by law, is conspicuously present in the emirate because of an economy that is largely based on tourism and trade. There is a high demand for women from <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Europe. According to the <i>World Sex Guide</i>, a website catering to <!--del_lnk--> sex tourists, <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russian</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Ethiopian women are the most common prostitutes, while Indian prostitutes are part of a well organized trans-<a href="../../wp/o/Oceania.htm" title="Oceania">Oceanic</a> prostitution network.<p>Sources disagree on whether or not <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jew">Jews</a> are &quot;banned&quot; from Dubai; <!--del_lnk--> Der Spiegel writes that &quot;all Jews are strictly banned from entering the country&quot;, while other sources suggest that only <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israeli</a> citizens have their visas routinely denied and that rejection of visa applications for Jews of non-Israeli citizenship is &quot;expat urban legend.&quot;<p>Residents are now required to take permission from their employers to obtain a driving licence. The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), reinstating a rule abolished about four years ago, issued a circular to all driving schools in Dubai asking them to make it mandatory for applicants to obtain a no-objection-certificate (NOC) from their employers to take driving lessons. No one is allowed to learn driving with effect from October 1 without getting a NOC from his or her employer.<p><a id="Transport" name="Transport"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transport</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Roads" name="Roads"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Roads</span></h3>
      <p>Dubai has a fairly large <!--del_lnk--> bus system run by the Dubai Municipality. The bus system has 59 unique routes on weekdays and transports over 200,000 people each week. Although the Public Transport bus system is large it is not large enough to accommodate the volume of people who would like to use it. The system has come under increasing criticism because of lack of capacity. The government has issued plastic, swipable &quot;e-go&quot; cards. There are also several discounts and period pass options available. Unfortunately though, the bus network is used extensively by lower income groups and does not do enough to attract higher income earners who would do well to use the bus transport system and ease traffic congestion that has recently become a major problem in Dubai and the United Arab Emirates. Traffic congestion has come about mainly due to lack of foresight on the recent rapid population increase, the relative ease of credit facilities for obtaining a car and the convoluted road networks that are constantly being changed, improved or reconstructed. Furthermore, Dubai has developed a reputation for having the most deaths and road accidents in the developed world clocking in with a statistic of having a minor road accident at least every 3 minutes. Due to the frequency of such incidents, road networks are blocked and held up quite frequently.<p>Dubai also has an extensive <!--del_lnk--> taxi system, by far the most frequently used means of public transport within the emirate. There are both government-operated and private cab companies. The Dubai Transport Corporation operates cream-coloured taxis. Some of the private cab companies are Cars Taxi, National Taxi, Cititaxi and Metro Taxi. Prices are reasonable (the meter begins as <!--del_lnk--> Dhs. 3, which is approximately 50pence, or 1 USD), and are charged by distance, although if the cab stops for more than 1 minute, 1/2 a Dirham will be added to the meter. Taxi drivers will usually try to avert this happening in traffic queues by moving slightly forward every 30 seconds or so. Cabs can be found anywhere, any time although difficulties may be experienced during large events.<p><a id="Trains" name="Trains"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Trains</span></h3>
      <p>There is currently a $3.89 billion <!--del_lnk--> Dubai Metro project under construction for the emirate. The Metro system is expected to be partially operational by 2009 and fully operational by 2012. The construction contract for the project was given to <i>Dubai Rapid Link</i> (DURL), a consortium led by <!--del_lnk--> Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Also involved are two other Japanese corporations, Obayashi and Kajima, and a Turkish company, Yapi Merkezi. The metro will comprise two lines: the Green Line from Rashidiya to the main city centre and the Red Line from the airport to Jebel Ali. The Dubai Metro (Green and Blue Lines) will have 70 kilometres of track and 43 stations, 33 above ground and ten underground. Trains are expected to run every 90 seconds when the project is completed. Recently, the Blue Line connecting Dubai International Airport to the new <!--del_lnk--> Jebel Ali Port and <!--del_lnk--> Dubai World Central International Airport was announced. The route will run 47 km through <!--del_lnk--> Dubailand, but the exact number of stations is unknown. Dubai is building this train system to ease congestion on its <!--del_lnk--> road network and to meet the transportation demands of its growing population. Seven monorails are also slated to be constructed to help feed the Metro system, connecting various places such as Dubailand, Palm Jumeirah, et al, to the main track.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Dubai International Airport is a hub for <!--del_lnk--> Emirates airlines and has a large Duty Free shopping centre. The airport has won numerous awards for its excellence in design and services. A third terminal is currently under construction and is due to open in 2006. The new terminal will be dedicated to Emirates airlines and will fully support the new <a href="../../wp/a/Airbus_A380.htm" title="Airbus A380">Airbus A380</a>. When completed this will double the capacity of the airport.<p>A second airport located at <!--del_lnk--> Jebel Ali &mdash; (which has been renamed as Dubai World Central International Airport although still retaining the IATA code of JXB) and a new free trade area within Dubai, marking the centrepiece of the Jebel Ali Airport City &mdash; was announced in 2004 and construction began in January 2005. The first part is expected to be completed by 2008. Although initially intended as a predominantly cargo airport, plans are afoot for the new Jebel Ali airport to handle some 120 million passengers per annum within 20 years, and would likely surpass <a href="../../wp/a/Atlanta%252C_Georgia.htm" title="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, currently the world&#39;s busiest airport, which handles 88.4 million passengers as of 2005.<p>Dubai is investing heavily in developing the reach of its airline, Emirates. The idea is to develop Dubai&#39;s air transportation ability so that passengers from any city can fly direct to Dubai. When Emirates Airline receives the Boeing 777-200LR Worldliner series aircraft, it will be able to offer direct access to virtually any major city in the world. The airline has placed an order of 45 of Airbus&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> A-380 &#39;superjumbo&#39; doubledecker aircraft, the largest of which has a capacity of 641 passengers. The A380 aircraft have already been charted to fly from 2007 onwards. In addition, Emirates has placed an order of 42 of the new <!--del_lnk--> Boeing 777 aircraft in November 2005.<p>Dubai&#39;s location makes it unique in its international connectivity and access.<p><a id="Postal_system" name="Postal_system"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Postal system</span></h2>
      <p>In parts what is being dubbed as &quot;New Dubai,&quot; or <i>some</i> parts of Dubai that range west from <!--del_lnk--> Sheikh Zayed Road to <!--del_lnk--> Jebel Ali Free Zone, the formal addressing system is: sector number, community number, street number and building number. In common practice, an address consists of: street number, building number and community name although the order may vary. For example:<pre>
<i>Street 1a, Villa 2<br /></i>
Umm Suqeim 3<br />
Dubai, United Arab Emirates
</pre><p>In older parts of Dubai (Deira, Bur Dubai), or what comprises Dubai City and the newer commercial/business area of Dubai, street or sector addresses, historically, tend not be used; however, use of the official street map will show that all sectors and thoroughfares have been designated. Location tends to be identified via building name and a landmark, which may very well mean that a person not familiar with or new to Dubai may be unable to find his/her destination. For example:<pre>
<i>Suite 803, City Tower 2<br /></i>
Opposite Emirates Hotel<br />

      <p>A <!--del_lnk--> post office of <!--del_lnk--> British India was opened <!--del_lnk--> August 19, <!--del_lnk--> 1909. It used the stamps of India on mail, with postmark &quot;Dubai Persian Gulf&quot;, until India&#39;s independence in 1947, then stamps of Pakistan until <!--del_lnk--> March 31, <!--del_lnk--> 1948. When <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> came into existence, the British government set up a postal administration for Eastern Arabia and used <!--del_lnk--> overprinted British stamps until <!--del_lnk--> January 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1961, when Dubai issued its own stamps inscribed &quot;Trucial States&quot;. Despite the name, these were only on sale in Dubai&#39;s post office.<p>The Dubai Post Department took over the postal service on <!--del_lnk--> June 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1963 and the following day issued a series of stamps depicting sea life, views of Dubai, and <!--del_lnk--> Sheikh <!--del_lnk--> Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum. This was the opening <!--del_lnk--> salvo of a barrage of stamp issues over the next few years. The emirate discovered that <!--del_lnk--> stamp collectors were willing to give it money for colored labels with &quot;Dubai&quot; printed on them, and by the time the postal system was merged with those of other emirates in mid-1972, it had issued over 400 stamps, few of which ever saw usage on mail.<p><a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h2>
