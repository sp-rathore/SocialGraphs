      <p><i><b>Domesday Book</b></i> (also known as <i><b>Domesday</b></i>, or <i><b>Book of Winchester</b></i>) was the record of the great survey of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> completed in <!--del_lnk--> 1086, executed for <!--del_lnk--> William the Conqueror. The survey was similar to a <!--del_lnk--> census by a government of today. William needed information about the country he had just conquered so he could administer it. While spending the <!--del_lnk--> Christmas of 1085 in <!--del_lnk--> Gloucester, William &quot;had deep speech with his counsellors and sent men all over England to each shire ... to find out ... what or how much each landholder had in land and livestock, and what it was worth.&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> Saxon Chronicle) One of the main purposes of the survey was to find out who owned what so they could be taxed on it, and the judgment of the assessors was final &mdash; whatever the book said about who owned the property, or what it was worth, was the law, and there was no appeal. It was written in <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a>, although there were some vernacular words inserted for native terms with no previous Latin equivalent and the text was highly abbreviated. When the book took the name &quot;<i>Domesday</i>&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> Middle English spelling of <i>Doomsday</i>) in the <a href="../../wp/1/12th_century.htm" title="12th century">12th century</a>, it was to emphasize its definitiveness and authority (the analogy refers to the <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christian</a> belief of a <!--del_lnk--> Last Judgment).<p>In August 2006, a complete online version of Domesday Book was made available for the first time by the <!--del_lnk--> The National Archives.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p><i>Domesday Book</i> is really two independent works. One, known as <i><b>Little Domesday</b></i> covers <a href="../../wp/n/Norfolk.htm" title="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Suffolk and <!--del_lnk--> Essex. The other, <i><b>Great Domesday</b></i> covers the rest of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, except for lands in the north that would later become <!--del_lnk--> Westmorland, <!--del_lnk--> Cumberland, <!--del_lnk--> Northumberland and <!--del_lnk--> County Durham (because some of these lands were under <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> control at the time). There are also no surveys of <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Winchester and some other towns. The omission of these two major cities is probably due to their size and complexity, Cumberland is missing because it was not conquered until some time after the survey and the <!--del_lnk--> Prince-Bishop <!--del_lnk--> William of St. Carilef had the exclusive right to tax Durham; the omission of the other counties has not been fully explained. Parts of the North East of England were covered by the 1183 &#39;Boldon Book&#39;, which listed those areas liable to tax by the Bishop of Durham.<p>Despite its name, <i>Little Domesday</i> is actually larger &mdash; as it is far more detailed, down to numbers of livestock. It has been suggested that <i>Little Domesday</i> represents a first attempt, and that it was found impossible, or at least inconvenient, to complete the work on the same scale for <i>Great Domesday</i>.<p>For both volumes, the contents of the returns were entirely rearranged and classified according to <!--del_lnk--> fiefs, rather than geographically. Instead of appearing under the <!--del_lnk--> Hundreds and townships, holdings appear under the names of the local <!--del_lnk--> barons, i.e. those who held the lands directly of the crown in fee.<p>In each county, the list opened with the holdings of the king himself (which had possibly formed the subject of separate inquiry); then came those of the churchmen and religious houses; next were entered those of the lay tenants-in-chief (<i>barons</i>); and last of all those of women, of the king&#39;s serjeants (<i>servientes</i>), of the few English <!--del_lnk--> thegns who retained land, and so forth.<p>In some counties, one or more principal towns formed the subject of a separate section; in some the clamores (disputed titles to land) were similarly treated separately. This principle applies more specially to the larger volume; in the smaller one the system is more confused, the execution less perfect.<p>Apart from the wholly rural portions, which constitute its bulk, <i>Domesday</i> contains entries of interest concerning most of the towns, which were probably made because of their bearing on the fiscal rights of the crown therein. These include fragments of custumals (older customary agreements), records of the military service due, of markets, mints, and so forth. From the towns, from the counties as wholes, and from many of its ancient lordships, the crown was entitled to archaic dues in kind, such as <a href="../../wp/h/Honey.htm" title="Honey">honey</a>.<p>The information of most general interest found in the great record is that on political, personal, ecclesiastical and social history, which only occurs sporadically and, as it were, by accident. Much of this was used by <!--del_lnk--> E. A. Freeman for his work on the <!--del_lnk--> Norman Conquest.<p><a id="The_survey" name="The_survey"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The survey</span></h2>
      <p>From the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, it is known that the planning for the survey was conducted in <!--del_lnk--> 1085, and from the <!--del_lnk--> colophon of the book it is known that the survey was completed in <!--del_lnk--> 1086. It is not known when exactly <i>Domesday Book</i> was compiled, but the entire work appears to have been copied out by one person.<p>Each county was visited by a group of royal officers (<i>legati</i>), who held a public inquiry, probably in the great assembly known as the county court, which was attended by representatives of every township as well as of the local lords. The unit of inquiry was the Hundred (a subdivision of the county, which then was an administrative entity), and the return for each Hundred was sworn to by twelve local jurors, half of them English and half of them Normans.<p>What is believed to be a full transcript of these original returns is preserved for several of the <!--del_lnk--> Cambridgeshire Hundreds, and is of great illustrative importance. The <i>Inquisitio Eliensis</i>, the <i>Exon Domesday</i> (so called from the preservation of the volume at <!--del_lnk--> Exeter), which covers <!--del_lnk--> Cornwall, <!--del_lnk--> Devon, <a href="../../wp/d/Dorset.htm" title="Dorset">Dorset</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Somerset, <!--del_lnk--> Wiltshire, and the second volume of <i>Domesday Book</i>, also all contain the full details which the original returns supplied.<p>Through comparison of what details are recorded in which counties, six &quot;circuits&quot; can be determined.<ol>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Berkshire, <a href="../../wp/h/Hampshire.htm" title="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Kent, <!--del_lnk--> Surrey, <!--del_lnk--> Sussex<li><!--del_lnk--> Cornwall, <!--del_lnk--> Devon, <a href="../../wp/d/Dorset.htm" title="Dorset">Dorset</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Somerset, <!--del_lnk--> Wiltshire (Exeter Domesday)<li><!--del_lnk--> Bedfordshire, <!--del_lnk--> Buckinghamshire, <!--del_lnk--> Cambridgeshire, <!--del_lnk--> Hertfordshire, <!--del_lnk--> Middlesex<li><!--del_lnk--> Leicestershire, <!--del_lnk--> Northamptonshire, <!--del_lnk--> Oxfordshire, <!--del_lnk--> Staffordshire, <!--del_lnk--> Warwickshire<li><!--del_lnk--> Cheshire, <!--del_lnk--> Gloucestershire, <!--del_lnk--> Herefordshire, <!--del_lnk--> Shropshire, <!--del_lnk--> Worcestershire &mdash; the <!--del_lnk--> Marches<li><!--del_lnk--> Derbyshire, <!--del_lnk--> Huntingdonshire, <!--del_lnk--> Lincolnshire, <!--del_lnk--> Nottinghamshire, <!--del_lnk--> Yorkshire</ol>
      <p><a id="Purpose" name="Purpose"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Purpose</span></h2>
      <p>For the object of the survey, we have three sources of information:<ul>
       <li>The passage in the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which tells us why it was ordered:</ul>
      <dl>
       <dd>&quot;After this had the king a large meeting, and very deep consultation with his council, about this land; how it was occupied, and by what sort of men. Then sent he his men over all England into each shire; commissioning them to find out &quot;How many hundreds of hides were in the shire, what land the king himself had, and what stock upon the land; or, what dues he ought to have by the year from the shire.&quot; Also he commissioned them to record in writing, &quot;How much land his archbishops had, and his diocesan bishops, and his abbots, and his earls;&quot; and though I may be prolix and tedious, &quot;What, or how much, each man had, who was an occupier of land in England, either in land or in stock, and how much money it were worth.&quot; So very narrowly, indeed, did he commission them to trace it out, that there was not one single hide, nor a yard of land, nay, moreover (it is shameful to tell, though he thought it no shame to do it), not even an ox, nor a cow, nor a swine was there left, that was not set down in his writ. And all the recorded particulars were afterwards brought to him.&quot;</dl>
      <ul>
       <li>The list of questions which the jurors were asked, as preserved in the <i>Inquisitio Eliensis</i><li>The contents of <i>Domesday Book</i> and the allied records mentioned above.</ul>
      <p>Although these can by no means be reconciled in every detail, it is now generally recognized that the primary object of the survey was to ascertain and record the fiscal rights of the king. These were mainly<ul>
       <li>The national land-tax (<i>geldum</i>), paid on a fixed assessment,<li>Certain miscellaneous dues, and<li>The proceeds of the crown lands.</ul>
      <p>After a great political convulsion such as the Norman conquest, and the wholesale confiscation of landed estates which followed it, it was in William&#39;s interest to make sure that the rights of the crown, which he claimed to have inherited, had not suffered in the process. More especially was this the case as his Norman followers were disposed to evade the liabilities of their English predecessors.<p>The Domesday survey therefore recorded the names of the new holders of lands and the assessments on which their tax was to be paid. But it did more than this; by the king&#39;s instructions it endeavoured to make a national valuation list, estimating the annual value of all the land in the country, (1) at the time of <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_the_Confessor.htm" title="Edward the Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a>&#39;s death, (2) when the new owners received it, (3) at the time of the survey, and further, it reckoned, by command, the potential value as well. It is evident that William desired to know the financial resources of his kingdom, and probable that he wished to compare them with the existing assessment, which was one of considerable antiquity, though there are traces that it had been occasionally modified. The great bulk of <i>Domesday Book</i> is devoted to the somewhat arid details of the assessment and valuation of rural estates, which were as yet the only important source of national wealth. After stating the assessment of the <a href="../../wp/m/Manorialism.htm" title="Manorialism">manor</a>, the record sets forth the amount of <a href="../../wp/a/Arable_land.htm" title="Arable land">arable land</a>, and the number of plough teams (each reckoned at eight oxen) available for working it, with the additional number (if any) that might be employed; then the river-meadows, woodland, pasture, fisheries (i.e. weirs in the streams), water-mills, saltpans (if by the sea) and other subsidiary sources of revenue; the peasants are enumerated in their several classes; and finally the annual value of the whole, past and present, is roughly estimated.<p>It is obvious that, both in its values and in its measurements, the survey&#39;s reckoning is very crude.<p>The rearrangement, on a feudal basis, of the original returns enabled the Conqueror and his officers to see with ease the extent of a baron&#39;s possessions; but it also had the effect of showing how far he had engaged under-tenants, and who those under-tenants were. This was of great importance to William, not only for military reasons, but also because of his firm resolve to make the under-tenants (though the &quot;men&quot; of their lords) swear allegiance directly to himself. As <i>Domesday Book</i> normally records only the Christian name of an under-tenant, it is not possible to search for the surnames of families claiming a Norman origin; but much has been done, and is still being done, to identify the under-tenants, the great bulk of whom bear foreign Christian names.<p>To a large extent, it comes down to the king&#39;s knowing where he should look when he needed to raise money. It therefore includes sources of income but not sinks of expenditure such as castles; unless their mention is needed to explain discrepancies between pre-and post-Conquest holdings. Typically, this happened in a town, where separately-recorded properties had been demolished to make way for a castle.<p><a id="Subsequent_history" name="Subsequent_history"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Subsequent history</span></h2>
      <p><i>Domesday Book</i> was originally preserved in the royal treasury at <!--del_lnk--> Winchester (the Norman kings&#39; capital). It was originally referred to as the <i>Book of Winchester</i>, and refers to itself as such in a late edition. When the treasury moved to <!--del_lnk--> Westminster, probably under <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_II_of_England.htm" title="Henry II of England">Henry II</a>, the book went with it. In the <i>Dialogus de scaccario</i> (temp. Hen. II.) it is spoken of as a record from the arbitrament of which there was no appeal (from which its popular name of <i>Domesday</i> is said to be derived). In the Middle Ages its evidence was frequently invoked in the law-courts; and even now there are certain cases in which appeal is made to its testimony.<p>It remained in Westminster until the days of <a href="../../wp/v/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a>, being preserved from 1696 onwards in the Chapter House, and only removed in special circumstances, such as when it was sent to Southampton for <!--del_lnk--> photozincographic reproduction. <i>Domesday Book</i> was eventually placed in the <!--del_lnk--> Public Record Office, London; it can be now seen in a glass case in the museum at <!--del_lnk--> The National Archives, <!--del_lnk--> Kew which is in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames in South West London. In 1869 it received a modern binding. Most recently, the two books were rebound for its ninth centenary in 1986, when <i>Great Domesday</i> was divided into two volumes and <i>Little Domesday</i> was divided into three volumes. The ancient Domesday chest, in which it used to be kept, is also preserved in the building at Kew.<p>The printing of <i>Domesday</i>, in &quot;record type&quot;, was begun by the government in 1773, and the book was published, in two volumes, in 1783; in 1811 a volume of indices was added, and in 1816 a supplementary volume, separately indexed, containing:<ol>
       <li>The <i><!--del_lnk--> Exon Domesday</i> &mdash; for the south-western counties<li>The <i><!--del_lnk--> Inquisitio Eliensis</i><li>The <i><!--del_lnk--> Liber Winton</i> &mdash; surveys of Winchester early in the <a href="../../wp/1/12th_century.htm" title="12th century">12th century</a><li>The <i><!--del_lnk--> Boldon Buke</i> &mdash; a survey of the bishopric of Durham a century later than Domesday.</ol>
      <p>Photographic facsimiles of <i>Domesday Book</i>, for each county separately, were published in 1861-1863, also by the government. Today, <i>Domesday Book</i> is available in numerous editions, usually based per county and available with other <!--del_lnk--> local history resources.<p>Although unique in character and invaluable to the student, scholars are unable to explain portions of its language and of its system. This is partly due to its very early date, which has placed a gulf between <i>Domesday Book</i> and later records which is difficult to bridge.<p>To the topographer, as to the genealogist, its evidence is of primary importance, as it not only contains the earliest survey of each township or manor, but affords, in the majority of cases, the clue to its subsequent descent.<p>In August 2006 the contents of Domesday went on-line, with an English translation of the book&#39;s Latin. Visitors to the website will now be able to search a place name, see the index entry made for the manor, town, city or village and, for a fee, download the appropriate page.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1986, the <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a> released the <!--del_lnk--> BBC Domesday Project, the results of a project to create a survey to mark the 900th anniversary of the original Domesday Book.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesday_Book&quot;</div>
