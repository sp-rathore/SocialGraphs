      <p>The etymology of <i>Denmark</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Danish: <i>Danmark</i>) is uncertain because there are so few old sources, and the experts have two interpretations of the name. Both groups say <i>-mark</i> is a wild forest (uninhabited territory or lawless no-man&#39;s land). Dan-mark means: 1. An occupied hollow in a wild forest or: 2. A forest or border owned by the Danes.<p>According to <!--del_lnk--> Saxo Grammaticus, <!--del_lnk--> Dan and Angul were the sons of the very first <!--del_lnk--> King of Denmark, <!--del_lnk--> King Humble.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>The earliest <!--del_lnk--> Danish archaeological findings date back to 130,000-110,000 BC in the <!--del_lnk--> Eem interglacial period. People have continually lived in Denmark since about 12,500 BC, and <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a> made inroads about 3,900 BC. The <!--del_lnk--> Nordic Bronze Age (1,800-600 BC) in Denmark was marked by <!--del_lnk--> burial mounds, which left an abundance of <!--del_lnk--> findings, including <!--del_lnk--> lurs and the <!--del_lnk--> Sun Chariot.<p>During the <!--del_lnk--> Pre-Roman Iron Age (500 BC-<a href="../../wp/a/Anno_Domini.htm" title="Anno Domini">AD</a> 1), native groups began migrating south. The <!--del_lnk--> Roman provinces maintained trade routes and relations with native tribes in Denmark, attested by finds of Roman coins. Evidence of strong Celtic cultural influence dates from this period in Denmark and much of northwest Europe, and is among other things reflected in the finding of the <!--del_lnk--> Gundestrup cauldron. The first Danish people came to Denmark between the Pre-Roman and <!--del_lnk--> Germanic Iron Age, in the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Iron Age (AD 1-400).<p>Before the arrival of precursors to the Danes, who came from <!--del_lnk--> Scandinavia and spoke an early form of <!--del_lnk--> north Germanic, most of <!--del_lnk--> Jutland and part of the islands had been vacated or partly vacated by the earlier <!--del_lnk--> Jutes, who settled in <!--del_lnk--> Britain together with the <!--del_lnk--> Angles and the <!--del_lnk--> Saxons to form the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxons.<p>The exact origin of Denmark has been lost in history, but a short note about the <i>Dani</i> in &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The Origin and Deeds of the Goths&quot; from 551 AD by historian <!--del_lnk--> Jordanes is believed by some to be an early mention of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Daner</i>,, one of the ethnos from which are descended the modern <!--del_lnk--> Danish people. The <!--del_lnk--> Danevirke defence structures were built in several phases from the 3rd century forth, and the sheer size of the construction efforts in 737 are contributed to the emergence of a Danish king. The <!--del_lnk--> new runic alphabet was first used at the same time, and <!--del_lnk--> Ribe, the oldest town of Denmark, was founded about 700.<dl>

      <p>From the 8th to the 10th century, the Danes were known as <a href="../../wp/v/Viking.htm" title="Vikings">Vikings</a>. Together with <!--del_lnk--> Norwegians and <!--del_lnk--> Swedes, they colonised, raided and traded in all parts of <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>. Viking explorers first discovered <a href="../../wp/i/Iceland.htm" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> by accident in the 9th century, on the way towards the <a href="../../wp/f/Faroe_Islands.htm" title="Faroe Islands">Faroe Islands</a> and eventually came across &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Vinland&quot; (Land of wine) also known today as <!--del_lnk--> Newfoundland, in <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>. The Danish Vikings were most active in England and France where they temporarily conquered parts of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, known as the <!--del_lnk--> Danelaw, <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, giving name to the French region of <!--del_lnk--> Normandy. In the Viking age has there been found more <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon coins in Denmark than in England. As attested by the <!--del_lnk--> Jelling stones, the Danes were united and <!--del_lnk--> Christianised about 965 by <!--del_lnk--> Harald Bluetooth, the second recognised <!--del_lnk--> king of Denmark. In the early 11th century, <a href="../../wp/c/Canute_the_Great.htm" title="Canute the Great">Canute the Great</a> won and united Denmark, England and Norway for almost 30 years.<p>Up through the <!--del_lnk--> High and <!--del_lnk--> Late Middle Ages, the king of Denmark ruled <a href="../../wp/s/Sk%25C3%25A5neland.htm" title="Sk&aring;neland">Sk&aring;neland</a> (<!--del_lnk--> Sk&aring;ne, <!--del_lnk--> Halland and <!--del_lnk--> Blekinge), <!--del_lnk--> Danish Estonia, as well as the <!--del_lnk--> duchies of <!--del_lnk--> Schleswig and <!--del_lnk--> Holstein in northern <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>. In 1397, Denmark entered the <!--del_lnk--> Kalmar Union with <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Sweden-Finland. It was a united Scandinavian state which kept the individual interests of the countries, and lasted until Sweden broke out in 1523. The <!--del_lnk--> Protestant Reformation came to Scandinavia in 1530s, and following the <!--del_lnk--> Count&#39;s Feud civil war, Denmark converted to <!--del_lnk--> Lutheranism in 1536. Later that year, Denmark entered a <!--del_lnk--> union with Norway and its colonies.<p>Two and a half centuries of wars with Sweden followed. Sk&aring;neland was lost to Sweden in the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Roskilde in 1658 and the Denmark-Norway union was dissolved by the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Kiel in 1814, when Norway entered a new union with Sweden, which lasted until 1905. Denmark kept the colonies of <a href="../../wp/i/Iceland.htm" title="Iceland">Iceland</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/Faroe_Islands.htm" title="Faroe Islands">Faroe Islands</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/Greenland.htm" title="Greenland">Greenland</a>.

      <p>The Danish liberal and national movement gained momentum in the 1830s, and after the European <!--del_lnk--> Revolutions of 1848 Denmark became a <a href="../../wp/c/Constitutional_monarchy.htm" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a> on <!--del_lnk--> June 5, <!--del_lnk--> 1849.<p>After the <!--del_lnk--> Second War of Schleswig (Danish: <i>Slesvig</i>) in 1864, Denmark was forced to cede <!--del_lnk--> Schleswig-Holstein to <!--del_lnk--> Prussia, in a defeat that left deep marks on the Danish national identity. After this point Denmark adopted a policy of neutrality, as a result of which Denmark stayed neutral in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>. After the defeat of Germany, the <a href="../../wp/t/Treaty_of_Versailles.htm" title="Treaty of Versailles">Versailles powers</a> offered to return the then-German region of Schleswig-Holstein to Denmark. Fearing German <!--del_lnk--> irredentism, Denmark refused to consider the return of the area and insisted on a <!--del_lnk--> plebiscite concerning the return of Schleswig. The two <!--del_lnk--> Schleswig Plebiscites took place on February 10 and March 14, respectively. On July 10, 1920, after the plebiscite and the King&#39;s signature July 9 on the reunion document, Northern Schleswig (S&oslash;nderjylland) was recovered by Denmark, thereby adding 163,600 inhabitants and 3,984 km&sup2;. The reunion day (Genforeningsdag) is celebrated every year <!--del_lnk--> June 15 on Valdemarsdag.<p>Despite its continued neutrality, Denmark was invaded by <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> (<i><!--del_lnk--> Operation Weser&uuml;bung),</i> on <!--del_lnk--> April 9, <!--del_lnk--> 1940. Though accorded self-rule (which ended in 1943 because of a mounting resistance movement), Denmark remained <!--del_lnk--> militarily occupied throughout <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. The Danish sympathy for the Allied cause was strong; 1,900 Danish police officers were arrested by the Gestapo and sent, under guard, to be interned in <!--del_lnk--> Buchenwald. During the war, Iceland claimed independence and in 1948 the <a href="../../wp/f/Faroe_Islands.htm" title="Faroe Islands">Faroe Islands</a> gained <!--del_lnk--> home rule. After the war, Denmark became one of the founding members of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/NATO.htm" title="NATO">NATO</a> and, in 1973, joined the <!--del_lnk--> European Economic Community (later, the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a>).

      <p>The Kingdom of Denmark is a <a href="../../wp/c/Constitutional_monarchy.htm" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a>, with <!--del_lnk--> executive power with <!--del_lnk--> Queen Margrethe II as head of state. This executive power is exercised on behalf of the monarch by the <!--del_lnk--> prime minister and other <!--del_lnk--> cabinet ministers who head departments. The cabinet, including the prime minister, and other ministers collectively make up the <!--del_lnk--> government. These ministers are responsible to <!--del_lnk--> Parliament, the legislative body, which is traditionally considered to be supreme (that is, able to legislate on any matter and not bound by decisions of its predecessors).<p>While the monarch is <!--del_lnk--> head of state and theoretically holds all executive power, it is the prime minister who is <!--del_lnk--> head of government. The government is answerable chiefly to <!--del_lnk--> Parliament; however, ministers do not have to come from Parliament, though it is the modern day custom.<p><i>Folketinget</i> is the national legislature of kingdom. It has the ultimate legislative authority according to the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, however questions over sovereignty have been brought forward because of Denmark&rsquo;s entry into the European Union. In theory however, the doctrine prevails. Parliament consists of 179 members elected by proportional majority. Parliamentary elections are held at least every four years, but it is within the powers of the prime minister to call one sooner. On a <!--del_lnk--> vote of no confidence the parliament may force the entire government to resign.<p>Compared to most other Western European countries, the Danish political system has traditionally emphasized coalitions. In some cases this has been in the form of majority coalitions, although most Danish post-war governments have been minority coalitions, ruling with more or less stable parliamentary support.<p>Since November 2001, the Danish Prime Minister has been Anders Fogh Rasmussen from the party <!--del_lnk--> Venstre, a right-wing liberal party. Historically, the Social Democrats have led most post-war Danish governments, although the Social Democratic influence has never been as strong as in <!--del_lnk--> Sweden.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

This is in the archipelago <!--del_lnk--> Ertholmene 18 km northeast of <!--del_lnk--> Bornholm. The distance from east to west is 452 km, from north to south 360 km.<p>Denmark consists of the <!--del_lnk--> peninsula of <!--del_lnk--> Jutland <i>(Jylland)</i> and 443 named <!--del_lnk--> islands. Of these, 76 are inhabited, with the largest being <!--del_lnk--> Zealand <i>(Sj&aelig;lland)</i> and <!--del_lnk--> Funen <i>(Fyn)</i>. The island of <!--del_lnk--> Bornholm is located somewhat east of the rest of the country, in the <a href="../../wp/b/Baltic_Sea.htm" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic Sea</a>. Many of the larger islands are connected by bridges; the <!--del_lnk--> &Oslash;resund Bridge connects Zealand with <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Great Belt Bridge connects Funen with Zealand, and the Little Belt Bridge connects Jutland with Funen. <!--del_lnk--> Ferries or small aircraft connect to the smaller islands. Main cities are the capital <a href="../../wp/c/Copenhagen.htm" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> (on Zealand), <a href="../../wp/a/Aarhus.htm" title="Aarhus">Aarhus</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Aalborg and <!--del_lnk--> Esbjerg (on Jutland) and <!--del_lnk--> Odense (on Funen). Along with <a href="../../wp/e/Equatorial_Guinea.htm" title="Equatorial Guinea">Equatorial Guinea</a> it is one of two countries in the world with its <!--del_lnk--> mainland on a <a href="../../wp/c/Continent.htm" title="Continent">continent</a> and its <!--del_lnk--> capital city on an <!--del_lnk--> island.<p>The country is mostly flat with little elevation; the highest natural point is <!--del_lnk--> M&oslash;lleh&oslash;j, at 171 metres. Other hills in the same area southwest of &Aring;rhus are Yding Skovh&oslash;j at 171 metres and Ejer Bavneh&oslash;j at 170 metres. The area of inland water is: (eastern Denmark) 210 km&sup2;; (western D.) 490 km&sup2;.<p>Denmark is split into many islands because the country&#39;s average height above sea level is only 31 metres. This results in a long coastline, more than 7,400 km. If Denmark was formed as a perfect circle, the circumference would be only 742 km. Another feature that shows the close connection between the land and ocean is that no location in Denmark is farther from the coast than 52 km. The size of the land area of Denmark cannot be stated exactly since the ocean constantly erodes and adds material to the coastline, and because of human land reclamation projects (to counter erosion). On the southwest coast of Jutland, the tide is between 1 and 2 metres, and the coastline moves outward and inward on a 10 km stretch.<div class="thumb tleft">

There is a lot of wind, which is stronger during the winter and weaker during the summer. Denmark has an average of 170 rainy days. The greatest rainfall comes in September, October and November.<p>Because of Denmark&#39;s northern location, the length of the day with <a href="../../wp/s/Sunlight.htm" title="Sunlight">sunlight</a> varies greatly. There are short days during the winter with sunrise coming around 8 a.m. and sunset 3:30 p.m., as well as long summer days with sunrise at 3:30 a.m. and sunset at 10 p.m. The shortest and longest days of the year are celebrated. The celebration for the shortest day is <!--del_lnk--> Christmas (Jul) celebrated mostly on Christmas Eve, the 24th of December. Originally, this was only about the shortest day but was later combined with <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, although the old norse name for the celebration persisted.

      <p>Denmark&#39;s national currency, the <i>krone</i> (plural: kroner), is very stable and currently exchanges with American dollars at a rate of about $0.17 USD per krone (about 6 kroner per dollar).<p>The Danish economy is highly unionised; 75% of its labor force are members of a trade union. Most trade unions take part in the organised umbrella system of trade unions, the biggest umbrella organisation being the so-called LO, the <!--del_lnk--> Danish Confederation of Trade Unions. However, an increasingly larger part of the labor force choose not to become members of a trade union or to become members of one of the trade unions outside the organised system (often referred to as the yellow, in Danish <i>gule</i>, trade unions).<p>Relationships between unions and employers are cooperative: unions have a day-to-day role in managing the workplace, and their representatives sit on most companies&#39; <!--del_lnk--> board of directors. Rules on work schedules and pay are negotiated between unions and employers, with minimal government involvement. The unemployment rate September 2006 was 4.2%, for a total of 117,100 persons. The number of unemployed is forecast at 65,000 in 2015. The number of people in the working age group, less disability pensioners etc., will grow by 10,000 to 2,860,000, and the jobs by 70,000 to 2,790,000, parttime jobs included.<p>The government has been very successful in meeting, and even exceeding, the economic convergence criteria for participating in the third phase (a common European currency) of the <!--del_lnk--> Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union (EMU), but Denmark, in a September 2000 <!--del_lnk--> referendum, reconfirmed its decision not to join the 12 other EU members in the <a href="../../wp/e/Euro.htm" title="Euro">euro</a>. Even so, the Danish currency remains pegged to the euro.<p>The welfare model is the general term for Denmark to organise and finance their social security systems, health services and education. The principle behind the welfare model is that benefits should be given to all citizens who fulfill the conditions, without regard to employment or family situation. The system covers everyone; it is universal. And the benefits are given to the individual, so that e.g. married women have rights independently of their husbands.<p>In the area of sickness and unemployment, the right to benefit is, however, always dependent on former employment and at times also on membership of a trade union and the payment of contributions; however the largest share of the financial burden is still carried by the central government (staten) and financed from general taxation, not in the main from earmarked contributions.<p>The State is involved in financing and organising the welfare benefits available to the citizens to a far greater extent than in other European countries. For that reason the welfare model is accompanied by a taxation system which is both broadly based (25%VAT and excise) and with high income tax rates.<p>The benefits given are more generous than is the case in the <!--del_lnk--> British Beveridge model &mdash; and in combination with the taxation system this brings about a greater redistribution than is the case in the Bismarck model, which is aimed rather at maintaining the present status.<p>For the past three years Denmark has ranked first on the <!--del_lnk--> Economist Intelligence Unit&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> e-readiness&quot; list. &quot;A country&#39;s &quot;e-readiness&quot; is a measure of its <!--del_lnk--> e-business environment, a collection of factors that indicate how amenable a market is to <a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">Internet</a>-based opportunities.&quot;<p><a id="Transport" name="Transport"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transport</span></h2>

      <p>The Danish education system is sophisticated and offers free access to public school, high school and most kinds of higher education (universities etc.). About 99% of the general population attend elementary school (lasting 9 to 10 years); 86% attend secondary school and 41% pursue further education.<p>Primary school in Denmark is &quot;den Danske Folkeskole&quot; or &quot;the Danish folk school&quot;. It goes from 0-10th grade. In Denmark one can also go to &quot;Friskole&quot;/&quot;Privatskole&quot; or &quot;free school&quot;: schools that are not under the municipalities. An example is &quot;[Rudolf Steiner] Skolerne&quot; or &quot;Waldof Schools&quot;. The most special kind of school in Denmark is &quot;Efterskole&quot;. If translated directly from Danish it becomes &quot;afterschool&quot;. The &quot;afterschool&quot; goes from an 8-10 class, and everybody lives at the school. One of the big differences between a boarding school and an &quot;afterschool&quot; is the freedom; one has more freedom at an afterschool.<p>Perhaps the most important Danish contribution to education is the &quot;folkeh&oslash;jskole&quot;, introduced by <!--del_lnk--> N.F.S. Grundtvig in the 1800s. Literally translated as &quot;folk high school,&quot; the folkeh&oslash;jskole is a social education structure without tests or grades, putting its emphasis not on demonstratable achievement but rather on communal learning, self-discovery, and learning how to think. <!--del_lnk-->  Many young Danes attend a folkeh&oslash;jskole for a few months or a year after they graduate from the Gymnasium, which is a school comparable to college in the US, before going on to university. However, the folkeh&oslash;jskoles, as &quot;schools for the people,&quot; are also resources for lifelong learning. Some folkeh&oslash;jskoles have particular focus areas, such as sports, music, or environmental protection. Most, however, offer a broad liberal arts education.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

The play was inspired by an old Danish myth of the viking Prince Amled of Jutland, and his quest for vengeance against his father&#39;s killer. Another widely known Dane is <!--del_lnk--> Hans Christian Andersen, in Denmark referred to as H. C. Andersen, a writer mostly famous for such fairy tales as <!--del_lnk--> The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes, <!--del_lnk--> The Little Mermaid, and <!--del_lnk--> The Ugly Duckling. Also <!--del_lnk--> Karen Blixen (pen name: <i>Isak Dinesen</i>) and the Philosopher <a href="../../wp/s/S%25C3%25B8ren_Kierkegaard.htm" title="S&oslash;ren Kierkegaard">S&oslash;ren Kierkegaard</a> are well-known world wide. Also <a href="../../wp/n/Niels_Bohr.htm" title="Niels Bohr">Niels Bohr</a>, the famous physicist who developed the first <!--del_lnk--> working model for the atom and the <!--del_lnk--> quantum theory concept of <!--del_lnk--> complementarity. <!--del_lnk--> Hans Kirk, although less well-known outside of Denmark, is the author of the bestselling Danish novel of all time, <i>The Fishermen</i>.<p>The most popular sport in Denmark is <a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Football (soccer)">football</a> (soccer). The lengthy coastline also provides good opportunity for <!--del_lnk--> sailing and other water sports. The &quot;Around Zealand Regatta&quot; is a yacht race that begins in <!--del_lnk--> Helsing&oslash;r and continues for 2&ndash;3 days. Because of the level terrain, another common sport is <!--del_lnk--> cycling, and of late <a href="../../wp/c/Copenhagen.htm" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> has been nicknamed the &quot;City of Cyclists&quot; for the frequent use of bicycles for transportation and the designated roadtracks for cyclists. Indoor sports such as <a href="../../wp/b/Badminton.htm" title="Badminton">badminton</a> and <!--del_lnk--> handball are also popular because of the lengthy winters.<p><a id="Military" name="Military"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Military</span></h2>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> armed forces of Denmark are known as the Danish Defence Force (<!--del_lnk--> Danish: <i>Det Danske Forsvar</i>). During peacetime, the Ministry of Defence (FM) in Denmark employs, in four branches, 15,450 in the army, 5,300 in the navy, 6,050 in the air force and more than 55,000 in the Home Guard. Although all four are under the command of the Ministry of Defence, the first three are commanded by the <!--del_lnk--> Defence Command (FKO) and have their own subcommand, while the Home Guard is under the direct command of the Danish Ministry of Defence in peacetime. During war, the number of active military employees balloons to more than 45,000 in the army, 7,300 in the navy a 9,500 in the air force with no change to the Home Guard, which is put under the direct command of the Defence Command.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> draft age is 18 years of age for compulsory and volunteer <!--del_lnk--> military service. Military service is only compulsory for Danish men who are fit enough to serve. At the <!--del_lnk--> committee one has to pick a number from a bowl. If the number is large enough then you will not be required to serve. Otherwise one is required to serve either in the military or become a <!--del_lnk--> conscientious objector and undertake community service. Conscripts serve an initial training period that varies from four to 12 months according to specialisation. Reservists are assigned to mobilisation units following completion of their conscript service. Women are eligible to volunteer for military service as of 2004. There are 955,168 males and 935,643 females aged between 18 and 49 fit for military service.
