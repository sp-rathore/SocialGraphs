      <p><b>Dover</b> is a major <a href="../../wp/e/English_Channel.htm" title="English Channel">channel</a> port in the <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a> county of <!--del_lnk--> Kent. At the <!--del_lnk--> 2001 census, the town of Dover proper had a population of 28,156 inhabitants, while the population of the whole <!--del_lnk--> urban area of Dover, as calculated by the <!--del_lnk--> Office for National Statistics, was 39,078 inhabitants. (External reference: <!--del_lnk--> ). The town is the administrative centre of the <!--del_lnk--> Dover district.<p>Dover is famous for its <a href="../../wp/w/White_cliffs_of_Dover.htm" title="White cliffs of Dover">white cliffs</a>, which are made of <!--del_lnk--> chalk. The cliffs gave Britain its <!--del_lnk--> nickname of <i><!--del_lnk--> Albion</i>, meaning &quot;white&quot;. The town&#39;s name derives from the <!--del_lnk--> Brythonic <i>Dubr&#x101;s</i> (&quot;the waters&quot;).<p>Its closeness to continental <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> &ndash; it is only 34 kilometres (21 miles) from the French port of <!--del_lnk--> Calais &ndash; makes Dover one of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>&#39;s busiest cross-<a href="../../wp/e/English_Channel.htm" title="English Channel">Channel</a> ports, with 18 million passengers passing through each year. Regular <!--del_lnk--> ferry services operate from Dover to <!--del_lnk--> Calais and <!--del_lnk--> Dunkerque. A regular catamaran service to <!--del_lnk--> Boulogne recommenced in May 2004. <!--del_lnk--> Catamaran services provided by <!--del_lnk--> Hoverspeed to <!--del_lnk--> Ostend were withdrawn in 2003, and to Calais on 7 November 2005. Hoverspeed had previously operated hovercraft services to and from Calais and Boulogne for many years.<p>Dover is represented in Parliament by the <!--del_lnk--> Labour MP <!--del_lnk--> Gwyn Prosser.<p>Since 1836 the town of Dover (originally being the two parishes of Dover St. Mary&#39;s and Dover St. James) has incorporated the ancient villages and parishes of Buckland and Charlton. These are now suburbs of the town.<p>Most of the western half of the town is in Hougham parish and a small part of the eastern section and <!--del_lnk--> Dover Castle are in Guston parish<p><b>Maxton</b> was once a hamlet of Hougham parish to the west of Dover, and the terminus of the <a href="../../wp/r/Rail_transport.htm" title="Rail transport">tramway</a> system serving the town until its closure in <!--del_lnk--> 1936. It is now a suburb of the town.<p>

      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1992, a waterlogged <a href="../../wp/b/Boat.htm" title="Boat">boat</a> was discovered in a depth of 6 m that dates to the <a href="../../wp/b/Bronze_Age.htm" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a> and is one of the oldest seagoing vessels ever recovered. It has been dated by the <!--del_lnk--> radiocarbon method to ca. <!--del_lnk--> 1550 BC.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Langdon Bay <!--del_lnk--> hoard, discovered in <!--del_lnk--> 1974 off the Dover coast contains bronze axes of a French type and may represent the cargo of a sunken vessel, thus demonstrating cross-channel <!--del_lnk--> trade already for the Bronze Age, if not earlier.

      <p>In <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman</a> times it became an important fortified port named <i><!--del_lnk--> Portus Dubris</i>. Dover was the starting point of the <a href="../../wp/w/Watling_Street.htm" title="Watling Street">Watling Street</a> Roman road, and was an important harbour of the <!--del_lnk--> Classis Britannica.<p>In around <!--del_lnk--> AD 50 the Romans built two lighthouses, one on either side of the then-river-<!--del_lnk--> estuary (now <!--del_lnk--> silted-up, one on the <!--del_lnk--> Western Heights whose few remains are now within the <!--del_lnk--> Drop Redoubt, and the other which still stands to its full height in the grounds of <!--del_lnk--> Dover Castle, making it one of the oldest buildings in <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">Britain</a>. The &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Painted House&quot; is a Roman <!--del_lnk--> mansio from about <!--del_lnk--> AD 200 and one of the best preserved Roman houses in Britain. On the same site and nearby there is also a <!--del_lnk--> Classis Britannica fort and the <!--del_lnk--> Saxon Shore Fort which was built over them both.<p><a id="Anglo-Saxon_and_Norman.2C_to_1200" name="Anglo-Saxon_and_Norman.2C_to_1200"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Anglo-Saxon and Norman, to 1200</span></h3>

      <p>After the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Hastings.htm" title="Battle of Hastings">Battle of Hastings</a> in October 1066, <!--del_lnk--> William the Conqueror and his forces marched to <a href="../../wp/w/Westminster_Abbey.htm" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> for his coronation. They took a roundabout route, via <!--del_lnk--> Romney, Dover, Canterbury, Surrey and Berkshire. From the <!--del_lnk--> Cinque Ports&#39;s foundation in 1050, Dover has always been a chief member - it may also have been this that first attracted William&#39;s attention, and got Kent the motto of <!--del_lnk--> Invicta. In the words of <!--del_lnk--> William of Poitiers:<dl>
       <dd>Then he marched to Dover, which had been reported impregnable and held by a large force. The English, stricken with fear at his approach had confidence neither in their ramparts nor in the numbers of their troops ... While the inhabitants were preparing to surrender unconditionally, [the Normans], greedy for booty, set fire to the castle and the great part of it was soon enveloped in flames...[William then paid for the repair and] having taken possession of the castle, the Duke spent eight days adding new fortifications to it&#39;.</dl>
      <p>Archaeological evidence suggests that a new castle was constructed near the Saxon church of St. Mary de Castro in what is now <!--del_lnk--> Dover Castle, rather than or as well as repairing the old burgh.<p>The <a href="../../wp/d/Domesday_Book.htm" title="Domesday Book">Domesday Book</a> of only 20 years later states that before the conquest Dover&#39;s value had been &pound;18 but was now &pound;40. Clearly Dover had quickly been rebuilt.<p>The Normans also built the churches of <!--del_lnk--> St Mary the Virgin, Dover (on the foundations of a Roman structure - it still stands) and of St. James the Apostle (as an aisleless nave with a short tower - perhaps on the site of a Saxon church partly destroyed in 1066 - destroyed in World War Two, ruins visible) and reconstituted the Saxon monastic church of St Martin le Grand, as well as founding a new <!--del_lnk--> Dover Priory on another site, also dedicated to St. Martin. Several surviving buildings and various ruins of Dover Priory have been incorporated in to Dover College<p><a id="Medieval" name="Medieval"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Medieval</span></h3>

      <p>St Martin le Grand dominated Market Square, being over 150 feet long. It housed the altars of three parish churches; St. Mary, St. Nicholas and St. John the Baptist and had the churches of St. Peter and St. James subordinate to it. The church was finally dismantled around 1540 although the remains of some of the walls survived into the 19th century.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1216, <!--del_lnk--> Dover was attacked by the French and successfully defended from <!--del_lnk--> Dover Castle by <!--del_lnk--> Hubert de Burgh - it was less lucky in <!--del_lnk--> 1295 when 10,000 French burnt most of Dover to the ground. It nevertheless flourished as the closest port to the continent.<p>Medieval buildings:<ul>

      <p>Dover became a garrison town heavily defended against the threat of French invasion. Napoleon&#39;s troops, gathered at Boulogne, could be seen from Dover on a clear day.<p>At first earthen batteries were built along the seafront and across the <!--del_lnk--> Western Heights (to supplement the medieval castle, which had been superseded by developments in military technology and artillery). These were later improved in <!--del_lnk--> 1804 with a massive building programme in stone and brick on the Western Heights, creating two cutting-edge forts, deep brick-lined ditches, and the <!--del_lnk--> Grand Shaft, a unique 140ft triple staircase, linking the town to the forts and enabling troops from the hilltop barracks to be rapidly deployed at the seafront.<p><a name="19th_century"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">19th century</span></h3>
      <p>Between 1801 and 1901 the population increased by 600 percent. The habour was finally rebuilt as a set of artificial moles, and the town tried to become a seaside resort by building a pleasure pier, ice rink, bathing machines and impressive seafront crescents of hotels and apartments. The railways arrived and cross-channel traffic boomed - the town were even combined with boat trains and the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Arrow service.<div class="thumb tright">
