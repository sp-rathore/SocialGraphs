      <p>One of the best known sauropods, <i>Diplodocus</i> was a very large long-necked <!--del_lnk--> quadrupedal animal, with a long, whip-like tail. Its forelimbs were slightly shorter than its hind limbs, resulting in a largely horizontal posture. The long-necked, long-tailed animal with four sturdy legs has been mechanically compared with a suspension bridge. In fact, <i>Diplodocus</i> is the longest dinosaur known from a complete skeleton. While dinosaurs such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Seismosaurus</i> (which might be a large <i>Diplodocus</i>) and <i><!--del_lnk--> Supersaurus</i> were probably longer, fossil remains of these animals are only fragmentary.<p>The skull of <i>Diplodocus</i> was very small, compared to the <!--del_lnk--> size of the animal, which could reach up to 27&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> metres (90 <!--del_lnk--> feet), of which 6 metres was neck. <i>Diplodocus</i> had small, &#39;peg&#39;-like teeth only at the anterior part of the jaws, which were distinctly procumbent . Its braincase was small. The neck was composed of at least fifteen <!--del_lnk--> vertebrae and is now believed to have been generally held parallel to the ground and unable to have been elevated much past horizontal .<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p><i>Diplodocus</i> had an extremely long tail, composed of at around eighty <!--del_lnk--> caudal vertebrae, which is almost double the number some of the earlier sauropods had in their tails (such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Shunosaurus</i> with 43), and far more than conteporaneous macronarians had (such as <i><a href="../../wp/c/Camarasaurus.htm" title="Camarasaurus">Camarasaurus</a></i> with 53). There has been speculation as to whether it may have had a defensive or noisemaking function.<p>The tail may have served as a counterbalance for the neck. The middle part of the tail had &#39;double beams&#39; (oddly-shaped bones on the underside of the tail), which gave <i>Diplodocus</i> its name. They may have provided support for the vertebrae or perhaps prevented the blood vessels from being crushed if the animal&#39;s heavy tail pressed against the ground. These &#39;double beams&#39; are also seen in some related dinosaurs.<p><a id="Discovery_and_species" name="Discovery_and_species"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Discovery and species</span></h2>
      <p>Several species of <i>Diplodocus</i> were described between 1878 and 1924. The first <!--del_lnk--> skeleton was found at <!--del_lnk--> Como Bluff, <!--del_lnk--> Wyoming by Benjamin Mudge and Samuel Wendell Williston in <!--del_lnk--> 1878 and was named <i>Diplodocus longus</i> (&quot;long double-beam&quot;), by <a href="../../wp/p/Paleontology.htm" title="Paleontology">palaeontologist</a> <!--del_lnk--> Othniel Charles Marsh in 1878. <i>Diplodocus</i> remains have since been found in the <!--del_lnk--> Morrison Formation of the western <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">U.S.</a> States of <!--del_lnk--> Colorado, <!--del_lnk--> Utah, <!--del_lnk--> Montana and <!--del_lnk--> Wyoming. <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil.htm" title="Fossil">Fossils</a> of this animal are common, except for the <!--del_lnk--> skull, which is often missing from otherwise complete skeletons. Although not the type species, <i>D. carnegiei</i> is the most completely known and most famous due to the large number of casts of its skeleton in museums around the world.<p>The two Morrison Formation sauropod genera <i>Diplodocus</i> and <i>Barosaurus</i> had very similar limb-bones. In the past, many isolated limb bones were automatically attributed to <i>Diplodocus</i> but may, in fact, have belonged to <i>Barosaurus</i>.<p><a id="Valid_species" name="Valid_species"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Valid species</span></h3>
      <ul>
       <li><i>D. longus</i>, the <!--del_lnk--> type species, is known from two skulls and a caudal series from the Morrison Formation of Colorado and Utah.<li><i>D. carnegiei</i>, named after <a href="../../wp/a/Andrew_Carnegie.htm" title="Andrew Carnegie">Andrew Carnegie</a>, is the best known, mainly due to a near-complete skeleton collected by Jacob Wortman, of the <!--del_lnk--> Carnegie Museum of Natural History in <!--del_lnk--> Pittsburgh, <!--del_lnk--> Pennsylvania and described and named by <!--del_lnk--> John Bell Hatcher in 1901.<li><i>D. hayi</i>, known from a partial skeleton discovered by William H.

A presentation at the annual conference of the <!--del_lnk--> Geological Society of America, in 2004, made a case for <i><!--del_lnk--> Seismosaurus</i>, discovered in 1979 and recognised as a separate genus in 1991, to be reassigned as a species of <i>Diplodocus</i>, namely <i>D. hallorum</i>.</ul>

      <p>Due to a wealth of skeletal remains, <i>Diplodocus</i> is one of the best studied dinosaurs. Many aspects of its lifestyle have been subject to various theories over the years. Marsh and then <!--del_lnk--> Hatcher assumed the animal was aquatic, due to the position of its nasal openings at the apex of the cranium. A classic 1910 reconstruction by Dr. Oliver P. Hay <!--del_lnk--> depicts two <i>Diplodocus</i> with splayed lizard-like limbs on the banks of a river. Dr. Hay made an argument in favour for Diplodocus having a sprawling, lizard-like gait with widely-splayed legs,  and was supported by Dr. Gustav Tornier. However, this hypothesis was put to rest by Dr. W. J. Holland, who demonstrated that a sprawling <i>Diplodocus</i> would have needed a trench to pull its belly through. <p>The idea of an aquatic existence was later debunked, as the water pressure on the chest wall of <i>Diplodocus</i> was proven to have been too great for the animal to have breathed. Since the 1970s, general consensus has the sauropods as firmly terrestrial animals, browsing on trees. Later still, interestingly, with the preceding view of its possible preference for water plants there is a view of a likely <!--del_lnk--> riparian habitat for <i>Diplodocus</i>, echoing the original aquatic theory.<p><a id="Neck" name="Neck"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Neck</span></h3>
      <p>At first, <!--del_lnk--> diplodocids were often portrayed with their necks held high up in the air, allowing them to graze from tall trees. More recently, scientists have argued that the heart would have had trouble sustaining sufficient blood pressure to oxygenate the brain. Furthermore, more recent studies have shown that the structure of the neck vertebrae would not have permitted the neck to bend far upwards. Interestingly, the range of movement of the neck would have allowed the head to graze below the level of the body, leading scientists to speculate on whether <i>Diplodocus</i> grazed on submerged water plants, from riverbanks. This concept of the feeding posture is supported by the relative lengths of front and hind limbs. Furthermore, its peglike teeth may have been used for eating soft water plants.<p>As with the related genus <i>Barosaurus</i>, the very long neck of <i>Diplodocus</i> is the source of much controversy amongst scientists. A 1992 <!--del_lnk--> Columbia University study of Diplodocid neck structure indicated that the longest necks would have required a 1.6 ton heart. The study proposed that animals like these would have had rudimentary auxiliary &#39;hearts&#39; in their necks, whose only purpose was to pump blood up to the next &#39;heart&#39; (Lambert).<p><a id="Spines" name="Spines"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Spines</span></h3>
      <p>Recent discoveries have suggested that <i>Diplodocus</i> and other diplodocids may have had narrow, pointed <!--del_lnk--> keratinous spines lining their back, much like those on an <!--del_lnk--> iguana.  This radically different look has been incorporated into recent reconstructions, notably <i><!--del_lnk--> Walking with Dinosaurs</i>. It is unknown exactly how many diplodocids had this trait.<p><a id="Trunk" name="Trunk"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Trunk</span></h3>
      <p>There has been speculation over whether the high nasal openings in the skull meant that <i>Diplodocus</i> may have had a trunk. A recent study surmised there was no paleoneuroanatomical evidence for a trunk. It noted that the <!--del_lnk--> facial nerve in an animal with a trunk, such as an elephant, is large as it innervates the trunk. The evidence is that it is very small in <i>Diplodocus</i>. Studies by Lawrence Witmer (2001) indicated that, while the nasal openings were high on the head, the actual, fleshy nostrils were situated much lower down on the snout. .<p><a id="Growth_rate" name="Growth_rate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Growth rate</span></h3>
      <p>Following a number of <!--del_lnk--> bone <!--del_lnk--> histology studies, <i>Diplodocus</i>, along with other sauropods, grew at a very fast rate, reaching sexual maturity just over a decade, though continuing to grow throughout their lives.  Previous thinking held that sauropods would keep growing slowly throughout their lifetime, taking decades to reach maturity.<p><a id="Diet" name="Diet"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Diet</span></h2>
      <p><i>Diplodocus</i> had highly unusual teeth compared to other sauropods. The crowns were long and slender, elliptical in cross-section, while the apex forms a blunt triangular point. The most prominent wear facet is on the apex, though unlike all other wear patterns observed within sauropods, <i>Diplodocus</i> wear patterns are on the labial (cheek) side of both the upper and lower teeth. What this means is <i>Diplodocus</i> and other diplodocids had a radically different feeding mechanism than other sauropods. Unilateral branch-stripping is the most likely feeding behaviour of <i>Diplodocus</i>   , as it explains the unusual wear patterns of the teeth (coming from tooth-food contact). In unilateral branch-stripping one tooth row would have been used to strip foliage from the stem, whilst the other would act as a guide and stabiliser.<p>With a laterally and dorsoventrally flexible neck, and the possibilty of using its tail and rearing up on its hind limbs (tripodal ability), <i>Diplodocus</i> would have had the ability to browse at many levels (low, medium, and high), up to approximately 12 metres from the ground.<p><a id="Classification" name="Classification"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Classification</span></h2>
      <p><i>Diplodocus</i> is both the <!--del_lnk--> type genus of, and gives its name to <b><!--del_lnk--> Diplodocidae</b>, the family in which it belongs. Members of this family, while still massive, are of a markedly more slender build compared with other sauropods such as the <!--del_lnk--> titanosaurs and <!--del_lnk--> brachiosaurs. All are characterised by long necks and tails and a horizontal posture, with forelimbs shorter than hindlimbs. Diplodocids flourished in the Late Jurassic of North America and possibly Africa and appear to have been replaced ecologically by titanosaurs during the <a href="../../wp/c/Cretaceous.htm" title="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>.<p>A subfamily, <b>Diplodocinae</b>, was erected to include <i>Diplodocus</i> and its closest relatives, including <i><!--del_lnk--> Seismosaurus</i>, which may belong to the same genus, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Barosaurus</i>. More distantly related is the contemporaneous <i><a href="../../wp/a/Apatosaurus.htm" title="Apatosaurus">Apatosaurus</a></i>, which is still considered a diplodocid although not a diplodocine, as it is a member of the subfamily Apatosaurine. The <!--del_lnk--> Portuguese <i><!--del_lnk--> Dinheirosaurus</i> and the <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">African</a> <i><!--del_lnk--> Tornieria</i> have also been identified as close relatives of <i>Diplodocus</i> by some authors.<p><a id="In_popular_culture" name="In_popular_culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">In popular culture</span></h2>
