      <p>Hilbert was born in <!--del_lnk--> Wehlau, near <!--del_lnk--> K&ouml;nigsberg, <!--del_lnk--> East Prussia (now <!--del_lnk--> Znamensk, near <!--del_lnk--> Kaliningrad, <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>). He graduated from the <!--del_lnk--> lyceum of his native city and registered at the <!--del_lnk--> University of K&ouml;nigsberg. He obtained his doctorate in 1885, with a dissertation, written under <!--del_lnk--> Ferdinand von Lindemann, titled <i>&Uuml;ber invariante Eigenschaften specieller bin&auml;rer Formen, insbesondere der Kugelfunctionen</i> (&quot;On the invariant properties of special <!--del_lnk--> binary forms, in particular the circular functions&quot;). <!--del_lnk--> Hermann Minkowski was also a doctoral candidate at the same university and time, and he and Hilbert became close friends, the two exercising a reciprocal influence over each other at various times in their scientific careers.<p>Hilbert remained at the University of K&ouml;nigsberg as a professor from <!--del_lnk--> 1886 to <!--del_lnk--> 1895, when, as a result of intervention on his behalf by <!--del_lnk--> Felix Klein he obtained the position of Chairman of Mathematics at the <!--del_lnk--> University of G&ouml;ttingen, at that time the best research centre for mathematics in the world and where he remained for the rest of his life.<p>In 1892, he married K&auml;the Jerosch (1864-1945) and had one child Franz Hilbert (1893-1969).<p><a id="The_finiteness_theorem" name="The_finiteness_theorem"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The finiteness theorem</span></h2>
      <p>Hilbert&#39;s first work on invariant functions led him to the demonstration in <!--del_lnk--> 1888 of his famous <i>finiteness theorem</i>. Twenty years earlier, <!--del_lnk--> Paul Gordan had demonstrated the <!--del_lnk--> theorem of the finiteness of generators for binary forms using a complex computational approach. The attempts to generalize his method to functions with more than two variables failed because of the enormous difficulty of the calculations involved. Hilbert realized that it was necessary to take a completely different path. As a result, he demonstrated <i><!--del_lnk--> Hilbert&#39;s basis theorem</i>: showing the existence of a finite set of generators, for the invariants of <!--del_lnk--> quantics in any number of variables, but in an abstract form. That is, while demonstrating the existence of such a set, it was not algorithmic but an <!--del_lnk--> existence theorem.<p>Hilbert sent his results to the <i><!--del_lnk--> Mathematische Annalen</i>. Gordan, the house expert on the theory of invariants for the <i>Mathematische Annalen</i>, was not able to appreciate the revolutionary nature of Hilbert&#39;s theorem and rejected the article, criticizing the exposition because it was insufficiently comprehensive. His comment was:<dl>
       <dd><i>This is Theology, not Mathematics!</i></dl>
      <p>Klein, on the other hand, recognized the importance of the work, and guaranteed that it would be published without any alterations. Encouraged by Klein and by the comments of Gordan, Hilbert in a second article extended his method, providing estimations on the maximum degree of the minimum set of generators, and he sent it once more to the <i>Annalen</i>. After having read the manuscript, Klein wrote to him, saying:<dl>
       <dd><i>Without doubt this is the most important work on general algebra that the</i> Annalen <i>has ever published.</i></dl>
      <p>Later, after the usefulness of Hilbert&#39;s method was universally recognized, Gordan himself would say:<dl>
       <dd><i>I must admit that even theology has its merits.</i></dl>
      <p><a id="Axiomatization_of_geometry" name="Axiomatization_of_geometry"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Axiomatization of geometry</span></h2>
      <dl>
       <dd><i>See supplement, <!--del_lnk--> Hilbert&#39;s axioms.</i></dl>
      <p>The text <i><!--del_lnk--> Grundlagen der Geometrie</i> (tr.: <i>Foundations of Geometry</i>) published by Hilbert in <!--del_lnk--> 1899 substitutes a formal set, comprised of 21 <!--del_lnk--> axioms, for the traditional <a href="../../wp/e/Euclidean_geometry.htm" title="Euclidean geometry">axioms of Euclid</a>. They avoid weaknesses identified in those of <a href="../../wp/e/Euclid.htm" title="Euclid">Euclid</a>, whose works at the time were still used textbook-fashion. Independently and contemporaneously, a 19-year-old American student named <!--del_lnk--> Robert Lee Moore published an equivalent set of axioms. Some of the axioms coincide, while some of the axioms in Moore&#39;s system are theorems in Hilbert&#39;s and vice-versa.<p>Hilbert&#39;s approach signalled the shift to the modern <!--del_lnk--> axiomatic method. Axioms are not taken as self-evident truths. Geometry may treat <i>things</i>, about which we have powerful intuitions, but it is not necessary to assign any explicit meaning to the undefined concepts. The elements, such as <!--del_lnk--> point, <!--del_lnk--> line, <!--del_lnk--> plane, and others, could be substituted, as Hilbert says, by tables, chairs, glasses of beer and other such objects. It is their defined relationships that are discussed.<p>Hilbert first enumerates the undefined concepts: point, line, plane, lying on (a relation between points and planes), betweenness, congruence of pairs of points, and <!--del_lnk--> congruence of <!--del_lnk--> angles. The axioms unify both the <!--del_lnk--> plane geometry and <!--del_lnk--> solid geometry of Euclid in a single system.<p><a id="The_23_Problems" name="The_23_Problems"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The 23 Problems</span></h2>
      <dl>
       <dd>
      </dl>
      <p>He put forth a most influential list of <!--del_lnk--> 23 unsolved problems at the <!--del_lnk--> International Congress of Mathematicians in <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a> in 1900. This is generally reckoned the most successful and deeply considered compilation of open problems ever to be produced by an individual mathematician.<p>After re-working the foundations of classical geometry, Hilbert could have extrapolated to the rest of mathematics. His approach differed, however, from the later &#39;foundationalist&#39; Russell-Whitehead or &#39;encyclopedist&#39; <!--del_lnk--> Nicolas Bourbaki, and from his contemporary <!--del_lnk--> Giuseppe Peano. The mathematical community as a whole could enlist in problems, which he had identified as crucial aspects of the areas of mathematics he took to be key.<p>The problem set was launched as a talk &quot;The Problems of Mathematics&quot; presented during the course of the Second International Congress of Mathematicians held in Paris. Here is the introduction of the speech that Hilbert gave:<dl>
       <dd><i>Who among us would not be happy to lift the veil behind which is hidden the future; to gaze at the coming developments of our science and at the secrets of its development in the centuries to come? What will be the ends toward which the spirit of future generations of mathematicians will tend? What methods, what new facts will the new century reveal in the vast and rich field of mathematical thought?</i></dl>
      <p>He presented fewer than half the problems at the Congress, which were published in the acts of the Congress. In a subsequent publication, he extended the panorama, and arrived at the formulation of the now-canonical 23 Problems of Hilbert. The full text is important, since the exegesis of the questions still can be a matter of inevitable debate, whenever it is asked how many have been solved.<p>Some of these were solved within a short time. Others have been discussed throughout the 20th century, with a few now taken to be unsuitably open-ended to come to closure. Some even continue to this day to remain a challenge for mathematicians.<p><a id="Formalism" name="Formalism"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Formalism</span></h2>
      <p>In an account that had become standard by the mid-century, Hilbert&#39;s problem set was also a kind of manifesto, that opened the way for the development of the <!--del_lnk--> formalist school, one of three major schools of mathematics of the 20th century. According to the formalist, mathematics is a game devoid of meaning in which one plays with symbols devoid of meaning according to formal rules which are agreed upon in advance. It is therefore an autonomous activity of thought. There is, however, room to doubt whether Hilbert&#39;s own views were simplistically formalist in this sense.<p><a id="Hilbert.27s_program" name="Hilbert.27s_program"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Hilbert&#39;s program</span></h3>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1920 he proposed explicitly a research project (in <i><!--del_lnk--> metamathematics</i>, as it was then termed) that became known as <!--del_lnk--> Hilbert&#39;s program. He wanted <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> to be formulated on a solid and complete logical foundation. He believed that in principle this could be done, by showing that:<ol>
       <li>all of mathematics follows from a correctly-chosen finite system of <!--del_lnk--> axioms; and<li>that some such axiom system is provably consistent.</ol>
      <p>He seems to have had both technical and philosophical reasons for formulating this proposal. It affirmed his dislike of what had become known as the <i><!--del_lnk--> ignorabimus</i>, still an active issue in his time in German thought, and traced back in that formulation to <!--del_lnk--> Emil du Bois-Reymond.<p>This program is still recognizable in the most popular <!--del_lnk--> philosophy of mathematics, where it is usually called <i>formalism</i>. For example, the <!--del_lnk--> Bourbaki group adopted a watered-down and selective version of it as adequate to the requirements of their twin projects of (a) writing encyclopedic foundational works, and (b) supporting the <!--del_lnk--> axiomatic method as a research tool. This approach has been successful and influential in relation with Hilbert&#39;s work in algebra and functional analysis, but has failed to engage in the same way with his interests in physics and logic.<p><a id="G.C3.B6del.27s_work" name="G.C3.B6del.27s_work"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">G&ouml;del&#39;s work</span></h3>
      <p>Hilbert and the talented mathematicians who worked with him in his enterprise were committed to the project. His attempt to support axiomatized mathematics with definitive principles, which could banish theoretical uncertainties, was however to end in failure.<p><!--del_lnk--> G&ouml;del demonstrated that any non-contradictory formal system, which was comprehensive enough to include at least arithmetic, cannot demonstrate its completeness by way of its own axioms. In <!--del_lnk--> 1931 his <!--del_lnk--> incompleteness theorem showed that Hilbert&#39;s grand plan was impossible as stated. The second point cannot in any reasonable way be combined with the first point, as long as the axiom system is genuinely <!--del_lnk--> finitary.<p>Nevertheless, the incompleteness theorem says nothing with regard to the demonstration by way of a different formal system of the completeness of mathematics. The subsequent achievements of <!--del_lnk--> proof theory at the very least <i>clarified</i> consistency as it relates to theories of central concern to mathematicians. Hilbert&#39;s work had started logic on this course of clarification; the need to understand G&ouml;del&#39;s work then led to the development of <!--del_lnk--> recursion theory and then <!--del_lnk--> mathematical logic as an autonomous discipline in the decade 1930-1940. The basis for later <!--del_lnk--> theoretical computer science, in <!--del_lnk--> Alonzo Church and <a href="../../wp/a/Alan_Turing.htm" title="Alan Turing">Alan Turing</a> also grew directly out of this &#39;debate&#39;.<p><a id="The_G.C3.B6ttingen_school" name="The_G.C3.B6ttingen_school"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The G&ouml;ttingen school</span></h2>
      <p>Among the students of Hilbert, there were <!--del_lnk--> Hermann Weyl, the champion of chess <!--del_lnk--> Emanuel Lasker, <!--del_lnk--> Ernst Zermelo, and <!--del_lnk--> Carl Gustav Hempel. <a href="../../wp/j/John_von_Neumann.htm" title="John von Neumann">John von Neumann</a> was his assistant. At the University of G&ouml;ttingen, Hilbert was surrounded by a social circle of some of the most important mathematicians of the 20th century, such as <!--del_lnk--> Emmy Noether and <!--del_lnk--> Alonzo Church.<p><a id="Functional_analysis" name="Functional_analysis"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Functional analysis</span></h2>
      <p>Around 1909, Hilbert dedicated himself to the study of differential and <!--del_lnk--> integral equations; his work had direct consequences for important parts of modern functional analysis. In order to carry out these studies, Hilbert introduced the concept of an infinite dimensional <!--del_lnk--> Euclidean space, later called <!--del_lnk--> Hilbert space. His work in this part of analysis provided the basis for important contributions to the mathematics of physics in the next two decades, though from an unanticipated direction. Later on, <!--del_lnk--> Stefan Banach amplified the concept, defining <!--del_lnk--> Banach spaces. Hilbert space is the most important single idea in the area of <!--del_lnk--> functional analysis that grew up around it during the 20th century.<p><a id="Physics" name="Physics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Physics</span></h2>
      <p>Until 1912, Hilbert was almost exclusively a &quot;pure&quot; mathematician. When planning a visit from Bonn, where he was immersed in studying physics, his fellow mathematician and friend <!--del_lnk--> Hermann Minkowski joked he had to spend 10 days in quarantine before being able to visit Hilbert. In fact, Minkowski seems responsible for most of Hilbert&#39;s physics investigations prior to 1912, including their joint seminar in the subject in 1905.<p>In 1912, three years after his friend&#39;s death, Hilbert turned his focus to the subject almost exclusively. He arranged to have a &quot;physics tutor&quot; for himself. He started studying <!--del_lnk--> kinetic gas theory and moved on to elementary <!--del_lnk--> radiation theory and the molecular theory of matter. Even after the war started in 1914, he continued seminars and classes where the works of <a href="../../wp/a/Albert_Einstein.htm" title="Albert Einstein">Einstein</a> and others were followed closely.<p>Hilbert invited Einstein to G&ouml;ttingen to deliver a week of lectures in June-July 1915 on general relativity and his developing theory of gravity (Sauer 1999, Folsing 1998). The exchange of ideas led to the final form of the field equations of <!--del_lnk--> General Relativity, namely the <!--del_lnk--> Einstein field equations and the <!--del_lnk--> Einstein-Hilbert action. In spite of the fact that Einstein and Hilbert never engaged in a public priority dispute, there has been some <!--del_lnk--> dispute about the discovery of the field equations.<p>Additionally, Hilbert&#39;s work anticipated and assisted several advances in the <!--del_lnk--> mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. His work was a key aspect of <!--del_lnk--> Hermann Weyl and <!--del_lnk--> John von Neuman&#39;s work on the mathematical equivalence of <!--del_lnk--> Werner Heisenberg&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> matrix mechanics and <!--del_lnk--> Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger&#39;s <a href="../../wp/s/Schr%25C3%25B6dinger_equation.htm" title="Schr&ouml;dinger equation">wave equation</a> and his namesake <!--del_lnk--> Hilbert space plays an important part in quantum theory. In 1926 von Neuman showed that if atomic states were understood as vectors in Hilbert space, then they would correspond with both Schrodinger&#39;s wave function theory and Heisenberg&#39;s matrices.<p>Throughout this immersion in physics, Hilbert worked on putting rigor into the mathematics of physics. While highly dependent on higher math, the physicist tended to be &quot;sloppy&quot; with it. To a &quot;pure&quot; mathematician like Hilbert, this was both &quot;ugly&quot; and difficult to understand. As he began to understand the physics and how the physicists were using mathematics, he developed a coherent mathematical theory for what he found, most importantly in the area of <!--del_lnk--> integral equations. When his colleague <!--del_lnk--> Richard Courant wrote the now classic <!--del_lnk--> Methods of Mathematical Physics including some of Hilbert&#39;s ideas, he added Hilbert&#39;s name as author even though Hilbert had not directly contributed to the writing. Hilbert said &quot;Physics is too hard for physicists&quot;, implying that the necessary mathematics was generally beyond them; the Courant-Hilbert book made it easier for them.<p><a id="Number_theory" name="Number_theory"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Number theory</span></h2>
      <p>Hilbert unified the field of <!--del_lnk--> algebraic number theory with his 1897 treatise <i>Zahlbericht</i> (literally &quot;report on numbers&quot;). He disposed of <!--del_lnk--> Waring&#39;s problem in the wide sense. He then had little more to publish on the subject; but the emergence of <!--del_lnk--> Hilbert modular forms in the dissertation of a student means his name is further attached to a major area.<p>He made a series of conjectures on <!--del_lnk--> class field theory. The concepts were highly influential, and his own contribution is seen in the names of the <!--del_lnk--> Hilbert class field and the <!--del_lnk--> Hilbert symbol of <!--del_lnk--> local class field theory. Results on them were mostly proved by 1930, after breakthrough work by <!--del_lnk--> Teiji Takagi that established him as Japan&#39;s first mathematician of international stature.<p>Hilbert did not work in the central areas of <!--del_lnk--> analytic number theory, but his name has become known for the <!--del_lnk--> Hilbert-P&oacute;lya conjecture, for reasons that are anecdotal.<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Later years</span></h2>
      <p>Hilbert lived to see the <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">Nazis</a> purge many of the prominent faculty members at <!--del_lnk--> University of G&ouml;ttingen, in <!--del_lnk--> 1933. <!--del_lnk--> . Among those forced out were <!--del_lnk--> Hermann Weyl, who had taken Hilbert&#39;s chair when he retired in 1930, <!--del_lnk--> Emmy Noether and <!--del_lnk--> Edmund Landau. One of those who had to leave Germany was <!--del_lnk--> Paul Bernays, Hilbert&#39;s collaborator in <!--del_lnk--> mathematical logic, and co-author with him of the important book <i>Grundlagen der Mathematik</i> (which eventually appeared in two volumes, in 1934 and 1939). This was a sequel to the Hilbert-<!--del_lnk--> Ackermann book <i><!--del_lnk--> Principles of Theoretical Logic</i> from 1928.<p>About a year later, he attended a banquet, and was seated next to the new Minister of Education, <!--del_lnk--> Bernhard Rust. Rust asked, &quot;How is mathematics in G&ouml;ttingen now that it has been freed of the Jewish influence?&quot; Hilbert replied, &quot;Mathematics in G&ouml;ttingen? There is really none any more&quot;.<p>By the time Hilbert died in <!--del_lnk--> 1943, the Nazis had nearly completely restructured the university, many of the former faculty being either Jewish or married to Jews. Hilbert&#39;s funeral was attended by fewer than a dozen people, only two of whom were fellow academics.<p>On his tombstone, at G&ouml;ttingen, one can read his epitaph:<dl>
       <dd><i>Wir m&uuml;ssen wissen, wir werden wissen</i> - We must know, we will know.</dl>
      <p>Ironically, the day before Hilbert pronounced this phrase, <!--del_lnk--> Kurt G&ouml;del had presented his thesis, containing the famous <!--del_lnk--> incompleteness theorem.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert&quot;</div>
