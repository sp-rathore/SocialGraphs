      <p><b>Douglas No&euml;l Adams</b> (<!--del_lnk--> March 11, <!--del_lnk--> 1952 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> May 11, <!--del_lnk--> 2001) was a British author, comic <!--del_lnk--> radio dramatist, and amateur musician. He is known most notably as author of the <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Hitchhiker%2527s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy.htm" title="The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy">Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy</a></i> series. <i>Hitchhiker&#39;s</i> began on radio, and developed into a <!--del_lnk--> &quot;trilogy&quot; of five books (which sold more than fifteen million copies during his lifetime) as well as a <!--del_lnk--> television series, a towel, a comic book series, a <!--del_lnk--> computer game and a <!--del_lnk--> feature film that was completed after Adams&#39;s death. He was known to some fans as <i>Bop Ad</i> (after his illegible signature), or by his initials &quot;<!--del_lnk--> DNA&quot;.<p>In addition to <i>The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy</i>, Douglas Adams wrote or co-wrote three stories of the science fiction television series <i><a href="../../wp/d/Doctor_Who.htm" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a></i>, and served the series as Script Editor during the seventeenth season. His other written works include the <i><!--del_lnk--> Dirk Gently</i> novels, and co-author credits on two <i><!--del_lnk--> Liff</i> books and <i><!--del_lnk--> Last Chance to See</i>, itself based on a radio series. Adams also originated the idea for the computer game <i><!--del_lnk--> Starship Titanic</i>, which was realized by a company that Adams co-founded, and adapted into a novel by <!--del_lnk--> Terry Jones. A posthumous collection of essays and other material, including an incomplete novel, was published as <i><!--del_lnk--> The Salmon of Doubt</i> in 2002.<p>His fans and friends also knew Adams as an environmental activist, a self-described &quot;radical <!--del_lnk--> atheist&quot; and a lover of fast cars, cameras, the <a href="../../wp/m/Macintosh.htm" title="Apple Macintosh">Macintosh</a> computer, and other &quot;techno gizmos.&quot; He was a keen <!--del_lnk--> technologist, using such inventions as e-mail and <!--del_lnk--> Usenet before they became widely popular, or even widely known.<p>Toward the end of his life, he was a sought-after lecturer on topics including technology and the environment. Since his death at the age of 49, he is still widely revered in science fiction and fantasy <!--del_lnk--> fandom circles.<p>

      <p>Douglas Adams was born to Janet (Donovan) Adams (now Janet Thrift) and Christopher Douglas Adams in <!--del_lnk--> Cambridge, England. His parents had one other child together, Susan, who was born in March 1955. His parents separated and divorced in 1957, and Douglas, Susan, and Janet moved in with Janet&#39;s parents, the Donovans, in <!--del_lnk--> Brentwood, Essex. Douglas&#39;s grandmother kept her house as an official <!--del_lnk--> RSPCA refuge for hurt animals, which &quot;exacerbated young Douglas&#39;s hayfever and asthma.&quot;<p>Christopher Adams remarried in July 1960, to Mary Judith Stewart (born Judith Robertson). From this marriage, Douglas Adams had a half-sister, Heather. Janet remarried in 1964, to a veterinarian, Ron Thrift, providing two more half-siblings to Douglas; Jane and James Thrift.<p><a id="Education_and_early_works" name="Education_and_early_works"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Education and early works</span></h2>
      <p>Adams first attended Primrose Hill Primary School in Brentwood. He took the exams and interviewed for <!--del_lnk--> Brentwood School at age six, and attended the Preparatory School from 1959 to 1964, then the main school until 1970. He was in the top stream, and specialised in the arts in the sixth form, after which he stayed an extra term in a special seventh form class, customary in the school for those preparing for Oxbridge entrance exams.<p>While at the Preparatory school, he had an English class, taught by Frank Halford, where Halford awarded Adams the only ten out of ten of his entire teaching career for a creative writing exercise. Adams remembered this for the rest of his life, especially when facing writer&#39;s block. Some of Adams&#39;s earliest writing was published at the school, such as a report on the school&#39;s Photography Club in <i>The Brentwoodian</i> (in 1962) or spoof reviews in the school magazine <i>Broadsheet</i> (edited by <!--del_lnk--> Paul Neil Milne Johnstone). Adams also had a letter and short story published nationally in the UK in the boys&#39; magazine <i>The Eagle</i> in 1965. He met <!--del_lnk--> Griff Rhys Jones, who was in the year below, at the school, and was in the same class as &quot;Stuckist&quot; artist <!--del_lnk--> Charles Thomson; all three appeared together in a production of Shakespeare&#39;s Julius Caesar in 1968. He was six feet tall (1.83 m) by the time he was 12, and he stopped growing only at 6&#39;5&quot; (1.96 m). Later, he would often make self-ironic jokes about his own towering stature, &quot;...the form-master wouldn&#39;t say &#39;Meet under the clock tower,&#39; or &#39;Meet under the War Memorial,&#39; but &#39;Meet under Adams.&#39;&quot;<p>On the strength of a bravura essay on religious poetry that mixed the <a href="../../wp/t/The_Beatles.htm" title="Beatles">Beatles</a> with <!--del_lnk--> William Blake, he was awarded a place at <!--del_lnk--> St John&#39;s College, <a href="../../wp/u/University_of_Cambridge.htm" title="University of Cambridge">Cambridge</a> to read English, entering in 1971. Adams attempted early on to get into the <!--del_lnk--> Footlights Dramatic Club, with which several other names in British Comedy had been affiliated. He was, however, turned down, and started to write and perform in revues with Will Adams (no relation) and <!--del_lnk--> Martin Smith, forming a group called &quot;Adams-Smith-Adams.&quot; Later, on another attempt to join Footlights, Adams was encouraged by <!--del_lnk--> Simon Jones and found himself working with Rhys Jones, among others. In 1974, Adams graduated with a B.A. in <!--del_lnk--> English literature.<p>Some of his early work appeared on <!--del_lnk--> BBC2 (television) in 1974, in an edited version of the <i>Footlights Revue</i> from Cambridge, that year. A version of the same revue performed live in London&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> West End led to Adams being &quot;discovered&quot; by <a href="../../wp/m/Monty_Python.htm" title="Monty Python">Monty Python</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Graham Chapman. The two formed a brief writing partnership, and Adams earned a writing credit in one episode (episode 45: &quot;Party Political Broadcast on Behalf of the Liberal Party&quot;) of <i><!--del_lnk--> Monty Python&#39;s Flying Circus</i> for a sketch called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Patient Abuse.&quot; In the sketch, a man who had been stabbed by a nurse arrives at his doctor&#39;s office bleeding profusely from the stomach, when the doctor makes him fill out numerous senseless forms before he can administer treatment (a joke he later incorporated into the <!--del_lnk--> Vogons&#39; obsession with paperwork). Adams also contributed to a sketch on the album for <i><!--del_lnk--> Monty Python and the Holy Grail</i>.<p>Douglas also had two &quot;blink and you miss them&quot; appearances in the fourth series of <i>Monty Python&#39;s Flying Circus</i>. At the beginning of Episode 42, &quot;The Light Entertainment War,&quot; Adams is in a surgeon&#39;s mask (as Dr. Emile Koning, according to the on-screen captions), pulling on gloves, while <!--del_lnk--> Michael Palin narrates a sketch that introduces one person after another, and never actually gets started. At the beginning of Episode 44, &quot;Mr Neutron,&quot; Adams is dressed in a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> pepperpot&quot; outfit and loads a missile onto a cart, driven by <!--del_lnk--> Terry Jones, who is calling out for scrap metal (&quot;Any old iron...&quot;). The two episodes were first broadcast in November 1974. Adams and Chapman also attempted a few non-Python projects, including <i><!--del_lnk--> Out of the Trees.</i><p>Some of Adams&#39;s early radio work included sketches for <i><!--del_lnk--> The Burkiss Way</i> in 1977 and <i><!--del_lnk--> The News Huddlines</i>. He also co-wrote, again with Graham Chapman, the <!--del_lnk--> 20 February <!--del_lnk--> 1977 episode of Doctor on the Go, a sequel to the <!--del_lnk--> Doctor in the House television comedy series.<p>As Adams had difficulty selling his jokes and stories, he took a series of &quot;odd jobs&quot; in order to have some income. A biography from an early edition of one of the <i>HHGG</i> novels provides the following description of his early career:<dl>
       <dd>After graduation he spent several years contributing material to radio and television shows as well as writing, performing, and sometimes directing <!--del_lnk--> stage revues in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, Cambridge and at the <!--del_lnk--> Edinburgh Fringe. He has also worked at various times as a hospital porter, barn builder, chicken shed cleaner, bodyguard, <!--del_lnk--> radio producer and <!--del_lnk--> script editor of <i><a href="../../wp/d/Doctor_Who.htm" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a></i>.</dl>
      <p>Adams held the job as a bodyguard in the mid-1970s. He was employed by an Arab family, which had made its fortune in oil (and were from <a href="../../wp/q/Qatar.htm" title="Qatar">Qatar</a>, according to the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>). He had a couple of favourite anecdotes about the job: one story related that the family once ordered one of everything from a hotel&#39;s menu, tried all of the dishes, and sent out for hamburgers. Another story had to do with a prostitute, sent to the floor Adams was guarding one evening. They acknowledged each other as she entered, and an hour later, when she left, she is said to have remarked, &quot;At least you can read while you&#39;re on the job.&quot;<p>In 1979, Adams and <!--del_lnk--> John Lloyd wrote the scripts for two half-hour episodes of <i><!--del_lnk--> Doctor Snuggles</i>: &quot;The Remarkable Fidgety River&quot; and &quot;The Great Disappearing Mystery&quot; (episodes seven and twelve). John Lloyd was also co-author of two episodes from the original &quot;Hitchhiker&quot; radio series (Fit the Fifth and Fit the Sixth (also known as Episodes Five and Six, <i>see explanation below</i>)), as well as <i><!--del_lnk--> The Meaning of Liff</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Deeper Meaning of Liff</i>. Lloyd and Adams also collaborated on an SF movie comedy project based on <i><!--del_lnk--> The Guinness Book of World Records</i>, which would have starred <!--del_lnk--> John Cleese as the UN Secretary General, and had a race of aliens beating humans in athletic competitions, but the humans winning in all of the &quot;absurd&quot; record categories. This latter project never proceeded past a treatment.<p>After the first radio series of <i>The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide</i> became successful, Adams was made a BBC radio producer, working on <i><!--del_lnk--> Week Ending</i> and a pantomime called <i><!--del_lnk--> Black Cinderella Two Goes East</i>. He left the position after six months to become the script editor for <a href="../../wp/d/Doctor_Who.htm" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a>.<p><a id="The_Hitchhiker.27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy" name="The_Hitchhiker.27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"><i>The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy</i></span></h2>
      <p><i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Hitchhiker%2527s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy.htm" title="The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy">The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy</a></i> was a concept for a science-fiction comedy radio series pitched by Adams and radio producer <!--del_lnk--> Simon Brett to <!--del_lnk--> BBC Radio 4 in 1977. Adams came up with an outline for a pilot episode, as well as a few other stories (reprinted in <!--del_lnk--> Neil Gaiman&#39;s book <i><!--del_lnk--> Don&#39;t Panic: The Official Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy Companion</i>) that could potentially be used in the series.<p>According to Adams, the idea for the title <i>The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy</i> occurred to him while he lay drunk in a field in <!--del_lnk--> Innsbruck, Austria (though he joked that the <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a> would instead claim it was Spain &quot;probably because it&#39;s easier to spell&quot;), gazing at the stars. He had been wandering the countryside while carrying a book called the <i><!--del_lnk--> Hitch-hiker&#39;s Guide to Europe</i> when he ran into a town where, as he humourously describes, everyone was either &quot;deaf&quot; and &quot;dumb&quot; or only spoke languages he could not. After wandering around and drinking for a while, he went to sleep in the middle of a field and was inspired by his inability to communicate with the townspeople. He later said that due to his constantly retelling this story of inspiration, he no longer had any memory of the moment of inspiration itself, and only remembered his retellings of that moment. A postscript to M. J. Simpson&#39;s biography of Adams, <i>Hitchhiker</i>, provides evidence that the story was in fact a fabrication and that Adams had conceived the idea some time <i>after</i> his trip around Europe.<p>Despite the original outline, Adams was said to make up the stories as he wrote. He turned to <!--del_lnk--> John Lloyd for help with the final two episodes of <!--del_lnk--> the first series. Lloyd contributed bits from an unpublished science fiction book of his own, called <i>GiGax</i>. However, very little of Lloyd&#39;s material survived in later adaptations of <i>Hitchhiker&#39;s</i>, such as the novels and the TV series. The TV series itself was based on the first six radio episodes, but sections contributed by Lloyd were largely re-written.<p><!--del_lnk--> BBC Radio 4 broadcast the first radio series weekly in the UK in March and April 1978. Following the success of the first series, another episode was recorded and broadcast, which was commonly known as the Christmas Episode. <!--del_lnk--> A second series of five episodes was broadcast one per night, during the week of <!--del_lnk--> 21 January - <!--del_lnk--> 25 January <!--del_lnk--> 1980.<p>While working on the radio series (and with simultaneous projects such as <i><!--del_lnk--> The Pirate Planet</i>) Adams developed problems keeping to writing deadlines that only got worse as he published novels. Adams was never a prolific writer and usually had to be forced by others to do any writing. This included being locked in a hotel suite with his editor for three weeks to ensure that <i><!--del_lnk--> So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish</i> was completed. He was quoted as saying, &quot;I love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by.&quot; Despite the difficulty with deadlines, Adams eventually authored five novels in the series, published in 1979, 1980, 1982, 1984 and 1992.<p>The books formed the basis for other adaptations, such as three-part comic book adaptations for each of the first three books, an interactive text-adventure <!--del_lnk--> computer game, and a photo-illustrated edition, published in 1994. This latter edition featured a <!--del_lnk--> 42 Puzzle designed by Adams, which was later incorporated into paperback covers of the first four &quot;Hitchhiker&#39;s&quot; novels (the paperback for the fifth re-used the artwork from the hardcover edition). Adams also began attempts to turn the first <i>Hitchhiker&#39;s</i> novel into a movie in 1980, making several trips to <a href="../../wp/l/Los_Angeles%252C_California.htm" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles, California</a>, and working with a number of Hollywood studios and potential producers. When he died in 2001 in California, he had been trying again to get the movie project started with Disney, which had bought the rights in 1998. The screenplay finally got a posthumous re-write by <!--del_lnk--> Karey Kirkpatrick, was green-lit in September 2003, and <!--del_lnk--> the resulting movie was released in 2005.<p>Radio Producer <!--del_lnk--> Dirk Maggs had consulted with Adams, first in 1993, and later in 1997 and 2000 about creating a third radio series, based on the third novel in the <i>Hitchhiker&#39;s</i> series. They also vaguely discussed the possibilities of radio adaptations of the final two novels in the five-book &quot;trilogy.&quot; As with the movie, this project was only realized after Adams&#39;s death. The third series, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Tertiary Phase</i>, was broadcast on <!--del_lnk--> BBC Radio 4 in September 2004 and was subsequently released on audio CD. Douglas Adams himself can be heard playing the part of Agrajag. <i>So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish</i> and <i>Mostly Harmless</i> made up the fourth and fifth radio series, respectively (on radio they were titled <i><!--del_lnk--> The Quandary Phase</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Quintessential Phase</i>) and these were broadcast in May and June of 2005, and also subsequently released on Audio CD. The last episode in the last series (with a new, &quot;more upbeat&quot; ending) concluded with, &quot;The very final episode of <i>The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy</i> by Douglas Adams is affectionately dedicated to its author.&quot;<p>More recently, the film makers at Smoov Filmz adapted the anecdote that <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Dent relates about biscuits in <i><!--del_lnk--> So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish</i> into a short film called &quot;Cookies.&quot; Adams also discussed the real-life episode that inspired the anecdote in a 2001 speech, reprinted in his posthumous collection <i><!--del_lnk--> The Salmon of Doubt</i>. He also told the story on the radio programme <i>It Makes Me Laugh</i> on 19 July 1981.<p><a id="Doctor_Who" name="Doctor_Who"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Doctor Who</i></span></h2>
      <p>Adams sent the script for the HHGG pilot radio programme to the <i><a href="../../wp/d/Doctor_Who.htm" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a></i> production office in 1978, and was commissioned to write <i><!--del_lnk--> The Pirate Planet</i> (see below). He had also previously attempted to submit a potential movie script, called &quot;Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen,&quot; which later became his novel <i>Life, the Universe, and Everything</i> (which in turn became the third <i>Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide</i> radio series). Adams then went on to serve as script editor on the show for its seventeenth season in 1979. Altogether, he wrote three <!--del_lnk--> <i>Doctor Who</i> serials starring <!--del_lnk--> Tom Baker as the Doctor:<ul>
       <li><i>The Pirate Planet</i> (the second serial in the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Key To Time&quot; arc, in <!--del_lnk--> Season 16)<li><i><!--del_lnk--> City of Death</i> (with producer <!--del_lnk--> Graham Williams, from an original storyline by writer <!--del_lnk--> David Fisher. It was transmitted under the pseudonym &quot;<!--del_lnk--> David Agnew&quot;)<li><i><!--del_lnk--> Shada</i> (only partially filmed and not broadcast due to industrial disputes)</ul>
      <p>Adams was also known to allow <!--del_lnk--> in-jokes from <i>The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide</i> to appear in the <i>Doctor Who</i> stories he wrote and other stories on which he served as Script Editor. Subsequent writers have also inserted <i>Hitchhiker&#39;s</i> references, even as recently as 2005. Conversely, at least one reference to <i>Doctor Who</i> was worked into a <i>Hitchhiker&#39;s</i> novel. In <i><!--del_lnk--> Life, the Universe and Everything</i>, two characters travel in time and land on the pitch at <!--del_lnk--> Lord&#39;s Cricket Ground. The reaction of the radio commentators to their sudden appearance is very similar to the reactions of commentators in a scene in the eighth episode of the 1965-66 story <i><!--del_lnk--> The Daleks&#39; Master Plan</i>, which has <!--del_lnk--> the Doctor&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> TARDIS <!--del_lnk--> materialise on the pitch at Lord&#39;s.<p>Elements of <i>Shada</i> and <i>City of Death</i> were reused in Adams&#39;s later novel <i><!--del_lnk--> Dirk Gently&#39;s Holistic Detective Agency</i>, in particular the character of <!--del_lnk--> Professor Chronotis, and Dirk Gently himself clearly fills much the same plot role as the Doctor (though the character is very different). <!--del_lnk--> Big Finish Productions eventually remade <i>Shada</i> as an audio play starring <!--del_lnk--> Paul McGann as the Doctor. Accompanied by partially animated illustrations, it was <!--del_lnk--> webcast on the <!--del_lnk--> BBCi website in 2003, and subsequently released as a two-CD set later that year. An omnibus edition of this version was broadcast on the digital radio station <!--del_lnk--> BBC7 on <!--del_lnk--> 10 December <!--del_lnk--> 2005.<p>Adams is credited with introducing a fan and later friend of his, the zoologist <!--del_lnk--> Richard Dawkins, to Dawkins&#39; future wife, <!--del_lnk--> Lalla Ward, who had played the part of <!--del_lnk--> Romana in Doctor Who. Dawkins confirmed this in his published eulogy of Adams.<p>When he was at school, he wrote and performed a play called <i>Doctor Which</i>.<p><a id="Music" name="Music"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Music</span></h2>
      <p>Adams played the <a href="../../wp/g/Guitar.htm" title="Guitar">guitar</a> left-handed and had a collection of twenty-four left-handed guitars when he died in 2001 (having received his first guitar in 1964). He also studied <a href="../../wp/p/Piano.htm" title="Piano">piano</a> in the 1960s with the same teacher as <!--del_lnk--> Paul Wickens, the pianist who later played in <a href="../../wp/p/Paul_McCartney.htm" title="Paul McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>&#39;s band (and composed the music for the 2004-2005 editions of the <i>Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide</i> radio series). <a href="../../wp/t/The_Beatles.htm" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Pink Floyd and <!--del_lnk--> Procol Harum all had great influence on Adams&#39;s work.<p><a id="Pink_Floyd" name="Pink_Floyd"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Pink Floyd</span></h3>
      <p>Adams included a direct reference to <!--del_lnk--> Pink Floyd in the original radio version of <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Hitchhiker%2527s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy.htm" title="The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy">The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy</a></i>, in which he describes the main characters surveying the landscape of an alien planet while Marvin, their android companion, hums Pink Floyd&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Shine on You Crazy Diamond&quot;. See also <!--del_lnk--> Pink Floyd trivia or <!--del_lnk--> Hitchhiker&#39;s radio series trivia.<p>Adams&#39;s official biography shares its name with the song &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Wish You Were Here&quot; by <!--del_lnk--> Pink Floyd. Adams was friendly with their guitarist <!--del_lnk--> David Gilmour and, on the occasion of his 42nd birthday (the number 42 having especial significance, being <!--del_lnk--> The Answer to Life, the Universe and Everything and also Adams&#39; age when his daughter Polly was born), was invited to make a guest appearance at their <!--del_lnk--> October 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1994 concert at Earls Court in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, playing <!--del_lnk--> rhythm guitar on the songs &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Brain Damage&quot; and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Eclipse&quot;. Adams chose the name for Pink Floyd&#39;s 1994 album, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Division Bell</i> by picking the words from the lyrics to one of its tracks, namely &quot;High Hopes&quot;. Gilmour also performed at Adams&#39;s Memorial Service.<p>Pink Floyd and their lavish stage shows were also the inspiration for the Adams-created fictional <!--del_lnk--> rock band &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Disaster Area&quot;, described in the <i>Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide</i> as not only the loudest rock band in the galaxy, but in fact the loudest noise of any kind at all. One element of Disaster Area&#39;s stage show was to send a space ship hurtling into a sun, probably inspired by the plane that would crash into the stage during some of Pink Floyd&#39;s live shows, usually at the end of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> On the Run&quot;. The 1968 Pink Floyd song &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun&quot; may also have influenced part of the ideas behind Disaster Area.<p><a id="Procol_Harum" name="Procol_Harum"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Procol Harum</span></h3>
      <p>Douglas Adams was a good friend of <!--del_lnk--> Gary Brooker, the lead singer, pianist and songwriter of the <!--del_lnk--> progressive rock band <!--del_lnk--> Procol Harum. Adams is known to have invited Brooker to one of the many parties that Adams held at his house. On one such occasion Gary Brooker performed the full (4 verse) version of his hit song &quot;&#39;<!--del_lnk--> A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot;. Brooker also performed at Adams&#39;s Memorial Service.<p>Adams also appeared on stage with Brooker to perform &quot;In Held Twas in I&quot; at Redhill when the band&#39;s lyricist <!--del_lnk--> Keith Reid was not available. On several other occasions he had been known to introduce Procol Harum at their gigs.<p>Adams also let it be known that while writing he would listen to music, and this would occasionally influence his work. On one occasion the title track from the Procol Harum album <i><!--del_lnk--> Grand Hotel</i> was playing when...<table align="center" style="border-collapse:collapse;border-style:none;background-color:transparent;max-width:40em;width:80%;">

      <p>Adams made a number of references to music and musicians who had influenced his work through his books. In the <i>Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide</i> series, examples include one of the two mice, in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy</i>, suggesting that as they have not found the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything, they should instead make it up, proposing to use the question &quot;How many roads must a man walk down?&quot; This is a line from <a href="../../wp/b/Bob_Dylan.htm" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>&#39;s song, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Blowin&#39; in the Wind&quot;. Prior to this scene, in the same novel, the ship&#39;s computer onboard the <!--del_lnk--> Heart of Gold, unable to assist or prevent the ship&#39;s impending destruction with two nuclear missiles closing in on it, sings &quot;<!--del_lnk--> You&#39;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; in the background, a <!--del_lnk--> Rodgers and Hammerstein hit from the musical <i><!--del_lnk--> Carousel</i> which had been an early 1960s rock hit in the UK and then was adopted as a crowd chant by many <a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Football (soccer)">football</a> fans, in particular <a href="../../wp/l/Liverpool_F.C..htm" title="Liverpool F.C.">Liverpool</a> supporters.<p><i><!--del_lnk--> The Restaurant at the End of the Universe</i>, the second novel in the series, is dedicated to the 1980 Paul Simon soundtrack album, <i><!--del_lnk--> One-Trick Pony</i>. Adams says he played it &quot;incessantly&quot; while writing the book. In one scene in the fourth novel, <i><!--del_lnk--> So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish</i>, Arthur Dent listens to a <!--del_lnk--> Dire Straits LP and Adams goes on to pay tribute to their lead guitarist, <!--del_lnk--> Mark Knopfler. Adams later revealed that the particular song to which he refers in the book &mdash; although never by name &mdash; is &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;, from the <i><!--del_lnk--> Making Movies</i> album. And in the final novel, <i><!--del_lnk--> Mostly Harmless</i>, <a href="../../wp/e/Elvis_Presley.htm" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis</a> is discovered playing in a diner attended by <!--del_lnk--> Ford Prefect and <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Dent, where he is simply known as &quot;The King&quot;.<p>Besides modern rock music, Douglas Adams was a great admirer of the work of <!--del_lnk--> JS Bach, which provides a minor plot element in <i>Dirk Gently&#39;s Holistic Detective Agency</i>. Adams was also good friends with <!--del_lnk--> The Monkees&#39; <!--del_lnk--> Michael Nesmith. In the early 1990s, one of the aborted attempts to have <i>The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy</i> adapted into a movie would have had Nesmith as its producer.<p>Adams was also a major fan of <a href="../../wp/t/The_Beatles.htm" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>. He makes a reference to <a href="../../wp/p/Paul_McCartney.htm" title="Paul McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> in <i>Life, The Universe, and Everything</i> and quotes lyrics and titles from songs by The Beatles in <i>Mostly Harmless</i> and <i>Dirk Gently&#39;s Holistic Detective Agency</i>. Adams also does this at least once in <i>The Salmon of Doubt</i>. In Chapter 3 there is a conversation between Kate and Dirk, which includes the following exchange:<dl>
       <dd>&quot;So?&quot;<br />
       <dd>&quot;I looked around and I noticed there wasn&#39;t a chair.&quot;</dl>
      <p>Taken together, these two lines form a quotation from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Norwegian Wood&quot; on the <i><!--del_lnk--> Rubber Soul</i> album.<p><a id="Computer_games_and_projects" name="Computer_games_and_projects"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Computer games and projects</span></h2>
      <p>Douglas Adams created an <!--del_lnk--> interactive fiction version of <i><!--del_lnk--> HHGG</i> together with <!--del_lnk--> Steve Meretzky from <!--del_lnk--> Infocom in 1984. In 1986 he participated in a weeklong brainstorming session with the <!--del_lnk--> Lucasfilm Games team for the game <i><!--del_lnk--> Labyrinth</i>. Later he was also involved in creating <i><!--del_lnk--> Bureaucracy</i> (also by Infocom, but not based on any book). Adams was also responsible for the computer game <i><!--del_lnk--> Starship Titanic</i>, which was published in 1999 by <!--del_lnk--> Simon and Schuster. Terry Jones wrote the accompanying book, entitled <i>Douglas Adams&rsquo;s Starship Titanic</i>, since Adams was too busy with the computer game to do both. In April 1999, Adams initiated the <!--del_lnk--> h2g2 <!--del_lnk--> collaborative writing project, an experimental attempt at making <i>The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy</i> a reality.<p>In 1990, Adams wrote and presented a <!--del_lnk--> television documentary programme <i><!--del_lnk--> Hyperland</i> which featured <!--del_lnk--> Tom Baker as a &quot;software agent&quot; (similar to the &quot;Assistants&quot; used in several versions of <!--del_lnk--> Microsoft Office, derived from their failed &quot;Bob&quot; program), and interviews with <!--del_lnk--> Ted Nelson, which was essentially about the use of <!--del_lnk--> hypertext. Although Adams did not <i>invent</i> hypertext, he was an <!--del_lnk--> early adopter and advocate of it. This was the same year that <a href="../../wp/t/Tim_Berners-Lee.htm" title="Tim Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> used the idea of hypertext in his <!--del_lnk--> HTML.<p><a id="The_Dirk_Gently_series" name="The_Dirk_Gently_series"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The <i>Dirk Gently</i> series</span></h2>
      <p>In between Adams&#39;s first trip to Madagascar with <!--del_lnk--> Mark Carwardine in 1985, and their series of travels that formed the basis for the radio series and non-fiction book <i><!--del_lnk--> Last Chance to See</i>, Adams wrote two other novels with a new cast of characters. <i><!--del_lnk--> Dirk Gently&#39;s Holistic Detective Agency</i> was first published in 1987, and was described by its author as &quot;a kind of ghost-horror-detective-time-travel-romantic-comedy-epic, mainly concerned with mud, music and quantum mechanics.&quot; It received many rave reviews from American newspapers upon its publication in the USA. Adams borrowed a few ideas from two <i><a href="../../wp/d/Doctor_Who.htm" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a></i> stories he had worked on: <i><!--del_lnk--> City of Death</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Shada</i>.<p>A sequel novel, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul</i> was published a year later. This was an entirely original work, Adams&#39;s first since <i>So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish.</i> Reviewers, however, were not as generous with praise for the second volume as they had been for the first. After the obligatory book tours, Adams was off on his round-the-world excursion which supplied him with the material for <i>Last Chance to See</i>.<p><a id="Personal_beliefs" name="Personal_beliefs"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Personal beliefs</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Religion" name="Religion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h3>
      <p>Adams was a self-declared &quot;radical <!--del_lnk--> atheist&quot;, though he used the term for emphasis, so that he would not be asked if he in fact meant <!--del_lnk--> agnostic. He stated in an interview with <!--del_lnk--> American Atheists that this made things easier, but most importantly that it conveyed the fact that he really meant it, had thought about it a great deal, and that it was an opinion he held seriously. He was convinced that there is no <a href="../../wp/g/God.htm" title="God">God</a>, having never seen one shred of <!--del_lnk--> evidence to convince him otherwise, and devoted himself instead to secular causes such as <!--del_lnk--> environmentalism. Despite this, he did state in the same interview that he was &quot;fascinated by religion.&quot; [...] &quot;I love to keep poking and prodding at it. I&rsquo;ve thought about it so much over the years that that fascination is bound to spill over into my writing.&quot; His fascination he ascribed to the fact that so many &quot;otherwise rational... intelligent people... nevertheless take it [the existence of God] seriously&quot;.<p>In <i><!--del_lnk--> The God Delusion</i>, the evolutionary biologist and atheist <!--del_lnk--> Richard Dawkins repeatedly claims Adams as one of his &#39;converts&#39; to atheism. Dawkins dedicated the book to Adams&#39; memory.<p>One analogy that Adams put forward on the subject of religion was that of the &quot;sentient <!--del_lnk--> puddle&quot;. This analogy is intended to refute the suggestion that the existence of God and His love for mankind would be proven by the fact that the world is perfectly designed for our needs. He compared such thinkers to an intelligent puddle of water. He said the puddle is pleased with itself and certain that the hole in the ground it occupies must have been designed specifically for it since it fits so well in it. The puddle looks up to the sun above and worships its divine benefactor. The fate of the puddle is to exist under the sun until it has entirely evaporated.<p><a id="Environmental_activism" name="Environmental_activism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Environmental activism</span></h3>
      <p>Adams was also an <!--del_lnk--> environmental activist who campaigned on behalf of a number of <!--del_lnk--> endangered species. This activism included the production of the non-fiction radio series <i><!--del_lnk--> Last Chance to See</i>, in which he and <!--del_lnk--> naturalist <!--del_lnk--> Mark Carwardine visited rare species such as the <a href="../../wp/k/Kakapo.htm" title="Kakapo">Kakapo</a>, and the publication of a tie-in book of the same name. In 1992, this was made into a CD-ROM combination of <!--del_lnk--> audio book, <!--del_lnk--> e-book and picture slide show years before such things became fashionable.<p>Adams and Mark Carwardine contributed the &#39;Meeting a Gorilla&#39; passage from <i><!--del_lnk--> Last Chance to See</i> to the book <i><!--del_lnk--> The Great Ape Project</i>. This book, edited by <!--del_lnk--> Paola Cavalieri and <!--del_lnk--> Peter Singer launched a wider-scale project in 1993, which calls for the extension of moral equality to include all great apes, human or nonhuman.<p>In 1994 he climbed <a href="../../wp/m/Mount_Kilimanjaro.htm" title="Mount Kilimanjaro">Mount Kilimanjaro</a> while wearing a rhino suit for the British charity organization <i><!--del_lnk--> Save the Rhino</i>. About &pound;100,000 were raised through that event, benefiting schools in <a href="../../wp/k/Kenya.htm" title="Kenya">Kenya</a> and a <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Rhinoceros.htm" title="Black Rhinoceros">Black Rhinoceros</a> preservation programme in <a href="../../wp/t/Tanzania.htm" title="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>. Adams was also an active supporter of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund</i>.<p>Since 2003, <i><!--del_lnk--> Save the Rhino</i> has held an annual Douglas Adams Memorial Lecture around the time of his birthday to raise money for environmental campaigns. The lectures in the series are:<ul>

      <p><a id="Technology" name="Technology"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Technology</span></h3>
      <p>Adams was a serious fan of technology. Though he did not buy his first <!--del_lnk--> word processor until 1982, he had considered one as early as 1979. He was quoted as saying that until 1982, he had difficulties with &quot;the impenetrable barrier of jargon. Words were flying backwards and forwards without concepts riding on their backs.&quot; In 1982, his first purchase was a &#39;Nexus&#39;. In 1983, when he and Jane Belson went out to Los Angeles, he bought a <!--del_lnk--> DEC <!--del_lnk--> Rainbow. Upon their return to England, Adams bought an <!--del_lnk--> Apricot, then a <!--del_lnk--> BBC Micro and a <!--del_lnk--> Tandy 100. In <i><!--del_lnk--> Last Chance to See</i> Adams mentions his <!--del_lnk--> Cambridge Z88, which he had taken to <!--del_lnk--> Zaire on a quest to find the Northern White Rhinoceros.<p>Adams&#39;s posthumously published work, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Salmon of Doubt</i>, features multiple articles written by Douglas on the subject of technology, including reprints of articles that originally ran in <i>MacUser</i> magazine, and in <i>The Independent on Sunday</i> newspaper. In these, Adams claims that one of the first computers he ever saw was a <!--del_lnk--> Commodore PET, and that his love affair with the <a href="../../wp/m/Macintosh.htm" title="Apple Macintosh">Apple Macintosh</a> first began after seeing one at Infocom&#39;s headquarters in Massachusetts in 1983 (though that was actually very likely an <!--del_lnk--> Apple Lisa).<p>Adams was a Macintosh user from the time they first came out in 1984 until his death in 2001. He was the second person to buy a Mac in the UK (the first being <!--del_lnk--> Stephen Fry - though some accounts differ on this, saying Adams bought the first two, and Fry bought the third). Adams was also an &quot;Apple Master,&quot; one of several celebrities whom Apple made into spokespeople for its products (other Apple Masters included <!--del_lnk--> John Cleese and <!--del_lnk--> Gregory Hines). Adams&#39;s contributions included a rock video that he created using the first version of <!--del_lnk--> iMovie with footage featuring his daughter Polly. The video can still be seen on Adams&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> .Mac homepage. Adams even installed and started using the first release of <!--del_lnk--> Mac OS X in the weeks leading up to his death. His very last post to his own forum was in praise of Mac OS X and the possibilities of its <!--del_lnk--> Cocoa programming framework. Adams can also be seen in the <i>Omnibus</i> tribute included with the Region One/NTSC DVD release of the TV adaptation of <i>The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide</i> using Mac OS X (version 10.0.x) on his <!--del_lnk--> PowerBook G3.<p>Adams used e-mail extensively from the technology&#39;s infancy, adopting a very early version of e-mail to correspond with <!--del_lnk--> Steve Meretzky during the pair&#39;s collaboration on Infocom&#39;s version of <i><!--del_lnk--> The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy</i>. While living in New Mexico in 1993 he set up another e-mail address and began posting to his own <!--del_lnk--> USENET newsgroup, alt.fan.douglas-adams, and occasionally, when his computer was acting up, to the comp.sys.mac hierarchy. Many of his posts are now archived through <a href="../../wp/g/Google.htm" title="Google">Google</a>. Challenges to the authenticity of his messages later led Adams to set up a message forum on his own website to avoid the issue.<p><a id="Personal_life" name="Personal_life"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Personal life</span></h2>
      <p>In the early 1980s, Adams had an affair with married novelist <!--del_lnk--> Sally Emerson, to whom he dedicated his book <i><!--del_lnk--> Life, the Universe, and Everything</i>. Emerson returned to her husband after splitting with Adams in 1981, and Adams was soon afterward introduced by friends to Jane Belson, with whom he later became romantically involved. Belson was the &quot;lady barrister&quot; mentioned in the jacket-flap biography printed in his books during the mid-1980s (&quot;He [Adams] lives in Islington with a lady barrister and an Apple Macintosh&quot;). The two lived in Los Angeles together during 1983 while Adams worked on an early screenplay adaptation of <i>Hitchhiker&#39;s</i>. When the deal fell through, they moved to London, and after several separations (&quot;He is currently not certain where he lives, or with whom&quot;) and an aborted engagement, they were married on <!--del_lnk--> 25 November <!--del_lnk--> 1991. Adams and Belson had one daughter together, Polly Jane Rocket Adams, born on <!--del_lnk--> 22 June <!--del_lnk--> 1994, in the year that Adams turned <!--del_lnk--> 42. In 1999, the family moved from London to <!--del_lnk--> Santa Barbara, California, where they lived until Adams&#39;s death. Following his funeral, Jane Belson and Polly Adams returned to London, where they currently reside.<p><a id="Death" name="Death"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Death</span></h2>
      <p>Adams died of a <a href="../../wp/m/Myocardial_infarction.htm" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a> at the age of 49 on Friday <!--del_lnk--> 11 May <!--del_lnk--> 2001, while working out at a private <!--del_lnk--> gym in <!--del_lnk--> Montecito, California. He suffered a narrowing of the coronary arteries which led to a <a href="../../wp/m/Myocardial_infarction.htm" title="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</a> and a fatal <!--del_lnk--> cardiac arrhythmia. He was survived by his wife Jane and daughter Polly. His funeral was held on <!--del_lnk--> 16 May <!--del_lnk--> 2001 in Santa Barbara, California. Several friends and people he had worked with were in attendance. His ashes were placed in <!--del_lnk--> Highgate Cemetery in north <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> that June.<p>A memorial service was held on <!--del_lnk--> 17 September <!--del_lnk--> 2001 at St. Martin-in-the-Fields Church, Trafalgar Square, London. This became the first church service of any kind broadcast live on the web by the BBC. Video clips of the service are still available on the BBC&#39;s website for download.<p>In May 2002, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Salmon of Doubt</i> was published, containing many <!--del_lnk--> short stories, <!--del_lnk--> essays, and letters, as well as <!--del_lnk--> eulogies from <!--del_lnk--> Richard Dawkins, <!--del_lnk--> Stephen Fry (in the UK edition), <!--del_lnk--> Christopher Cerf (in the U.S. edition), and <!--del_lnk--> Terry Jones (in the U.S. paperback edition).
