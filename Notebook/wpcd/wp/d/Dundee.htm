It is located on the north bank of the <!--del_lnk--> River Tay&#39;s estuary and so is near the east coast and the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea.htm" title="North Sea">North Sea</a>. Dundee is known as the <i>City of Discovery</i>, both in honour of Dundee&#39;s history of scientific activities, and of the <!--del_lnk--> RRS <i>Discovery</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Robert Falcon Scott&#39;s <a href="../../wp/a/Antarctica.htm" title="Antarctica">Antarctic</a> exploration vessel, which was built in Dundee and is now berthed there.<p>Its history began with the <a href="../../wp/p/Picts.htm" title="Picts">Picts</a> in the <a href="../../wp/i/Iron_Age.htm" title="Iron Age">Iron Age</a> and during the medieval period was the site of many battles. During the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> the local <!--del_lnk--> jute industry caused the city to grow rapidly. In this period Dundee also gained a reputation for its marmalade industry and its journalism, giving Dundee its epithet as the city of &quot;jam, jute and journalism&quot;. Dundee&#39;s population reached a peak of nearly 200,000 at the start of the 1970s, but it has since declined due to outward migration and a falling birth rate.<p>The biomedical and technology industries have grown since the 1980s and the city now accounts for 10% of Britain&rsquo;s digital entertainment industry. The city is also famous for being the home of <!--del_lnk--> William McGonagall, who is widely known as the &quot;world&#39;s worst poet&quot;. The city is home to the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Dance Theatre, who are based in the city&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Dundee Repertory Theatre, and the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Scottish National Orchestra, which regularly plays in the city&#39;s Caird Hall. On <!--del_lnk--> 5 March <!--del_lnk--> 2004 Dundee was granted <!--del_lnk--> Fairtrade City status.<p>

      <p>Dundee first became a settlement when the <a href="../../wp/p/Picts.htm" title="Picts">Picts</a> settled the area 3,500 years ago. At the time the area was known by the Pictish name of <b>Alec-tum</b>. The name &quot;Dundee&quot; was later adopted from the <a href="../../wp/s/Scottish_Gaelic_language.htm" title="Scottish Gaelic language">Gaelic</a> D&ugrave;n D&egrave;agh, meaning &quot;Fort on the Tay&quot;. In 1191 <!--del_lnk--> CE, the town was awarded a <!--del_lnk--> charter making it a <!--del_lnk--> royal burgh. This charter was later revoked by <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_I_of_England.htm" title="Edward I of England">Edward I</a>, though it was replaced by a new charter from <!--del_lnk--> Robert the Bruce in 1327. Dundee became a walled city in 1545, owing to a period of hostilities known as the <!--del_lnk--> rough wooing. In July 1547, much of the city was destroyed by an English naval bombardment. In 1645, during the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish civil war, Dundee was again besieged, this time by the Royalist <!--del_lnk--> Marquess of Montrose. In 1651 during the <!--del_lnk--> Third English Civil War, it was invaded by <!--del_lnk--> General Monck, who was the commander of <a href="../../wp/o/Oliver_Cromwell.htm" title="Oliver Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell&#39;s</a> forces in Scotland. These <!--del_lnk--> English Parliamentarians destroyed much of the city and killed many of its inhabitants. Dundee was later the site of an early <!--del_lnk--> Jacobite uprising when <!--del_lnk--> John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee raised the <!--del_lnk--> Stuart standard on <!--del_lnk--> Dundee Law in support of <a href="../../wp/j/James_II_of_England.htm" title="James II of England">James VII (James II of England)</a> following his overthrow, earning him the nickname <!--del_lnk--> Bonnie Dundee.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Dundee greatly expanded in size during the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> mainly because of the <!--del_lnk--> jute industry. By the end of the 19th century, a majority of the city&#39;s workers were employed in its many jute mills and in related industries. Dundee&#39;s location on a major estuary allowed for the easy importation of jute from the <!--del_lnk--> Indian subcontinent and of <!--del_lnk--> whale oil &mdash; needed for the processing of the jute &mdash; from the city&#39;s large <!--del_lnk--> whaling industry. The industry began to decline in the 20th century as it became cheaper to process the cloth on the Indian subcontinent. The city&#39;s last jute mill closed in the 1970s.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In addition to jute the city is also known for <!--del_lnk--> jam and <!--del_lnk--> journalism. The &quot;jam&quot; association refers to <!--del_lnk--> marmalade, which was purportedly invented in the city by <!--del_lnk--> Janet Keiller in 1797 (although in reality, recipes for marmalade have been found dating back to the 1500s). <!--del_lnk--> Keiller&#39;s marmalade became a famous brand because of its mass production and its worldwide export. However, the industry was never a major employer compared with the jute trade. Marmalade has since become the preserve of larger businesses, but jars of Keiller&#39;s marmalade are still widely available. &quot;Journalism&quot; refers to the publishing firm <!--del_lnk--> DC Thomson &amp; Co., which was founded in the city in 1905 and remains the largest employer after the health and leisure industries. The firm publishes a <!--del_lnk--> variety of newspapers, children&#39;s comics and magazines, including <i><!--del_lnk--> The Sunday Post</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Courier</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Shout</i> and children&#39;s publications, <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Beano.htm" title="The Beano">The Beano</a></i> and <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Dandy.htm" title="The Dandy">The Dandy</a></i>.<p>Dundee also developed a major maritime and shipbuilding industry in the 19th Century. 2,000 ships were built in Dundee between 1871 and 1881, including the Antarctic research ship used by <!--del_lnk--> Robert Falcon Scott, the <i><!--del_lnk--> RRS Discovery</i>. This ship is now on display at Discovery Point in the city, and the Victorian steel-framed works in which Discovery&#39;s engine was built is now home to the city&#39;s largest bookstore. The need of the local jute industry for <!--del_lnk--> whale oil also supported a large <!--del_lnk--> whaling industry. <!--del_lnk--> Dundee Island in the Antarctic takes its name from the <!--del_lnk--> Dundee whaling expedition, which discovered it in 1892. Whaling ceased in 1912 and shipbuilding ceased in 1981. The estuary was the location of the first <a href="../../wp/t/Tay_Rail_Bridge.htm" title="Tay Rail Bridge">Tay rail bridge</a>, built by <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Bouch and opened in 1879. At the time it was the longest railway bridge in the world. The bridge fell down in a storm less than a year later under the weight of a train full of passengers in what is known as <i><!--del_lnk--> The Tay Bridge Disaster</i>.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

The city surrounds the <!--del_lnk--> basalt <!--del_lnk--> plug of an extinct <a href="../../wp/v/Volcano.htm" title="Volcano">volcano</a>, called <!--del_lnk--> Dundee Law or simply <i>The Law</i> (174&nbsp;metres (571&nbsp;ft)). Dundee is Scotland&#39;s only south-facing city, giving it a contested claim to being the nation&#39;s sunniest city.<p>Dundee lies close to <!--del_lnk--> Perth (20&nbsp;miles) and the southern <a href="../../wp/s/Scottish_Highlands.htm" title="Scottish Highlands">Highlands</a> to the west. <!--del_lnk--> St Andrews (14&nbsp;miles) and north-east <!--del_lnk--> Fife are situated to the south, while the <!--del_lnk--> Sidlaw Hills, <!--del_lnk--> Angus Glens and the <!--del_lnk--> Glamis Castle are located to the north. Two <!--del_lnk--> links <!--del_lnk--> golf courses, <!--del_lnk--> St Andrews and <!--del_lnk--> Carnoustie are located nearby. The towns of <!--del_lnk--> Invergowrie in <!--del_lnk--> Perth and Kinross, <!--del_lnk--> Newport on Tay in <!--del_lnk--> Fife and <!--del_lnk--> Monifieth in <!--del_lnk--> Angus are outside of local government control of Dundee but are <i><!--del_lnk--> de facto</i> suburbs of the city, taking its population up to c.170,000.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>
      <p>Natives of Dundee are called Dundonians and are recognisable for their distinctive <!--del_lnk--> accent, which most noticeably substitutes the <!--del_lnk--> monophthong /e/ in place of the <!--del_lnk--> diphthong /ai/. A significant proportion of the population are on low income or receive <!--del_lnk--> social security benefits. More than half of the city&#39;s council <!--del_lnk--> wards are among Scotland&#39;s most deprived and fewer than half of the homes in Dundee are owner-occupied. The <!--del_lnk--> Whitfield area in particular has the highest rate of <!--del_lnk--> child poverty in the <!--del_lnk--> UK at 96%. Dundee had the highest rate of <!--del_lnk--> abortions in Scotland in <!--del_lnk--> 2004 (24.2 per 1000) and the highest rate of <!--del_lnk--> teenage pregnancy in <!--del_lnk--> Western Europe in 2003-2004 (1 in 16; the national average is 1 in 23).<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Dundee&#39;s population increased substantially with the urbanisation of the Industrial Revolution as did other British cities. The most significant influx occurred in the mid-1800s with the arrival of <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Irish</a> workers fleeing from the <!--del_lnk--> Potato Famine and attracted by industrialisation. The city also attracted immigrants from <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Poland</a> in the 19th and 20th Centuries, although Dundee did not experience post-<a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> immigration on the same scale as other cities. Nevertheless, Dundee still has a sizable <!--del_lnk--> ethnic minority population. The city&#39;s declining industrial base has caused the population to reduce since the start of the 1970s. A 7.3% drop in population occurred between 1991 to 2001 and a decline of further 14.3% (20,674) is predicted from 2005 to 2011. The number of deaths has exceeded the number of births since 1993, with a drop of 19% in births between 1993 and 2003. There has also been an annual net average emigration of 1,000 from 1998 to 2002. Dundee attracts a large number of students (many Irish), so that students account for 14.2% of the population, the highest proportion of the four Scottish Cities.<p><a id="Places_of_worship" name="Places_of_worship"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Places of worship</span></h2>
      <p>The City Churches, <!--del_lnk--> Dundee Parish Church (St Mary&#39;s) and the <!--del_lnk--> Steeple Church, are the most prominent <!--del_lnk--> Church of Scotland buildings in Dundee. The Church of Scotland <!--del_lnk--> Presbytery of Dundee currently consists of 45 congregations, although many now share a <!--del_lnk--> minister. <!--del_lnk--> Robert Murray McCheyne, who was the minister of St Peter&#39;s (<!--del_lnk--> Free Church of Scotland) from 1838 until his death in 1843, led a significant religious revival in Dundee.

      <p>Dundee was first made a <!--del_lnk--> royal burgh in 1911 and became a <!--del_lnk--> unitary council area in 1996 under the <i><!--del_lnk--> Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994</i>, which gave it a single tier of <!--del_lnk--> local government control under the <!--del_lnk--> Dundee City Council. The city has two mottos &mdash; <i>Dei Donum</i> (<a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a>: Gift of God) and <i>Prudentia et Candore</i> (With Thought And Purity), although usually only the latter is used for civic purposes. Dundee is represented in both the <a href="../../wp/b/British_House_of_Commons.htm" title="British House of Commons">British House of Commons</a> and in the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Parliament. For elections to the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Parliament.htm" title="European Parliament">European Parliament</a>, Dundee is within the <!--del_lnk--> Scotland constituency.<p><a id="Local_government" name="Local_government"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Local government</span></h3>
      <p>Dundee is one of 32 <!--del_lnk--> council areas of Scotland, represented by the Dundee City Council, a local authority composed of 29 elected <!--del_lnk--> councillors. Previously the city was a <!--del_lnk--> county city and later a <!--del_lnk--> district of the <!--del_lnk--> Tayside <!--del_lnk--> region. Council meetings take place in the City Chambers, which opened in 1933 and are located in City Square. The civic head and chair of the council is known as the <!--del_lnk--> Lord Provost, a position similar to that of <!--del_lnk--> mayor in other cities. The council executive is based in Tayside House on the banks of the <!--del_lnk--> River Tay, but the council recently announced plans to demolish it in favour of new premises (Dundee House) on North Lindsay Street. <!--del_lnk--> As of 2006 the council is controlled by a minority coalition of <!--del_lnk--> Labour and <a href="../../wp/l/Liberal_Democrats.htm" title="Liberal Democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> of 12 councillors, with the support of the <!--del_lnk--> Conservatives who have five. Although the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish National Party (SNP) is the largest party on the council, with 11 councillors. <!--del_lnk--> Elections to the council are on a four year cycle, the next due on <!--del_lnk--> 3 May <!--del_lnk--> 2007. Councillors are elected from single-member <!--del_lnk--> wards by the <!--del_lnk--> first past the post system of election, although this will change for the 2007 election, due to the <!--del_lnk--> Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004. Eight new multi-member wards will be introduced, each electing three or four councillors by <!--del_lnk--> single transferable vote, to produce a form of <!--del_lnk--> proportional representation.<p><a id="Westminster_and_Holyrood" name="Westminster_and_Holyrood"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Westminster and Holyrood</span></h3>

      <p>Dundee is a regional employment, education and retail centre, with 300,000 persons within 30 minutes drive of the city centre and 630,000 people within one hours drive from the centre. Many people from <!--del_lnk--> North East Fife, <!--del_lnk--> Angus and <!--del_lnk--> Perth and Kinross commute to the city. In 2004-2005 the city itself had an economically active population of 77.4% of the working age population, about 17% of the working age population are full time students. The city sustains about 90,000 jobs in around 4,000 companies. The number of jobs in the city has grown by around 10% since 1996. recent and current investment levels in the city are at a record level. Since 1997 Dundee has been the focus of investment approaching an estimated &pound;1 billion.<p>Despite this economic growth the proportion of Dundee&rsquo;s population whose lives are affected by poverty and who can be described as socially excluded is second only to Glasgow in Scotland. Median weekly earnings were &pound;409 in February 2006, an increase of &pound;33% since 1998, on a par with the Scottish median. Unemployment in 2004 was around 4.3%, higher than the Scottish average of 3%, although the city has &ldquo;closed the gap&rdquo; since the 1996 when unemployment was 8.6% with the Scottish average at 6.1%. In 2000 the number of unemployed in the city had fallen to below 5,000 for the first time in over 25 years. Average house prices in Dundee have more than doubled since 1990 from an average of &pound;42,475, to &pound;102,025 in 2006. Total house sales in the city have more than trebled since 1990 from &pound;115,915,391 to &pound;376,999,716 in 2004. House prices rose by over 15% between 2001-2002 and 2002-2003 and between 2005 and 2006 prices rose by 16.6%.<p><a id="History_2" name="History_2"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h3>
      <p>The period following <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> was notable for the transformation of the city&#39;s economy. While jute still employed one-fifth of the working population, new industries were attracted and encouraged. <!--del_lnk--> NCR Corporation selected Dundee as the base of operations for the UK in late 1945, primarily because of the lack of damage the city had sustained in the war, good transport links and high productivity from long hours of sunshine. Production started in the year before the official opening of the plant on <!--del_lnk--> June 11, <!--del_lnk--> 1947. A fortnight after the 10th anniversary of the plant, the 250,000<sup>th</sup> cash machine was produced. By the 1960s, NCR had become the principal employer of the city and produced <!--del_lnk--> ATMs at several of its Dundee plants. Magnetic-strip readers for <!--del_lnk--> cash registers and computers were also built in Dundee. Astral, a Dundee-based firm that manufactured and sold <!--del_lnk--> refrigerators and <!--del_lnk--> spin dryers was merged into <!--del_lnk--> Morphy Richards and rapidly expanded to employ over 1,000 people. The development in Dundee of a <!--del_lnk--> Michelin <!--del_lnk--> tyre-production facility helped to absorb the unemployment caused by the decline of the jute industry, particularly with the abolition of the jute control by the <!--del_lnk--> Board of Trade on <!--del_lnk--> April 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1969.<p>Employment in Dundee changed dramatically during the 1980s with the loss of nearly 10,000 manufacturing jobs due to closure of the shipyards, cessation of carpet manufacturing and the disappearance of the jute trade. In 1983, the first <a href="../../wp/s/Sinclair_Research_Ltd.htm" title="Sinclair Research Ltd">Sinclair</a> <a href="../../wp/z/ZX_Spectrum.htm" title="ZX Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a> <!--del_lnk--> home computers were produced in Dundee by <!--del_lnk--> Timex. In the same year the company broke production records, despite a <!--del_lnk--> sit-in by workers protesting job cuts and plans to demolish one of the factory buildings to make way for a supermarket. Timex closed their Dundee plant in 1993 following an acrimonious six month <!--del_lnk--> industrial dispute. To combat growing unemployment and vulnerable economic conditions, Dundee was declared an <!--del_lnk--> Enterprise Zone in January 1984.<p><a id="Modern_day" name="Modern_day"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Modern day</span></h3>
      <p>As in the rest of Scotland manufacturing industries are being gradually replaced by a modern <!--del_lnk--> mixed economy, supported by public and private investment and a skilled or semi-skilled workforce, although 13.5% of the workforce still work in the manufacturing sector, higher than the Scottish and UK average, and more than double that of Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen. The main new growth sectors have been <!--del_lnk--> software development and <a href="../../wp/b/Biotechnology.htm" title="Biotechnology">biotechnology</a> along with retail. The city has a small financial, banking and insurance sector, with 11% of the workforce, smaller than the three larger Scottish cities, for example Edinburgh&rsquo;s banking and finance sector accounts for 33.3% of it&rsquo;s workforce.<p>In 2005 32 companies employed 250 or more staff these include limited and private companies <!--del_lnk--> NCR Corporation, <!--del_lnk--> Michelin, <!--del_lnk--> Tesco (although it was announced in <!--del_lnk--> March <!--del_lnk--> 2003 that they would be closing their distribution centre in the city with the loss of 450 jobs), <!--del_lnk--> D.

The <!--del_lnk--> biomedical and <a href="../../wp/b/Biotechnology.htm" title="Biotechnology">biotechnology</a> sectors, including start-up biomedical companies arising from university research, employ 1,000 people directly and nearly 2,000 indirectly. <!--del_lnk--> Information technology and <a href="../../wp/c/Computer_and_video_games.htm" title="Computer and video games">software for computer games</a> have been important industries in the city for more than twenty years. <!--del_lnk--> Rockstar North, developer of <i><!--del_lnk--> Lemmings</i> and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Grand Theft Auto</i> series was founded in Dundee as DMA Design by <!--del_lnk--> David Jones; an undergraduate of the <!--del_lnk--> University of Abertay. Dundee is responsible for 10% of Britain&rsquo;s digital entertainment industry, with an annual turnover of &pound;100 million. Outside of specialised fields of medicine, science and technology, the proportion of Dundonians employed in the <!--del_lnk--> manufacturing sector is higher than that found in the larger Scottish cities; nearly 12% of 82,000 workers. Manufacturing income per head in Dundee was &pound;19,700 in 1999, compared to &pound;16,700 in <a href="../../wp/g/Glasgow.htm" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>.
