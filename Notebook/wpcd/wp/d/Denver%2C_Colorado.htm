       <br /> The <b>City and County of Denver</b> is the most populous city, the second most populous county, and the <a href="../../wp/c/Capital.htm" title="Capital">capital</a> of the <!--del_lnk--> State of Colorado. Denver is located in the <!--del_lnk--> South Platte River Valley on the <!--del_lnk--> High Plains just east of the <!--del_lnk--> Front Range of the <a href="../../wp/r/Rocky_Mountains.htm" title="Rocky Mountains">Southern Rocky Mountains</a>. The Denver downtown district is located immediately east of the confluence of <!--del_lnk--> Cherry Creek with the <!--del_lnk--> South Platte River, approximately 15 <!--del_lnk--> miles (24 <!--del_lnk--> kilometers) east of the <!--del_lnk--> foothills of the <a href="../../wp/r/Rocky_Mountains.htm" title="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>. Denver has a <!--del_lnk--> consolidated city and county government. Residents of Denver are known as Denverites.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> United States Census Bureau estimates that in 2005 the population of the City and County of Denver was 557,917 (25th most populous U.S. city), the population of the <!--del_lnk--> Denver-Aurora Metropolitan Statistical Area was 2,359,994 (22nd most populous MSA), and the population of the Denver-Aurora-Boulder Combined Statistical Area was 2,869,377 (19th most populous CSA). Denver is the most populous city within a radius of 550 miles (885 kilometers), and the <!--del_lnk--> Denver Metropolitan Area is the most populous in the <a href="../../wp/r/Rocky_Mountains.htm" title="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountain Region</a> of <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>. The city claims to have the 10th largest downtown district in the United States.<p>Denver is nicknamed &quot;<b>The Mile-High City</b>&quot; because its official elevation, engraved on the fifteenth step of the <!--del_lnk--> state capitol building, is one <!--del_lnk--> statute mile (5280 feet or 1609 meters) above sea level. The elevation of <!--del_lnk--> Denver International Airport is 5431 feet (1655 meters).<p>Denver has also been known historically as the <b>Queen City of the Plains</b> because of its important role in the agricultural industry of the plains regions along the foothills of the <!--del_lnk--> Front Range. Other nicknames that Denver has had include <b>The Rail City</b>, for the city&#39;s importance as a North American rail hub, and <b>Capital of the Rocky Mountain Empire</b>, for the city&#39;s preeminence in the Rocky Mountain region. Several <!--del_lnk--> US Navy ships have been named <!--del_lnk--> USS <i>Denver</i> in honour of the city.<p>

      <p>Denver was founded in the <!--del_lnk--> Kansas Territory in 1858. That summer a group from <!--del_lnk--> Lawrence, Kansas, arrived and established <!--del_lnk--> Montana City on the banks of the <!--del_lnk--> South Platte River. This was the first settlement in what was later to become the city of Denver. The site faded quickly, however, and was abandoned in favour of <!--del_lnk--> Auraria and St. Charles City by the summer of 1859. The site is now <!--del_lnk--> Grant-Frontier Park and includes mining equipment and a log cabin replica.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> November 22, <!--del_lnk--> 1858, <!--del_lnk--> General William Larimer, a land speculator from eastern <!--del_lnk--> Kansas, placed <!--del_lnk--> cottonwood logs to stake a claim on the hill overlooking the confluence of the <!--del_lnk--> South Platte River and <!--del_lnk--> Cherry Creek, across the creek from the existing mining settlement of <!--del_lnk--> Auraria. Larimar named the townsite Denver City in honour of Kansas Territorial Governor <!--del_lnk--> James W. Denver. Larimer hoped that the town&#39;s name would help make it the <!--del_lnk--> county seat of Arapaho County, but ironically Governor Denver had already resigned from office. The location was accessible to existing trails and was across the South Platte River from the site of seasonal encampments of the <!--del_lnk--> Cheyenne and <!--del_lnk--> Arapaho. The site of these first towns is now the site of <!--del_lnk--> Confluence Park in downtown Denver. Larimer, along with associates in the St. Charles City Land Company, sold parcels in the town to merchants and miners, with the intention of creating a major city that would cater to new emigrants. Denver City was a frontier town, with an economy based on servicing local miners with gambling, saloons, livestock and goods trading. In the early years, land parcels were often traded for grubstakes or gambled away by miners in Auraria.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Colorado Territory was created on <!--del_lnk--> February 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1861, <!--del_lnk--> Arapahoe County was formed on <!--del_lnk--> November 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1861, and Denver City was incorporated on <!--del_lnk--> November 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1861. Denver City served as the Arapahoe <!--del_lnk--> County Seat until <!--del_lnk--> 1902. In <!--del_lnk--> 1865, Denver City became the <a href="../../wp/c/Capital.htm" title="Capital">Territorial Capital</a>, and on <!--del_lnk--> August 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1876, Denver (no longer needing to call itself Denver City) became the <a href="../../wp/c/Capital.htm" title="Capital">State Capital</a> when Colorado was admitted to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">Union</a>.<p>Between 1880-1895 the city experienced a huge rise in city corruption, as crime bosses, such as <!--del_lnk--> Soapy Smith, worked side-by-side with elected officials and the police, to control the elections, gambling, and the bunko gangs. By 1890, Denver had grown to be the second largest city west of <!--del_lnk--> Omaha, Nebraska, second only to <!--del_lnk--> San Francisco. It would lose the title at the turn of the century to <!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles, however. In 1887, the precursor to the international charity <!--del_lnk--> United Way was formed in Denver by local religious leaders who fundraised and coordinated various charities to help Denver&#39;s poor.<p>The era of the 1890s played an important role in Denver&#39;s history, as this is when the city began to take on a &quot;big city&quot; image. On <!--del_lnk--> November 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1902, Arapahoe County was split into the new consolidated City and County of Denver, the new <!--del_lnk--> Adams County, and the renamed <!--del_lnk--> South Arapahoe County. The 1908 <!--del_lnk--> Democratic National Convention was staged to promote Denver&#39;s prominence, and to signify the city&#39;s participation on the national political and socioeconomic stage.<p>Denver was selected to host the <!--del_lnk--> 1976 Winter Olympics to coincide with Colorado&#39;s centennial anniversary, but Colorado voters struck down ballot initiatives allocating public funds to pay for the high costs of the games, so they were moved to <!--del_lnk--> Innsbruck, <a href="../../wp/a/Austria.htm" title="Austria">Austria</a>. The infamy of becoming the only city ever to decline to host an Olympiad after being selected has made subsequent bids difficult. The movement against hosting the games was based largely on environmental issues and was led by then State Representative <!--del_lnk--> Richard Lamm. Lamm was subsequently elected as <!--del_lnk--> Colorado governor in 1974. Beat icon <!--del_lnk--> Neal Cassady was raised on Larimer Street in Denver, and a portion of <a href="../../wp/j/Jack_Kerouac.htm" title="Jack Kerouac">Jack Kerouac</a>&#39;s beat masterpiece <!--del_lnk--> On the Road takes place in the city, and is based on the beat&#39;s actual experiences in Denver during a road trip. Beat poet <!--del_lnk--> Allen Ginsberg lived for a time in the Denver suburb of <!--del_lnk--> Lakewood, and he helped found the <!--del_lnk--> Buddhist college, <!--del_lnk--> Naropa University or the &quot;Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa&quot; in nearby <!--del_lnk--> Boulder.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>
      <p>Denver has a semi-arid climate with four distinct seasons. While Denver is located on the <!--del_lnk--> Great Plains, the weather of the city and surrounding area is heavily influenced by the proximity of the <a href="../../wp/r/Rocky_Mountains.htm" title="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> to the west. The climate, while generally mild compared to the mountains to the west and the plains further east, can be very unpredictable. Measurable amounts of snow have fallen in Denver as late as <!--del_lnk--> Memorial Day and as early as <!--del_lnk--> Labor Day, and trace amounts have been recorded in every month of the year.<div class="thumb tleft">
       <div style="width:202px;"><a class="internal" href="../../images/138/13884.jpg.htm" title="Thunderstorms are a common sight in Denver."><img alt="Thunderstorms are a common sight in Denver." height="233" longdesc="/wiki/Image:Denver_Lightning.jpg" src="../../images/177/17744.jpg" width="200" /></a><div class="thumbcaption">

      </div>
      <p>The average temperature in Denver is 50.1 &deg;F (10.1 &deg;C), and the average yearly precipitation is 15.81 in (402 mm). The season&#39;s first snowfall generally occurs around <!--del_lnk--> October 19, and the last snowfall is about <!--del_lnk--> April 27, averaging 61.6 in (156 cm) of seasonal accumulation. Although Denver&#39;s Convention and Visitor Bureau claims Denver receives over 300 sunny days a year, the <!--del_lnk--> National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration places that figure at about 250 days of sunshine a year.<p>Denver&#39;s winters can vary from mild to cold, and although large amounts of snow can fall on the mountains just west of the city, the effects of <!--del_lnk--> orographic lift dry out the air passing over the <!--del_lnk--> Front Range, shadowing the city from precipitation for much of the season. Additionally, warm <!--del_lnk--> chinook winds can occasionally be felt as air passing over the mountains heats as it descends. Nevertheless, winters are generally mild, with the coldest temperature ever recorded in Denver was recorded on <!--del_lnk--> January 9, 1875 at -29 &deg;F (-34 &deg;C), though the last time Denver recorded a temperature below -20 &deg;F (-29 &deg;C) was in 1990.<p>Spring brings with it significant changes as Denver can be affected by <!--del_lnk--> air masses on all sides, whether arctic air from the north, which occasionally combines with Pacific storm fronts bringing snow to the city. In fact, March is Denver&#39;s snowiest month, averaging 11.7 in (29.7 cm) of snow. Additionally, warm air from the <a href="../../wp/g/Gulf_of_Mexico.htm" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> can bring the first <!--del_lnk--> thunderstorms of the season, and continental warm air can bring summer-like warm and dry conditions.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Denver has 79 <!--del_lnk--> neighborhoods that the city and community groups use for planning and administration. Although the city&#39;s delineation of the neighbourhood boundaries is somewhat arbitrary, it corresponds roughly to the definitions used by residents. These &quot;neighborhoods&quot; should not be confused with cities or suburbs, which are separate entities within the metro area.<p>These neighborhoods&#39; character vary significantly from each other and include everything from large <!--del_lnk--> skyscrapers to turn of the 20th century houses to modern, <!--del_lnk--> suburban style developments. Generally, the neighborhoods closest to the city center are denser, older and contain more brick building material. Many neighborhoods away from the city center were developed after World War II, and are built with more modern materials and style. Some of the neighborhoods even further from the city centre, or recently redeveloped parcels anywhere in the city have either very suburban characteristics or are <!--del_lnk--> new urbanist developments that attempt to recreate the feel of older neighborhoods. Most neighborhoods contain parks or other feature that is the focal point for the neighbourhood.<p>Denver also has a number of neighborhoods not reflected in the administrative boundaries. Sometimes, these neighborhoods reflect the way people in an area identify themselves; sometimes, they reflect how others, such as real estate developers, have defined those areas.<p>Well-known neighborhoods include the historic and trendy <!--del_lnk--> LoDo (short for &quot;Lower Downtown&quot;), part of the city&#39;s Union Station neighbourhood; <!--del_lnk--> Capitol Hill, <!--del_lnk--> Highland, <!--del_lnk--> Washington Park; Uptown, part of the North Capitol Hill neighbourhood; Curtis Park, part of the <!--del_lnk--> Five Points neighbourhood; <!--del_lnk--> Alamo Placita, the northern part of the Speer neighbourhood; and <!--del_lnk--> Golden Triangle, in the Civic Centre.<p><a id="Parks_and_recreation" name="Parks_and_recreation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Parks and recreation</span></h3>

      <p>When Denver was founded in 1858, the city was little more than a dusty collection of buildings on a long, grassy plain with a few contorted <!--del_lnk--> cottonwood and <!--del_lnk--> willow trees on riverbanks. As of 2006, Denver has over 200 parks, from small mini-parks all over the city to the giant 314 acre (1.3 km&sup2;) <!--del_lnk--> City Park to the 14,000 acre (57 km&sup2;) Denver Mountain Parks. Denver also has 28 recreation centers providing places and programming for resident&#39;s recreation and relaxation.<p>Many of Denver&#39;s parks were acquired from state lands in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This coincided with the <!--del_lnk--> City Beautiful movement, and legendary Denver mayor Robert Speer (1904-12 and 1916-18) set out to expand and beautify the city&#39;s parks. Reinhard Schuetze was the city&#39;s first <!--del_lnk--> landscape architect, and he brought his German-educated landscaping genius to <!--del_lnk--> Washington Park, <!--del_lnk--> Cheesman Park, and <!--del_lnk--> City Park among others. Speer used Schuetze as well as other landscape architects such as <!--del_lnk--> Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. and <!--del_lnk--> Saco Rienk DeBoer to design not only parks such as <!--del_lnk--> Civic Centre Park, but many city parkways and tree-lawns. All of this greenery was fed with <!--del_lnk--> South Platte River water diverted through the city ditch.<div class="thumb tleft">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>In addition to the parks within Denver itself, the city acquired land for mountain parks starting in the 1910s. Over the years, Denver has acquired, built and maintained around 40,000 acres (160 km&sup2;) of mountain parks, the most famous being <!--del_lnk--> Red Rocks Park, which is known just as much for its scenery as its musical history revolving around the <!--del_lnk--> Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Denver also owns the <!--del_lnk--> Winter Park Resort ski area in <!--del_lnk--> Grand County, 60 miles west of Denver. City parks are important places for the both Denverites and visitors inciting controversy with every change. Denver continues to grow its park system with the development of many new parks along the Platte River through the city and in the <!--del_lnk--> Stapleton neighbourhood redevelopment. All of these parks are important gathering places for residents and allow what was once a dry plain to be lush, active, and green.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>Denver is a consolidated city and county with a non-partisan elected <!--del_lnk--> mayor (though s/he may belong to a particular political party), a 13-member <!--del_lnk--> city council and an <!--del_lnk--> auditor. The <!--del_lnk--> Denver City Council is elected from 11 districts with two at-large council-members and is responsible for passing and changing all laws, resolutions, and ordinances, usually after a public hearing. They can also call for misconduct investigations of Denver&#39;s departmental officials.<p>Denver has a strong mayor/weak city council government. The mayor can approve or <!--del_lnk--> veto any ordinances or resolutions approved by the council, makes sure all contracts with the city are kept and performed, signs all bonds and contracts, is responsible for the city budget, and can appoint people to various city departments, organizations, and commissions. However, the council can override the mayor&#39;s veto with a nine out of 13 member vote, and the city budget must be approved and can be changed by a simple majority vote of the council. The auditor checks all expenditures and may refuse to allow specific ones, usually based on financial reasons.<p>All elected officials have four-year terms, with a maximum of two terms. While Denver elections are non-partisan, <!--del_lnk--> Democrats have long held a virtual monopoly on Denver politics with all elected officials having Democratic Party affiliation. In federal elections, Denverites also tend to vote for Democratic candidates, voting for the Democratic Presidential nominee in every election since 1960 (excluding 1980 and 1972). The office of Denver&#39;s Mayor has been occupied by a Democrat since the municipal general election of 1963, including the current mayor, John Hickenlooper. Denver is represented at the federal level by congresswoman <!--del_lnk--> Diana DeGette, a Democrat representing <!--del_lnk--> Colorado&#39;s 1st congressional district, which includes all of Denver and parts of <!--del_lnk--> Arapahoe County.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>During the 1960s and 1970s, Denver was one of the epicenters of the <!--del_lnk--> Chicano Movement. The boxer-turned-activist <!--del_lnk--> Rodolfo &quot;Corky&quot; Gonzales formed an organization called the Crusade for Justice, which battled police brutality, fought for bilingual education, and, most notably, hosted the First National Chicano Youth Liberation Conference in March of 1969.<p>In recent years, Denver has taken a stance on helping people who are or become <!--del_lnk--> homeless, particularly under the administrations of mayors <!--del_lnk--> John Hickenlooper and <!--del_lnk--> Wellington Webb. Denver&#39;s homeless population is considerably lower than many other major cities, but residents of the city streets have suffered during Denver&#39;s <a href="../../wp/w/Winter.htm" title="Winter">winters</a>. Although mild and dry much of the time, Denver&#39;s winters can have brief periods of cold temperatures and varying amounts of snow. As a result, the city has set a national precedent on homeless services, with the creations of a ten-year plan to end homelessness (a plan now becoming popular in other cities as well), a task force and commission to end homelessness, and an expansion of human and civil services through the Denver area.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In 2005, Denver became the first major city in the U.S. to make the private use of less than an ounce of <!--del_lnk--> marijuana legal for adults 21 and older. The city voted 53.49%-46.51% in favour of the <!--del_lnk--> marijuana legalization measure. It should be noted that this initiative does not usurp state law, which currently treats marijuana possession in much the same way as a speeding ticket, with fines of up to $100 and no jail time. The electorate of Colorado voted on and rejected a similar state-wide initiative in November 2006.<p>Denver is competing with <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York</a> to host the <!--del_lnk--> 2008 Democratic National Convention, which would coincidentally be the centennial of the city&#39;s first hosting of the landmark 1908 convention.

      <p>Denver&#39;s economy is based partially on its geographic position and its connection to some of the major transportation systems of the country. Because Denver is the largest city within 600 miles, it has become a natural location for storage and distribution of goods and services to the <!--del_lnk--> Mountain States. Denver is also approximately halfway between the large cities of the <!--del_lnk--> Midwest like <a href="../../wp/c/Chicago.htm" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> and <a href="../../wp/d/Detroit%252C_Michigan.htm" title="Detroit, Michigan">Detroit</a> and the cities of the <!--del_lnk--> West Coast, another benefit for distribution. Over the years, the city has been home to some large corporations in the central United States, making Denver a key trade point for the country.<p>Geography also allows Denver to have a considerable government presence, with many federal agencies based or having offices in the Denver area. In fact, the <!--del_lnk--> Denver-Aurora Metropolitan Area has more federal workers than any other metropolitan area except for the <!--del_lnk--> Washington D.C. metropolitan area. Along with the plethora of federal agencies come many companies based on US defense and space projects. <!--del_lnk--> Lockheed-Martin and <!--del_lnk--> Ball Aerospace are examples. Being the <a href="../../wp/c/Capital.htm" title="Capital">capital</a> of the state of <!--del_lnk--> Colorado also gives many state jobs to Denver.<p>In 2005, an expansion for the <!--del_lnk--> Colorado Convention Centre was completed. According to local officials, the convention centre expansion makes the city one of the top 10 cities in the nation for holding a convention.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Denver&#39;s position near the mineral-rich <a href="../../wp/r/Rocky_Mountains.htm" title="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>, encouraged mining and energy companies to spring up in the area. In the early days of the city, gold and silver booms and busts played a large role in the economic success of the city. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the energy crisis in America created an energy boom in Denver captured in the soap opera <i><!--del_lnk--> Dynasty</i>. During this time, Denver was built up considerably, with many new downtown <!--del_lnk--> skyscrapers built during this time. Eventually, the oil prices dropped from $34 a barrel in 1981 to $9 a barrel in 1986, and the Denver economy dropped with it, leaving almost 15,000 oil industry workers in the area unemployed (including current mayor <!--del_lnk--> John Hickenlooper, a former geologist), and the highest office vacancy rate in the nation (30%). Energy and mining are still important in Denver&#39;s economy today, with companies such as <!--del_lnk--> EnCana, <!--del_lnk--> Halliburton, <!--del_lnk--> Newmont Mining, <!--del_lnk--> Nobel Energy, and <!--del_lnk--> Anadarko.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Denver&#39;s west-central geographic location in the Mountain Time Zone (UTC -7) also benefits the telecommunications industry by allowing communication with both North American coasts, South America, Europe, and Asia in the same business day. Denver&#39;s location on the 105th meridian at over 1 mile in elevation also enables it to be the largest city in the U.S. to offer a &#39;one-bounce&#39; real-time satellite uplink to six continents in the same business day. <!--del_lnk--> Qwest Communications, <!--del_lnk--> EchoStar, <!--del_lnk--> Starz-Encore, and <!--del_lnk--> Comcast are just a few of the telecommunications companies with operations in the Denver area. These and other high-tech companies had a boom in Denver in the mid to late 1990s, but the technology bust in the new millennium caused Denver to lose many of those technology jobs. Recently, the Denver area has started making a comeback, with the October 2005 unemployment at 4.7% the lowest since September of 2001. Denver government and industry leaders are attempting to diversify the Denver economy so that it is less susceptible to boom and bust cycles.<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transportation</span></h2>

      <p>Most of Denver has a straightforward <!--del_lnk--> street grid oriented to the four <!--del_lnk--> cardinal directions. Blocks are usually identified in hundreds from the median streets, identified as &quot;0&quot;, which are Broadway (the west-east median) and Ellsworth Avenue (the north-south median). <!--del_lnk--> Colfax Avenue, the major east-west artery through Denver, is 15 blocks (1500) north of the median. Avenues north of Ellsworth are numbered (with the exception of Colfax Avenue and a few others), while avenues south of Ellsworth are named.<p>There is also an older downtown grid system that was designed to be parallel to the confluence of the <!--del_lnk--> South Platte River and <!--del_lnk--> Cherry Creek. Most of the streets downtown and in <!--del_lnk--> LoDo run northeast-southwest and northwest-southeast. This system has an unplanned benefit for snow removal; if the streets were in a normal N-S/E-W grid, only the N-S streets would receive sunlight. With the grid oriented to the diagonal directions, the NW-SE streets receive sunlight to melt snow in the morning and the NE-SW streets receive it in the afternoon. The NW-SE streets are numbered, while the NE-SW streets are named. The named streets start at the intersection of Colfax Avenue and Broadway with the block-long Cheyenne Place. The numbered streets start underneath the Colfax and I-25 viaducts. There are 27 named and 44 numbered streets on this grid. There are also a few vestiges of the old grid system in the normal grid, such as Park Avenue, Morrison Road, and Speer Boulevard.<p>All roads in the downtown grid system are streets. (<!--del_lnk--> 16th Street, Stout Street) Roads outside of that system that travel east/west are given the suffix &quot;avenue&quot; and those that head north and south are given the &quot;street&quot; suffix. (Example, Colfax Avenue, Lincoln Street,). Boulevards are higher capacity streets and will travel any direction. Smaller roads are sometimes referred to as places, drives or courts. Most streets outside of the area between Broadway and Colorado Boulevard are organized alphabetically from the city&#39;s centre.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Denver is primarily served by the interstate highways <!--del_lnk--> I-25 and <!--del_lnk--> I-70. The intersection of the two interstates is referred to locally as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> the mousetrap&quot;, because when airborne, the junction (and subsequent vehicles) resemble mice in a large trap. I-70 runs east-west from <!--del_lnk--> Utah to <!--del_lnk--> Maryland. I-25 runs north-south from <!--del_lnk--> New Mexico through Denver to <!--del_lnk--> Wyoming. <!--del_lnk--> I-225 traverses neighboring <!--del_lnk--> Aurora and connects with I-25 in the southeastern corner of Denver. Additionally, <!--del_lnk--> I-76 begins from I-70 just west of the city in <!--del_lnk--> Arvada. It intersects I-25 north of the city and runs northeast to Nebraska where it ends at <!--del_lnk--> I-80. <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Route 6 connects downtown Denver to the suburb of <!--del_lnk--> Golden.<p>A highway expansion and transit project for the southern <!--del_lnk--> I-25 corridor, dubbed T-REX (TRansportation EXpansion), was completed on November 17th, 2006. The project installed wider and additional highway lanes, and improved highway access and drainage. The project also includes a light rail line that traverses from downtown to the south end of the metro area, known as &quot;Surrey Ridge&quot;.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Mass transportation throughout the <!--del_lnk--> Denver-Aurora metropolitan area is managed and coordinated by the <!--del_lnk--> Regional Transportation District (RTD). RTD currently operates more than 1,000 <!--del_lnk--> buses serving 10,000 bus stops in 38 municipal jurisdictions. Additionally, RTD operates two <!--del_lnk--> light rail lines (the <!--del_lnk--> C Line and the <!--del_lnk--> D Line) with a total of 15.8 miles of track and serving 24 stations. Current RTD local fare is $1.50 with disabled residents who have an RTD disabled discount card being charged 75&cent;. <!--del_lnk--> FasTracks, an expansion project approved by voters in 2004, will allow light rail to serve cities such as <!--del_lnk--> Lakewood, <!--del_lnk--> Golden, and <!--del_lnk--> Aurora. Commuter rail lines will serve the northern section of the metropolitan area, in addition to <!--del_lnk--> Boulder, <!--del_lnk--> Longmont, and <!--del_lnk--> Denver International Airport. November 17, 2006 the first extension of Light Rail in four years, and some elements of the new lines will mark the beginning of the FasTracks program (although this extension of the system was part of T-Rex). The E and F Lines travel from downtown Denver to Lincoln Avenue, at the southern end of the Metro area. The H Line travels from downtown Denver to the Nine Mile station, on I-225 in Aurora.

In the 1980s and 1990s, one of the top priorities of former Mayor <!--del_lnk--> Federico Pe&ntilde;a was bringing major league baseball to the city, an effort which culminated in the construction of <!--del_lnk--> Coors Field and the creation of the <!--del_lnk--> Colorado Rockies as an expansion franchise in 1993. Denver is also home to the <a href="../../wp/n/National_Hockey_League.htm" title="National Hockey League">NHL</a> team, the <!--del_lnk--> Colorado Avalanche, who have won two <!--del_lnk--> Stanley Cups (1996 and 2001) while in Denver, as well as the <!--del_lnk--> NBA team, the <!--del_lnk--> Denver Nuggets. The home arena of both the Avalanche and the Nuggets is the <!--del_lnk--> Pepsi Centre. The city also hosted the <!--del_lnk--> Colorado Rapids of <!--del_lnk--> Major League Soccer through 2006, with a new stadium being built in nearby <!--del_lnk--> Commerce City for 2007.<div class="thumb tright">
