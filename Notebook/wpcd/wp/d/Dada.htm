      <p><b>Dada</b> or <b>Dadaism</b> is a <!--del_lnk--> cultural movement that began in neutral <a href="../../wp/z/Z%25C3%25BCrich.htm" title="Z&uuml;rich">Z&uuml;rich</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Switzerland.htm" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved <a href="../../wp/v/Visual_arts.htm" title="Visual arts">visual arts</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Literature.htm" title="Literature">literature</a> (<a href="../../wp/p/Poetry.htm" title="Poetry">poetry</a>, <!--del_lnk--> art manifestoes, <a href="../../wp/a/Aesthetics.htm" title="Aesthetics">art theory</a>), <a href="../../wp/t/Theatre.htm" title="Theatre">theatre</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> graphic design, and concentrated its <!--del_lnk--> anti war politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in <a href="../../wp/a/Art.htm" title="Art">art</a> through <!--del_lnk--> anti-art cultural works. Dada activities included public gatherings, demonstrations, and publication of art/literary journals. Passionate coverage of art, politics, and culture filled their publications. The movement influenced later styles, movements, and groups including <!--del_lnk--> Surrealism, <!--del_lnk--> Pop Art and <!--del_lnk--> Fluxus.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p>The movement was a protest against the <!--del_lnk--> barbarism of World War I, the <!--del_lnk--> bourgeois interests that Dada adherents believed inspired the war, and what they believed was an oppressive intellectual rigidity in both art and everyday society. Dada was an international movement, and it is difficult to classify artists as being from any one particular country, as they were constantly moving from one place to another.<p>Dada thought that reason and logic had led people into the horrors of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">war</a>, so the only route to salvation was to reject logic and embrace <!--del_lnk--> anarchy and <!--del_lnk--> irrationality. However, this could also be thought of as the logical side of <!--del_lnk--> anarchy and rejection of values and order; it is not irrational to embrace the systematic destruction of values, if one thinks them to be flawed.<p>According to its proponents, Dada was not <a href="../../wp/a/Art.htm" title="Art">art</a> &mdash; it was &quot;<!--del_lnk--> anti-art&quot;. It was anti-art in the sense that Dadaists protested against the contemporary academic and cultured values of art. For everything that art stood for, Dada was to represent the opposite. Where art was concerned with <a href="../../wp/a/Aesthetics.htm" title="Aesthetics">aesthetics</a>, Dada ignored aesthetics. If art were to have at least an implicit or latent message, Dada strove to have no meaning &mdash; interpretation of Dada is dependent entirely on the viewer. If art is to appeal to sensibilities, Dada is to offend. Ironically, Dada became an influential movement in modern art, a commentary on order and the carnage Dadaists believed it wreaked. Through their rejection of traditional culture and aesthetics they hoped to destroy them.<p>A reviewer from the <i><!--del_lnk--> American Art News</i> stated at the time that &quot;The Dada philosophy is the sickest, most paralyzing and most destructive thing that has ever originated from the brain of man.&quot; Art historians have described Dada as being, in large part, &quot;in reaction to what many of these artists saw as nothing more than an insane spectacle of collective homicide.&quot;<p>Years later, Dada artists described the movement as &quot;a phenomenon bursting forth in the midst of the postwar economic and <!--del_lnk--> moral crisis, a savior, a monster, which would lay waste to everything in its path. [It was] a systematic work of destruction and demoralization...In the end it became nothing but an act of sacrilege.&quot;<p><a id="Ways_Dadaism_has_been_described" name="Ways_Dadaism_has_been_described"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Ways Dadaism has been described</span></h3>

       <li>&quot;DADAIST DISGUST - Every product of disgust that is capable of becoming a negation of the family is dada; DADA; acquaintance with all the means hitherto rejected by the sexual prudishness of easy compromise and good manners: DADA; abolition of logic, dance of those who are incapable of creation: DADA; every hierarchy and social equation established for values by our valets: DADA; every object, all objects, feelings and obscurities, every apparition and the precise shock of parallel lines, are means for the battle of: DADA; the abolition of memory: DADA; the abolition of archaeology: DADA the abolition of prophets: DADA; the abolition of the future: DADA; the absolute and indiscutable belief in every god that is an immediate product of spontaneity: DADA; the elegant and unprejudiced leap from on harmony to another sphere; the trajectory of a word, a cry, thrown into the air like an acoustic disc; to respect all individualities in their folly of the moment, whether serious, fearful, timid, ardent, vigorous, decided or enthusiastic; to strip one&#39;s church of every useless and unwieldy accessory; to spew out like a luminous cascade any offensive or loving thought, or to cherish it - with the lively satisfaction that it&#39;s all precisely the same thing - with the same intensity in the bush, which is free of insects for the blue-blooded, and gilded with the bodies of archangels, with one&#39;s soul. Liberty: DADA DADA DADA; - the roar of contorted pains, the interweaving of contraries and all contradictions, freaks and irrelevancies: LIFE.

      <p><a id="Z.C3.BCrich" name="Z.C3.BCrich"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Z&uuml;rich</span></h3>
      <p>In 1916, <!--del_lnk--> Hugo Ball, <!--del_lnk--> Emmy Hennings, <!--del_lnk--> Tristan Tzara, <!--del_lnk--> Hans Arp, <!--del_lnk--> Marcel Janco, <!--del_lnk--> Richard Huelsenbeck, <!--del_lnk--> Sophie T&auml;uber; along with others discussed art and put on performances in the <!--del_lnk--> Cabaret Voltaire expressing their disgust with the war and the interests that inspired it. By some accounts Dada coalesced on October 6 at the cabaret.<p>At the first public <!--del_lnk--> soiree at the cabaret on July 14, 1916, Ball recited the first manifesto (see <!--del_lnk--> text). Tzara, in 1918, wrote a <!--del_lnk--> Dada manifesto considered one of the most important of the Dada writings. Other manifestos followed.<p><!--del_lnk--> Marcel Janco recalled,<dl>
       <dd><i>We had lost confidence in our culture. Everything had to be demolished. We would begin again after the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> tabula rasa&quot;. At the Cabaret Voltaire we began by shocking common sense, public opinion, education, institutions, museums, good taste, in short, the whole prevailing order.</i></dl>
      <p>A single issue of <i>Cabaret Voltaire</i> was the first publication to come out of the movement.<p>After the cabaret closed down, activities moved to a new gallery, and Ball left Europe. Tzara began a relentless campaign to spread Dada ideas. He bombarded French and Italian artists and writers with letters, and soon emerged as the Dada leader and master strategist. The <!--del_lnk--> Cabaret Voltaire has by now re-opened, and it&#39;s still in the same place at the Spiegelgasse 1 in the Niederdorf.<p>Z&uuml;rich Dada, with Tzara at the helm, published the art and literature review <i>Dada</i> beginning in July 1917, with five editions from Z&uuml;rich and the final two from Paris.<p>When World War I ended in 1918, most of the Z&uuml;rich Dadaists returned to their home countries, and some began Dada activities in other cities.<p><a id="Origin_of_the_word_Dada" name="Origin_of_the_word_Dada"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Origin of the word <i>Dada</i></span></h4>
      <p>The origin of the name <i>Dada</i> is unclear; some believe that it is a nonsensical word. Others maintain that it originates from the <a href="../../wp/r/Romania.htm" title="Romania">Romanian</a> artists <!--del_lnk--> Tristan Tzara and <!--del_lnk--> Marcel Janco&#39;s frequent use of the words <i>da, da</i>, meaning <i>yes, yes</i> in the <!--del_lnk--> Romanian language (Engl. equivalent: <i>yeah, yeah</i>, as in <i>yeah, right</i>). Others believe that a group of artists assembled in <a href="../../wp/z/Z%25C3%25BCrich.htm" title="Z&uuml;rich">Z&uuml;rich</a> in 1916, wanting a name for their new movement, chose it at random by stabbing a <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a>-<a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a> dictionary with a paper knife, and picking the name that the point landed upon. <i>Dada</i> in French is a child&#39;s word for <i><!--del_lnk--> hobby-horse</i>. In French the colloquialism, <i>c&#39;est mon dada</i>, means <i>it&#39;s my hobby</i>.<p>It has also been suggested that the word &quot;dada&quot; was chosen randomly from the Larousse dictionary.<p>According to the Dada ideal, the movement would not be called <i>Dadaism</i>, much less designated an <i>art-movement</i>.<p><a id="Berlin" name="Berlin"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Berlin</span></h3>
      <p>The groups in <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> were not as strongly <i>anti-art</i> as other groups. Their activity and art was more <a href="../../wp/p/Politics.htm" title="Politics">political</a> and <!--del_lnk--> social, with corrosive <!--del_lnk--> manifestos and <a href="../../wp/p/Propaganda.htm" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a>, biting <!--del_lnk--> satire, large public <!--del_lnk--> demonstrations and overt political activities. It has been suggested that this is at least partially due to Berlin&#39;s proximity to the front, and that for an opposite effect, New York&#39;s geographic distance from the war spawned its more theoretically-driven, less political nature.<p>In February 1918, <!--del_lnk--> Richard Huelsenbeck gave his first Dada speech in <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin.htm" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>, and produced a Dada manifesto later in the year. <!--del_lnk--> Hannah H&ouml;ch and <!--del_lnk--> George Grosz used Dada to express post-World War I <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">communist</a> sympathies. Grosz, together with <!--del_lnk--> John Heartfield, developed the <!--del_lnk--> technique of <!--del_lnk--> photomontage during this period. The artists published a series of short-lived political <!--del_lnk--> journals, and held the <!--del_lnk--> International Dada Fair in 1920.<p>The Berlin group saw much in-fighting; <!--del_lnk--> Kurt Schwitters and others were excluded from the group. Schwitters moved to <!--del_lnk--> Hanover where he developed his individual type of Dada, which he dubbed <i><!--del_lnk--> Merz</i>.<p>The Berlin group published <!--del_lnk--> periodicals such as <i>Club Dada</i>, <i>Der Dada</i>, <i>Everyman His Own Football</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Jedermann sein eigner Fussball), and <i>Dada Almanach</i>.<p><a id="Cologne" name="Cologne"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Cologne</span></h3>
      <p>In <a href="../../wp/c/Cologne.htm" title="Cologne">Cologne</a> (K&ouml;ln), <!--del_lnk--> Max Ernst, <!--del_lnk--> Johannes Theodor Baargeld and <!--del_lnk--> Arp launched a controversial Dada exhibition in 1920 which focused on nonsense and anti-bourgeois sentiments.<p><a id="New_York" name="New_York"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">New York</span></h3>

      <p>Like Z&uuml;rich, <!--del_lnk--> New York was a refuge for writers and artists from <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>. Soon after arriving from France in 1915, <!--del_lnk--> Marcel Duchamp and <!--del_lnk--> Francis Picabia met American artist <!--del_lnk--> Man Ray. By 1916 the three of them became the centre of radical anti-art activities in the United States. American <!--del_lnk--> Beatrice Wood, who had been studying in France, soon joined them. Much of their activity centered in <!--del_lnk--> Alfred Stieglitz&#39;s gallery, 291, and the home of <!--del_lnk--> Walter and Louise Arensberg.<p>The New Yorkers, though not particularly organized, called their activities <i>Dada,</i> but they did not issue manifestos. They issued challenges to art and culture through publications such as <i>The Blind Man</i>, <i>Rongwrong</i>, and <i>New York Dada</i> in which they criticized the traditionalist basis for <i>museum</i> art. New York Dada lacked the disillusionment of European Dada and was instead driven by a sense of irony and humor. In his book <i>Adventures in the arts: informal chapters on painters, vaudeville and poets</i> <!--del_lnk--> Marsden Hartley included an essay on &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The Importance of Being &#39;Dada&#39; &quot;.<p>During this time Duchamp began exhibiting &quot;<!--del_lnk--> readymades&quot; (found objects) such as a bottle rack, and got involved with the <!--del_lnk--> Society of Independent Artists. In 1917 he submitted the now famous <i><!--del_lnk--> Fountain</i>, a urinal signed R. Mutt, to the Society of Independent Artists show only to have the piece rejected. First an object of scorn within the arts community, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Fountain</i> has since become almost canonized by some. The committee presiding over Britain&#39;s prestigious <!--del_lnk--> Turner Prize in 2004, for example, called it &quot;the most influential work of modern art.&quot; In an attempt to &quot;pay homage to the spirit of Dada&quot; a performance artist named <!--del_lnk--> Pierre Pinoncelli made a crack in The Fountain with a hammer in January of 2006; he also urinated on it in 1993.<p>Picabia&#39;s travels tied New York, Z&uuml;rich and Paris groups together during the Dadaist period. For seven years he also published the Dada periodical <i>391</i> in <!--del_lnk--> Barcelona, New York City, Z&uuml;rich, and Paris from 1917 through 1924.<p>By 1921, most of the original players moved to Paris where Dada experienced its last major incarnation (see <!--del_lnk--> Neo-Dada for later activity).<p><a id="Paris" name="Paris"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Paris</span></h3>
      <p>The French <!--del_lnk--> avant-garde kept abreast of Dada activities in Z&uuml;rich with regular communications from <!--del_lnk--> Tristan Tzara (whose pseudonym means &quot;sad in country,&quot; a name chosen to protest the treatment of Jews in his native Romania), who exchanged letters, poems, and magazines with <!--del_lnk--> Guillaume Apollinaire, <!--del_lnk--> Andr&eacute; Breton, <!--del_lnk--> Max Jacob, and other French writers, critics and artists.<p>Dada in Paris surged in 1920 when many of the originators converged there. Inspired by Tzara, Paris Dada soon issued manifestos, organized demonstrations, staged performances and produced a number of journals (the final two editions of <i>Dada</i>, <i>Le Cannibale</i>, and <i>Litt&eacute;rature</i> featured Dada in several editions.)<p>The first introduction of Dada artwork to the Parisian public was at the <!--del_lnk--> Salon des Ind&eacute;pendants in 1921. <!--del_lnk--> Jean Crotti exhibited works associated with Dada including a work entitled, <i>Explicatif</i> bearing the word <i>Tabu</i>.<p><a id="The_Netherlands" name="The_Netherlands"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">The Netherlands</span></h3>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> The Netherlands the Dada movement centered mainly around <!--del_lnk--> Theo van Doesburg, most well known for establishing the <!--del_lnk--> De Stijl movement and magazine of the same name. Van Doesburg mainly focused on poetry, and included poems from many well-known Dada writers in <i>De Stijl</i> such as <!--del_lnk--> Hugo Ball, <!--del_lnk--> Hans Arp and <!--del_lnk--> Kurt Schwitters. Van Doesburg became a friend of Schwitters, and together they organized the so-called <i>Dutch Dada campaign</i> in 1923, where Van Doesburg promoted a leaflet about Dada (entitled <i>What is Dada?</i>), Schwitters read his poems, <!--del_lnk--> Vilmos Husz&agrave;r demonstrated a mechanical dancing doll and Van Doesburg&#39;s wife, Nelly, played <!--del_lnk--> avant-garde compositions on piano.<p>Van Doesburg wrote Dada poetry himself in <i><!--del_lnk--> De Stijl</i>, although under a pseudonym, I.K. Bonset, which was only revealed after his tragic death in 1931. &#39;Together&#39; with I.K. Bonset, he also published a short-lived Dutch Dada magazine called <i>M&eacute;cano</i>.<p><a id="Georgia" name="Georgia"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Georgia</span></h3>
      <p>Although Dada itself was unknown in <a href="../../wp/g/Georgia_%2528country%2529.htm" title="Georgia (country)">Georgia</a> until at least 1920, from 1917-1921 a group of poets called themselves &quot;41st Degree&quot; (referring both to the latitude of <!--del_lnk--> Tbilisi, Georgia and to the temperature of a high fever) organized along Dadaist lines. The most important figure in this group was <!--del_lnk--> Iliazd, whose radical typographical designs visually echo the publications of the Dadaists. After his flight to <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a> in 1921, he collaborated with Dadaists on publications and events.<p><a id="Poetry.2C_music_and_sound" name="Poetry.2C_music_and_sound"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Poetry, music and sound</span></h2>
      <p>Dada was not confined to the visual and literary arts; its influence reached into sound and music. <!--del_lnk--> Kurt Schwitters developed what he called <i>sound poems</i> and composers such as <!--del_lnk--> Erwin Schulhoff, <!--del_lnk--> Hans Heusser and <!--del_lnk--> Albert Savinio wrote <i>Dada music</i>, while members of <!--del_lnk--> Les Six collaborated with members of the Dada movement and had their works performed at Dada gatherings.<p>In the very first Dada publication, <!--del_lnk--> Hugo Ball describes a &quot;balalaika orchestra playing delightful folk-songs.&quot; African music and <a href="../../wp/j/Jazz.htm" title="Jazz">jazz</a> was common at Dada gatherings, signaling a return to nature and naive <!--del_lnk--> primitivism.<p><a id="Legacy" name="Legacy"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Legacy</span></h2>
      <p>While broad, the movement was unstable. By 1924 in Paris, Dada was melding into <!--del_lnk--> surrealism, and artists had gone on to other ideas and movements, including surrealism, <!--del_lnk--> social realism and other forms of <!--del_lnk--> modernism. Some theorists argue that Dada was actually the beginning of <!--del_lnk--> postmodern art.<p>By the dawn of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, many of the European Dadaists had fled or emigrated to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. Some died in death camps under Hitler, who persecuted the kind of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Degenerate art&quot; that Dada represented. The movement became less active as post-World War II optimism led to new movements in art and literature.<p>Dada is a named influence and reference of various <!--del_lnk--> anti-art and <!--del_lnk--> political and <!--del_lnk--> cultural movements including <!--del_lnk--> Situationists.<p>At the same time that the Z&uuml;rich Dadaists made noise and spectacle at the <!--del_lnk--> Cabaret Voltaire, <a href="../../wp/v/Vladimir_Lenin.htm" title="Vladimir Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> wrote his revolutionary plans for <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> in a nearby apartment. He was unappreciative of the artistic revolutionary activity near him. <!--del_lnk--> Tom Stoppard used this coincidence as a premise for his play <i><!--del_lnk--> Travesties</i> (1974), which includes Tzara, Lenin, and <a href="../../wp/j/James_Joyce.htm" title="James Joyce">James Joyce</a> as characters.<p>The Cabaret Voltaire fell into disrepair until it was occupied from January to March, 2002, by a group proclaiming themselves <!--del_lnk--> neo-Dadaists, led by <!--del_lnk--> Mark Divo. The group included <!--del_lnk--> Jan Thieler, <!--del_lnk--> Ingo Giezendanner, <!--del_lnk--> Aiana Calugar, <!--del_lnk--> Lennie Lee and <!--del_lnk--> Dan Jones. After their eviction the space became a museum dedicated to the history of Dada. The work of <!--del_lnk--> Lennie Lee and <!--del_lnk--> Dan Jones remained on the walls of the museum.<p>Several notable <!--del_lnk--> retrospectives have examined the influence of Dada upon art and society. In 1967, a large Dada retrospective was held in <!--del_lnk--> Paris, France. In 2006, the <!--del_lnk--> Museum of Modern Art in New York City held a Dada exhibition in collaboration with the <!--del_lnk--> National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. and the <!--del_lnk--> Centre Pompidou in Paris.<p><a id="Modern_usage_of_the_word__Dada" name="Modern_usage_of_the_word__Dada"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Modern usage of the word <i>Dada</i></span></h3>
      <p>The satirical <!--del_lnk--> Church of the SubGenius pays homage to Dada in its use of the term &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Bulldada&quot;, which has passed into common usage as a description for concepts and items that are unintentionally ironic.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Brotherhood of Dada is a fictional gang in <!--del_lnk--> DC comics.
