      <p><b>Demosthenes</b> (384&ndash;322&nbsp;BC, <i><!--del_lnk--> Greek: &Delta;&eta;&mu;&omicron;&sigma;&theta;&#x3AD;&nu;&eta;&sigmaf;</i>) was a prominent <!--del_lnk--> Greek <!--del_lnk--> statesman and <!--del_lnk--> orator of <a href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Ancient Athens">ancient Athens</a>. His <!--del_lnk--> orations constitute the last significant expression of Athenian intellectual prowess and provide a thorough insight into the politics and culture of <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">ancient Greece</a> during the <!--del_lnk--> 4th century BC. Demosthenes learned <!--del_lnk--> Rhetoric by studying the <!--del_lnk--> speeches of previous great orators. He delivered his first judicial speeches at the age of twenty, in which he argued effectively to gain from his guardians what was left of his inheritance. For a time, Demosthenes made his living as a professional speech-writer (<!--del_lnk--> logographer) and a <!--del_lnk--> lawyer, writing speeches for use in private <!--del_lnk--> legal suits.<p>Demosthenes grew interested in politics during his time as a logographer, and in 354 BC he gave his first public political speeches. He would go on to devote the most productive years of his life to opposing <a href="../../wp/m/Macedon.htm" title="Macedon">Macedon</a>&#39;s expansion. He idealized his city and strove throughout his life to restore Athens&#39; supremacy and motivate his compatriots against <!--del_lnk--> Philip II of Macedon. He sought to preserve his city&#39;s freedom and to establish an alliance against Macedon, in an unsuccessful attempt to impede Philip&#39;s plans to expand his influence southwards by conquering all the Greek states. After Philip&#39;s death, Demosthenes played a leading part in his city&#39;s uprising against the new King of Macedon, <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>. However, his efforts failed and the revolt was met with a harsh Macedonian reaction. To prevent a similar revolt against his own rule, Alexander&#39;s successor, <!--del_lnk--> Antipater, sent his men to track Demosthenes down. Demosthenes took his own life, in order to avoid being arrested by Archias, Antipater&#39;s confidant.<p>The <i>Alexandrian Canon</i> compiled by <!--del_lnk--> Aristophanes of Byzantium and <!--del_lnk--> Aristarchus of Samothrace recognized Demosthenes as one of the 10 greatest <!--del_lnk--> Attic orators and logographers. According to <!--del_lnk--> Longinus, Demosthenes &quot;perfected to the utmost the tone of lofty speech, living passions, copiousness, readiness, speed&quot;. <!--del_lnk--> Cicero acclaimed him as &quot;the perfect orator&quot; who lacked nothing, while <!--del_lnk--> Quintilian extolled him as &quot;lex orandi&quot; (&quot;the standard of <!--del_lnk--> oratory&quot;) and underscored that &quot;inter omnes unus excellat&quot; (&quot;he stands alone among all the orators&quot;).<p>

      <p>Demosthenes was born in <!--del_lnk--> 384 BC, during the last year of the 98th <!--del_lnk--> Olympiad or the first year of the 99th Olympiad. His father - also named Demosthenes - who belonged to the local <a href="../../wp/t/Tribe.htm" title="Tribe">tribe</a>, Pandionis, and lived in the <!--del_lnk--> deme of <!--del_lnk--> Paeania in the Athenian countryside, was a wealthy sword-maker. <!--del_lnk--> Aeschines, Demosthenes&#39; greatest political rival, maintained that his mother Kleoboule was a <!--del_lnk--> Scythian by blood, an allegation which is disputed by some modern scholars. Demosthenes was orphaned at the age of seven. Although his father provided well for him, his legal guardians, Aphobus, Demophon and Therippides, mishandled his inheritance.<p>As soon as Demosthenes came of age in 366 BC, he demanded that they render an account of their management. According to the orator, the account revealed the misappropriation of his property. Although his father left an estate of nearly fourteen <!--del_lnk--> talents, (somewhat over 3,150 golden <a href="../../wp/p/Pound_sterling.htm" title="Pound sterling">pounds</a> or 400,000 <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">United States dollars</a>) Demosthenes asserted that the guardians had left nothing &quot;except the house, and fourteen slaves and thirty silver minae (30 minae = &frac12; talent)&quot;. At the age of 20, Demosthenes sued his trustees in order to recover his patrimony and delivered five orations himself: three <i>Against Aphobus</i> between during 363 BC and 362 BC and two <i>Against Ontenor</i> during 362 BC and 361 BC. The courts fixed Demosthenes&#39; damages at ten talents. When all the trials came to an end, however, the orator succeeded in retrieving only a portion of his inheritance.<p>Between his coming of age in 366 BC and the trials that took place in 364 BC, Demosthenes and his guardians negotiated acrimoniously, but were unable to reach an agreement, as neither side was willing to make concessions. At the same time, Demosthenes prepared himself for the trials and improved his oratory skill. As an adolescent, his curiosity had been noticed by the orator <!--del_lnk--> Callistratus, who was then at the height of his reputation, having just won a case of considerable importance. According to <a href="../../wp/f/Friedrich_Nietzsche.htm" title="Friedrich Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>, a German <!--del_lnk--> philologist and <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosopher">philosopher</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Constantine Paparregopoulus, a major Greek <!--del_lnk--> historian, Demosthenes was a student of <!--del_lnk--> Isocrates; Cicero, Quintillian and the Roman biographer Hermippus maintain that Demosthenes was a student of <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Lucian, a Roman-Syrian rhetorician and <!--del_lnk--> satirist, includes the philosophers <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Theophrastus and <!--del_lnk--> Xenocrates among his teachers. These claims are nowadays disputed. According to Plutarch, Demosthenes employed <!--del_lnk--> Isaeus as his master in Rhetoric, even though Isocrates was then teaching this subject, either because he could not pay Isocrates the prescribed fee or because Demosthenes believed Isaeus&#39; style better suited a vigorous and astute orator such as himself . <!--del_lnk--> Curtius, a German <!--del_lnk--> archaeologist and historian, likened the relation between Isaeus and Demosthenes to &quot;an intellectual armed alliance&quot;.<p>It has also been said that Demosthenes paid Isaeus 10,000 <!--del_lnk--> drachmas (somewhat over 1&frac12; talent) on the condition that the teacher should withdraw from a school of Rhetoric which he had opened, and should devote himself wholly to his new pupil. Another version credits Isaeus with having taught Demosthenes without charge. According to <!--del_lnk--> Sir Richard C. Jebb, a British <!--del_lnk--> classical <!--del_lnk--> scholar, &quot;the intercourse between Isaeus and Demosthenes as teacher and learner can have been either very intimate or of very long duration&quot;. <!--del_lnk--> Konstantinos Tsatsos, a Greek professor and <!--del_lnk--> academician, believes that Isaeus helped Demosthenes edit his initial judicial orations against his guardians. Demosthenes is also said to have admired the historian Thucydides. In the <i>Illiterate Book-Fancier,</i> Lucian mentions eight beautiful copies of Thucydides made by Demosthenes, all in the orator&#39;s own handwriting. These references hint at the orator&#39;s respect for a historian he must have assiduously studied.<p>According to <!--del_lnk--> Pseudo-Plutarch, Demosthenes was married once. The only information about his wife, whose name is unknown, is that she was the daughter of Heliodorus, a prominent citizen. Demosthenes had also a daughter, &quot;the first and only one who ever called him father&quot;, according to Aeschines&#39; trenchant comment. The girl died young and unmarried a few days before Philip&#39;s death.<p><a id="Career_as_logographer" name="Career_as_logographer"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Career as logographer</span></h3>

      <p>In order to make his living, Demosthenes became a professional <!--del_lnk--> litigant and logographer, writing speeches for use in private legal suits. He was so successful that he soon acquired wealthy and powerful clients. The Athenian logographer could remain anonymous, allowing him to serve personal interests, even if it prejudiced the client. Aeschines accused Demosthenes of unethically disclosing his clients&#39; arguments to their opponents. He attacked his political opponent, rhetorically querying: &quot;And the born traitor--how shall we recognize him? Will he not imitate you, Demosthenes, in his treatment of those whom chance throws in his way and who have trusted him? Will he not take pay for writing speeches for them to deliver in the courts, and then reveal the contents of these speeches to their opponents?&quot;<p>As an example, Aeschines accused Demosthenes of writing a speech for Phormion, a wealthy banker, and then communicating it to Apollodorus, who was bringing a capital charge against Phormion. Plutarch supported this accusation, pointing out that Demosthenes &quot;was thought to have acted dishonorably&quot;.<p><a id="Early_politics_.28354_BC.E2.80.93350_BC.29" name="Early_politics_.28354_BC.E2.80.93350_BC.29"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Early politics (354 BC&ndash;350 BC)</span></h2>

      <p>Even before he was 21 years of age in 363 BC, Demosthenes had already demonstrated an interest in politics. Then, in 363 BC, <!--del_lnk--> 359 BC and <!--del_lnk--> 357 BC, he undertook the function of the <!--del_lnk--> trierarch, being responsible for the outfitting and maintenance of a <!--del_lnk--> trireme. In <!--del_lnk--> 348 BC, he became a <!--del_lnk--> choregos, paying the costs of a <!--del_lnk--> theatrical production.<p>Although Demosthenes contended that he never plead in a single private case,  it still remains unclear when and if Demosthenes abandoned the profitable but less prestigious profession of the logographer. According to Plutarch, when he first addressed himself to the people, he was derided for his strange and uncouth style, &quot;which was cumbered with long sentences and tortured with formal arguments to a most harsh and disagreeable excess&quot;.<p>Nonetheless, some citizens discerned his talent. When he first left the <!--del_lnk--> ecclesia (the Athenian Assembly) disheartened, an old man named Eunomus encouraged him, saying that his diction was very much like that of <a href="../../wp/p/Pericles.htm" title="Pericles">Pericles</a>. Another time the ecclesia had refused to hear him and he was going home dejected, an actor named Satyrus followed him and entered into a familiar conversation with him.<p>As a boy Demosthenes had suffered from a <!--del_lnk--> speech impediment, an inarticulate and stammering pronunciation. This caused Aeschines to taunt him and refer to him in his speeches with the nickname &quot;Batalus&quot;, ostensibly invented by his own pedagogues or by the little boys with whom he was playing. According to Plutarch, he also had a weakness in his voice, &quot;a perplexed and indistinct utterance and a shortness of breath, which, by breaking and disjointing his sentences much obscured the sense and meaning of what he spoke.&quot; Demosthenes soon undertook a disciplined program to overcome these shortcomings and improve his locution. He worked on his diction, his voice and his gestures. His zeal and perseverance have passed into a proverb. It is, however, unknown whether these vignettes are factual accounts of events in Demosthenes&#39; life or merely anecdotes used to illustrate his perseverance and determination.<p><a id="Increased_political_activity" name="Increased_political_activity"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Increased political activity</span></h3>
      <p>Between <!--del_lnk--> 354 BC and <!--del_lnk--> 350 BC, Demosthenes continued practicing law privately, while, at the same time, he became increasingly interested in public affairs. He mainly remained a judicial orator, but started involving himself in the politics of the <!--del_lnk--> Athenian democracy. In <!--del_lnk--> 355 BC he wrote <i>Against Androtion</i> and a year later <i>Against Leptines</i>, two fierce attacks on individuals who attempted to repeal certain tax exemptions. The subject of <i>Against Timocrates</i> and <i>Against Aristocrates</i> is the need to crack down on corruption. Demosthenes denounced measures regarded as dishonest or unworthy of Athenian traditions. All these speeches offer early glimpses of his general principles on foreign policy, such as the importance of the navy, of alliances and of national honour.<table cellspacing="5" class="toccolours" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;">

      <p>In 354 BC, Demosthenes delivered his first political oration, <i>On the Navy.</i> The orator espoused moderation and proposed the reform of &quot;symmories&quot;(boards) as a source of funding for the Athenian fleet. In 352 BC, he delivered <i>For the Megalopolitans</i> and a year later <i>On the Liberty of the Rodians.</i> In both speeches, the orator opposed <!--del_lnk--> Eubulus, the most powerful Athenian statesman of the period <!--del_lnk--> 355 BC to <!--del_lnk--> 342 BC, who was against any intervention in the internal affairs of the other Greek cities.<p>Although none of his early orations were successful, Demosthenes established himself as an important political personality and broke with Eubulus&#39; faction, a prominent member of which was Aeschines. He laid the foundations for his future political successes and for becoming the leader of his own party. His arguments revealed his desire to articulate Athens&#39; needs and interests.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 351 BC, Demosthenes felt strong enough to express his view concerning the most important foreign policy issue facing Athens at that time: the stance his city should take towards Philip II of Macedon. According to <!--del_lnk--> Jacqueline de Romilly, a French philologist and member of the <!--del_lnk--> Acad&eacute;mie fran&ccedil;aise, the threat of Philip would give Demosthenes&#39; stances a focus and a raison d&#39;&ecirc;tre. From this point on, Demosthenes&#39; career is virtually the history of Athenian foreign policy.<p><a id="Confronting_Philip" name="Confronting_Philip"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Confronting Philip</span></h2>

      <p>Most of Demosthenes&#39; major orations were directed against the growing power of King Philip II of Macedon. Since <!--del_lnk--> 357 BC, when Philip seized <!--del_lnk--> Amphipolis and <!--del_lnk--> Pydna, Athens had been formally at war with the <!--del_lnk--> Macedonians. In <!--del_lnk--> 352 BC, Demosthenes characterized Philip as the very worst enemy of his city; this speech presaged the fierce attacks that Demosthenes would launch against the Macedonian king over the ensuing years. A year later he criticized those dismissing Philip as a person of no account and warned them that he was as dangerous as the King of <!--del_lnk--> Persia.<p>In 352 BC, Athenian troops successfully opposed Philip at <!--del_lnk--> Thermopylae, but the Macedonian victory over the <!--del_lnk--> Phocians at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Crocus Field shook the orator. The theme of the <i>First Philippic</i> (351 BC-350 BC) was preparedness and the reform of the <!--del_lnk--> theoric fund, a mainstay of Eubulus&#39; policy. In his rousing call for resistance, Demosthenes asked his countrymen to take the necessary action and asserted that &quot;for a free people there can be no greater compulsion than shame for their position&quot;.<table cellspacing="5" class="toccolours" style="float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;">

      <p>From this moment until <!--del_lnk--> 341 BC, all of Demosthenes&#39; speeches referred to the same issue, the struggle against Philip. In <!--del_lnk--> 349 BC, Philip attacked <!--del_lnk--> Olynthus, an ally of Athens. In the three <i>Olynthiacs</i>, Demosthenes criticized his compatriots for being idle and urged Athens to help Olynthus. He also insulted Philip, calling him a &quot;barbarian&quot;. Despite Demosthenes&#39; warnings, the Athenians engaged in a useless war in <!--del_lnk--> Euboea and offered no military support to Olynthus.<p><a id="Case_of_Meidias_.28348_BC.29" name="Case_of_Meidias_.28348_BC.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Case of Meidias (348 BC)</span></h3>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 348 BC a peculiar event occurred: <!--del_lnk--> Meidias, a wealthy Athenian, slapped in public Demosthenes, who was at the time a choregos at the <!--del_lnk--> Greater Dionysia, a large religious festival in honour of the god <!--del_lnk--> Dionysus. Meidias was a friend of Eubulus and supporter of the unsuccessful excursion in Euboea. He also was an old enemy of the orator; in 361 BC he had broken violently into the house of Demosthenes, with his brother Thrasylochus, to take possession of it.<table cellspacing="5" class="toccolours" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;">

      <p>Demosthenes decided to prosecute his wealthy opponent and wrote the judicial oration <i>Against Meidias</i>. This speech gives valuable information about Athenian law at the time and especially about the Greek concept of <!--del_lnk--> hybris (aggravated assault), which was regarded as a crime not only against the city but against society as a whole. The orator underscored that a democratic state perishes, if the <!--del_lnk--> rule of law is undermined by wealthy and unscrupulous men, and asserted that the citizens acquire power and authority in all state affairs due &quot;to the strength of the laws&quot;. According to philologist <!--del_lnk--> Henri Weil, Demosthenes dropped his charges for political reasons and never delivered <i>Against Meidias</i>, although Aeschines maintained that Demosthenes received money to drop the case.<p><a id="Peace_of_Philocrates_.28347_BC.E2.80.93345_BC.29" name="Peace_of_Philocrates_.28347_BC.E2.80.93345_BC.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Peace of Philocrates (347 BC&ndash;345 BC)</span></h3>
      <p>In 348 BC, Philip conquered Olynthus and razed it to the ground. In the wake of this Macedonian victory, which also included the conquest of the entire <!--del_lnk--> Chalcidice and all the states of the Chalcidic federation that Olynthus had once led, Athens sought to make peace with Macedon. Demosthenes was among those who orientated themselves towards a compromise. In <!--del_lnk--> 347 BC, an Athenian delegation, comprising Demosthenes, Aeschines and Philocrates, was officially sent to <!--del_lnk--> Pella to negotiate a peace treaty. In his first encounter with Philip, Demosthenes is said to have collapsed because of his fright.<p>Philip imposed his own harsh terms that the ecclesia officially accepted. Nevertheless, when an Athenian delegation travelled to Pella to put Philip under oath for the final conclusion of the treaty, the King of Macedon was campaigning abroad. He expected that he would hold safely any Athenian possessions which he might seize before the ratification. Being very anxious about the delay, Demosthenes insisted that the embassy should travel to the place where they would find Philip and swear him in without delay. Despite his suggestions, the Athenian envoys, including himself and Aeschines, remained in Pella, until Philip successfully concluded his excursion in <!--del_lnk--> Thrace.<p>Finally, peace was sworn in <!--del_lnk--> Pherae, but Demosthenes accused the other envoys of venality. Just after the conclusion of the Peace of Philocrates, Philip passed Thermopylae, and subdued <!--del_lnk--> Phocis; Athens made no move to support the Phocians. Supported by <!--del_lnk--> Thebes and <!--del_lnk--> Thessaly, Macedon took control of Phocis&#39; votes in the <!--del_lnk--> Amphictyonic League, a Greek religious organization formed to support the greater temples of <a href="../../wp/a/Apollo.htm" title="Apollo">Apollo</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Demeter. Despite some reluctance on the part of the Athenian leaders, Athens finally accepted Philip&#39;s entry into the Council of the League. Demosthenes was among those who recommended this stance in his oration <i><!--del_lnk--> On the Peace</i>.<p><a id="Second_and_Third_Philippic_.28344_BC.E2.80.93341_BC.29" name="Second_and_Third_Philippic_.28344_BC.E2.80.93341_BC.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Second and Third Philippic (344 BC&ndash;341 BC)</span></h3>

      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 344 BC Demosthenes travelled to <!--del_lnk--> Peloponnese, in order to detach as many cities as possible from Macedon&#39;s influence, but his efforts were generally unsuccessful. Most of the Peloponnesians saw Philip as the guarantor of their freedom and sent a joint embassy to Athens to express their grievances against Demosthenes&#39; activities. In response to these complaints, Demosthenes delivered the <i>Second Philippic</i>, a vehement attack against Philip. In <!--del_lnk--> 343 BC Demosthenes delivered <i><!--del_lnk--> On the False Embassy</i> against Aeschines, who was facing a charge of high treason. Nonetheless, Aeschines was acquitted by the narrow margin of thirty votes by a <!--del_lnk--> jury which may have numbered as many as 1,501.<p>In 343 BC, Macedonian forces were conducting campaigns in <!--del_lnk--> Epirus and, a year later, Philip campaigned in <!--del_lnk--> Thrace. He also negotiated with the Athenians an amendment to the Peace of Philocrates. When the Macedonian army approached <!--del_lnk--> Chersonese (now known as the <!--del_lnk--> Gallipoli Peninsula), an Athenian general named <!--del_lnk--> Diopeithes ravaged the maritime district of Thrace, thus inciting Philip&#39;s rage. Because of this turbulence, the Athenian Assembly convened. Demosthenes delivered <i>On the Chersonese</i> and convinced the Athenians not to recall Diopeithes. During the same year, he delivered the <i>Third Philippic</i>, which is considered to be the best of his political orations. Using all the power of his eloquence, he demanded resolute action against Philip and called for a burst of energy from the Athenian people. He told them that it would be &quot;better to die a thousand times than pay court to Philip&quot;. Demosthenes now dominated Athenian politics and was able to considerably weaken the pro-Macedonian faction of Aeschines.<p><a id="Battle_of_Chaeronea_.28338_BC.29" name="Battle_of_Chaeronea_.28338_BC.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)</span></h3>

      <p>In 341 BC Demosthenes was sent to <!--del_lnk--> Byzantium, where he renewed the alliance between that city and Athens. Thanks to the orator&#39;s diplomatic manoeuvres <!--del_lnk--> Abydos also entered into an alliance with Athens. These developments worried Philip and increased his anger towards Demosthenes. The Athenian Assembly, however, laid aside Philip&#39;s grievances against Demosthenes&#39; conduct and denounced the peace treaty, an action equivalent to an official declaration of war. In 339 BC Philip made his last and most effective bid to conquer southern <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greece</a>, assisted by Aeschines&#39; stance in the Amphictyonic Council. During a meeting of the Council, Philip accused the <!--del_lnk--> Amfissian <!--del_lnk--> Locrians of intruding on consecrated ground. The presiding officer of the Council, a Thessalian named Cottyphus, proposed the convocation of an Amphictyonic Congress to inflict a harsh punishment upon the Locrians. Aeschines agreed with this proposition and maintained that the Athenians should participate in the Congress. Demosthenes reversed, however, Aeschines&#39; initiatives and Athens finally abstained. After the failure of a first military excursion against the Locrians, the summer session of the Amphictyonic Council gave command of the league&#39;s forces to Philip and asked him to lead a second excursion. Philip decided to act at once; in the winter of <!--del_lnk--> 339 BC&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 338 BC, he passed through Thermopylae, entered Amfissa and defeated the Locrians. After this significant victory, Philip swiftly entered Phocis in 338 BC. He then turned south-east down the <!--del_lnk--> Cephissus valley, seized <!--del_lnk--> Elateia, and restored the fortifications of the city.<p>At the same time, Athens orchestrated the creation of an alliance with Euboea, <!--del_lnk--> Megara, <!--del_lnk--> Achaea, <!--del_lnk--> Corinth, <!--del_lnk--> Acarnania and some other states in the Peloponnese. However, the most desirable ally for Athens was Thebes. Therefore, Demosthenes was sent to the Boeotian city by Athens; Philip also sent a deputation, but the Athenian orator succeeded in securing an alliance with Thebes. Demosthenes&#39; oration before the Theban people is not extant and, therefore, the arguments he used to convince the Thebans remain unknown. In any case, the alliance came at a price; Thebes&#39; control of Boeotia was recognized, Thebes was to command solely on land and jointly at sea, and Athens was to pay two thirds of the campaign&#39;s cost.<p>While the Athenians and the Thebans were preparing themselves for war, Philip made a final attempt to appease his enemies, proposing in vain a new peace treaty. After a few trivial encounters between the two sides, which resulted in minor Athenian victories, Philip drew the <!--del_lnk--> phalanx of the Athenian and Theban confederates in a plain near <!--del_lnk--> Chaeronea, where he defeated them. Demosthenes fought as a mere <!--del_lnk--> hoplite. Such was Philip&#39;s hate for Demosthenes that, according to <!--del_lnk--> Diodorus Siculus, the King after his victory sneered at the misfortunes of the Athenian statesman. However, the Athenian orator and statesman <!--del_lnk--> Demades is said to have remarked: &quot;O King, when Fortune has cast you in the role of <a href="../../wp/a/Agamemnon.htm" title="Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>, are you not ashamed to act the part of <!--del_lnk--> Thersites (an obscene soldier of the Greek army during the <a href="../../wp/t/Trojan_War.htm" title="Trojan War">Trojan War</a>)&nbsp;?&quot; Stung by these words, Philip immediately altered his demeanour.<p><a id="Last_political_initiatives_and_death" name="Last_political_initiatives_and_death"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Last political initiatives and death</span></h2>

      <p>After Chaeronea, Philip inflicted a harsh punishment upon Thebes, but made peace with Athens on very lenient terms. Demosthenes encouraged the fortification of Athens and was chosen by the ecclesia to deliver the <!--del_lnk--> Funeral Oration. In 337 BC, Philip created the <!--del_lnk--> League of Corinth, a confederation of Greek states under his leadership, and returned to Pella. In <!--del_lnk--> 336 BC, Philip was assassinated at the wedding of his daughter, Cleopatra of Macedonia, to King <!--del_lnk--> Alexander of Epirus. After Philip&#39;s death, the army proclaimed Alexander, then aged 20, as the new King of Macedon. Greek cities like Athens and Thebes saw in this change of leadership an opportunity to regain their full independence. Demosthenes celebrated Philip&#39;s assassination and played a leading part in his city&#39;s uprising. According to Aeschines, &quot;it was but the seventh day after the death of his daughter, and though the ceremonies of mourning were not yet completed, he put a garland on his head and white raiment on his body, and there he stood making thank-offerings, violating all decency.&quot; Demosthenes also sent envoys to <!--del_lnk--> Attalus, whom he considered to be an internal opponent of Alexander. Nonetheless, Alexander moved swiftly to Thebes, which submitted shortly after the King&#39;s appearance at its gates. When the Athenians learned that Alexander had moved quickly to Boeotia, they panicked and begged the new King of Macedon for mercy. Alexander admonished them but imposed no punishment.<table cellspacing="5" class="toccolours" style="float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;">

      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 335 BC Alexander felt free to engage the <!--del_lnk--> Thracians and the <!--del_lnk--> Illyrians. While he was campaigning in the north, the Thebans and the Athenians rebelled once again, believing in the rumors that Alexander was dead. <!--del_lnk--> Darius III of Persia financed the Greek cities that rose up against Macedon, and Demosthenes is said to have received about 300 talents on behalf of Athens and to have faced accusations of embezzlement. Alexander reacted immediately and razed Thebes to the ground. He did not attack Athens, but demanded the exile of all anti-Macedonian politicians, Demosthenes first of all, a request turned down by the ecclesia.<p>Despite the unsuccessful ventures against Philip and Alexander, the Athenians still respected Demosthenes. In 336 BC, the orator Ctesiphon proposed that Athens honour Demosthenes for his services to the city by presenting him, according to custom, with a golden crown. This proposal became a political issue and in <!--del_lnk--> 330 BC, Aeschines prosecuted Ctesiphon on charges of legal irregularities. In his most brilliant speech, <i>On the Crown,</i> Demosthenes effectively defended Ctesiphon and attacked vehemently those who would have preferred peace with Macedon. The orator was unrepentant about his past actions and policies and insisted that, when in power, the constant aim of his policies was the honour and the ascendancy of his country; and on every occasion and in all business he preserved his loyalty to Athens. He finally defeated Aeschines, although his enemy&#39;s legal objections to the crowning were probably valid.<p><a id="Case_of_Harpalus" name="Case_of_Harpalus"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Case of Harpalus</span></h3>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 324 BC Harpalus, to whom Alexander had entrusted huge treasures, absconded and sought refuge in Athens. Demosthenes, at first, advised that he be chased out of the city. Finally, Harpalus was imprisoned despite the dissent of <!--del_lnk--> Hypereides, an anti-Macedonian statesman and former ally of Demosthenes. The ecclesia, after a proposal of Demosthenes, decided to take control of Harpalus&#39; money, which was entrusted to a committee presided over by Demosthenes. When the committee counted the treasure, they found they only had half the money Harpalus had declared he had. Nevertheless, they decided not to disclose the deficit. When Harpalus escaped, the <!--del_lnk--> Areopagus conducted an inquiry and charged Demosthenes with mishandling 20 talents. During Demosthenes&#39; trial, Hypereides argued that the defendant did not disclose the huge deficit, because he was bribed by Harpalus. The orator was fined and imprisoned, but he soon escaped. It remains unclear whether the accusations against him were just or not. In any case, the Athenians soon repealed the sentence.<table cellspacing="5" class="toccolours" style="float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;">

However, <!--del_lnk--> Antipater, Alexander&#39;s successor, quelled all opposition and demanded that the Athenians turn over Demosthenes and Hypereides, among others.

Demosthenes escaped to a sanctuary on the island of <!--del_lnk--> Calauria, where he was later discovered by Archias, a confidant of Antipater.

      <p>Plutarch lauds Demosthenes for not being of a fickle disposition. Rebutting historian <!--del_lnk--> Theopompus, the biographer insists that for &quot;the same party and post in politics which he held from the beginning, to these he kept constant to the end; and was so far from leaving them while he lived, that he chose rather to forsake his life than his purpose&quot;.  On the other hand, <!--del_lnk--> Polybius, a Greek historian of the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean</a> world, was highly critical of Demosthenes&#39; policies. Polybius accused him of having launched unjustified verbal attacks on great men of other cities, branding them unjustly as traitors to the Greeks. The historian maintains that Demosthenes measured everything by the interests of his own city, imagining that all the Greeks ought to have their eyes fixed upon Athens. According to Polybius, the only thing the Athenians eventually got by their opposition to Philip was the defeat at Chaeronea. &quot;And had it not been for the king&#39;s magnanimity and regard for his own reputation, their misfortunes would have gone even further, thanks to the policy of Demosthenes&quot;.<table cellspacing="5" class="toccolours" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;">

      <p>Paparregopoulus extols Demosthenes&#39; patriotism, but criticizes him as being short-sighted. According to this critique, Demosthenes should have understood that the ancient Greek states could only survive unified under the leadership of Macedon. Therefore, Demosthenes is accused of misjudging events, opponents and opportunities and of being unable to foresee Philip&#39;s inevitable triumph. He is criticized for having overrated Athens&#39; capacity to revive and challenge Macedon. His city had lost most of its Aegean allies, whereas Philip had consolidated his hold over <!--del_lnk--> Macedonia and was master of enormous mineral wealth. Chris Carey, a professor of Greek in <!--del_lnk--> UCL, concludes that Demosthenes was a better orator and political operator than strategist. Nevertheless, the same scholar underscores that &quot;pragmatists&quot; like Aeschines or Phocion had no inspiring vision to rival that of Demosthenes. The orator asked the Athenians to choose that which is just and honorable, before their own safety and preservation. The people preferred Demosthenes&#39; activism and even the bitter defeat at Chaeronea was regarded as a price worth paying in the attempt to retain freedom and influence. According to Professor of Greek Arthur Wallace Pickard-Cambridge, success may be a poor criterion for judging the actions of people like Demosthenes, who were motivated by the ideal of political liberty. Athens was asked by Philip to sacrifice its freedom and its democracy, while Demosthenes longed for the city&#39;s brilliance. He endeavored to revive its imperilled values and, thus, he became an &quot;educator of the people&quot; (in the words of <!--del_lnk--> Werner Jaeger).<p>The fact that Demosthenes fought at the battle of Chaeronea as a hoplite indicates that he lacked any military skills. According to historian <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Babington Macaulay, in his time the division between political and military offices was beginning to be strongly marked. Almost no politician, with the exception of <!--del_lnk--> Phocion, was at the same time an apt orator and a competent <!--del_lnk--> general. Demosthenes dealt in policies and ideas, and war was not his business. This contrast between Demosthenes&#39; intellectual prowess and his deficiencies in terms of vigor, stamina, military skill and strategic vision is illustrated by the inscription his countrymen engraved on the base of his statue:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>According to <!--del_lnk--> Dionysius of Halicarnassus, a Greek historian and teacher of rhetoric, Demosthenes represented the final stage in the development of Attic prose. Dionysius asserts that the orator brought together the best features of the basic types of style; he used the middle or normal type style ordinarily and applied the archaic type and the type of plain elegance where they were fitting. In each one of the three types he was better than its special masters. He is, therefore, regarded as a consummate orator, adept in the techniques of oratory, which are brought together in his work. In his initial judicial orations, the influence of both <!--del_lnk--> Lysias and Isaeus is obvious, but his marked, original style is already revealed.<p>According to the classical scholar Harry Thurston Peck, Demosthenes &quot;affects no learning; he aims at no elegance; he seeks no glaring ornaments; he rarely touches the heart with a soft or melting appeal, and when he does, it is only with an effect in which a third-rate speaker would have surpassed him. He had no wit, no humour, no vivacity, in our acceptance of these terms. The secret of his power is simple, for it lies essentially in the fact that his political principles were interwoven with his very spirit.&quot; In this judgement, Peck agrees with Jaeger, who said that the imminent political decision imbued the orator&#39;s speech with a fascinating artistic power. Demosthenes was apt at combining abruptness with the extended period, brevity with breadth. Hence, his style harmonizes with his fervent commitment. His language is simple and natural, never far-fetched or artificial. According to Jebb, Demosthenes was a true artist who could make his art obey him. For his part, Aeschines stigmatized his intensity, attributing to his rival strings of absurd and incoherent images. Dionysius stated that Demosthenes&#39; only shortcoming is the lack of humor, although Quintilian regards this deficiency as a virtue. The main criticism of Demosthenes&#39; art, however, seems to have rested chiefly on his known reluctance to speak extempore; he often declined to comment on subjects he had not studied beforehand. However, he gave the most elaborate preparation to all his speeches and, therefore, his arguments were the products of careful study. He was also famous for his caustic wit.<p>According to Cicero, Demosthenes regarded &quot;delivery&quot; (gestures, voice etc.) as more important than style. Although he lacked Aeschines&#39; charming voice and Demades&#39;s skill at improvisation, he made efficient use of his body to accentuate his words. Thus he managed to project his ideas and arguments much more forcefully. Nonetheless, his delivery was not accepted by everybody in antiquity: <!--del_lnk--> Demetrius Phalereus and the comedians ridiculed Demosthenes&#39; &quot;theatricality&quot;, whilst Aeschines regarded Leodamas of <!--del_lnk--> Acharnae as superior to him.<p><a id="Rhetorical_legacy" name="Rhetorical_legacy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Rhetorical legacy</span></h3>

      <p>Demosthenes&#39; fame continued down the ages. The scholars at the <a href="../../wp/l/Library_of_Alexandria.htm" title="Library of Alexandria">Library of Alexandria</a> carefully edited the manuscripts of his speeches, while Roman schoolboys studied his art as part of their own oratorical training. <!--del_lnk--> Juvenal acclaimed him as &quot;largus et exundans ingenii fons&quot; (a large and overflowing fountain of genius) and Cicero was inspired by Demosthenes for his speeches against <a href="../../wp/m/Mark_Antony.htm" title="Mark Antony">Mark Antony</a>, which were called <!--del_lnk--> Philippics too. Plutarch drew attention in his <i>Life of Demosthenes</i> to the strong similarities between the personalities and careers of Demosthenes and Marcus Tullius Cicero:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

        <td>The divine power seems originally to have designed Demosthenes and Cicero upon the same plan, giving them many similarities in their natural characters, as their passion for distinction and their love of liberty in civil life, and their want of courage in dangers and war, and at the same time also to have added many accidental resemblances. I think there can hardly be found two other orators, who, from small and obscure beginnings, became so great and mighty; who both contested with kings and tyrants; both lost their daughters, were driven out of their country, and returned with honour; who, flying from thence again, were both seized upon by their enemies, and at last ended their lives with the liberty of their countrymen.</td>

      <p>During the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> and <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, Demosthenes had a reputation for eloquence. He was read more than any other ancient orator; only Cicero offered any real competition. French author and lawyer <!--del_lnk--> Guillaume du Vair praises his speeches for their artful arrangement and elegant style, while <!--del_lnk--> John Jewel, <!--del_lnk--> bishop of Salisbury, and <!--del_lnk--> Jacques Amyot, a French Renaissance writer and translator, regard Demosthenes as a great or even the &quot;supreme&quot; orator.<p>In <a href="../../wp/m/Modern_history.htm" title="Modern history">modern history</a>, famous orators like <!--del_lnk--> Henry Clay would <!--del_lnk--> mimic Demosthenes&#39; technique. His ideas and principles survived, influencing prominent politicians and movements of our times. Hence, he constituted a source of inspiration for the authors of the <!--del_lnk--> Federalist Papers (series of 85 articles arguing for the ratification of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Constitution.htm" title="United States Constitution">United States Constitution</a>) and for the major orators of the <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Georges Clemenceau was among those who idealized the Athenian orator and wrote a book about him. For his part, Nietzsche often composed his sentences according to the paradigms of Demosthenes, whose style he admired. During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the fighters of the <!--del_lnk--> French Resistance identified themselves with Demosthenes, while they gave <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> the name of Philip. Therefore, the Athenian statesman was recognized as the symbol of independence and as a synonym of resistance against any tyrannical oppression. He also constituted a source of inspiration for writers of <!--del_lnk--> modern literature, such as <!--del_lnk--> Mary Renault and <!--del_lnk--> Orson Scott Card.<p><a id="Works" name="Works"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Works</span></h2>
      <p>Demosthenes must have written down and published most of his orations. After his death, texts of his speeches survived in Athens and the <a href="../../wp/l/Library_of_Alexandria.htm" title="Library of Alexandria">Library of Alexandria</a>. In Alexandria these texts were incorporated into the body of classical Greek literature that was preserved, catalogued and studied by scholars of the <!--del_lnk--> Hellenistic period. From then until the fourth century CE, copies of his orations multiplied and they were in a relatively good position to survive the tense period from the sixth till the ninth century CE. In the end, sixty-one of Demosthenes&#39; survived till the present day. <!--del_lnk--> Friedrich Blass, a German classical scholar, believes that nine more speeches were recorded by the orator, but they are not extant. Modern editions of these speeches are based on four <!--del_lnk--> manuscripts of the tenth and eleventh century CE. The authorship of at least nine of the sixty-one orations is disputed.<p>Fifty-six <!--del_lnk--> prologues and six letters are also extant. The prologues were openings of Demosthenes&#39;s speeches. They were collected for the Library of Alexandria by <!--del_lnk--> Callimachus, who believed that Demosthenes composed them. Modern scholars are divided: some of them reject them, while others, such as Blass, believe they are genuine. The letters are written under Demosthenes&#39;s name, but their authorship has been fiercely debated.<table align="center" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" class="toccolours" style="text-align: left; width:100%; margin;1em auto; clear:both;">
