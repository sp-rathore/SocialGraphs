      <p>Blanchflower attended Varndean Grammar School for Boys in <a href="../../wp/b/Brighton.htm" title="Brighton">Brighton</a> and Cantonian High School in <a href="../../wp/c/Cardiff.htm" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>. He went on to earn a <!--del_lnk--> B.A. in <!--del_lnk--> Social Sciences (<a href="../../wp/e/Economics.htm" title="Economics">Economics</a>) at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Leicester in <!--del_lnk--> 1973 and a Postgraduate Certificate in Education at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Birmingham in <!--del_lnk--> 1975. He received an <!--del_lnk--> M.Sc. (Economics) at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Wales in <!--del_lnk--> 1981 and his <!--del_lnk--> Ph.D. in <!--del_lnk--> 1985 at the <!--del_lnk--> University of London. He was also awarded an <!--del_lnk--> honorary <!--del_lnk--> A.M. in <!--del_lnk--> 1996 at <!--del_lnk--> Dartmouth College.<p><a id="Work_in_Economics" name="Work_in_Economics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Work in Economics</span></h2>
      <p>Blanchflower served as a Research Officer at the Institute for Employment Research at <!--del_lnk--> University of Warwick from <!--del_lnk--> 1984 to <!--del_lnk--> 1986, when he became a Lecturer at the Department of Economics at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Surrey, a post he held until 1989 when he moved to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>.<p>He has been a member of the Editorial Board of <i><!--del_lnk--> Small Business Economics</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Scottish Journal of Political Economy</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Industrial &amp; Labor Relations Review</i>.<p>He has also been a Research Associate at the Centre for Economic Performance at the <!--del_lnk--> London School of Economics and at the <!--del_lnk--> Canadian International Labour Network. <p><a id="The_Wage_Curve" name="The_Wage_Curve"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"><i>The Wage Curve</i></span></h3>
      <p>Blanchflower&#39;s <i>The Wage Curve</i> (with <!--del_lnk--> Andrew Oswald), with eight years of data from 4 million people in 16 countries, argued that the <!--del_lnk--> wage curve, which plots <!--del_lnk--> wages against <!--del_lnk--> unemployment, is negatively sloping, reversing generations of macroeconomic theory. &quot;The <!--del_lnk--> Phillips Curve is wrong, it&#39;s as fundamental as that,&quot; said Blanchflower. <i><!--del_lnk--> The Guardian</i> praised the findings as &quot;one of the most devastating findings of contemporary economics&quot;.  The implications, that wages are highest when unemployment is lowest and that increased unemployment drives down wages, have been suggested periodically in economics since the publication of <a href="../../wp/k/Karl_Marx.htm" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>&#39;s <i>Wage-Labour and Capital</i>, but were not accepted by the mainstream.<p><a id="Happiness" name="Happiness"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Happiness</span></h3>
      <p>Much of Blanchflower&#39;s work has focused on the economics of <!--del_lnk--> happiness. He has posited a correlation between age and happiness, declining through the 20s, 30s, and 40s before increasing in retirement.  He has been labelled a &quot;happiness guru&quot; for his ability to quantify the increase in happiness for individuals who are <!--del_lnk--> married or have <!--del_lnk--> sex frequently, work which has applications in <!--del_lnk--> divorce law and <!--del_lnk--> pharmaceutical <a href="../../wp/a/Advertising.htm" title="Advertising">advertising</a>. <p>He has been interviewed several times on <!--del_lnk--> NPR   and <!--del_lnk--> New Hampshire <!--del_lnk--> Public Radio  about his work in this area.<p><a id="Blanchflower_v._Blanchflower" name="Blanchflower_v._Blanchflower"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Blanchflower v. Blanchflower</span></h2>

      </dl>
      <p>In 2003 Blanchflower filed for an &quot;at fault&quot; divorce from his wife Sian Blanchflower on the grounds that she was having an adulterous affair with another woman. Mrs. Blanchflower admitted to the affair, but argued that the affair did not constitute adultery under <!--del_lnk--> New Hampshire law.  After a lower court initially sided with Mr. Blanchflower, the <!--del_lnk--> New Hampshire Supreme Court reversed the lower court&#39;s decision and ruled 3-2  in favour of Mrs. Blanchflower, concluding that adultery must involve <!--del_lnk--> sexual intercourse and that same-sex relations could not constitute sexual intercourse, based on the 1961 edition of <i><!--del_lnk--> Webster&#39;s Third New International Dictionary</i>.  Some <!--del_lnk--> gay-rights groups, who had filed <i><!--del_lnk--> amicus curiae</i> briefs in favour of Mr. Blanchflower, condemned the ruling, which is seen as a setback to the <!--del_lnk--> same-sex marriage movement. <p><a id="Selected_works" name="Selected_works"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Selected works</span></h2>
