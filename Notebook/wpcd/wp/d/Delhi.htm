The name <i>Delhi</i> also refers to the <b><a href="../../wp/d/Delhi.htm" title="National Capital Territory of Delhi">National Capital Territory of Delhi</a></b> (NCT), which is a special <!--del_lnk--> union territory jointly administered by the <!--del_lnk--> Central government, the NCT elected government and three municipal corporations. The metropolis of Delhi and the National Capital Territory of Delhi are coextensive and for most practical purposes they are considered to be the same entity. <a href="../../wp/n/New_Delhi.htm" title="New Delhi">New Delhi</a>, an urban area within the metropolis of Delhi, is the seat of the <!--del_lnk--> Government of India.<p>With a population of 15.3 million people (2005 figure), Delhi is the <!--del_lnk--> seventh most populous metropolis in the world . Delhi&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan area, informally known as the <!--del_lnk--> National Capital Region (NCR), comprises the NCT, the neighbouring satellite towns of <!--del_lnk--> Faridabad and <!--del_lnk--> Gurgaon in <!--del_lnk--> Haryana, and <!--del_lnk--> NOIDA and <!--del_lnk--> Ghaziabad in <!--del_lnk--> Uttar Pradesh. Altogether, the NCR is the <!--del_lnk--> world&#39;s sixth most populous <!--del_lnk--> agglomeration with a population of 19.7 million.<p>Delhi was the capital of several empires in <!--del_lnk--> ancient India and has over 60,000 recognized monuments erected over several millennia. Delhi derives its historic importance from its position in <!--del_lnk--> northern India between the <!--del_lnk--> Aravalli Hills to the southwest and the <!--del_lnk--> Yamuna River to the east. This enabled it to dominate the old trade routes from northwest India to the <!--del_lnk--> Gangetic Plains. As a result, it has long been an important cultural, political, and intellectual centre. Due to a high migration rate, Delhi registers as one of the fastest growing cities in Asia. As a consequence, it faces key issues like <!--del_lnk--> environmental degradation, <!--del_lnk--> air and <!--del_lnk--> water pollution, <!--del_lnk--> traffic congestion, and acute power and water shortages.<p>

      <p>The name &quot;Delhi&quot; is of uncertain <!--del_lnk--> etymology. One suggestion is that its <!--del_lnk--> eponym is &quot;Dhillu&quot;, the name of a <!--del_lnk--> Mauryan <!--del_lnk--> maharaja. However, some historians believe that the word <i>Dilli</i>, another name for Delhi, orignated from the <!--del_lnk--> Persian word <i>dahleez</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Urdu: <span dir="rtl" lang="ur" style="white-space: nowrap;" xml:lang="ur">&#x62F;&#x6C1;&#x644;&#x6CC;&#x632;</span>&lrm;), meaning &quot;<!--del_lnk--> frontier&quot; or &quot;threshold&quot;. Another theory suggests that the city&#39;s original name was Dhillika. The <!--del_lnk--> Persianized surname Dahelvi is also related to residents of Delhi. The <a href="../../wp/h/Hindi.htm" title="Hindi">Hindi</a>/<!--del_lnk--> Prakrit word <i>dhili</i> (&quot;loose&quot;) was also used for the locality, gradually morphing into the local name &quot;Dilli&quot;.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>Delhi is believed to be the site of <!--del_lnk--> Indraprastha, capital of the <!--del_lnk--> Pandavas in the Indian <!--del_lnk--> epic <a href="../../wp/m/Mahabharata.htm" title="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>, founded perhaps as long ago as <!--del_lnk--> 5000 BC. Ancient Hindu texts describe a city in North India called <!--del_lnk--> Indraprastha, which means &quot;city of <!--del_lnk--> Indra&quot; (God). In later years, according to the ancient texts, parts of the city came to be known as <!--del_lnk--> Hastinapur or &quot;the city of <!--del_lnk--> elephants&quot;. Archaeological evidence suggests that Indraprastha once stood where the <!--del_lnk--> Old Fort is today. The earliest architectural <!--del_lnk--> relics date back to the <!--del_lnk--> Maurya Period (c. <!--del_lnk--> 300 BC); since then the site has seen continuous settlement. The famous <!--del_lnk--> Iron pillar near the <!--del_lnk--> Qutub Minar was commissioned by the emperor <!--del_lnk--> Kumara Gupta I of the <!--del_lnk--> Gupta dynasty (320-540) and transplanted to Delhi during the 10th century. Eight major cities have been situated in the Delhi area. The first four cities were in the southern part of present-day Delhi.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Tomara <!--del_lnk--> Rajput dynasty founded the city of Lal Kot in 736 A.D. near the Qutub Minar. The epic <i><!--del_lnk--> Prithvirajaraso</i> names the <!--del_lnk--> Rajput <!--del_lnk--> Anangpal as the founder of Delhi. The <!--del_lnk--> Chauhan Rajput kings of <!--del_lnk--> Ajmer conquered Lal Kot in 1180 A.D. and renamed it Qila Rai Pithora. The Chauhan king <!--del_lnk--> Prithviraj III was defeated in 1192 by the <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghan</a> <!--del_lnk--> Muhammad Ghori. From 1206, Delhi became the capital of the <!--del_lnk--> Delhi Sultanate under the <!--del_lnk--> Slave Dynasty. The first <a href="../../wp/s/Sultan.htm" title="Sultan">Sultan</a> of Delhi, <!--del_lnk--> Qutb-ud-din Aybak was a former <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slave</a> who rose through the ranks to become a general, a governor and then <a href="../../wp/s/Sultan.htm" title="Sultan">Sultan</a> of Delhi. Qutb-ud-din started the construction the Qutub Minar to commemorate his victory but died before its completion. In the Qutb complex he also constructed the <!--del_lnk--> Quwwat-al-Islam (might of Islam), which is the earliest extant <a href="../../wp/m/Mosque.htm" title="Mosque">mosque</a> in India. After the end of the Slave dynasty, a succession of Turkic and Central Asian dynasties, the <!--del_lnk--> Khilji dynasty, the <!--del_lnk--> Tughluq dynasty, the <!--del_lnk--> Sayyid dynasty and the <!--del_lnk--> Lodhi dynasty held power in the late medieval period and built a sequence of forts and townships that are part of the <!--del_lnk--> seven cities of Delhi. In 1526, following the <!--del_lnk--> First Battle of Panipat, Zahiruddin <a href="../../wp/b/Babur.htm" title="Babur">Babur</a>, the former ruler of <!--del_lnk--> Fergana, defeated the last Lodhi sultan and founded the <!--del_lnk--> Mughal dynasty which ruled from Delhi, <!--del_lnk--> Agra and <!--del_lnk--> Lahore.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In the mid-sixteenth century there was an interruption in the Mughal rule of India as <!--del_lnk--> Sher Shah Suri defeated Babur&#39;s son <!--del_lnk--> Humayun and forced him to flee to <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Empire.htm" title="Persian Empire">Persia</a>. Sher Shah Suri built the sixth city of Delhi, as well as the old fort known as <!--del_lnk--> Purana Qila and the <!--del_lnk--> Grand Trunk Road. After Sher Shah Suri&rsquo;s early death, Humayun recovered the throne with Persian help. The third and greatest Mughal emperor, <a href="../../wp/a/Akbar.htm" title="Akbar">Akbar</a>, moved the capital to <!--del_lnk--> Agra resulting in a decline in the fortunes of Delhi. In the mid-seventeenth century, the Mughal Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Shah Jahan (1628-1658) built the seventh city of Delhi that sometimes bears his name (<!--del_lnk--> Shahjahanabad), and is more commonly known as the old city or old Delhi. The old city served as the capital of the later Mughal Empire from 1638 onwards, when Shah Jahan transferred the capital back from Agra. <!--del_lnk--> Aurangzeb (1658-1707) crowned himself as emperor in Delhi in 1658. In <!--del_lnk--> 1761, Delhi was raided by <!--del_lnk--> Ahmed Shah Abdali after the <!--del_lnk--> Third battle of Panipat.<p>Delhi passed to <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British</a> control in 1857 after the <!--del_lnk--> First War of Indian Independence. Shortly after the First War of Independence, <!--del_lnk--> Calcutta was declared the capital of <!--del_lnk--> British India and Delhi was made a district province of the <!--del_lnk--> Punjab. But in 1911, Delhi was again declared as the capital of India. Parts of the old city were pulled down to create <a href="../../wp/n/New_Delhi.htm" title="New Delhi">New Delhi</a>, a monumental new quarter of the city designed by the British <!--del_lnk--> architect <!--del_lnk--> Edwin Lutyens to house the government buildings. New Delhi, also known as Lutyens&#39; Delhi, was officially declared as the seat of the <!--del_lnk--> Government of India after <!--del_lnk--> independence in 1947. During the <!--del_lnk--> Partition of India thousands of <!--del_lnk--> Hindu and <!--del_lnk--> Sikh refugees from <!--del_lnk--> West Punjab and <!--del_lnk--> Sindh migrated to Delhi.<p>In 1984, the assassination of then Prime Minister of India, <a href="../../wp/i/Indira_Gandhi.htm" title="Indira Gandhi">Indira Gandhi</a>, led to a <!--del_lnk--> violent backlash against the Sikh community, resulting in more than two thousand seven hundred deaths.<p>In 1991, the <!--del_lnk--> Parliament of India passed the National Capital Territory Act which gave Delhi its own <!--del_lnk--> legislative assembly, though with limited powers. On February 16, 2006 the <!--del_lnk--> Delhi High Court passed a notice to the <!--del_lnk--> Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) to <!--del_lnk--> remove all commercial ventures within residential areas in the city.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>Delhi is located at 28.38&deg; N and 77.13&deg; E and lies in <!--del_lnk--> northern India. It borders the Indian state of <!--del_lnk--> Uttar Pradesh on the south and <!--del_lnk--> Haryana on the west. Delhi can be divided into three major geographical regions: the <!--del_lnk--> Yamuna flood plain, the <!--del_lnk--> ridge and the <!--del_lnk--> Gangetic Plains. The low-lying Yamuna flood plains provide fertile <!--del_lnk--> alluvial soil suitable for <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>. However, these plains are prone to recurrent <!--del_lnk--> floods. With an average <!--del_lnk--> altitude of 293&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> m above <!--del_lnk--> sea level,  the ridge forms the most dominating feature in this region. It originates from the <!--del_lnk--> Aravalli Hills in the south and encircles the west, northeast and northwest portions of the city. The Great Gangetic Plains are located in the south of the city and cover most of Delhi.<p><!--del_lnk--> Yamuna, one of the most sacred <a href="../../wp/r/River.htm" title="River">rivers</a> in <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, is the only main river flowing through Delhi. Most of the city, including New Delhi, lies west of the river. East of the river is the urban area of Shahdara.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>
      <p>Delhi has a semi-<!--del_lnk--> arid <a href="../../wp/c/Climate.htm" title="Climate">climate</a> with high variation between <a href="../../wp/s/Summer.htm" title="Summer">summer</a> and <a href="../../wp/w/Winter.htm" title="Winter">winter</a> temperatures. Due to Delhi&#39;s proximity to the <a href="../../wp/h/Himalayas.htm" title="Himalaya">Himalayas</a>, cold waves from the Himalayan region dip temperatures across Delhi. Summers are long, from early April till October, with the <!--del_lnk--> monsoon season in between. Extreme temperatures have ranged from &minus;0.6&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> &deg;C (<!--del_lnk--> 10 January <!--del_lnk--> 1935) to 47&nbsp;&deg;C. Winter starts in November and peaks in January. Delhi is notorious for its heavy fog during the winter season. In December, visibility is reduced to near zero disrupting road, air and rail traffic in the city.. During the summer season, the city faces extreme power and water shortage when the demand for these utilities is at its peak. Every year, the heat wave in summer claims several lives in Delhi. The city, however, has a pleasant climate from February to April and from August to November.<p>The average annual <a href="../../wp/r/Rain.htm" title="Rainfall">rainfall</a> is approximately 670&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mm (27&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> inches), most of which falls during the <!--del_lnk--> Monsoons, in July and August. Traditionally, the Monsoons are supposed to touch Delhi by <!--del_lnk--> June 29 every year.<table class="wikitable" style="width: 75%; margin: 0 auto 0 auto;">

      <p>Most of the Delhi metropolitan area lies within the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT). The NCT has three local <!--del_lnk--> municipal corporations: <!--del_lnk--> Municipal Corporation of Delhi, <!--del_lnk--> New Delhi Municipal Council and <!--del_lnk--> Delhi Cantonment Board. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) is one of the largest municipal corporations in the world providing civic amenities to an estimated 13.78 million people. The capital of India, New Delhi, falls under the administration of New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC). The chairperson of the NDMC is appointed by the Government of India in consultation with the Chief Minister of Delhi.<p>The National Capital Territory of Delhi is divided into nine districts. Each district is headed by a Deputy Commissioner and has three subdivisions. A Subdivision Magistrate heads each subdivision. All Deputy Commissioners report to the Divisional Commissioner. The District Administration of Delhi is the enforcement department for all kinds of State and Central Government policies and exercises supervisory powers over numerous other functionaries of the Government.<p>Delhi has four major <!--del_lnk--> satellite cities which lie outside the National Capital Territory of Delhi. These are <!--del_lnk--> Gurgaon and <!--del_lnk--> Faridabad in Haryana and <!--del_lnk--> NOIDA and <!--del_lnk--> Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh.<p><a id="Government_and_politics" name="Government_and_politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Government and politics</span></h2>

      <p>In 1991, the sixty-ninth amendment to the <!--del_lnk--> Constitution of India granted Delhi the status of a special <!--del_lnk--> union territory and officially changed its name to the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT). Delhi has its own <!--del_lnk--> Legislative Assembly, <!--del_lnk--> Lieutenant Governor, <!--del_lnk--> Council of Ministers and <!--del_lnk--> Chief Minister. The legislative assembly seats are filled by direct election from territorial constituencies in the NCT. However, the Union Government of India and the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi jointly administer New Delhi. New Delhi, an urban area in Delhi, is the seat of both the State Government of Delhi and the Government of India. Delhi has always been a stronghold of the <!--del_lnk--> Indian National Congress, locally known as the Congress Party. The trend started to change in the 1990s when the <!--del_lnk--> Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) under the leadership of <!--del_lnk--> Madan Lal Khurana came into power for the first time. However, in 1998 <!--del_lnk--> Sheila Dixit of the Congress Party defeated Madan Lal Khurana in state elections and has remained in power since then.<p>The per-capita electricity consumption is about 1,000&nbsp;kwh but actual demand is much more. In 1997, Delhi Vidyut Board (DVB) replaced Delhi Electric Supply Undertaking which was managed by the MCD. In 2002, the annual demand for electric power in Delhi touched 3250&nbsp;MW while DVB&#39;s own electric power production was only 405&nbsp;MW. The DVB meets rest of the electricity demand by drawing power from India&#39;s Northern Region Grid. As a result, Delhi faces a huge power shortage resulting in frequent <!--del_lnk--> blackouts and <!--del_lnk--> brownouts. Several industrial units in Delhi rely on private <!--del_lnk--> electrical generators to meet their electric demand. The Delhi government invested 149.2 billion <!--del_lnk--> INR in the city&#39;s energy sector and privatised Delhi&#39;s energy distribution system. However, the city continues to face acute power crisis especially during the summer season when energy demand is at its peak. Power theft is worse in Delhi than in any other major Indian metropolitan city. According to a report by BSES, Delhi&#39;s main electricity distribution company, 35% of Delhi&#39;s power is stolen.<p>Water supply in Delhi is managed by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB). In 2001, 731&nbsp;MGD of water was consumed by various households in Delhi out of which 609 MGD was supplied by DJB while the rest 122 MGD was met by private and public <!--del_lnk--> tube wells and <!--del_lnk--> hand pumps. Illegal water tapping in Delhi is very common. At 250 MGD, the Bhakra storage is the biggest water source for DJB followed by river Yamuna and <!--del_lnk--> Ganges. Due to the falling level of ground water in Delhi, DJB is constructing several <a href="../../wp/d/Dam.htm" title="Dam">dams</a> across river Yamuna, water treatment plants and water reservoirs. PWD and DJB have also implemended schemes for harvesting rain water. In 2002, the DJB had a water treatment capacity of 497.4 MGD. <p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>

      <p>With an estimated Gross Domestic Product of 478 billion <!--del_lnk--> INR (2005 figure) , Delhi is an important commercial centre in South Asia. According to the economic survey of Delhi, carried out in 2000&ndash;01, Delhi had a <i>per capita</i> income of 38,860 <!--del_lnk--> INR and recorded an annual economic growth rate of 9.9%. In 2001, the tertiary sector contributed 78.4% of Delhi&#39;s GDP followed by Secondary and Primary sectors with 20.2% and 1.4% contribution respectively. The city enjoys a considerably high literacy rate (81.7%).  Delhi&#39;s workforce constituted 32.84% of the population showing an increase of 51.9% between 1991 and 2001. This massive increase in the workforce was primarily due to migration of unemployed people from neighbouring states. As a consequence, Delhi&#39;s unemployment rate increased from 5.7% to 12.7% during the period 1992 to 2000. In December 2000, 991,000 people were registered with various employment exchange programs in Delhi. <p>Historically, Delhi has always been the economic capital of northern India. In early <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a>, it started to gain importance in arts and craft, textile and handloom. Many small-scale industries expanded, including the handloom and Copper utensils industry. By the end of the 19th century, Delhi was northern India&#39;s manufacturing hub. Delhi lies along the important trade route between <!--del_lnk--> Punjab and the <!--del_lnk--> Gangetic plains making it one of <!--del_lnk--> ancient India&#39;s most important trading centres.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In recent years, Delhi&#39;s service sector has expanded exponentially due in part to the large skilled English-speaking workforce that has attracted many <!--del_lnk--> multinational companies. Key <!--del_lnk--> service industries include <!--del_lnk--> information technology, <!--del_lnk--> telecommunications, <!--del_lnk--> hotels, <!--del_lnk--> banking, <!--del_lnk--> media, <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">tourism</a> and <!--del_lnk--> life sciences. Delhi&#39;s manufacturing industry has also grown considerably as many <!--del_lnk--> consumer goods industries have established manufacturing units and headquarters in and around Delhi. Delhi&#39;s large consumer market, coupled with the easy availability of skilled labour, has attracted a lot of foreign investment in Delhi. In 2001, the manufacturing sector employed 731,000 workers (24.6% of Delhi&#39;s workforce) while the number of industrial units increased by 48.4%. However, the contribution of the manufacturing sector to Delhi&#39;s GDP declined from 25.4% in 1994 to 20.2% in 2001. Construction, banking, power, telecommunications, health and community services and real estate form integral parts of Delhi&#39;s economy. Tourism is also a significant contributor to the economy of Delhi. Other key industries include government administration and defence. In 2001, the Union government had a total workforce of more than 212,000 in Delhi while the State government employed more than 114,000 people. Other local government bodies in Delhi employ as many as 298,000 people. In comparison, organised private sector employed only 217,000. <p>Delhi&#39;s relatively high <i><!--del_lnk--> per capita</i> income, better living standards and high economic growth rate has attracted a lot of people from rural areas in neighbouring states such as <!--del_lnk--> Rajasthan, <!--del_lnk--> Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and <!--del_lnk--> Bihar. Due to this high migration rate, Delhi registers as one of the fastest growing cities in the world. According to a United Nations report, Delhi will be the third largest <!--del_lnk--> agglomerate in the world after <a href="../../wp/t/Tokyo.htm" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> and Mumbai by <!--del_lnk--> 2025. <p><a id="Transport" name="Transport"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transport</span></h2>

      <p>Public transportation in Delhi is provided by <!--del_lnk--> auto rickshaws, buses, <!--del_lnk--> rapid transit system, taxis and suburban railways. Buses are the most popular means of transportation catering to about 60% of the total demand. Major bus service providers include state-owned <!--del_lnk--> Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC), BlueLine Transport Corporation and several other private concerns. Private vehicles account for 30% of the total demand for transportation while the rest of the demand is met largely by auto-rickshaws, taxis, rapid transit system and railways.<p>Transportation in Delhi is largely dependent upon road. Railways, including rapid transit systems like <!--del_lnk--> Delhi Metro, serve only 1% of the total demand. Major railway stations are <!--del_lnk--> Old Delhi, <!--del_lnk--> Hazrat Nizamuddin and <!--del_lnk--> New Delhi Railway Station. Road transportation in Delhi is maintained by MCD, NDMC, Delhi Cantonment Board, Public Works Department and Delhi Development Authority. At 1749&nbsp;km of road length per 100 km&sup2;, Delhi has one of the highest road densities in India. Major roadways include the Ring Road and the Outer Ring Road which had a traffic of 110,000 vehicles per day in 2001. Delhi is well connected to other parts of India by 5 <!--del_lnk--> National Highways: NH-1, -2, -8, -10 and -25. In 2001, more than 3.45 million vehicles were plying on Delhi&#39;s roads and the demand for transportation rose by 6.7% while the number of <!--del_lnk--> motor vehicles in Delhi rose by 14.7%.<p>Delhi&#39;s high population growth rate, coupled by high economic growth rate has resulted in ever increasing demand for transportation creating excessive pressure on the city&#39;s existent transport infrastructure. Like many other cities in the developing world, the city faces acute transport management problems leading to air pollution, congestion and resultant loss of productivity. In order to meet the transportation demand in Delhi, the State and Union governmet started the construction of an ambitious mass <!--del_lnk--> rapid transit system, known as <!--del_lnk--> Delhi Metro. As of 2005, the metro operates 3 lines with a total length of 156&nbsp;km and 150 stations while several other lines are under construction. The MCD and PWD also launched several traffic decongestion programmes. In 2001, the MCD alone started the construction of 21 flyovers at busy intersections throughout Delhi.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Due to high traffic congestion, Delhi&#39;s pollution levels increased drastically during the mid-1990s. In 1998, the <!--del_lnk--> Supreme Court of India ordered all public transport vehicles, including buses, taxis and auto-rickshaws, to use <!--del_lnk--> compressed natural gas as fuel instead of <!--del_lnk--> diesel and other hydro-carbons. The DTC now operates the world&#39;s largest fleet of environmentally friendly CNG buses. Though pollution due to road transportation has decreased in recent years, it remains alarmingly high. The <!--del_lnk--> World Bank has ranked Delhi as the world&#39;s most polluted city. Besides expanding the Delhi Metro, the government is currently considering several other means such as <!--del_lnk--> Trolleybus, <!--del_lnk--> Monorail and Integrated Freight Complexes to meet transport demand and reduce traffic congestion and pollution levels in the city.<p><!--del_lnk--> Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGI) serves Delhi for both domestic and international connections, and is situated in the southwestern corner of the city. In 2005-2006, IGI recorded a traffic of more than 16.2 million passengers(Both Domestic and International), making it one of the busiest airports in South Asia. Two other airports are Palam (now part of the IGI complex) and Safdarjung Flying Club.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>Delhi is a very cosmopolitan city due to the multi-ethnic and multi-cultural presence of the vast Indian bureaucracy and political system, and now expanding economy. There are more than 160 <!--del_lnk--> embassies and an ever-growing expatriate population. In <!--del_lnk--> 2003, the National Capital Territory of Delhi had a population of 14.1&nbsp;million people making it the second largest <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan area in India after <a href="../../wp/m/Mumbai.htm" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>. This figure includes about 295,000 people living in <a href="../../wp/n/New_Delhi.htm" title="New Delhi">New Delhi</a> and 125,000 in <!--del_lnk--> Delhi Cantonment. There are 821 women per 1000 men; the <!--del_lnk--> literacy rate is 81.67% and approximately 91% of the population is urban. Delhi is the most densely populated state in India with 9294 persons per km&sup2;. In 1999, Delhi recorded a <!--del_lnk--> birth rate, <!--del_lnk--> death rate and <!--del_lnk--> infant mortality rate (per 1000 population) of 22.15, 6.06 and 23.18 respectively. According to the Economic Survey of Delhi held in 2001, 2.6 million people were living in <!--del_lnk--> slum designated areas across Delhi while 1.7 million and 3.3 million were living in regularised and planned colonies respectively.<p><a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> is practised by 82% of Delhi&#39;s population. There are also large, vibrant communities of <!--del_lnk--> Muslims (11.7%), <!--del_lnk--> Sikhs (4.0%), <!--del_lnk--> Jains (1.1%) and <!--del_lnk--> Christians (0.9%). Other minorities include <!--del_lnk--> Buddhists and <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jew">Jews</a>. <a href="../../wp/h/Hindi.htm" title="Hindi">Hindi</a> is the principal spoken and written language. Other commonly spoken languages are <!--del_lnk--> English, <!--del_lnk--> Punjabi and <!--del_lnk--> Urdu (English being an associate official language, and Punjabi and Urdu being second official languages). Since Delhi is the capital, linguistic groups from all over India are well represented including <a href="../../wp/t/Tamil_language.htm" title="Tamil language">Tamil</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Kannada, <!--del_lnk--> Telugu, <!--del_lnk--> Bengali, <!--del_lnk--> Marathi and many others.<p>Delhi has one of the highest living standards in India with a <i>per capita</i> <!--del_lnk--> income of (at current prices for the year 2000-2001) 38864 <!--del_lnk--> INR. Due to relatively high employment opportunities and better living conditions, Delhi has attracted millions of people from rural areas in neighbouring <!--del_lnk--> Haryana, <!--del_lnk--> Punjab, <!--del_lnk--> Uttar Pradesh and <!--del_lnk--> Bihar. As a consequence, Delhi&#39;s demographics has changed drastically in the past few years. In 1999, the population of Delhi increased by 259,000 due to migration whereas the natural increase in population was 209,000. <!--del_lnk--> Punjabis, <!--del_lnk--> Gujjars and <!--del_lnk--> Jats are large ethnic communities, however a collage of peoples from almost every Indian state inhabits the city. According to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>, by <!--del_lnk--> 2015, Delhi will be the 3rd largest <!--del_lnk--> agglomeration in the world after <a href="../../wp/t/Tokyo.htm" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> and Mumbai, with an estimated population of 20.1&nbsp;million people.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

      <p>Delhi was the capital of several <!--del_lnk--> Hindu, <!--del_lnk--> Mughal, <!--del_lnk--> Rajput, <!--del_lnk--> Turkic and <!--del_lnk--> Afghan empires in <!--del_lnk--> ancient India. As a consequence, Delhi has a unique history of blending itself with several different cultures. After Delhi was declared as the capital of the Republic of India, several people from every corner of the country have made Delhi their home, adding to its cultural diversity. Delhi&#39;s art and crafts industry is as diverse as the city&#39;s culture. Delhi is the home of <i>Zardozi</i>, an embroidery done with gold thread and <i>Meenakari</i>, the art of enamelling. Delhi has several art and crafts museums like the Pragati Maidan and Dilli Haat. Pragati Maidan showcases rare and exquisite pieces of art and craft from all over India and hosts a 13-day long International Trade Fair every year in November.<p>A direct consequence of Delhi&#39;s rich history is its magnificent monuments. The Old City is the site where the Mughals and the <!--del_lnk--> Turkic rulers constructed several architectural marvels like the <!--del_lnk--> Jama Masjid and <!--del_lnk--> Lal Qila while the Birla Mandir and Chattarpur Temple represent a blend of North and <!--del_lnk--> South Indian architectural styles. The <!--del_lnk--> Archaeological Survey of India recognises more than 172 monuments in Delhi as national heritage sites. Two <!--del_lnk--> World Heritage Sites, the 72.5 meters tall <!--del_lnk--> Qutab Minar and <!--del_lnk--> Humayun&#39;s Tomb, are located in Delhi.
