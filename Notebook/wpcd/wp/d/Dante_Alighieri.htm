      <p>Dante was born in <!--del_lnk--> 1265, and was born under the sign of <!--del_lnk--> Gemini, placing his birthday between May 18th and June 17th. As an infant, Dante may have been originally christened &#39;Durante&#39; in Florence&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Baptistery, and the name Dante could be a shortened version of that name.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>He was born into the prominent Alighieri family of Florence, with loyalties to the <!--del_lnk--> Guelfs, a political alliance that supported the <a href="../../wp/p/Pope.htm" title="Papacy">Papacy</a>, involved in complex opposition to the <!--del_lnk--> Ghibellines, who were backed by the <!--del_lnk--> Holy Roman Emperor.<p>These factions fashioned their names after the ones of opposing factions of German Imperial politics, centered around the noble families the Welfs (Guelfs or Guelphs) and Waiblingen (Ghibellines), but adapting their meaning to the Italian political arena. After the defeat of the Ghibellines by the Guelfs in 1289, the Guelfs themselves were divided into White Guelfs, who were wary of Papal influence, and Black Guelfs who continued to support the Papacy. Dante (a White Guelf) pretended that his family descended from the ancient Romans (<i>Inferno</i>, XV, 76), but the earliest relative he can mention by name is <!--del_lnk--> Cacciaguida degli Elisei (<i>Paradiso</i>, XV, 135), of no earlier than about 1100.<p>Dante&#39;s father, Alighiero de Bellincione, was a White Guelf who suffered no reprisals after the Ghibellines won the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Montaperti. This suggests that Alighiero or his family enjoyed some protective prestige and status.<p>The poet&#39;s mother was Donna Gabriella degli Abati. She died when Dante was 5 or 6 years old, and Alighiero soon married again, to Lapa di Chiarissimo Cialuffi. (It is uncertain whether he really married her, as widowers had social limitations in these matters.) This woman definitely bore two children, Dante&#39;s brother Francesco and sister Tana (Gaetana).<p>When Dante was 12, in 1277, he was promised in marriage to Gemma di Manetto Donati, daughter of Messer Manetto Donati. Contracting marriages at this early age was quite common, and involved a formal ceremony, including contracts signed before a <!--del_lnk--> notary.<p>Dante had several sons with Gemma. As often happens with famous people, many people later claimed to be Dante&#39;s offspring; however, it is likely that Jacopo, Pietro, Giovanni, Gabrielle Alighieri, and Antonia were truly his children. Antonia became a nun with the name of Sister Beatrice.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Not much is known about Dante&#39;s education, and it is presumed he studied at home. It is known that he studied <!--del_lnk--> Tuscan poetry, at a time when the <!--del_lnk--> Sicilian School (<i>Scuola poetica siciliana</i>), a cultural group from <!--del_lnk--> Sicily, was becoming known in Tuscany. His interests brought him to discover <!--del_lnk--> Proven&ccedil;al <!--del_lnk--> minstrels and poets, and <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> culture (with a particular devotion to <a href="../../wp/v/Virgil.htm" title="Virgil">Virgil</a>).<p>During the &quot;Secoli Bui&quot; (<a href="../../wp/d/Dark_Ages.htm" title="Dark Ages">Dark Ages</a>), <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> had become a mosaic of small states, so <!--del_lnk--> Sicily was as far (culturally and politically) from Tuscany as <!--del_lnk--> Provence was: the regions did not share a language, culture, or easy communications. Nevertheless, we can assume that Dante was a keen up-to-date intellectual with international interests.<p>At 18, Dante met <!--del_lnk--> Guido Cavalcanti, <!--del_lnk--> Lapo Gianni, <!--del_lnk--> Cino da Pistoia, and soon after <!--del_lnk--> Brunetto Latini; together they became the leaders of <i><!--del_lnk--> Dolce Stil Novo</i> (&quot;The Sweet New Style&quot;). Brunetto later received a special mention in the <i>Divine Comedy</i> (<i>Inferno</i>, XV, 82), for what he had taught Dante. Some fifty poetical componments by Dante are known (the so-called <i><!--del_lnk--> Rime</i>, rhymes), others being included in the later <i>Vita Nuova</i> and <i>Convivio</i>. Other studies are reported, or deduced from <i>Vita Nuova</i> or the <i>Comedy</i>, regarding painting and music.<p>When he was nine years old he met <!--del_lnk--> Beatrice Portinari, daughter of Folco Portinari, with whom he fell in love &quot;at first sight&quot;, and apparently without even having spoken to her. He saw her frequently after age 18, often exchanging greetings in the street, but he never knew her well&mdash;he effectively set the example for the so-called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> courtly love&quot;. It is hard now to understand what this love actually comprised, but something extremely important for Italian culture was happening. It was in the name of this love that Dante gave his imprint to the Stil Novo and would lead poets and writers to discover the themes of Love (<i>Amore</i>), which had never been so emphasized before. Love for Beatrice (as in a different manner <!--del_lnk--> Petrarch would show for his Laura) would apparently be the reason for poetry and for living, together with political passions.<p>When Beatrice died in 1290, Dante tried to find a refuge in <!--del_lnk--> Latin literature. The <i><!--del_lnk--> Convivio</i> reveals that he had read <!--del_lnk--> Boethius&#39;s <i>De consolatione philosophiae</i> and <!--del_lnk--> Cicero&#39;s <i>De amicitia</i>.<p>He then dedicated himself to philosophical studies at religious schools like the Dominican one in <!--del_lnk--> Santa Maria Novella. He took part in the disputes that the two principal <!--del_lnk--> mendicant orders (<!--del_lnk--> Franciscan and <!--del_lnk--> Dominican) publicly or indirectly held in Florence, the former explaining the doctrine of the mystics and of <!--del_lnk--> San Bonaventura, the latter presenting Saint <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Aquinas.htm" title="Thomas Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a>&#39; theories.<p>This &quot;excessive&quot; passion for philosophy would later be criticized by the character Beatrice, in <i>Purgatorio</i>, the second book of the <i>Comedy</i>.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Dante, like many Florentines of his day, became embroiled in the <!--del_lnk--> Guelph-Ghibelline conflict. He fought in the <!--del_lnk--> battle of Campaldino (<!--del_lnk--> June 11, <!--del_lnk--> 1289), with Florentine Guelf knights against <!--del_lnk--> Arezzo Ghibellines, then in 1294 he was among those knights who escorted <!--del_lnk--> Carlo Martello d&#39;Anjou (son of <!--del_lnk--> Charles of Anjou) while he was in Florence.<p>To further his political career, he became a doctor and a pharmacist; he did not intend to take up those professions, but a law issued in 1295 required that nobles who wanted to assume public office had to be enrolled in one of the <!--del_lnk--> Corporazioni delle Arti e dei Mestieri, so Dante obtained quick admission to the apothecaries&#39; guild. The profession he chose was not entirely inapt, since at the time books were sold from apothecaries&#39; shops. As a politician, he accomplished little of relevance, but he held various offices over a number of years in a city undergoing some political agitation.<p>After defeating the Ghibellines, the Guelfs divided into two factions: the White Guelfs (<i>Guelfi Bianchi</i>), Dante&#39;s party, led by Vieri dei Cerchi, and the Black Guelfs (<i>Guelfi Neri</i>), led by <!--del_lnk--> Corso Donati. &quot;Colours&quot; were chosen when Vieri dei Cerchi gave his protection to the Grandi&#39;s family in <!--del_lnk--> Pistoia, which was locally called <i>La parte bianca</i> (the white party); Corso Donati had consequently protected the rival (<i>parte nera</i>), and these colours became the distinctive colours of the parties in Florence.<p>Being engaged in politics was not easy when <!--del_lnk--> Pope Boniface VIII was planning a military occupation of Florence, because this involved issues which transcended the city, and were beyond the scope of a local official. In 1301, <!--del_lnk--> Charles de Valois, brother of <!--del_lnk--> Philippe le Bel king of <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, was expected to visit Florence because the Pope had appointed him peacemaker for <!--del_lnk--> Tuscany. But the city&#39;s government had already treated the Pope&#39;s ambassadors badly a few weeks before, seeking independence from papal influences. It was thought wise to consider the hypothesis that Charles de Valois could eventually have received other unofficial orders. So the council sent a delegation to <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a>, in order to ascertain the Pope&#39;s intentions. Dante was the chief of this delegation.<p><a id="Exile_and_death" name="Exile_and_death"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Exile and death</span></h3>

      <p>Boniface quickly sent away the other representatives and asked Dante alone to remain in Rome. At the same time (<!--del_lnk--> November 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1301) <!--del_lnk--> Charles de Valois was entering Florence with Black Guelfs, who in the next six days destroyed everything and killed most of their enemies. A new government was installed of Black Guelfs, and Messer Cante dei <!--del_lnk--> Gabrielli di <!--del_lnk--> Gubbio was appointed <i><!--del_lnk--> Podest&agrave;</i> of Florence. Dante was condemned to exile for two years, and to pay a large sum of money. The poet was still in Rome, where the Pope had &quot;suggested&quot; he stay, and was therefore considered an absconder. He could not pay his fine and was finally condemned to perpetual exile. If he were ever caught by Florentine soldiers, he would have been summarily executed.<p>The poet took part in several attempts by the White Guelphs to regain the power they had lost, but these failed due to treachery. Dante, bitter at the treatment he had received at the hands of his enemies, also grew disgusted with the infighting and ineffectiveness of his erstwhile allies, and vowed to become a party of one. At this point he began sketching the foundations for the <i><!--del_lnk--> Divine Comedy</i>, a work in 100 <!--del_lnk--> cantos, divided into three books of thirty-three cantos each, with a single introductory canto.<p>He went to <!--del_lnk--> Verona as a guest of Bartolomeo Della Scala, then moved to <!--del_lnk--> Sarzana (<!--del_lnk--> Liguria), and after this he is supposed to have lived for some time in <!--del_lnk--> Lucca with Madame Gentucca, who made his stay comfortable (and was later gratefully mentioned in <i>Purgatorio</i>, XXIV, 37). Some speculative sources say that he was in <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>, too, between 1308 and 1310. Other sources, even less trustworthy, take him to <a href="../../wp/o/Oxford.htm" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>.<p>In 1310 <!--del_lnk--> Henry VII of <a href="../../wp/l/Luxembourg.htm" title="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a>, <!--del_lnk--> King of the Romans (Germany), was invading Italy; Dante saw in him the chance of revenge, so he wrote to him (and to other Italian princes) several public letters violently inciting them to destroy the Black Guelfs. Mixing religion and private concerns, he invoked the worst anger of God against his town, suggesting several particular targets that coincided with his personal enemies.<p>In Florence Baldo d&#39;Aguglione pardoned most of the White Guelfs in exile and allowed them to come back; however, Dante had gone beyond the pale in his violent letters to <i>Arrigo</i> (Henry VII), and he was not recalled.<p>In 1312, Arrigo assaulted Florence and defeated the Black Guelfs, but there is no evidence that Dante was involved. Some say he refused to participate in the assault on his city by a foreigner; others suggest that his name had become unpleasant for White Guelfs too and that any trace of his passage had carefully been removed. In 1313 Arrigo died, and with him any residual hope for Dante to see Florence again. He returned to Verona, where <!--del_lnk--> Cangrande I della Scala allowed him to live in a certain security and, presumably, in a fair amount of prosperity. Cangrande was admitted to Dante&#39;s Paradise (<i>Paradiso</i>, XVII, 76).<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In 1315, Florence was forced by Uguccione della Faggiuola (the military officer controlling the town) to grant an amnesty to people in exile. Dante too was in the list of citizens to be pardoned. But Florence required that, apart from paying a sum of money, these citizens agreed to be treated as public offenders in a religious ceremony. Dante refused this outrageous formula, and preferred to remain in exile.<p>When Uguccione finally defeated Florence, Dante&#39;s death sentence was converted into confinement, at the sole condition that he go to Florence to swear that he would never enter the town again. Dante didn&#39;t go. His condemnation to death was confirmed and extended to his sons.<p>Dante still hoped late in life that he might be invited back to Florence on honourable terms. For Dante, exile was nearly a form of death, stripping him of much of his identity. He addresses the pain of exile in <i>Paradiso</i>, XVII (55-60), where Cacciaguida, his great-great-grandfather, warns him what to expect:<table align="center">

      <p>Of course it never happened. Prince Guido Novello da Polenta invited him to <!--del_lnk--> Ravenna in 1318, and he accepted. He finished <i>Paradiso</i>, and finally died in 1321 (at the age of 56) while on the way back to Ravenna from a diplomatic mission in Venice, perhaps of <a href="../../wp/m/Malaria.htm" title="Malaria">malaria</a>. Dante was buried in the Church of San Pier Maggiore (later called San Francesco). Bernardo Bembo, praetor of <!--del_lnk--> Venice, in 1483 took care of his remains by organizing a better tomb.<p>On the grave, some verses of Bernardo Canaccio, a friend of Dante, dedicated to Florence:<dl>
       <dd><i>parvi Florentia mater amoris</i><dd>&quot;Florence, mother of little love&quot;</dl>
      <p>Eventually, Florence came to regret Dante&#39;s exile. In 1829, a tomb was built for him in Florence in the basilica of <!--del_lnk--> Santa Croce. That tomb has been empty ever since, with Dante&#39;s body still remaining in its tomb in Ravenna, far from the land he loved so dearly. The front of his tomb in Florence reads <i>Onorate l&#39;altissimo poeta</i> - which roughly translates as <i>Honour the most exalted poet</i>.<p><a id="Works" name="Works"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Works</span></h2>

      <p><i><!--del_lnk--> The Divine Comedy</i> describes Dante&#39;s journey through <!--del_lnk--> Hell (<i>Inferno</i>), <!--del_lnk--> Purgatory (<i>Purgatorio</i>), and <!--del_lnk--> Paradise (<i>Paradiso</i>), guided first by the Roman epic poet <a href="../../wp/v/Virgil.htm" title="Virgil">Virgil</a> and then by his beloved <!--del_lnk--> Beatrice. While the vision of Hell, the <i>Inferno</i>, is vivid for modern readers, the theological niceties presented in the other books require a certain amount of patience and scholarship to understand. <i>Purgatorio</i>, the most lyrical and human of the three, also has the most poets in it; <i>Paradiso</i>, the most heavily theological, has the most beautiful and ecstatic mystic passages, in which Dante tries to describe what he confesses he is unable to convey (e.g., when Dante looks into the face of God: &quot;all&#39;alta fantasia qui manc&ograve; possa&quot; - &quot;at this high moment, ability failed my capacity to describe&quot;, <i>Paradiso</i>, XXXIII, 142).<p>Dante wrote the <i>Comedy</i> in his regional dialect. By creating a poem of epic structure and philosophic purpose, he established that the <!--del_lnk--> Italian language was suitable for the highest sort of expression, and simultaneously established the <!--del_lnk--> Tuscan dialect as the standard for Italian. In French, Italian is nicknamed <i>la langue de Dante.</i> It often confuses readers that such a serious work would be called a &quot;comedy&quot;. In Dante&#39;s time, all serious scholarly works were written in Latin (a tradition that would persist for several hundred years more, until the waning years of the Enlightenment) and works written in any other language were assumed to be comedic in nature. It is also the case that the word &quot;<!--del_lnk--> comedy,&quot; in the classical sense, referenced works which subscribed to an ordered universe, in which events not only tended towards a happy or &quot;amusing&quot; ending, but an ending influenced by a Providential will that ordered all things to an ultimate good.<p>Other works include <i><!--del_lnk--> Convivio</i> (&quot;The Banquet&quot;), a collection of poems and interpretive commentary; <i><!--del_lnk--> Monarchia</i>, which sets out Dante&#39;s ideas on global political organization; <i><!--del_lnk--> De vulgari eloquentia</i> (&quot;On the Eloquence of Vernacular&quot;), on vernacular literature; and, <i><!--del_lnk--> La Vita Nuova</i> (&quot;The New Life&quot;), the story of his love for <!--del_lnk--> Beatrice Portinari, who also served as the ultimate symbol of salvation in the <i>Comedy</i>. The book contains love poems in Tuscan, not a new thing; the vernacular had been used for lyric works before. But it also contains Dante&#39;s learned comments on his own work, and these too are in the local language, instead of the Latin that was almost universally used.<p>Note: References to <i>Divina Commedia</i> are in the format (book, canto, verse), i.e., (<i>Inferno</i>, XV, 76).<div class="thumb tright">
