      <p>Unlike some early human activities such as the production of stone tools, hunting, cave painting, etc., dance does not leave behind physical artifacts. Thus, it is impossible to say with any certainty when dance became part of human culture. However, dance has certainly been an important part of ceremony, rituals, <!--del_lnk--> celebrations and <!--del_lnk--> entertainment since the birth of the earliest human <a href="../../wp/c/Civilization.htm" title="Civilization">civilizations</a>. <a href="../../wp/a/Archaeology.htm" title="Archaeology">Archaeology</a> delivers traces of dance from <!--del_lnk--> prehistoric times such as <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">Egyptian</a> tomb paintings depicting dancing figures from circa <!--del_lnk--> 3300 BC and the <!--del_lnk--> Bhimbetka rock-shelter paintings in <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>.<p>One of the earliest structured uses of dance may have been in the performative retelling of <a href="../../wp/m/Mythology.htm" title="Mythology">mythological</a> stories. Indeed, before the introduction of written languages, dance was one of the primary methods of passing these stories down from generation to generation. <p>Another early use of dance may have been as a precursor to <!--del_lnk--> ecstatic <!--del_lnk--> trance states in healing <!--del_lnk--> rituals. Dance is still used for this purpose by cultures from the Brazilian <a href="../../wp/r/Rainforest.htm" title="Rainforest">rainforest</a> to the <!--del_lnk--> Kalahari Desert.<p>Origins of <!--del_lnk--> Sri Lankan dances goes back to immemorial times of aboriginal tribes and &quot;yakkas&quot; (devils). According to a Sinhalese legend, <!--del_lnk--> Kandyan dances originate, 2500 years ago, from a magic ritual that broke the spell on a bewitched king.<p>Many contemporary dance forms can be traced back to <!--del_lnk--> historical, <!--del_lnk--> traditional, <!--del_lnk--> ceremonial, and <!--del_lnk--> ethnic dances.<p><a id="Dancing_and_music" name="Dancing_and_music"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Dancing and music</span></h2>
      <p>Although dance and <a href="../../wp/m/Music.htm" title="Music">music</a> can be traced back to <!--del_lnk--> prehistoric times it is unclear which art form came <i>first</i>. However, as <!--del_lnk--> rhythm and <a href="../../wp/s/Sound.htm" title="Sound">sound</a> are the result of movement, and music can inspire movement, the relationship between the two forms has probably always been <!--del_lnk--> symbiotic.<p>Many early forms of music and dance were created and performed together. This paired development has continued through the ages with dance/music forms such as: <!--del_lnk--> Jig, <!--del_lnk--> Waltz, <!--del_lnk--> Tango, <!--del_lnk--> Disco, <!--del_lnk--> Salsa, <!--del_lnk--> Electronica and <a href="../../wp/h/Hip_hop_music.htm" title="Hip hop music">Hip-Hop</a>. Some <!--del_lnk--> musical genre also have a parallel dance form such as <!--del_lnk--> Baroque music and <!--del_lnk--> Baroque dance where as others developed separately: <!--del_lnk--> Classical music, <!--del_lnk--> Classical ballet.<p>Although dance is often accompanied by <a href="../../wp/m/Music.htm" title="Music">music</a>, it can also be presented independently or provide its own accompaniment (<!--del_lnk--> tap dance). Dance presented with music may or may not be performed <i>in time</i> to the music depending on the style of dance. Dance performed without music is said to be <i>danced to its own rhythm</i>.<p><a id="Genres_and_music_forms_used_for_dancing" name="Genres_and_music_forms_used_for_dancing"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Genres and music forms used for dancing</span></h3>

      <p><a id="Dance_in_Indian_canonical_literature" name="Dance_in_Indian_canonical_literature"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Dance in Indian canonical literature</span></h3>
      <p>In the first millennium BCE in <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> many canonical texts were composed which sought to codify the rules of social management, private life, linguistic discipline, public finance, state policy, poetics, and dramatics. In the matter of dance, <!--del_lnk--> Bharata Muni&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Natyashastra</i> (literally <i>&quot;the art of dance&quot;</i>) is the one of the earlier texts.<p>Though the main theme of <i><!--del_lnk--> Natyashastra</i> deals with drama, dance also finds mentions at considerable length. It elaborates various gestures of hands and classifies such gestures and movements as either graceful or vigorous, defining the <i>lalita</i> form of dance - <i>lasya</i>; and the vigorous form &#39;<!--del_lnk--> tandava&#39;.<p>Dance is classified under four categories and into four regional varieties. <i><!--del_lnk--> Natyashastra</i> names these categories as secular, ritual, abstract, and, interpretive. Regional geography has altered since <!--del_lnk--> ancient India&#39;s time and so have regional varieties of Indian dances. Dances like <i>&quot;Odra Magadhi&quot;</i>, which after decades long debate, has been traced to present day Mithila-<!--del_lnk--> Orissa region&#39;s dance form of <!--del_lnk--> Odissi, indicate influence of dances in cultural interactions between different reigons.<p>Indian dance-styles have experienced states of dormance and resurgence many times. The roots of the present day <!--del_lnk--> Kathak, <!--del_lnk--> Bharatanatyam, <!--del_lnk--> Odissi, <!--del_lnk--> Mohini Attam and <!--del_lnk--> Kuchipudi are found in ancient Indian civilization. Abstractness is now the feature of almost all classical Indian dance forms.<p><a id="Devil_Dances_in_Sri_Lanka" name="Devil_Dances_in_Sri_Lanka"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Devil Dances in Sri Lanka</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> devil dances of Sri Lanka or &quot;yakun natima&quot; is a carefully crafted ritual with a history reaching far back into <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>&#39;s pre-Buddhist past. It combines ancient &quot;Ayurvedic&quot; concepts of disease causation with deft psychological manipulation. The dance combines many aspects including Sinhalese cosmolgy, the dances also has an impact on the <!--del_lnk--> classical dances of Sri Lanka.<p><a id="Classical_Indian_dance_since_1947" name="Classical_Indian_dance_since_1947"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Classical Indian dance since 1947</span></h3>
      <p>During the reign of the last Mughals and Nawabs of Oudh dance fell down to the status of &#39;<!--del_lnk--> nautch&#39;, an sensuous dance of courtesans.<p>Later, linking dance with immoral trafficking and prostitution, British rule prohibited public performance of dance. Many disapproved it. In 1947, India won her freedom and for dance an ambience where it could regain its past glory. Classical forms and regional distinctions were re-discovered, ethnic specialties were honored and by synthesizing them with the individual talents of the masters in the line and fresh innovations emerged dance with a new face but with classicism of the past.<p>Archaeology delivers traces of dance from prehistoric times such as Egyptian tomb paintings depicting dancing figures from circa 3300 BC and the Bhimbetka rock-shelter paintings in India.<p><a id="Performance_Dance_in_Europe_and_North_America" name="Performance_Dance_in_Europe_and_North_America"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Performance Dance in Europe and North America</span></h2>
      <p>As European culture became more cosmopolitan, dances from various areas were practiced outside of those areas, on the one hand, and new dances began to be invented, especially in Italy. As dances began to be performed outside of their cultural context, instruction manuals were now required. <!--del_lnk--> Ballet, the reigning dance form in Europe, developed first in Italy and then in France from lavish court spectacles that combined music, drama, poetry, song, costumes and dance. Members of the court nobility took part as performers. During the reign of <!--del_lnk--> Louis XIV, himself a dancer, dance became more codified. Professional dancers began to take the place of court amateurs, and ballet masters were licensed by the French government. The first ballet dance academy was the Acad&eacute;mie Royale de Danse (Royal Dance Academy), opened in Paris in 1661. Shortly thereafter, the first institutionalized ballet troupe, associated with the Academy, was formed; this troupe began as an all-male ensemble but by 1681 opened to include women as well.<p>During the <a href="../../wp/1/18th_century.htm" title="18th century">18th century</a>, ballets were still primarily composite productions, performed alongside <a href="../../wp/o/Opera.htm" title="Opera">opera</a> or poetry, but the idea of dance performance as separate from sung or spoken word began to be experimented with. <!--del_lnk--> Mime, instead, was used to tell the stories of these ballets. Female professional dancers began to take their place onstage, having previously been hampered by social norms; they performed in high-heeled shoes and long, full skirts.<p>During the Pre-Romantic era in ballet, the art form changed rapidly. Costume reforms were made, especially for women; these reforms were in part a result of the <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>. Heeled street shoes were replaced by slippers, and corsets and heavy petticoats were discarded, and tights were invented. Simple <!--del_lnk--> en pointe work was introduced by ballerinas such as Fanny Elssler and <!--del_lnk--> Marie Taglioni, who heavily darned their slippers in order to be able to rise up briefly on their toes. The seven movements of dance (to bend, to rise, to stretch, to glide, to jump, to turn, and to dart) were codified in 1796.<p>The period of time between 1830 and 1870 is classified as the <!--del_lnk--> Romantic era of ballet. A format developed for ballets crafted in this period: the first act was set in the real world and the second in a <!--del_lnk--> supernatural or otherwordly setting. Most ballerinas portrayed creatures such as wilis, sylphs and nymphs wearing long white skirts, today called Romantic tutus. Ballets choreographed during this time period included <!--del_lnk--> Giselle in 1841, <!--del_lnk--> La Sylphide in 1832, and <!--del_lnk--> Coppelia in 1870. The Romantic Era came to a close when ballet lost popularity in Western <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> due to competition by music halls and a lack of strong male dancers and choreography.<p><a href="../../wp/s/Saint_Petersburg.htm" title="St. Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a> became the centre of ballet during the second half of the 19th century; the art form was supported by the patronage of the czars and the success of the <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Ballet, its school (forerunner of the <!--del_lnk--> Kirov Ballet) and the talent of <!--del_lnk--> Marius Petipa. Hard or blocked pointe shoes were introduced during this period, as were short tutus (today known as classical tutus, these skirts take their name from this era, which was the Russian Classical). Many story ballets (<!--del_lnk--> The Nutcracker, <!--del_lnk--> Don Quixote, <!--del_lnk--> Swan Lake, <!--del_lnk--> The Sleeping Beauty, <!--del_lnk--> Le Corsaire) were produced during this period. Although the coming of the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Revolution boded ill for the art form, Nicholas Sergeyev, last r&eacute;gisseur of the Imperial Ballet, smuggled the <!--del_lnk--> choreographic notation documenting the Imperial Ballet&#39;s repertory out of Russia and into the West. Hence many of the ballets survived, and are still performed today.<p>The Russian impresario <!--del_lnk--> Serge Diaghilev was instrumental in bringing ballet back to Western Europe and allowing for its evolution into a 20th century art form. Although not a dancer nor a choreographer, Diaghilev was an avid dance and music patron. He assembled a troupe of Russian composers, dancers, choreographers and designers; as the Diaghilev Ballet Russes, this troupe toured Europe and the United States. Diaghilev was one of the foremost influences upon ballet in the new century, and he helped to launch the careers of such artists as <!--del_lnk--> Anna Pavlova, <!--del_lnk--> Michel Fokine, <!--del_lnk--> Vaslav Nijinsky, and <!--del_lnk--> George Balanchine, among others. After Diaghilev&#39;s death, the company disbanded. Many of his dancers settled in Western Europe and the United States. Michel Fokine joined <!--del_lnk--> American Ballet Theatre in 1940 as its resident choreographer; George Balanchine also came to America and founded the <!--del_lnk--> New York City Ballet in 1934. It was Balanchine who developed what is now known as the &quot;neo-classical&quot; style of ballet.<p>At the beginning of the <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a>, there was an explosion of innovation in dance style characterized by an exploration of freer technique. Early pioneers of what became known as <!--del_lnk--> modern dance include <!--del_lnk--> Loie Fuller, <!--del_lnk--> Isadora Duncan, <!--del_lnk--> Mary Wigman and <!--del_lnk--> Ruth St. Denis. The relationship of music to dance serves as the basis for <!--del_lnk--> Eurhythmics, devised by <!--del_lnk--> Emile Jaques-Dalcroze, which was influential to the development of Modern dance and modern ballet through artists such as <!--del_lnk--> Marie Rambert.<p><!--del_lnk--> Eurythmy, developed by <!--del_lnk--> Rudolf Steiner and <!--del_lnk--> Lori Maier-Smits, combines formal elements reminiscent of traditional dance with the new freer style, and introduced a complex new vocabulary to dance. In the <!--del_lnk--> 1920s, important founders of the new style such as <!--del_lnk--> Martha Graham and <!--del_lnk--> Doris Humphrey began their work. Since this time, a wide variety of dance styles have been developed; see <!--del_lnk--> Modern dance.<p><a id="Dance_studies" name="Dance_studies"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Dance studies</span></h2>
      <p>In the early <!--del_lnk--> 1920s dance studies (dance <!--del_lnk--> practice, <!--del_lnk--> critical theory, <!--del_lnk--> Musical analysis and <a href="../../wp/h/History.htm" title="History">history</a>) began to be considered an <!--del_lnk--> academic discipline.
