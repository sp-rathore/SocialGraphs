      <p>The people of <a href="../../wp/c/Chad.htm" title="Chad">Chad</a> speak more than 100 different languages and divide themselves into many ethnic groups. It is important to note, however, that language and ethnicity are not the same. Moreover, neither element can be tied to a particular physical type. In Chad, <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European</a> conquest and administration intensified feelings of ethnic separateness by drawing local boundaries along perceived ethnic lines. The Europeans also appointed chiefs and other local African authorities who had little legitimacy over the groups they were to lead. In general, the <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> favored southerners over northerners and settled populations over nomads. This bias continued after independence and has been an important element in internecine conflict.<p>Although the possession of a common language shows that its speakers have lived together and have a common history, peoples also change languages. This is particularly so in Chad, where the openness of the terrain, marginal rainfall, frequent drought and famine, and low population densities have encouraged physical and linguistic mobility. Slave raids among non-Muslim peoples, internal slave trade, and exports of captives northward from the ninth to the twentieth centuries also have resulted in language changes.<p>Anthropologists view ethnicity as being more than genetics. Like language, ethnicity implies a shared heritage, partly economic, where people of the same ethnic group may share a livelihood, and partly social, taking the form of shared ways of doing things and organizing relations among individuals and groups. Ethnicity also involves a cultural component made up of shared values and a common worldview. Like language, ethnicity is not immutable. Shared ways of doing things change over time and alter a group&#39;s perception of its own identity.<p>Not only do the social aspects of ethnic identity change but the biological composition (or gene pool) also may change over time. Although most ethnic groups emphasize intermarriage, people are often proscribed from seeking partners among close relatives -- a prohibition that promotes biological variation. In all groups, the departure of some individuals or groups and the integration of others also changes the biological component.<p>The Chadian government has avoided official recognition of ethnicity. With the exception of a few surveys conducted shortly after independence, little data were available on this important aspect of Chadian society. Nonetheless, ethnic identity was a significant component of life in Chad.<p>Chad&#39;s languages fall into ten major groups, each of which belongs to either the <!--del_lnk--> Nilo-Saharan, <!--del_lnk--> Afro-Asiatic, or <!--del_lnk--> Congo-Kordofanian language family. These represent three of the four major language families in Africa; only the <!--del_lnk--> Khoisan languages of southern Africa are not represented. The presence of such different languages suggests that the <a href="../../wp/l/Lake_Chad.htm" title="Lake Chad">Lake Chad</a> Basin may have been an important point of dispersal in ancient times.<p>

      <p>The separation of religion from social structure in Chad represents a false dichotomy, for they are perceived as two sides of the same coin. Three religious traditions coexist in Chad-- classical African religions, <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> (see <!--del_lnk--> Islam in Chad), and <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>. None is monolithic. The first tradition includes a variety of ancestor and/or place-oriented religions whose expression is highly specific. Islam, although characterized by an orthodox set of beliefs and observances, also is expressed in diverse ways. Christianity arrived in Chad much more recently with the arrival of Europeans. Its followers are divided into Roman Catholics and Protestants (including several denominations); as with Chadian Islam, Chadian Christianity retains aspects of pre-Christian religious belief.<p>The number of followers of each tradition in Chad is unknown. Estimates made in 1962 suggested that 35 percent of Chadians practiced classical African religions, 55 percent were <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Muslims</a>, and 10 percent were <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christians</a>. In the 1970s and 1980s, this distribution undoubtedly changed. Observers report that Islam has spread among the <!--del_lnk--> Hajerai and among other non-Muslim populations of the Saharan and sahelian zones. However, the proportion of Muslims may have fallen because the birthrate among the followers of traditional religions and Christians in southern Chad is thought to be higher than that among Muslims. In addition, the upheavals since the mid-1970s have resulted in brought the departure of some missionaries; whether or not Chadian Christians have been numerous enough and organized enough to have attracted more converts since that time is unknown.<p><a id="Demographic_data_from_the_CIA_World_Factbook" name="Demographic_data_from_the_CIA_World_Factbook"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographic data from the CIA World Factbook</span></h2>
