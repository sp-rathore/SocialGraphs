      <p>David Livingstone was born on <!--del_lnk--> March 19, <!--del_lnk--> 1813 in the village of <!--del_lnk--> Blantyre, <!--del_lnk--> South Lanarkshire, <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, into a family believed to be descended from the <a href="../../wp/s/Scottish_Highlands.htm" title="Scottish Highlands">highland</a> Livingstones, a <!--del_lnk--> clan that had been previously known as the <!--del_lnk--> Clan MacLea. He first studied <!--del_lnk--> Greek, <a href="../../wp/m/Medicine.htm" title="Medicine">medicine</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> theology at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Glasgow and while working in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, he emulated the example of another Scot, <!--del_lnk--> Robert Moffat, and joined the <!--del_lnk--> London Missionary Society, becoming a minister.<p>Livingstone originally planned to gain access to <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> through his medical knowledge (healing arts). The <!--del_lnk--> Opium Wars, which were raging at this stage with no signs of peace on the horizon, forced Livingstone to consider other options. Moffat seemed to have found an &quot;inviting field&quot; in <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a> and Livingstone turned his thoughts there.<p>From <!--del_lnk--> 1840 he worked in <!--del_lnk--> Bechuanaland (now <a href="../../wp/b/Botswana.htm" title="Botswana">Botswana</a>), but was unable to make inroads into <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> because of <!--del_lnk--> Boer opposition.<p>He married Mary Moffat, daughter of Robert Moffat, in <!--del_lnk--> 1845, and she travelled with him for a brief time at his insistence, despite her pregnancy and the protests of the Moffats. She later returned to <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> with their children.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In the period <!--del_lnk--> 1852&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 56, he explored the <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">African</a> interior, and was the first European to see the Mosi-oa-Tunya (&quot;the smoke that thunders&quot;) waterfall (which he renamed <!--del_lnk--> Victoria Falls after his monarch, <a href="../../wp/v/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a>). Livingstone was one of the first Westerners to make a transcontinental journey across Africa. The purpose of his journey was to open the routes, while accumulating useful information about the African continent. In particular, Livingstone was a proponent of trade and Christian missions to be established in central Africa. His motto, inscribed in the base of the statue to him at Victoria Falls, was &quot;<a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Commerce and <a href="../../wp/c/Civilization.htm" title="Civilisation">Civilisation</a>.&quot; At this time he believed the key to achieving these goals was the navigation of the <!--del_lnk--> Zambezi River. He returned to Britain to try to garner support for his ideas, and to publish a book on his travels. At this time he resigned from the <!--del_lnk--> London Missionary Society, to which he had belonged.<p><a id="Zambezi_expedition" name="Zambezi_expedition"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Zambezi expedition</span></h2>
      <p>Livingstone returned to Africa as head of the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Zambezi Expedition&quot;, which was a British government-funded project to examine the natural resources of southeastern Africa. The Zambezi river turned out to be completely unnavigable past the <!--del_lnk--> Cabora Bassa rapids, a series of <!--del_lnk--> cataracts and <!--del_lnk--> rapids that Livingstone had failed to explore on his earlier travels.<p>The expedition lasted from March 1858 until the middle of 1864. Livingstone was an inexperienced leader and had trouble managing a large-scale project. The artist <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Baines was dismissed from the expedition on charges (which he vigorously denied) of theft. Livingstone&#39;s wife Mary died on <!--del_lnk--> 29 April <!--del_lnk--> 1863 of <a href="../../wp/m/Malaria.htm" title="Malaria">malaria</a>, but Livingstone continued to explore, eventually returning home in <!--del_lnk--> 1864 after the government ordered the recall of the Expedition. The Zambezi Expedition was castigated as a failure in many newspapers of the time, and Livingstone experienced great difficulty in raising funds further to explore <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>. Nevertheless, the scientists appointed to work under Livingstone, <!--del_lnk--> John Kirk, Charles Meller, and Richard Thornton did contribute large collections of botanic, ecological, geological and ethnographic material to scientific institutions in the UK.<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Illness, pain and death</span></h2>

      <p>Livingstone was taken ill and completely lost contact with the outside world for six years. Only one of his 44 letter dispatches made it to <!--del_lnk--> Zanzibar. <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_Morton_Stanley.htm" title="Henry Morton Stanley">Henry Morton Stanley</a>, who had been sent in a publicity stunt to find him by the <i><!--del_lnk--> New York Herald</i> newspaper in <!--del_lnk--> 1869, found Livingstone in the town of <!--del_lnk--> Ujiji, on the shores of <a href="../../wp/l/Lake_Tanganyika.htm" title="Lake Tanganyika">Lake Tanganyika</a>, in October <!--del_lnk--> 1871. Stanley joined Livingstone, and together they continued exploring the north end of the Tanganyika (the other constituent of the present Tanzania), until Stanley left in March the next year.<p>Despite Stanley&#39;s urgings, Livingstone was determined not to leave Africa until his mission was complete. His illness made him confused and he had judgment difficulties at the end of his life. He accepted help from Arab <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slave</a> <!--del_lnk--> merchants, looking to capture slaves. They used him to facilitate contact with local people. He died there, in Chief <!--del_lnk--> Cazembe&#39;s village on the southern shores of <!--del_lnk--> Lake Bangweulu (now in <a href="../../wp/z/Zambia.htm" title="Zambia">Zambia</a>), on <!--del_lnk--> 1 May <!--del_lnk--> 1873 from <a href="../../wp/m/Malaria.htm" title="Malaria">malaria</a> and internal bleeding caused by <!--del_lnk--> dysentery. Livingstone&#39;s heart was buried under a Mvula tree near the spot where he died. His body, carried over a thousand miles by his loyal attendants Chuma and Susi, was returned to Britain for burial in <a href="../../wp/w/Westminster_Abbey.htm" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>.<p><a name="1939_Film"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1939 Film</span></h3>
