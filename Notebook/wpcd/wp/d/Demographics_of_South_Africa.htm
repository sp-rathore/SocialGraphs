      <p>Until <!--del_lnk--> 1991, <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South African</a> law divided the population into four major racial categories: blacks (African), whites, <!--del_lnk--> coloureds, and Asians. Although this law has been abolished, many South Africans still view themselves and each other according to these categories. Black Africans comprise about seventy-five percent of the population and are divided into a number of different ethnic groups including those from <a href="../../wp/a/Angola.htm" title="Angola">Angola</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Mozambique.htm" title="Mozambique">Mozambique</a> who are descendants of refugees who have settled South Africa. Whites comprise about thirteen percent of the population. They are primarily descendants of <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a>, and <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">German</a> settlers who began arriving at the Cape in the late 17th century. There is a <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> minority including the descendants of the first European explorers and the Portuguese who left the former Portuguese colonies of southern Africa (Angola and Mozambique) after their independence in the mid-70s. <!--del_lnk--> Coloureds are mixed-race people primarily descended from the earliest settlers, their slaves, and the indigenous peoples. They comprise about nine percent of the total population. Most <!--del_lnk--> Asians descend from Indian indentured workers who came to South Africa in the mid-19th century to work on the sugar estates in Natal. Others include the descendants of Indian traders who migrated to South Africa at around the same time. They constitute about three percent of the population and are concentrated in the <!--del_lnk--> KwaZulu-Natal Province. There is also a small Chinese population of approximately 100,000 people.<p>
