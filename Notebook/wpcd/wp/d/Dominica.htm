      <p>Dominica was first sighted by Europeans, including <a href="../../wp/c/Christopher_Columbus.htm" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>, in <!--del_lnk--> 1493. They encountered the <!--del_lnk--> indigenous peoples known as the <!--del_lnk--> Caribs, but soon left the island after being defeated by the Caribs. It is said that when his superiors asked Columbus to describe this island in the &quot;New World,&quot; he crumbled a piece of parchment roughly and threw it on the table. This, Columbus explained, is what Dominica looks like- completely covered with mountains with nary a flat spot.In <!--del_lnk--> 1627 <!--del_lnk--> England also tried and failed to capture Dominica. In <!--del_lnk--> 1635 the French claimed the island and sent missionaries, but were unable to wrench Dominica from the Caribs. They abandoned the island, along with the island of <!--del_lnk--> Saint Vincent, in the <!--del_lnk--> 1660s.<p>For the next hundred years Dominica remained isolated, and even more Caribs settled there after being driven from surrounding islands as <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="European">European</a> powers entered the region. <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> formally ceded possession of Dominica to the United Kingdom in <!--del_lnk--> 1763. The United Kingdom then set up a government and made the island a colony in <!--del_lnk--> 1805. The emancipation of African slaves occurred throughout the British Empire in <!--del_lnk--> 1834, and, by <!--del_lnk--> 1838, Dominica became the first British Caribbean colony to have a Black-controlled legislature. In <!--del_lnk--> 1896, the United Kingdom re-took governmental control of Dominica and turned it into a <!--del_lnk--> crown colony. Half a century later, from <!--del_lnk--> 1958 to <!--del_lnk--> 1962, Dominica became a province of the short-lived <!--del_lnk--> West Indies Federation. In <!--del_lnk--> 1978 Dominica finally became an independent nation. <b>Patrick Roland John</b>, (b. 7 January 1938) the first Prime Minister of Dominica, having served from 27 July 1974 to 21 June 1979. During his tenure, Dominica gained independence from the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. He was a successful trade union leader and a mayor of Roseau before taking on prime ministerial duties. <b>Dame Eugenia Charles</b>, DBE (May 15 1919 &ndash; September 6, 2005) was the Prime Minister of Dominica from July 21 1980 until June 14 1995. She was the first female prime minister in the Caribbean. She helped to found the <!--del_lnk--> Dominica Freedom Party, which she served as leader from the early 1970s until 1995. She was elected to Parliament in 1970 and became Opposition Leader in 1975. In 1995 Charles resigned and was replaced by <!--del_lnk--> Edison James. In 2000, <b>Roosevelt Douglas</b> (15 October 1941 &ndash; 1 October 2000) became Dominica&#39;s prime minister for eight months, from 3 February 2000 until his death later that year. At the parliamentary elections on January 31,2000 he led the <!--del_lnk--> Dominica Labour Party to victory against the ruling <!--del_lnk--> United Workers Party of Prime Minister Edison James. He formed a coalition government with the Dominica Freedom Party and began office on 3 February 2000. After only eight months in the office Douglas was found on 1 October 2000 dead in his house in Portsmouth. He had returned only one day before from state visits to <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Taiwan.htm" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a> and <a href="../../wp/j/Jamaica.htm" title="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>. Douglas was succeeded by, <b>Pierre Charles</b> (June 30, 1954 &ndash; January 6, 2004),Prime Minister of Dominica from 2000 to 2004. He was born in Grand Bay in Saint Patrick parish. A member of the Dominica Labour Party, he served in several cabinet posts including communication and works. While serving as foreign minister in the government of Rosie Douglas, he was officially named prime minister on October 3, 2000, two days after Douglas&#39;s death. <!--del_lnk--> Roosevelt Skerrit succeeded him as prime minister and became the new leader of the Dominica Labour Party. Election were held on May 5 2005 with the ruling coalition maintaining power.<p>

      <p>Dominica is a <!--del_lnk--> parliamentary democracy within the <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth of Nations. The President is <!--del_lnk--> head of state, while executive power rests with the <!--del_lnk--> Cabinet, headed by the <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister. The <!--del_lnk--> unicameral <!--del_lnk--> parliament consists of the 30-member <!--del_lnk--> House of Assembly, which consists of twenty-one directly elected members and nine Senators, who may either be appointed by the President or elected by the other members of the House of Assembly.<p>Unlike other former British colonies in the region, Dominica was never a <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth realm with the <!--del_lnk--> British monarch as head of state, as it instead became a <!--del_lnk--> republic on independence.

Dominica also has many waterfalls, springs and rivers. Some plants and animals thought to be extinct on surrounding islands can still be found in Dominica&#39;s forests.

      <p>The Dominican economy has high <a href="../../wp/p/Poverty.htm" title="Poverty">poverty</a> (30%), high <!--del_lnk--> unemployment (23%), and a low per capita <!--del_lnk--> GDP (US$5,400). The Dominican economy has been hurt by problems in the <a href="../../wp/b/Banana.htm" title="Banana">banana</a> industry. The entire economy suffers when weather conditions damage the banana crop, or when the price of bananas falls. The <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> has phased out preferred access of bananas to its markets, causing banana demand to fall. In response, the Dominican government privatized the banana industry. Also, the government has attempted to diversify the economy and has lifted <!--del_lnk--> price controls in an attempt to improve the lagging economy. The government is also trying to develop tourism, especially <!--del_lnk--> ecotourism. The lack of a large international airport or sandy beaches limit opportunities for standard tourism, but the island&#39;s heavily rainforested landscape and beautifully preserved environment could lure those looking for unparalleled ecotourism experiences. Indeed, it is remarked that of all the islands of the Caribbean, Dominica is the only one <a href="../../wp/c/Christopher_Columbus.htm" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> might still recognise.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

English is the official language of Dominica and is universally understood; however, because of historic French domination, <!--del_lnk--> Antillean Creole &quot;Patois&quot;, a French-based <!--del_lnk--> creole language, is the mother tongue of 80% of the Dominican people and this is one of the causes that led Dominica to join the <!--del_lnk--> Francophonie organization. About 80% of the population is Catholic, though in recent years a number of Protestant churches have been established.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

      <p>Dominica is home to a wide range of people. Historically occupied by several native tribes, only a <!--del_lnk--> Carib tribe remained by the time European settlers reached the island. French and British settlers each claimed the island, and imported <!--del_lnk--> slaves from <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>. The native Caribs have a reserve on which they live in their traditional manner. This mix of cultures is important to Dominica.<p>The famed novelist <!--del_lnk--> Jean Rhys was born and raised in Dominica. The island is obliquely depicted in her best-known book, <i><!--del_lnk--> Wide Sargasso Sea</i>. Rhys&#39;s friend, the political activist and writer <!--del_lnk--> Phyllis Shand Allfrey, set her <!--del_lnk--> 1954 novel, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Orchid House</i> (<!--del_lnk--> ISBN 0-8135-2332-X), in Dominica.<p>The dialect of Dominica also includes Cocoy and a French Patois. &quot;Cocoy&quot;, is primarily a mix of cockney English imported by English settler and with an infusion of African lingual. Cocoy is mainly spoken in the north-eastern part of the island. The French patois which is more widely spoken came from the French plantation owners from the neighbouring French islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominica&quot;</div>
