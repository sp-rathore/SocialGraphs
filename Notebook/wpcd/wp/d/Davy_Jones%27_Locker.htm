      <p><b>Davy Jones&#39;s Locker</b> is an <!--del_lnk--> idiom for the bottom of the sea &mdash; the resting place of drowned <!--del_lnk--> seamen. It is used as a <!--del_lnk--> euphemism for death at sea (e.g. to be &quot;sent to Davy Jones&#39;s Locker&quot;); <b>Davy Jones</b> is a nickname (used primarily by sailors) for what would be the <!--del_lnk--> devil of the seas. The origins of the name are unclear, and many theories have been put forth, including incompetent sailors, a pub owner who kidnapped sailors, or that Davy Jones is another name for the <!--del_lnk--> devil.<p>The story&#39;s reputation has been widespread among sailors since its popularization, and nautical traditions have been created around Davy Jones. He is also very popular in the broader culture.<p>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Daniel Defoe mentions the phrase in his <!--del_lnk--> 1726 book &quot;The Four Years Voyages of Capt. George Roberts&quot;: &quot;Heaving the rest into David Jones&#39;s locker, i.e. the sea.&quot; It appears not to have yet taken on the later connotations of misfortune.<p>The earliest known reference to Davy Jones&#39;s negative connotation occurs in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Tobias Smollett, published in <!--del_lnk--> 1751:<dl>
       <dd><i>This same Davy Jones, according to sailors, is the fiend that presides over all the evil spirits of the deep, and is often seen in various shapes, perching among the rigging on the eve of hurricanes, ship-wrecks, and other disasters to which sea-faring life is exposed, warning the devoted wretch of death and woe.</i></dl>
      <p>He is described in the same story as having saucer eyes, three rows of teeth, horns, a tail, and blue smoke coming from his nostrils.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1824, <!--del_lnk--> Washington Irving mentions Jones&#39;s name in his &quot;Adventures of the Black Fisherman.&quot;:<dl>
       <dd><i>He came, said he, in a storm, and he went in a storm; he came in the night, and he went in the night; he came nobody knows whence, and he has gone nobody knows where. For aught I know he has gone to sea once more on his chest, and may land to bother some people on the other side of the world; though it&#39;s a thousand pities, added he, if he has gone to Davy Jones&#39;s locker.</i></dl>

      <p>The exact origin of &quot;Davy Jones&quot; is unclear, and many explanations have been proposed. David Jones was a pirate on the Indian Ocean in the <!--del_lnk--> 1630s, but most scholars agree that he was not famous enough to gain such lasting global fame.  Sources have cited the British pub owner who is referenced in the <!--del_lnk--> 1594 song &quot;Jones&#39;s Ale is Newe.&quot; He may be the same pub owner who supposedly threw drunken sailors into his ale locker and then dumped them onto any passing ship. He could also be Duffer Jones, a notoriously <!--del_lnk--> myopic sailor who often found himself overboard.<p>Others have suggested more supernatural meanings. Some believe the name came from Welsh sailors who would call upon Saint David for protection in times of mortal danger. Some also think it is just another name for the <!--del_lnk--> devil. Some call him Deva, Davy or Taffy, the thief of the evil spirit. Some think Jonah became the &quot;evil angel&quot; of all sailors. Upon death, a wicked sailor&#39;s body supposedly went to Davy Jones&#39;s locker, but a holy sailor soul went to <!--del_lnk--> Fiddler&#39;s Green.<p><a id="Etymology" name="Etymology"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Etymology</span></h3>
      <p>Davy may come from Duppy, a <!--del_lnk--> West Indian term for a malevolent <!--del_lnk--> ghost, or from <!--del_lnk--> Saint David, also known as Dewi, the <!--del_lnk--> patron saint of <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a>, while Jones comes from the prophet <!--del_lnk--> Jonah, whose story is considered bad luck for sailors.<p><a id="Reputation" name="Reputation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Reputation</span></h3>
      <p>Jones&#39;s reputation causes fear among sailors, and many refuse to discuss Davy Jones in any great detail. Not all traditions dealing with Davy Jones are fearful. In traditions associated with sailors crossing the Equatorial line, there was a &quot;raucous and rowdy&quot; initiation presided over by those who had crossed the line before, known as shellbacks, or Sons of Neptune. The eldest shellback was called King Neptune, and the next eldest was his assistant who was called Davy Jones.<p><a id="In_popular_culture" name="In_popular_culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">In popular culture</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Movies" name="Movies"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Movies</span></h4>
      <p><b><!--del_lnk--> Davy Jones</b> is the main villain in the film <i><!--del_lnk--> Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#39;s Chest</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 2006), played by <!--del_lnk--> Bill Nighy. He appears along with his crew of half-human, half-sea creature sailors aboard the <!--del_lnk--> Flying Dutchman. He is portrayed as a mutated cross between a man and an octopus, with a wriggling beard of tentacles and two crustacean-esque limbs. The movie also extrapolates on the origins of Davy Jones. In the movie, the story follows that Davy Jones was once an average sailor who fell in love with a beautiful woman, wild and untameable as the sea. When he could not have her, the pain was so much that he cut out his still beating heart, and sealed it in a chest, so that he would never have to feel love or compassion ever again.<p><a id="Television" name="Television"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Television</span></h4>
      <p>In an episode of <i><!--del_lnk--> SpongeBob SquarePants</i>, The Flying Dutchman threatens to send Mr. Krabs to Davy Jones&#39; locker, which is full of smelly gym socks.<p>In the Anime and Manga series <i><!--del_lnk--> One Piece</i>, Davy Jones is mentioned as being the inspiration for the <!--del_lnk--> Davy Back Fight.

The number of games are chosen based on a coin system, meaning you can have either a 1-coin, 2-coin, or 3-coin game. After the selection, the coins are thrown into the ocean, supposedly payment to Davy Jones.<p>Davy Jones is also referenced many times in the <a href="../../wp/t/Television.htm" title="Television">television</a> series <i><!--del_lnk--> Rocko&#39;s Modern Life</i>.<p>His ship, <i>The Flying Dutchman</i>, has been parodied on <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Simpsons.htm" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i> as the restaurant <i>The Frying Dutchman</i>.<p>On the 1960&#39;s comedy <i><!--del_lnk--> The Monkees</i>, actor / character <!--del_lnk--> Davy Jones made reference to one day inheriting the locker in an episode of the series, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Hitting the High Seas.&quot;<p>In &quot;The Bird&#39;s Last Jest,&quot; an episode of the live-action <i><!--del_lnk--> Batman</i> series, <!--del_lnk--> Robin (<!--del_lnk--> Burt Ward) exclaims, &quot;Holy Davy Jones!&quot; as Chief O&#39;Hara (<!--del_lnk--> Stafford Repp) appears to be headed for a watery grave.<p>Also, in an episode of <i><!--del_lnk--> Yo Yogi</i>, Yogi says &quot;send them to Davey Jones&#39; locker&quot;.<p><a id="Video_Games" name="Video_Games"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Video Games</span></h4>
