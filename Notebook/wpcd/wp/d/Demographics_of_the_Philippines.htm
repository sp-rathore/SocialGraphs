      <p>According to the 2000 Census, the population of the <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a> was 76,504,077. The <!--del_lnk--> Aeta, who are genetically akin to <!--del_lnk--> Andamanese islanders and are known as the aboriginal inhabitants of the Philippines, constituting a distinct stock, number somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000 people (&lt;0.03 percent). The overwhelming majority of the population (95 percent), known as <!--del_lnk--> ethnic Filipinos, are made up of various ethnolinguistic groups descended from later <!--del_lnk--> Austronesian-speaking migrants who arrived in successive waves to the archipelago from <a href="../../wp/t/Taiwan.htm" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> and admixed with other sporadic migrations from the Asian mainland (what is today southern China). The most significant foreign ethnic minority are the Chinese, who have played an important role in commerce since the 9th century when they first arrived in the Philippines for trade. <!--del_lnk--> Mestizos, those of mixed race, form a tiny but economically and politically important minority. The most widely spoken language is <!--del_lnk--> Filipino, which is based on <!--del_lnk--> Tagalog, although thirteen regional languages are spoken as vernaculars throughout the Philippines. <!--del_lnk--> English serves as the primary lingua franca and as the language of commerce and the professions. <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> is the main religion in the archipelago, with <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholicism making up the majority. A small but significant minority profess <!--del_lnk--> Islam, particularly in the southern Philippines. The people of the Philippines are known as Filipinos. Throughout the colonial era the term &quot;Filipino&quot; originally referred to only the Spanish and Spanish-mestizo minority. The definition, however, was later changed to include the entire population of the Philippines regardless of ethnic origin.<p>

About 8% of all Filipinos of Austronesian descent are tribal peoples. The aborigines of the Philippines, called as <!--del_lnk--> Aeta, who are descended from <!--del_lnk--> Negritos of the <!--del_lnk--> Andaman Islands, now constitute only 0.003% of the entire population.<p>Significant foreign minorities include the <!--del_lnk--> ethnic Chinese, <!--del_lnk--> Americans, and the <!--del_lnk--> South Asians (mostly <!--del_lnk--> Sindh and <!--del_lnk--> Pakistani). Other foreign ethnicities in the country include <!--del_lnk--> Spaniards, <a href="../../wp/d/Demographics_of_the_Philippines.htm" title="Europeans in the Philippines">other Europeans</a> (mostly British and Dutch), <!--del_lnk--> Koreans, <!--del_lnk--> Japanese, <!--del_lnk--> Indonesians, and <!--del_lnk--> Arabs.<p>Various degrees of intermarriage between ethnic groups have resulted in the formation of a new vibrant class of peoples, collectively known as <!--del_lnk--> Filipino Mestizos. According to a <!--del_lnk--> Stanford University <i>small-n</i> study, only about 3.6% of all Filipinos have European genes, most probably <!--del_lnk--> Spanish.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Languages</span></h2>

      <p>A total of one hundred seventy-two native languages and dialects are spoken, all belonging to the <!--del_lnk--> Austronesian linguistic family. Since <!--del_lnk--> 1939, in an effort to develop national unity, the government has promoted the use of the official national language, <!--del_lnk--> Tagalog. Visayan (also pronounced Bisayan) is widely spoken throughtout the middle islands known as the Visayans and in many areas of Mindanao. <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> is the predominant non-native language.

      <p>According to the 2000 Census, 81.04% of all Filipinos are <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholics, while 5.06% are adherents of <!--del_lnk--> Islam in the Philippines, and 2.82% are <!--del_lnk--> Born Again Christians.

Roman Catholicism still subsists as a major religion. Often still, Catholic Filipinos mix Catholic beliefs and traditions with beliefs in ghosts and other spirits. Protestant denominations were introduced to the Philippines primarily during the 37 years of American occupation.<p><a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> was brought to the Sulu Archipelago in the 9th century by <!--del_lnk--> Makhdum Karim, an Arab trader, and to Mindanao island by <!--del_lnk--> Rajah Kabungsuwan, a Malaccan nobleman. From then onwards, Muslim princes carried on expeditions to propagate Islam. While Islam was easily displaced among the peoples of Luzon and the Visayas, it gained a stronghold in Mindanao.<p>Other religions include <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana Buddhism, followed by many Filipinos of Chinese descent. It is often mixed with Taoist and Confucianist beliefs, and <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Sikhism.htm" title="Sikhism">Sikhism</a>, followed by Filipinos of Indo-Aryan descent.<p><!--del_lnk--> Animism is still prevalent among the highland peoples of Cordillera and Mindanao.<p><a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h2>
      <p>The Philippines&#39; literacy rate was pegged at 92.28%, males at 92.10% and females at 92.47%. Literacy was defined by the Census 2000 to be a person 10 years or older, having the capability to read and write. The National Capital Region had the highest literacy rate, which was pegged at 98.14%. Other regions having a literacy rate higher than the national average were Ilocos Region, 95.23%, Central Luzon, 94.80%m Southern Tagalog Region, 94.01%, Bicol Region, 92.69%, and Western Visayas, 93.02%.

      <p>The first census in the Philippines was done on 1591, based on tributes collected. Based on this tribute counting, there were about 666,712 people in the islands. On 1600, this method was revamped by the Spanish officials, who then based the counting of the population through church records. On 1799, a certain Fr. Manuel Buzeta estimated the population count as 1,502,574. However, the first official census was conducted only in 1878, when the population as of midnight on December 31, 1877 was counted. This was followed by two more censuses, namely, the 1887 census, and the 1898 census. The 1887 census yielded a count of 5,984,727, while that of 1898 yielded 5,279,955.<p><a name="1818_census"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1818 census</span></h3>
