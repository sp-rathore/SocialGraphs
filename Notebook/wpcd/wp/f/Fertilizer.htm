      <p><b>Fertilizers</b> (<a href="../../wp/b/British_English.htm" title="British English">British English</a>, also <b>fertilisers</b>) are compounds given to <a href="../../wp/p/Plant.htm" title="Plant">plants</a> to promote growth; they are usually applied either via the soil, for uptake by plant roots, or by <!--del_lnk--> foliar feeding, for uptake through leaves. Fertilizers can be <!--del_lnk--> organic (composed of organic matter, i.e. carbon based), or <!--del_lnk--> inorganic (containing simple, inorganic chemicals). They can be naturally-occurring compounds such as <!--del_lnk--> peat or <a href="../../wp/m/Mineral.htm" title="Mineral">mineral</a> deposits, or manufactured through natural processes (such as <!--del_lnk--> composting) or chemical processes (such as the <!--del_lnk--> Haber process).<p>Fertilizers typically provide, in varying <!--del_lnk--> proportions, the three <!--del_lnk--> major plant nutrients (<a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen.htm" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Phosphorus.htm" title="Phosphorus">phosphorus</a>, and <a href="../../wp/p/Potassium.htm" title="Potassium">potassium</a>), the <!--del_lnk--> secondary plant nutrients (<a href="../../wp/c/Calcium.htm" title="Calcium">calcium</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Sulfur.htm" title="Sulfur">sulfur</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Magnesium.htm" title="Magnesium">magnesium</a>), and sometimes <!--del_lnk--> trace elements (or micronutrients) with a role in plant nutrition: <a href="../../wp/b/Boron.htm" title="Boron">boron</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Chlorine.htm" title="Chlorine">chlorine</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Manganese.htm" title="Manganese">manganese</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a>, <a href="../../wp/z/Zinc.htm" title="Zinc">zinc</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper">copper</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Molybdenum.htm" title="Molybdenum">molybdenum</a>.<p>

       <li>Examples of naturally-occurring inorganic fertilizers include Chilean <!--del_lnk--> sodium nitrate, mined &quot;rock <!--del_lnk--> phosphate&quot; and <!--del_lnk--> limestone (a calcium source, but mostly used to reduce soil acidity).<li>Examples of manufactured or chemically-synthesized inorganic fertilizers include <!--del_lnk--> ammonium nitrate, <!--del_lnk--> potassium sulfate, and <!--del_lnk--> superphosphate, or <!--del_lnk--> triple superphosphate.</ul>
      <p><a id="Macronutrients_and_micronutrients" name="Macronutrients_and_micronutrients"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Macronutrients and micronutrients</span></h3>
      <p>FERTILIZERS can be divided into macronutrients or micronutrients based on their concentations in plant dry matter. There are six macronutrients: nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus, often termed &#39;primary macronutrients&#39; because their availability is often managed with NPK fertilizers, and the &#39;secondary macronutrient&#39;, and calcium, magnesium, and sulfur, which are required in similar quantities but whose availability is often managed as part of liming and manuring practices rather than fertilizers. The macronutrients are consumed in larger quantities and normally present as whole number or tenths of percentages in plant tissues. There are many micronutrients, and their importance and occurrence differ somewhat from plant to plant. In general, most present from 5 to 100 parts per million (ppm) by mass. Examples of micronutrients are as follows: <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a> (Fe), <a href="../../wp/m/Manganese.htm" title="Manganese">manganese</a> (Mn), <a href="../../wp/b/Boron.htm" title="Boron">boron</a> (B), <a href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper">copper</a> (Cu), <a href="../../wp/m/Molybdenum.htm" title="Molybdenum">molybdenum</a> (Mo), and <a href="../../wp/z/Zinc.htm" title="Zinc">zinc</a> (Zn).<p><a id="Macronutrient_fertilizers" name="Macronutrient_fertilizers"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Macronutrient fertilizers</span></h3>
      <p>Synthesized materials are also called <b>artificial</b> , and may be described as <b>straight</b>, where the product predominantly contains the three primary ingredients of <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen.htm" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a> (N), <a href="../../wp/p/Phosphorus.htm" title="Phosphorus">phosphorus</a> (P) and <a href="../../wp/p/Potassium.htm" title="Potassium">potassium</a> (K), which are known as <b>N-P-K fertilizers</b> or <b>compound fertilizers</b> when elements are mixed intentionally. They are named or labeled according to the content of these three elements, which are macronutrients. The mass fraction (percent) nitrogen is reported directly. However, phosphorus is reported as <!--del_lnk--> diphosphorus pentoxide (P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), the <!--del_lnk--> anhydride of <!--del_lnk--> phosphoric acid, and potassium is reported as potash or <!--del_lnk--> potassium oxide (K<sub>2</sub>O), which is the anhydride of <!--del_lnk--> potassium hydroxide. Fertilizer composition is expressed in this fashion for historical reasons in the way it was analyzed (conversion to ash for P and K); this practice dates back to <!--del_lnk--> Justus von Liebig (see more below). Consequently, an 18-51-20 fertilizer would have 18% nitrogen as N, 51% phosphorus as P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, and 20% potassium as K<sub>2</sub>O, The other 11%is known as <b>ballast</b> and has no value to the plants.Although analyses are no longer carried out by ashing first, the naming convention remains. If nitrogen is the main element, they are often described as <b>nitrogen fertilizers</b>.<p>In general, the mass fraction (percentage) of elemental phosphorus, [P] = 0.436 x [P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>]<p>and the mass fraction (percentage) of elemental potassium, [K] = 0.83 x [K<sub>2</sub>O]<p>(These conversion factors are mandatory under the UK fertiliser-labelling regulations if elemental values are declared in addition to the N-P-K declaration.)<p>An 18&minus;51&minus;20 fertiliser therefore contains, by weight, 18% elemental nitrogen (N), 22% elemental phosphorus (P) and 16% elemental potassium (K).<p><a id="Agricultural_versus_Horticultural_Fertilizers" name="Agricultural_versus_Horticultural_Fertilizers"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Agricultural versus Horticultural Fertilizers</span></h3>
      <p>In general, agricultural fertilizers contain only one or two macronutrients. Agricultural fertilizers are intended to be applied infrequently and normally prior to or along side seeding. Examples of agricultural fertilizers are granular <!--del_lnk--> triple superphosphate, <!--del_lnk--> potassium chloride, <!--del_lnk--> urea, and <!--del_lnk--> anhydrous ammonia. The commodity nature of fertilizer, combined with the high cost of shipping, leads to use of locally available materials or those from the closest/cheapest source, which may vary with factors affecting transportation by rail, ship, or truck. In other words, a particular <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen.htm" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a> source may be very popular in one part of the country while another is very popular in another geographic region only due to factors unrelated to agronomic concerns.<p>Horticultural or specialty fertilizers, on the other hand, are formulated from many of the same compounds and some others to produce well-balanced fertilizers that also contain micronutrients. Some materials, such as <!--del_lnk--> ammonium nitrate, are used minimally in large scale production farming. The 18-51-20 example above is a horticultural fertilizer formulated with high phosphorus to promote bloom development in ornamental flowers. Horticultural fertilizers may be water-soluble (instant release) or relatively insoluble (controlled release). Controlled release fertilizers are also referred to as sustained release or timed release. Many controlled release fertilizers are intended to be applied approximately every 3-6 months, depending on watering, growth rates, and other conditions, whereas water-soluble fertilizers must be applied at least every 1-2 weeks and can be applied as often as every watering if sufficiently dilute. Unlike agricultural fertilizers, horticultural fertilizers are marketed directly to consumers and become part of retail product distribution lines.<p><a id="Justus_von_Liebig" name="Justus_von_Liebig"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Justus von Liebig</span></h3>
      <p>Chemist <!--del_lnk--> Justus von Liebig (in the 19th century) contributed greatly to understanding the role of inorganic compounds in plant nutrition and devised the concept of <!--del_lnk--> Liebig&#39;s barrel to illustrate the significance of inadequate concentrations of essential nutrients. At the same time he deemphasized the role of <a href="../../wp/h/Humus.htm" title="Humus">humus</a>. This theory was influential in the great expansion in use of artificial fertilizers in the 20th century.<p>Nitrogen fertilizer is often synthesized using the <!--del_lnk--> Haber-Bosch process, which produces <a href="../../wp/a/Ammonia.htm" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a>. This ammonia is applied directly to the soil or used to produce other compounds, notably <!--del_lnk--> ammonium nitrate, a dry, concentrated product. It can also be used in the <!--del_lnk--> Odda Process to produce compound fertilizers such as 15-15-15.<p>Inorganic fertilizers sometimes do not replace trace mineral elements in the soil which become gradually depleted by crops grown there. This has been linked to studies which have shown a marked fall (up to 75%) in the quantities of such minerals present in fruit and vegetables. One exception to this is in <!--del_lnk--> Western Australia where deficiencies of <a href="../../wp/z/Zinc.htm" title="Zinc">zinc</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper">copper</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Manganese.htm" title="Manganese">manganese</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Molybdenum.htm" title="Molybdenum">molybdenum</a> were identified as limiting the growth of crops and pastures in the 1940&#39;s and 1950&#39;s. Soils in Western Australia are very old, highly weathered and deficient in many of the major nutrients and trace elements. Since this time these trace elements are routinely added to inorganic fertilizers used in Agriculture in this state.<p>In many countries there is the public perception that inorganic fertilizers &quot;poison the soil&quot; and result in &quot;low quality&quot; produce. However, there is very little (if any) scientific evidence to support these views. When used appropriately, inorganic fertilizers enhance plant growth, the accumulation of organic matter and the biological activity of the soil, while reducing the risk of water run-off, overgrazing and soil erosion. The nutritional value of plants for human and animal consumption is typically improved when inorganic fertilizers are used appropriately.<p><a id="Organic_fertilizers" name="Organic_fertilizers"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Organic fertilizers</span></h2>
      <ul>
       <li>Examples of naturally occurring organic fertilizers include <!--del_lnk--> manure, <!--del_lnk--> slurry, <!--del_lnk--> worm castings, <!--del_lnk--> peat, <!--del_lnk--> seaweed and <!--del_lnk--> guano. <!--del_lnk--> Green manure crops are also grown to add nutrients to the <a href="../../wp/s/Soil.htm" title="Soil">soil</a>. Naturally occurring minerals such as mine rock phosphate, sulfate of potash and limestone are also considered Organic Fertilizers.<li>Examples of manufactured organic fertilizers include <!--del_lnk--> compost, <!--del_lnk--> bloodmeal, <!--del_lnk--> bone meal and <!--del_lnk--> seaweed extracts. Other examples are natural enzyme digested proteins, fish meal, and feather meal.</ul>
      <p>The decomposing <!--del_lnk--> crop residue from prior years is another source of fertility. Though not strictly considered &quot;fertilizer&quot;, the distinction seems more a matter of words than reality.<p>Some ambiguity in the usage of the term &#39;organic&#39; exists because some of synthetic fertilizers, such as <!--del_lnk--> urea and <!--del_lnk--> urea formaldehyde, are fully organic in the sense of <!--del_lnk--> organic chemistry. In fact, it would be difficult to chemically distinguish between urea of biological origin and that produced synthetically. On the other hand, some fertilizer materials commonly approved for organic agriculture, such as powdered <!--del_lnk--> limestone, mined &quot;rock <!--del_lnk--> phosphate&quot; and <!--del_lnk--> Chilean saltpeter, are inorganic in the use of the term by chemistry.<p>Although the density of nutrients in organic material is comparatively modest, they have some advantages. For one thing organic growers typically produce some or all of their fertilizer on-site, thus lowering operating costs considerably. Then there is the matter of how effective they are at promoting plant growth, chemical <!--del_lnk--> soil test results aside. The answers are encouraging. Since the majority of nitrogen supplying organic fertilizers contain insoluble nitrogen and are slow release fertilizers their effectiveness can be greater than conventional nitrogen fertilzers.<p>Implicit in modern theories of organic agriculture is the idea that the pendulum has swung the other way to some extent in thinking about plant nutrition. While admitting the obvious success of Leibig&#39;s theory, they stress that there are serious limitations to the current methods of implementing it via chemical fertilization. They re-emphasize the role of humus and other organic components of soil, which are believed to play several important roles:<ul>
       <li>Mobilizing existing soil nutrients, so that good growth is achieved with lower nutrient densities while wasting less<li>Releasing nutrients at a slower, more consistent rate, helping to avoid a boom-and-bust pattern<li>Helping to retain soil moisture, reducing the stress due to temporary moisture stress<li>Improving the <a href="../../wp/s/Soil_structure.htm" title="Soil structure">soil structure</a></ul>
      <p>Organics also have the advantage of avoiding certain long-term problems associated with the regular heavy use of artificial fertilizers:<ul>
       <li>the possibility of &quot;burning&quot; plants with the concentrated chemicals (i.e. an over supply of some nutrients)<li>the progressive decrease of real or perceived &quot;soil health&quot;, apparent in loss of structure, reduced ability to absorb precipitation, lightening of soil colour, etc.<li>the necessity of reapplying artificial fertilizers regularly (and perhaps in increasing quantities) to maintain fertility<li>the cost (substantial and rising in recent years) and resulting lack of independence</ul>
      <p>Organic fertilizers also have their disadvantages:<ul>
       <li>As acknowledged above, they are typically a dilute source of nutrients compared to inorganic fertilizers, and where significant amounts of nutrients are required for profitable yields, very large amounts of organic fertilizers must be applied. This results in prohibitive transportation and application costs, especially where the agriculture is practiced a long distance from the source of the organic fertilizer.<li>The composition of organic fertilizers tends to be highly variable, so that accurate application of nutrients to match plant production is difficult. Hence, large-scale agriculture tends to rely on inorganic fertilizers while organic fertilizers are cost-effective on small-scale horticultural or domestic gardens.</ul>
      <p>In practice a compromise between the use of artificial and organic fertilizers is common, typically by using inorganic fertilizers supplemented with the application of organics that are readily available such as the return of crop residues or the application of manure.<p>It is important to differentiate between what we mean by organic fertilizers and fertilizers approved for use in <!--del_lnk--> organic farming and <!--del_lnk--> organic gardening by organizations and authorities who provide <!--del_lnk--> organic certification services. Some approved fertilizers may be inorganic, naturally occurring chemical compounds, e.g. minerals...<p><a id="Environmental_effects_of_fertilizer_use" name="Environmental_effects_of_fertilizer_use"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Environmental effects of fertilizer use</span></h2>
      <p>Over-application of chemical fertilizers, or application of chemical fertilizers at a time when the ground is waterlogged or the crop is not able to use the chemicals, can lead to <!--del_lnk--> surface runoff (particularly phosphorus) or leaching into <!--del_lnk--> groundwater (particularly nitrates). One of the adverse effects of excess fertilizer in <!--del_lnk--> lacustrine systems are <!--del_lnk--> algal blooms, which can lead to excessive mortality rates for fish and other aquatic organisms. When prolonged algae blooms occur over many years, the effect is a process called <!--del_lnk--> eutrophication. Worldwide the issues of <!--del_lnk--> nutrient fate are analyzed using <!--del_lnk--> hydrology transport models.<p>Excessive nitrogen fertilizer applications can lead to pest problems by increasing the birth rate, longevity and overall fitness of certain pests (Jahn 2004; Jahn et al. 2001a,b, 2005; Preap et al. 2002, 2001).<p>It is also possible to over-apply organic fertilizers. However: their nutrient content, their solubility, and their release rates are typically much lower than chemical fertilizers, partially because by their nature, most organic fertilizers also provide increased physical and biological storage mechanisms to soils.<p>The problem of over-fertilization is primarily associated with the use of artificial fertilizers, because of the massive quantities applied and the destructive nature of chemical fertilizers on soil nutrient holding structures. The high solubilities of chemical fertilizers also exacerbate their tendency to degrade <!--del_lnk--> ecosystems.<p>Storage and application of some fertilizers in some weather or soil conditions can cause emissions of the <!--del_lnk--> greenhouse gas <!--del_lnk--> nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O). <a href="../../wp/a/Ammonia.htm" title="Ammonia">Ammonia</a> gas (NH<sub>3</sub>) may be emitted following application of inorganic fertilizers, or manure or slurry. Besides supplying nitrogen, ammonia can also increase soil <!--del_lnk--> acidity (lower <!--del_lnk--> pH, or &quot;souring&quot;).<p>For these reasons, it is recommended that knowledge of the nutrient content of the soil and nutrient requirements of the crop are carefully balanced with application of nutrients in inorganic fertiliser especially. This process is called <!--del_lnk--> nutrient budgeting. By careful monitoring of soil conditions, farmers can avoid wasting expensive fertilizers, and also avoid the potential costs of cleaning up any pollution created as a byproduct of their farming.<p>The concentration of up to 100 mg/kg of <a href="../../wp/c/Cadmium.htm" title="Cadmium">Cadmium</a> in <!--del_lnk--> phosphate minerals (for example <a href="../../wp/n/Nauru.htm" title="Nauru">Nauru</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Christmas islands ) increases the contamination of soil with Cadmium, for example in New Zealand. <a href="../../wp/u/Uranium.htm" title="Uranium">Uranium</a> is another example for impurities of fertilizers<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilizer&quot;</div>
