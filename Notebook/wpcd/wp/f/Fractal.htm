      <p>In colloquial usage, a <b>fractal</b> is &quot;a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be subdivided in parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced/size copy of the whole&quot;. The term was coined by <!--del_lnk--> Beno&icirc;t Mandelbrot in 1975 and was derived from the Latin fractus meaning <i>broken</i> or <i>fractured</i>.<p>A fractal as a <a href="../../wp/g/Geometry.htm" title="Geometry">geometric</a> object generally has the following features:<ul>
       <li>fine structure at arbitrarily small scales<li>is too irregular to be easily described in traditional Euclidean geometric language.<li>is self-similar (at least approximatively or stochastically)<li>has a <!--del_lnk--> Hausdorff dimension that is greater than its <!--del_lnk--> topological dimension (although this requirement is not met by space-filling curves such as the <!--del_lnk--> Hilbert curve)<li>has a simple and recursive definition.</ul>
      <p>Due to them appearing similar at all levels of magnification, fractals are often considered to be &#39;infinitely complex&#39;. Obvious examples include clouds, mountain ranges and lightning bolts. However, not all self-similar objects are fractals &mdash; for example, the <!--del_lnk--> real line (a straight <!--del_lnk--> Euclidean line) is formally self-similar but fails to have other fractal characteristics.<p>

      <p>Objects that are now described as fractals were discovered and described centuries ago. <!--del_lnk--> Ethnomathematics like Ron Eglash&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> African Fractals (<!--del_lnk--> ISBN 0-8135-2613-2) describes pervasive fractal geometry in indigenous African craft work. In 1525, the German Artist <a href="../../wp/a/Albrecht_D%25C3%25BCrer.htm" title="Albrecht D&uuml;rer">Albrecht D&uuml;rer</a> published <i><!--del_lnk--> The Painter&#39;s Manual</i>, in which one section is on &quot;Tile Patterns formed by Pentagons&quot;. The <!--del_lnk--> D&uuml;rer&#39;s Pentagon largely resembled the <!--del_lnk--> Sierpinski carpet, but based on <!--del_lnk--> pentagons instead of squares..<p>The idea of &quot;recursive self-similarity&quot; was originally developed by the philosopher <a href="../../wp/g/Gottfried_Leibniz.htm" title="Gottfried Leibniz">Leibniz</a> and he even worked out many of the details. In 1872, <!--del_lnk--> Karl Weierstrass found an example of a function with the nonintuitive property that it is everywhere <!--del_lnk--> continuous but nowhere <!--del_lnk--> differentiable &mdash; the graph of <!--del_lnk--> this function would now be called a fractal. In 1904, <!--del_lnk--> Helge von Koch, dissatisfied with Weierstrass&#39;s very abstract and analytic definition, gave a more geometric definition of a similar function, which is now called the <!--del_lnk--> Koch snowflake. In 1915, <!--del_lnk--> Waclaw Sierpinski constructed his <!--del_lnk--> triangle and one year later his <!--del_lnk--> carpet. Actually, these fractals were described as curves, which is hard to realize with the well-known modern constructions. The idea of self-similar curves was taken further by <!--del_lnk--> Paul Pierre L&eacute;vy who, in his 1938 paper <i>Plane or Space Curves and Surfaces Consisting of Parts Similar to the Whole</i>, described a new fractal curve, the <!--del_lnk--> L&eacute;vy C curve.<p><a href="../../wp/g/Georg_Cantor.htm" title="Georg Cantor">Georg Cantor</a> gave examples of <!--del_lnk--> subsets of the real line with unusual properties &mdash; these <!--del_lnk--> Cantor sets are also now recognized as fractals. Iterated functions in the <!--del_lnk--> complex plane had been investigated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by <!--del_lnk--> Henri Poincar&eacute;, <!--del_lnk--> Felix Klein, <!--del_lnk--> Pierre Fatou and <!--del_lnk--> Gaston Julia. However, without the aid of modern computer graphics they lacked the means to visualize the beauty of many of the objects that they had discovered.<p>In the 1960s Beno&icirc;t Mandelbrot started investigating self-similarity in papers such as <i><!--del_lnk--> How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension</i>. This built on earlier work by <!--del_lnk--> Lewis Fry Richardson. In 1975, Mandelbrot coined the word <i>fractal</i> to denote an object whose <!--del_lnk--> Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension is greater than its <!--del_lnk--> topological dimension. He illustrated this mathematical definition with striking computer-constructed visualizations. These images captured the popular imagination; many of them were based on recursion, leading to the popular meaning of the term &quot;fractal&quot;.<p><a id="Examples" name="Examples"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Examples</span></h2>

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>A relatively simple class of examples is given by the <!--del_lnk--> Cantor sets, <!--del_lnk--> Sierpinski triangle and <!--del_lnk--> carpet, <!--del_lnk--> Menger sponge, <!--del_lnk--> dragon curve, <!--del_lnk--> space-filling curve, <!--del_lnk--> Koch curve. Additional examples of fractals include the <!--del_lnk--> Lyapunov fractal and the limit sets of <!--del_lnk--> Kleinian groups. Fractals can be <!--del_lnk--> deterministic (all the above) or <!--del_lnk--> stochastic (that is, non-deterministic). For example the trajectories of the Brownian motion in the plane have <!--del_lnk--> Hausdorff dimension 2.<p><!--del_lnk--> Chaotic dynamical systems are sometimes associated with fractals. Objects in the phase space of a dynamical system can be fractals (see <!--del_lnk--> attractor). Objects in the parameter space for a family of systems may be fractal as well. An interesting example is the <!--del_lnk--> Mandelbrot set. This set contains whole discs, so it has the Hausdorff dimension equal to its topological dimension of 2 &mdash;but what is truly surprising is that the <!--del_lnk--> boundary of the Mandelbrot set also has the Hausdorff dimension of 2 (while the topological dimension of 1), a result proved by M. Shishikura in 1991. A closely related fractal is the <!--del_lnk--> Julia set.<p><a id="Self-similarity_dimension" name="Self-similarity_dimension"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Self-similarity dimension</span></h2>
      <p>The self-similarity dimension is a simplification of the <!--del_lnk--> Hausdorff dimension which can be applied to exactly self-similar objects.<p>The following analysis of the Koch Snowflake suggests how self-similarity can be used to analyze fractal properties.<p>The total length of a number, <i>N</i>, of small steps, <i>L</i>, is the product <i>NL</i>. Applied to the boundary of the Koch snowflake this gives a boundless length as <i>L</i> approaches zero. But this distinction is not satisfactory, as different Koch snowflakes do have different sizes. A solution is to measure, not in meter, m, nor in square meter, m&sup2;, but in some other power of a meter, m<sup><i>x</i></sup>. Now 4<i>N</i>(<i>L</i>/3)<sup><i>x</i></sup> = <i>NL</i><sup><i>x</i></sup>, because a three times shorter steplength requires four times as many steps, as is seen from the figure. Solving that equation gives <i>x</i> = (log 4)/(log 3) &asymp; 1.26186. So the unit of measurement of the boundary of the Koch snowflake is approximately m<sup>1.26186</sup>.<p>More generally, suppose that a fractal consists of <i>N</i> identical parts that are similar to the entire fractal with the scale factor of <i>L</i> and that the intersection between part is of the Lebesgue measure 0. Then the Hausdorff dimension of the fractal is <img alt="\frac{\log N}{\log L}\,\!" class="tex" src="../../images/278/27863.png" />. For example, the Hausdorff dimension of<ul>
       <li>the Cantor set is <img alt="\frac{\log 2}{\log 3}\approx 0.63\,\!" class="tex" src="../../images/278/27866.png" />,<li>the Sierpinski gasket is <img alt="\frac{\log 3}{\log 2}\approx 1.58\,\!" class="tex" src="../../images/278/27867.png" />,<li>the Sierpinski carpet is <img alt="\frac{\log 8}{\log 3}\approx 1.89\,\!" class="tex" src="../../images/278/27868.png" />,</ul>
      <p>and so on. Even more generally one may assume that each of <i>N</i> parts is similar to the fractal with a different scale factor <span class="texhtml"><i>L</i><sub><i>i</i></sub></span>, <span class="texhtml"><i>i</i> = 1...<i>N</i></span>. Then the Hausdorff dimension can be calculated by solving the following equation in the variable <i>s</i>:<dl>

      <p>Three common techniques for generating fractals are:<dl>
       <dd>
        <ul>
         <li><b>Escape-time fractals</b> &mdash; These are defined by a <!--del_lnk--> recurrence relation at each point in a space (such as the complex plane). Examples of this type are the <!--del_lnk--> Mandelbrot set, <!--del_lnk--> Julia set, the <!--del_lnk--> Burning Ship fractal and the <!--del_lnk--> Lyapunov fractal.<li><b><!--del_lnk--> Iterated function systems</b> &mdash; These have a fixed geometric replacement rule. <!--del_lnk--> Cantor set, <!--del_lnk--> Sierpinski carpet, <!--del_lnk--> Sierpinski gasket, <!--del_lnk--> Peano curve, <!--del_lnk--> Koch snowflake, <!--del_lnk--> Harter-Heighway dragon curve, <!--del_lnk--> T-Square, <!--del_lnk--> Menger sponge, are some examples of such fractals.<li><b>Random fractals</b> &mdash; Generated by stochastic rather than deterministic processes, for example, trajectories of the <!--del_lnk--> Brownian motion, <!--del_lnk--> L&eacute;vy flight, <!--del_lnk--> fractal landscapes and the <!--del_lnk--> Brownian tree. The latter yields so-called mass- or dendritic fractals, for example, <!--del_lnk--> diffusion-limited aggregation or <!--del_lnk--> reaction-limited aggregation clusters.</ul>

      <p><a id="Classification_of_fractals" name="Classification_of_fractals"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Classification of fractals</span></h2>
      <p>Fractals can also be classified according to their self-similarity. There are three types of self-similarity found in fractals:<dl>
       <dd>
        <ul>
         <li>Exact self-similarity &mdash; This is the strongest type of self-similarity; the fractal appears identical at different scales. Fractals defined by iterated function systems often display exact self-similarity.<li>Quasi-self-similarity &mdash; This is a loose form of self-similarity; the fractal appears approximately (but not exactly) identical at different scales. Quasi-self-similar fractals contain small copies of the entire fractal in distorted and degenerate forms. Fractals defined by <!--del_lnk--> recurrence relations are usually quasi-self-similar but not exactly self-similar.<li>Statistical self-similarity &mdash; This is the weakest type of self-similarity; the fractal has numerical or statistical measures which are preserved across scales. Most reasonable definitions of &quot;fractal&quot; trivially imply some form of statistical self-similarity. (Fractal dimension itself is a numerical measure which is preserved across scales.) Random fractals are examples of fractals which are statistically self-similar, but neither exactly nor quasi-self-similar.</ul>

      <p>Approximate fractals are easily found in nature. These objects display self-similar structure over an extended, but finite, scale range. Examples include <a href="../../wp/c/Cloud.htm" title="Cloud">clouds</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Snow.htm" title="Snow">snow flakes</a>, <!--del_lnk--> mountains, <a href="../../wp/r/River.htm" title="River">river</a> networks, <!--del_lnk--> cauliflower or <!--del_lnk--> broccoli, and systems of <!--del_lnk--> blood vessels.<p>Trees and ferns are fractal in nature and can be modeled on a computer by using a <!--del_lnk--> recursive <a href="../../wp/a/Algorithm.htm" title="Algorithm">algorithm</a>.

The central points are then randomly moved up or down, within a defined range. The procedure is repeated, decreasing at each iteration the range by half. The recursive nature of the algorithm guarantees that the whole is statistically similar to each detail.<p>Fractal patterns have been found in the paintings of American artist <!--del_lnk--> Jackson Pollock.
