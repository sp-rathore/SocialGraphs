      <p>Since prehistoric times people have lived by the seas and rivers for the access to cheap and quick transportation and access to food sources and trade; without human populations near natural bodies of water, there would be no concern for floods. However fertile soil in a river delta is subject to regular inundation from normal variation in precipitation.<p>Floods from the <a href="../../wp/s/Sea.htm" title="Sea">sea</a> can cause overflow or overtopping of flood-defenses like <!--del_lnk--> dikes as well as flattening of <a href="../../wp/d/Dune.htm" title="Dune">dunes</a> or bluffs. Land behind the coastal defence may be inundated or experience damage. A flood from sea may be caused by a heavy storm (<!--del_lnk--> storm surge), a high tide, a <a href="../../wp/t/Tsunami.htm" title="Tsunami">tsunami</a>, or a combination thereof. As many urban communities are located near the coast this is a major threat around the world.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Many <a href="../../wp/r/River.htm" title="River">rivers</a> that flow over relatively flat land border on broad <!--del_lnk--> flood plains. When heavy the deposition of silt on the rich farmlands and can result in their eventual depletion. The annual cycle of flood and farming was of great significance to many early farming cultures, most famously to the ancient <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egyptians</a> of the <a href="../../wp/n/Nile.htm" title="Nile">Nile</a> river and to the <a href="../../wp/m/Mesopotamia.htm" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamians</a> of the <a href="../../wp/t/Tigris.htm" title="Tigris">Tigris</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Euphrates.htm" title="Euphrates">Euphrates</a> rivers .<p>A flood happens when an area of land, usually low-lying, is covered with water. The worst floods usually occur when a river overflows its banks. An example of this is the January 1999 <!--del_lnk--> Queensland floods, which swamped south-eastern Queensland. Floods happen when soil and vegetation cannot absorb all the water. The water then runs off the land in quantities that cannot be carried in stream channels or kept in natural ponds or man-made reservoirs.<p>Periodic floods occur naturally on many rivers, forming an area known as the flood plain. These river floods usually result from heavy rain, sometimes combined with melting snow, which causes the rivers to overflow their banks. A flood that rises and falls rapidly with little or no advance warning is called a flash flood. Flash floods usually result from intense rainfall over a relatively small area. Coastal areas are occasionally flooded by high tides caused by severe winds on ocean surfaces, or by tidal waves caused by undersea earthquakes. There are often many causes for a flood.<p><!--del_lnk--> Monsoon rainfalls can cause disastrous flooding in some equatorial countries, such as <a href="../../wp/b/Bangladesh.htm" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Tropical_cyclone.htm" title="Hurricane">Hurricanes</a> have a number of different features which, together, can cause devastating flooding. One is the <!--del_lnk--> storm surge (sea flooding as much as 8 <!--del_lnk--> metres high) caused by the leading edge of the hurricane when it moves from sea to land. Another is the large amounts of <!--del_lnk--> precipitation associated with hurricanes. The eye of a hurricane has extremely low pressure, so <a href="../../wp/s/Sea.htm" title="Sea">sea</a> level may rise a few metres in the eye of the storm. This type of <!--del_lnk--> coastal flooding occurs regularly in <a href="../../wp/b/Bangladesh.htm" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>.<p>In <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> floods from sea may occur as a result from heavy <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic</a> storms, pushing the water to the coast. Especially in combination with high tide this can be damaging.<p>Under some rare conditions associated with <!--del_lnk--> heat waves, <!--del_lnk--> flash floods from quickly melting mountain <a href="../../wp/s/Snow.htm" title="Snow">snow</a> have caused loss of property and life.<p>Undersea earthquakes, eruptions of island volcanos that form a <!--del_lnk--> caldera, (such as <!--del_lnk--> Thera or <!--del_lnk--> Krakatau) and marine landslips on continental shelves may all engender a tidal wave called a <a href="../../wp/t/Tsunami.htm" title="Tsunami">tsunami</a> that causes destruction to coastal areas. See the <i><a href="../../wp/t/Tsunami.htm" title="Tsunami">tsunami</a></i> article for full details of these marine floods.<p>Floods are the most frequent type of disaster worldwide. Thus, it is often difficult or impossible to obtain <!--del_lnk--> insurance policies which cover destruction of <a href="../../wp/p/Property.htm" title="Property">property</a> due to flooding, since floods are a relatively predictable risk.<p><a id="Flood_defenses.2C_planning.2C_and_management" name="Flood_defenses.2C_planning.2C_and_management"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Flood defenses, planning, and management</span></h2>

      <p>In western countries, rivers prone to flooding are often carefully managed. Defenses such as <!--del_lnk--> levees, <!--del_lnk--> bunds, <!--del_lnk--> reservoirs, and <!--del_lnk--> weirs are used to prevent rivers from bursting their banks. Coastal flooding has been addressed in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> with <!--del_lnk--> coastal defenses, such as <!--del_lnk--> sea walls and <!--del_lnk--> beach nourishment.<ul>
