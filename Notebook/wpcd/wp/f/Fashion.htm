      <p>The term <b>fashion</b> usually applies to a prevailing mode of expression, but quite often applies to a personal mode of expression that may or may not adhere to prevailing ideals. Inherent in the term is the idea that the mode will change more quickly than the <a href="../../wp/c/Culture.htm" title="Culture">culture</a> as a whole. The terms &quot;fashionable&quot; and &quot;unfashionable&quot; are employed to describe whether someone or something fits in with the current popular mode of expression. The term &quot;fashion&quot; is frequently used in a positive sense, as a synonym for <!--del_lnk--> glamour and style. In this sense, fashions are a sort of communal <a href="../../wp/a/Art.htm" title="Art">art</a>, through which a culture examines its notions of <!--del_lnk--> beauty and <!--del_lnk--> goodness. The term &quot;fashion&quot; is also sometimes used in a negative sense, as a synonym for <!--del_lnk--> fads, <!--del_lnk--> trends, and <!--del_lnk--> materialism.<p>Fashions are <!--del_lnk--> social psychology phenomena common to many fields of human activity and thinking. The rises and falls of fashions have been especially documented and examined in the following fields:<ul>
       <li><a href="../../wp/a/Architecture.htm" title="Architecture">Architecture</a>, <!--del_lnk--> interior design, and <!--del_lnk--> landscape design<li>Arts and <!--del_lnk--> crafts<li><!--del_lnk--> Body type, <a href="../../wp/c/Clothing.htm" title="Clothing">clothing</a> or <!--del_lnk--> costume, <!--del_lnk--> cosmetics, <!--del_lnk--> grooming, and <!--del_lnk--> personal adornment<li><!--del_lnk--> Cuisine<li><a href="../../wp/d/Dance.htm" title="Dance">Dance</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Music.htm" title="Music">music</a><li><!--del_lnk--> Forms of address, <!--del_lnk--> slang, and other forms of speech<li><a href="../../wp/e/Economics.htm" title="Economics">Economics</a> and spending choices, as studied in <a href="../../wp/b/Behavioral_finance.htm" title="Behavioral finance">behavioural finance</a><li><!--del_lnk--> Entertainment, <a href="../../wp/g/Game.htm" title="Games">games</a>, <!--del_lnk--> hobbies, <a href="../../wp/s/Sport.htm" title="Sports">sports</a>, and other pastimes<li><!--del_lnk--> Etiquette<li><!--del_lnk--> Management, <!--del_lnk--> management styles and ways of organizing<li><a href="../../wp/p/Politics.htm" title="Politics">Politics</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Mass_media.htm" title="Mass media">media</a>, especially the topics of <!--del_lnk--> conversation encouraged by the media<li><a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">Philosophy</a> and <!--del_lnk--> spirituality (One might argue that <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religion</a> is prone to fashions, although official religions tend to change so slowly that the term cultural shift is perhaps more appropriate than &quot;fashion&quot;)<li><a href="../../wp/t/Technology.htm" title="Technology">Technology</a>, such as the choice of <!--del_lnk--> programming techniques</ul>
      <p>Of these fields, <!--del_lnk--> costume especially has become so linked in the public eye with the term &quot;fashion&quot;. The more general term &quot;costume&quot; has been relegated by many to only mean <!--del_lnk--> fancy dress or <!--del_lnk--> masquerade wear, while the term &quot;fashion&quot; means <a href="../../wp/c/Clothing.htm" title="Clothing">clothing</a> generally, and the study of it. This linguistic switch is due to the so-called fashion plates which were produced during the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, showing novel ways to use new textiles. For a broad cross-cultural look at clothing and its place in society, refer to the entries for clothing and costume. The remainder of this article deals with clothing fashions in the industrialized world.<p>

      <p>The <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European</a> idea of fashion as a personal statement rather than a cultural expression begins in the <a href="../../wp/1/16th_century.htm" title="16th century">16th century</a>: ten portraits of German or Italian gentlemen may show ten entirely different hats. But the local culture still set the bounds, as <a href="../../wp/a/Albrecht_D%25C3%25BCrer.htm" title="Albrecht D&uuml;rer">Albrecht D&uuml;rer</a> recorded in his actual or composite contrast of Nuremberg and Venetian fashions at the close of the <a href="../../wp/1/15th_century.htm" title="15th century">15th century</a> (<i>illustration, right</i>). Fashions among upper-class Europeans began to move in synchronicity in the <a href="../../wp/1/18th_century.htm" title="18th century">18th century</a>; though colors and patterns of textiles changed from year to year, (Thornton), the cut of a gentleman&#39;s coat and the length of his waistcoat, or the pattern to which a lady&#39;s dress was cut changed more slowly. Men&#39;s fashions derived from military models, and changes in a European male silhouette are galvanized in theatres of European war, where gentleman officers had opportunities to make notes of foreign styles: an example is the &quot;Steinkirk&quot; cravat (a necktie) (see <!--del_lnk--> Cravat).<p>The pace of change picked up in the <!--del_lnk--> 1780s with the publication of French engravings that showed the latest Paris styles. By <!--del_lnk--> 1800, all Western Europeans were dressing alike: local variation became first a sign of provincial culture, and then a badge of the conservative <!--del_lnk--> peasant (James Laver; <!--del_lnk--> Fernand Braudel).<p>Fashion in clothes has allowed wearers to express <a href="../../wp/e/Emotion.htm" title="Emotion">emotion</a> or solidarity with other people for millennia. Modern <!--del_lnk--> Westerners have a wide choice available in the selection of their clothes. What a person chooses to wear can reflect that person&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> personality or likes. When people who have cultural <!--del_lnk--> status start to wear new or different clothes a fashion trend may start. People who like or respect them may start to wear clothes of a similar style.<p>Fashions may vary significantly within a <a href="../../wp/s/Society.htm" title="Society">society</a> according to <!--del_lnk--> age, <!--del_lnk--> social class, <!--del_lnk--> generation, <!--del_lnk--> occupation and <a href="../../wp/g/Geography.htm" title="Geography">geography</a> as well as over time. If, for example, an older person dresses according to the fashion of young people, he or she may look ridiculous in the eyes of both young and older people. The term &quot;<!--del_lnk--> fashion victim&quot; refers to someone who slavishly follows the current fashions (implementations of fashion).<p>One can regard the system of sporting various fashions as a fashion <a href="../../wp/l/Language.htm" title="Language">language</a> incorporating various <!--del_lnk--> fashion statements using a <!--del_lnk--> grammar of fashion. (Compare some of the work of <!--del_lnk--> Roland Barthes.)<ul>

      <p>This is an example list of some of the fads and trends of the 21st century: Capri pants, handbags, sport suits and sports jackets, ripped jeans, <!--del_lnk--> designer jeans, blazer jackets, and high-heeled shoes.<dl>

      <p>Fashion, by definition, changes constantly. The changes may proceed more rapidly than in most other fields of human activity (<a href="../../wp/l/Language.htm" title="Language">language</a>, <!--del_lnk--> thought, etc). For some, modern fast-paced changes in fashion embody many of the negative aspects of <a href="../../wp/c/Capitalism.htm" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a>: it results in waste and encourages people <i>qua</i> <!--del_lnk--> consumers to buy things unnecessarily. Others, especially young people, enjoy the diversity that changing fashion can apparently provide, seeing the constant change as a way to satisfy their desire to experience &quot;new&quot; and &quot;interesting&quot; things. Note too that fashion can change to enforce uniformity, as in the case where so-called <!--del_lnk--> Mao suits became the national uniform of <!--del_lnk--> mainland China.<p>Materially affluent societies can offer a variety of different fashions, in clothes or accessories, to choose from. At the same time there remains an equal or larger range designated (at least currently) &#39;out of fashion&#39;. (These or similar fashions may cyclically come back &#39;into fashion&#39; in due course, and remain &#39;in fashion&#39; again for a while.)<p>Practically every aspect of appearance that can be changed has been changed at some time, for example skirt lengths ranging from ankle to mini, etc. In the past, new discoveries and lesser-known parts of the world could provide an impetus to change fashions based on the <!--del_lnk--> exotic: Europe in the eighteenth or nineteenth centuries, for example, might favour things Turkish at one time, things Chinese at another, and things Japanese at a third. A modern version of exotic clothing includes <!--del_lnk--> club wear. Globalization has reduced the options of exotic novelty in more recent times, and has seen the introduction of non-Western wear into the Western world.<p><!--del_lnk--> Fashion houses and their associated <!--del_lnk--> fashion designers, as well as high-status consumers (including <!--del_lnk--> celebrities), appear to have some role in determining the rates and directions of fashion change.<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Quotes</span></h2>
