      <p><b>Felix the Cat</b> is a <!--del_lnk--> cartoon <!--del_lnk--> character from the <a href="../../wp/s/Silent_film.htm" title="Silent film">silent-film</a> era. His black body, white eyes, and giant grin, coupled with the <!--del_lnk--> surrealism of the situations in which his cartoons place him, combined to make Felix one of the most recognizable cartoon characters in the world. Felix was the first character from animation to attain a level of popularity sufficient to draw movie audiences based solely on his <!--del_lnk--> star power.<p>Felix&#39;s origins remain disputed. <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australian</a> <!--del_lnk--> cartoonist and <!--del_lnk--> film entrepreneur <!--del_lnk--> Pat Sullivan and <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States of America">American</a> <!--del_lnk--> animator <!--del_lnk--> Otto Messmer have both claimed to be his creator, and evidence seems to back up both claims. However, many historians, such as <!--del_lnk--> John Canemaker, argue that Messmer ghosted for Sullivan. Other historians disagree. What is certain is that the <a href="../../wp/c/Cat.htm" title="Cat">cat</a> emerged from Sullivan&#39;s studio.<p>During the 1920s, Felix enjoyed sudden, enormous popularity in international <a href="../../wp/p/Popular_culture.htm" title="Popular culture">popular culture</a>. He got his own <!--del_lnk--> comic strip (drawn by Messmer), and his image soon adorned all sorts of merchandise. <a href="../../wp/j/Jazz.htm" title="Jazz">Jazz</a> bands such as <!--del_lnk--> Paul Whiteman&#39;s sang about him. Nevertheless, the success was short-lived. The arrival of <!--del_lnk--> talking cartoons, particularly those of <a href="../../wp/w/Walt_Disney.htm" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney&#39;s</a> <!--del_lnk--> Mickey Mouse, eclipsed the silent offerings of Sullivan and Messmer. A few talking Felix shorts produced by Sullivan&#39;s brother failed to win back audiences.<p><a href="../../wp/t/Television.htm" title="Television">Television</a> would prove the cat&#39;s savior. Felix cartoons began airing on American TV beginning in 1953. Meanwhile, <!--del_lnk--> Joe Oriolo, the new artist behind the Felix comic strip, gained the rights to feature Felix in a new series specifically for television. Oriolo introduced new characters, such as <!--del_lnk--> Poindexter and <!--del_lnk--> Rock Bottom, and he gave Felix a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Magic Bag of Tricks&quot;, which could shift into myriad shapes based on Felix&#39;s needs. Joe Oriolo&#39;s son, <!--del_lnk--> Don Oriolo, continues as Felix&#39;s caretaker today, and the cat has since starred in other television programs and in a <!--del_lnk--> feature film.<p>

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> November 9, <!--del_lnk--> 1919, Master Tom, a character resembling Felix, debuted in a <!--del_lnk--> Paramount Pictures short entitled <i><!--del_lnk--> Feline Follies</i>. Produced by the <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a>-based animation studio owned by Pat Sullivan, the cartoon was directed by <!--del_lnk--> cartoonist and <!--del_lnk--> animator Otto Messmer. It was a success, and the Sullivan studio quickly set to work on producing another film featuring Master Tom, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Musical Mews</i> (released <!--del_lnk--> November 16, <!--del_lnk--> 1919). It too proved to be successful with audiences. Paramount <!--del_lnk--> producer <!--del_lnk--> John King suggested that the cat ought to be renamed to &quot;Felix&quot;, after the <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> words <i>felis</i> (cat) and <i>felix</i> (luck), which was used for the third film, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Adventures of Felix</i> (released on <!--del_lnk--> December 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1919). In 1924, animator <!--del_lnk--> Bill Nolan redesigned the fledgling feline, making him both rounder and cuter. Felix&#39;s new looks, coupled with Messmer&#39;s mastery of <!--del_lnk--> character animation, would soon rocket Felix to international fame.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The question of who exactly created Felix remains a matter of dispute. Sullivan stated in numerous newspaper interviews that he created Felix and did the key drawings for the character. On a visit to Australia in 1925, Sullivan told <i><!--del_lnk--> The Argus</i> newspaper that &quot;The idea was given to me by the sight of a cat which my wife brought to the studio one day.&quot;<!--del_lnk-->  On other occasions, he claimed that Felix had been inspired by <a href="../../wp/r/Rudyard_Kipling.htm" title="Rudyard Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>&#39;s &quot;The Cat that Walked by Himself&quot; or by his wife&#39;s love for strays. Members of the Australian Cartoonist Association have demonstrated that lettering used in <i>Feline Follies</i> matches Sullivan&#39;s handwriting.<!--del_lnk-->  Sullivan&#39;s claim is also supported by his <!--del_lnk--> March 18, <!--del_lnk--> 1917, release of a cartoon short entitled <i><!--del_lnk--> The Tail of Thomas Kat</i>, more than two years prior to <i>Feline Follies</i>. Both an Australian <!--del_lnk--> ABC-TV documentary screened in 2004 and the curators of an exhibition at the <!--del_lnk--> State Library of New South Wales, in 2005, suggested that Thomas Kat was a prototype or precursor of Felix. However, few details of Thomas have survived. His fur colour has not been definitively established, and the surviving copyright synopsis for the short suggests significant differences between Thomas and the later Felix. For example, whereas the later Felix magically transforms his tail into tools and other objects, Thomas is a non-<!--del_lnk--> anthropomorphized cat who loses his tail in a fight with a rooster, never to recover it.<p>Sullivan was the studio proprietor and &mdash; as is the case with almost all film entrepreneurs &mdash; he owned the copyright of any creative work by his employees. In common with many animators at the time, Messmer was not credited. After Sullivan&#39;s death in 1933, his estate in Australia took ownership of the character.<p>It was not until many years after Sullivan&#39;s death that Sullivan staffers such as <!--del_lnk--> Hal Walker, <!--del_lnk--> Al Eugster, and Sullivan&#39;s lawyer, <!--del_lnk--> Harry Kopp, credited Messmer with Felix&#39;s creation. They claimed that Felix was based on an animated <a href="../../wp/c/Charlie_Chaplin.htm" title="Charlie Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a> that Messmer had animated for Sullivan&#39;s studio earlier on. The down-and-out personality and movements of the cat in <i>Feline Follies</i> reflect key attributes of Chaplin&#39;s, and, although blockier than the later Felix, the familiar black body is already there (Messmer found solid shapes easier to animate). Messmer himself recalled his version of the cat&#39;s creation in an interview with animation historian <!--del_lnk--> John Canemaker:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>Many animation historians (most of them American and English) back Messmer&#39;s claims. Among them are <!--del_lnk--> Michael Barrier, <!--del_lnk--> Jerry Beck, <!--del_lnk--> Colin and Timothy Cowles, <!--del_lnk--> Donald Crafton, <!--del_lnk--> David Gerstein, <!--del_lnk--> Milt Gray, <!--del_lnk--> Mark Kausler, <!--del_lnk--> Leonard Maltin, and <!--del_lnk--> Charles Solomon.<p>Regardless of who created Felix, Sullivan marketed the cat relentlessly, while the unaccredited Messmer continued to produce a prodigious volume of Felix cartoons. Messmer did the animation directly on white paper with inkers tracing the drawings directly. The animators drew backgrounds onto pieces of <!--del_lnk--> celluloid, which were then laid atop the drawings to be photographed. Any perspective work had to be animated by hand, as the studio cameras were unable to perform pans or trucks. Messmer began a <!--del_lnk--> comic strip in 1923, distributed by <!--del_lnk--> King Features Syndicate.<p><a id="Popularity_and_distribution" name="Popularity_and_distribution"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Popularity and distribution</span></h2>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Paramount Pictures distributed the earliest films from 1919 to 1921. <!--del_lnk--> Margaret J. Winkler distributed the shorts from 1922 to 1925, the year when <!--del_lnk--> Educational Pictures took over the distribution of the shorts. Sullivan promised them one new <i>Felix</i> short every two weeks. The combination of solid animation, skillful promotion, and widespread distribution sent Felix&#39;s popularity soaring to new heights.<p>By 1923, the cat was at the peak of his film career. <i><!--del_lnk--> Felix in Hollywood</i>, a short released during this year, plays upon Felix&#39;s popularity, as he becomes acquainted with such fellow celebrities as <!--del_lnk--> Douglas Fairbanks, <!--del_lnk--> Cecil B. DeMille, <a href="../../wp/c/Charlie_Chaplin.htm" title="Charlie Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Ben Turpin, and even censor <!--del_lnk--> Will H. Hays. His image could be seen on clocks, Christmas ornaments, and as the first giant balloon ever made for <!--del_lnk--> Macy&#39;s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Felix also became the subject of several popular songs of the day, such as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Felix Kept Walking&quot;. Even <!--del_lnk--> Paul Whiteman, the king of jazz himself, did a bit on the frisky feline. Sullivan made an estimated $100,000 a year from toy licensing alone. With the character&#39;s success also emerged a handful of new costars. These included Felix&#39;s master <!--del_lnk--> Willie Brown, a foil named <!--del_lnk--> Skiddoo the Mouse, Felix&#39;s nephews <!--del_lnk--> Inky, Dinky, and Winky, and his girlfriend Kitty.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Most of the early Felix cartoons mirrored American attitudes of the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> roaring twenties&quot;. Ethnic stereotypes appeared in such shorts as <i><!--del_lnk--> Felix Goes Hungry</i> (1924). Recent events such as the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Civil War were depicted in shorts like <i><!--del_lnk--> Felix All Puzzled</i> (1924). <!--del_lnk--> Flappers were caricatured in <i><!--del_lnk--> Felix Strikes It Rich</i> (also 1924). He also became involved in <a href="../../wp/t/Trade_union.htm" title="Trade union">union</a> organizing with <i><!--del_lnk--> Felix Revolts</i> (1923). In some shorts, Felix even performed a rendition of the <!--del_lnk--> Charleston.<p>References to <!--del_lnk--> alcoholism and <!--del_lnk--> Prohibition were also commonplace in many of the Felix shorts, particularly <i><!--del_lnk--> Felix Finds Out</i> (1924), <i><!--del_lnk--> Whys and Other Whys</i> (1927), <i><!--del_lnk--> Felix Woos Whoopee</i> (1930) to name a few. In <i><!--del_lnk--> Felix Dopes It Out</i> (1924), Felix tries to help his hobo friend who is plagued with a red nose. By the end of the short, the cat finds the cure for the condition: &quot;Keep drinking, and it&#39;ll turn blue.&quot;<p>In addition, Felix was the first image ever broadcast by <a href="../../wp/t/Television.htm" title="Television">television</a> when <!--del_lnk--> RCA chose a <!--del_lnk--> papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; Felix doll for a 1928 experiment via <!--del_lnk--> W2XBS <!--del_lnk--> New York in <!--del_lnk--> Van Cortlandt Park. The doll was chosen for its tonal contrast and its ability to withstand the intense lights needed. It was placed on a rotating <!--del_lnk--> phonograph turntable and photographed for approximately two hours each day. After a one-time payoff to Sullivan, the doll remained on the turntable for nearly a decade as RCA fine-tuned the picture&#39;s definition.<p>Felix&#39;s great success also spawned a host of imitators. The appearances and personalities of other 1920s feline stars such as Julius of <a href="../../wp/w/Walt_Disney.htm" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney</a>&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Alice Comedies</i>, Waffles of <!--del_lnk--> Paul Terry&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Aesop&#39;s Film Fables</i>, and especially Bill Nolan&#39;s 1925 adaptation of <i><a href="../../wp/k/Krazy_Kat.htm" title="Krazy Kat">Krazy Kat</a></i> (distributed by the eschewed Winkler) all seem to have been directly patterned after Felix.<p>Felix&#39;s cartoons were a hit with the critics as well. They have been cited as imaginative examples of <!--del_lnk--> surrealism in <a href="../../wp/f/Film.htm" title="Film">filmmaking</a>. Felix has been said to represent a child&#39;s sense of wonder, creating the fantastic when it is not there, and taking it in stride when it is. His famous pace&mdash;hands behind his back, head down, deep in thought&mdash;became a trademark that has been analyzed by critics around the world. Felix&#39;s expressive tail, which could be a shovel one moment, an exclamation mark or pencil the next, serves to emphasize that anything can happen in his world. <!--del_lnk--> Aldous Huxley wrote that the <i>Felix</i> shorts proved that &quot;What the cinema can do better than literature or the spoken drama is to be fantastic.&quot;<p>In 1928, Education ceased releasing the Felix cartoons and several were reissued by <!--del_lnk--> First National Pictures. <!--del_lnk--> Copley Pictures distributed them from 1929 to 1930. He saw a brief three-cartoon resurrection in 1936 by the <!--del_lnk--> Van Beuren Studios, but the glory of the old days had disappeared during the cat&#39;s short-lived stint in colour and sound. Sullivan did most of the <!--del_lnk--> marketing for the character in the 1920s.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Given the character&#39;s unprecedented popularity and the fact that his name was partially derived from the Latin word for &quot;happy&quot;, some rather notable individuals and organizations adopted Felix as a mascot. The first of these was a <!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles <!--del_lnk--> Chevrolet dealer and friend of Pat Sullivan named Winslow B. Felix who first opened his showroom in 1921. <!--del_lnk--> The three-sided neon sign of Felix Chevrolet, with its giant, smiling images of the character, is today one of LA&#39;s best-known landmarks, standing watch over both <!--del_lnk--> Figueroa Street and the <!--del_lnk--> Harbour Freeway. Others who adopted Felix included the 1922 <!--del_lnk--> New York Yankees and aviator <!--del_lnk--> Charles Lindbergh, who took a Felix doll with him on his historic flight across the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>.<p>This popularity persisted. In the late 1920s, the U.S. Navy&#39;s Bombing Squadron Two (VB-2B) adopted a unit insignia consisting of Felix happily carrying a bomb with a burning fuse. They retained the insignia through the 1930s when they became a fighter squadron under the designations VF-6B and, later, VF-3, whose members <!--del_lnk--> Edward O&#39;Hare and <!--del_lnk--> John Thach became famous Naval Aviators in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. After the world war a <!--del_lnk--> US Navy fighter squadron currently designated <!--del_lnk--> VF-31 replaced its winged meat-cleaver logo with the same insignia, after the original Felix squadron had been disbanded. The carrier-based night-fighter squadron, nicknamed the &quot;Tomcatters,&quot; remained active under various designations continuing through the present day and Felix still appears on both the squadron&#39;s cloth jacket patches and aircraft, carrying his bomb with its fuse that has yet to burn down.<p><a id="From_silent_to_sound" name="From_silent_to_sound"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">From silent to sound</span></h2>

      <p>With the advent of <i><!--del_lnk--> The Jazz Singer</i> in 1927, Educational Pictures, who distributed the Felix shorts at the time, urged Pat Sullivan to make the leap to <!--del_lnk--> &quot;talkie&quot; cartoons, but Sullivan refused. Further disputes led to a break between Educational and Sullivan. Only when Walt Disney&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Steamboat Willie</i> made cinematic history as the first talking cartoon with a synchronized soundtrack did Sullivan see the possibilities of sound. He managed to secure a contract with First National Pictures in 1928. However, for reasons unknown, this did not last, so Sullivan sought out Jacques Kopfstein and Copley Pictures to distribute his new sound Felix cartoons. On <!--del_lnk--> October 16, <!--del_lnk--> 1929, an advertisement appeared in <!--del_lnk--> Film Daily with Felix announcing, <!--del_lnk--> Jolson-like, &quot;You ain&#39;t heard nothin&#39; yet!&quot;<p>Unfortunately, nothing good was heard from Felix&#39;s transition to sound. The results were disastrous. More than ever, it seemed as though Disney&#39;s mouse was drawing audiences away from Sullivan&#39;s silent star. Not even entries such as the off-beat &quot;Felix Woos Whoopee&quot; or the <!--del_lnk--> Silly Symphony-esque <i><!--del_lnk--> April Maze</i> (both 1930) could regain the franchise&#39;s audience. Kopfstein finally canceled Sullivan&#39;s contract. Subsequently, he announced plans to start a new studio in <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a>, but such ideas never materialized. Things went from bad to worse when Sullivan&#39;s wife, Marjorie, died in March 1932. After this, Sullivan completely fell apart. He slumped into an alcoholic depression, his health rapidly declined, and his memory began to fade. He could not even cash checks to Messmer because his signature was reduced to a mere scribble. He died in 1933. Messmer recalled,<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>In 1935, Amadee J. Van Beuren of the Van Beuren Studios called Messmer and asked him if he could return Felix to the screen. Van Beuren even stated that Messmer would be equipped with a full staff and all of the necessary utilities. However, Messmer declined his offer and instead recommended <!--del_lnk--> Burt Gillett, a former Sullivan staffer who was now heading the Van Beuren staff. So, in 1936, Van Beuren obtained approval from Sullivan&#39;s brother to license Felix to his studio with the intention of producing new shorts both in colour and with sound. With Gillett at the helm, now with a heavy Disney influence, he did away with Felix&#39;s established personality and made him just another <!--del_lnk--> funny-animal character of the type popular in the day. The new shorts were unsuccessful, and after only three outings Van Beuren discontinued the series.<p><a id="The_cat.27s_comeback" name="The_cat.27s_comeback"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The cat&#39;s comeback</span></h2>
      <p>In 1953, <!--del_lnk--> Official Films purchased the Sullivan-Messmer shorts, added soundtracks to them, and distributed to the home movie and television markets. Messmer himself pursued the Sunday Felix comic strips until their discontinuance in 1943, when he began eleven years of writing and drawing monthly Felix comic books for <!--del_lnk--> Dell Comics. In 1954, Messmer retired from the Felix daily newspaper strips, and his assistant <!--del_lnk--> Joe Oriolo took over. Oriolo struck a deal with Felix&#39;s new owner, Pat Sullivan&#39;s nephew, to begin a new series of Felix cartoons on television. Oriolo went on to star Felix in 260 television cartoons distributed by <!--del_lnk--> Trans-Lux starting in 1958. Like the Van Beuren studio before, Oriolo gave Felix a more domesticated and pedestrian personality, geared more toward children, and introduced now-familiar elements such as Felix&#39;s Magic Bag of Tricks, a satchel that could assume the shape and characteristics of anything Felix wanted. The program is also remembered for its distinctive <!--del_lnk--> theme song written by <!--del_lnk--> Winston Sharples:<dl>
       <dd>Felix the Cat,<dd>The wonderful, wonderful cat!<dd>Whenever he gets in a fix<dd>He reaches into his bag of tricks!</dl>
      <p>The show did away with Felix&#39;s previous supporting cast and introduced many new characters. These include the sinister, mustachioed <!--del_lnk--> Professor; his intelligent but bookish nephew <!--del_lnk--> Poindexter (with an <!--del_lnk--> IQ of 222); the Professor&#39;s bulldog-faced, bumbling sidekick <!--del_lnk--> Rock Bottom; an evil, cylindrical robot and &quot;King of the Moon&quot; named <!--del_lnk--> The Master Cylinder; and a small, unassuming and friendly <!--del_lnk--> Inuit named <!--del_lnk--> Vavoom, whose only vocalization is a literally earth-shattering shout of his own name. These characters were performed by <!--del_lnk--> voice actor <!--del_lnk--> Jack Mercer.<p>Oriolo&#39;s plots revolve around the unsuccessful attempts of the antagonists to steal Felix&#39;s Magic Bag, though in an unusual twist, these antagonists are occasionally depicted as Felix&#39;s friends as well. The cartoons proved popular, but critics have dismissed them as paling in comparison to the earlier Sullivan-Messmer works, especially since Oriolo aimed the cartoons at children. <!--del_lnk--> Limited animation (required due to budgetary restraints) and simplistic storylines did nothing to diminish the series&#39; popularity.<p>Today, Oriolo&#39;s son, Don continues to market the cat. In 1988, Felix starred in his first (and only) feature film, <i><!--del_lnk--> Felix the Cat: The Movie</i>, in which he, the Professor and Poindexter visit an alternate reality. The film was a box-office failure. Additionally, it was not even released until 1991. In 1995 to 1997, Felix appeared on television again, in an off-beat series called <i><!--del_lnk--> The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat</i>. <i><!--del_lnk--> Baby Felix</i> followed in 2000 for the <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japanese</a> market and the direct-to-video <i><!--del_lnk--> Felix the Cat Saves Christmas</i>. Oriolo has also brought about a new wave of Felix merchandising, everything from mugs to a video game for the <a href="../../wp/n/Nintendo_Entertainment_System.htm" title="Nintendo Entertainment System">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>.<p><a id="VHS_.26_DVD" name="VHS_.26_DVD"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">VHS &amp; DVD</span></h2>

      <p>Since the publication of John Canemaker&#39;s <i>Felix: The Twisted Tale of the World&#39;s Most Famous Cat</i> in 1991, there has been a renewed interest in the early Sullivan-Messmer shorts. In recent years, the films have seen lots of <!--del_lnk--> VHS and <a href="../../wp/d/DVD.htm" title="DVD">DVD</a> exposure, most notably on the <i>Presenting Felix the Cat</i> compilations from Bosko Video, <i>Felix!</i> from Lumivision, <i>Felix the Cat: The Collector&#39;s Edition</i> from Delta Entertainment, <i>Before Mickey</i> from Inkwell Images Ink, the recent <i>Felix the Cat and 1920&#39;s Rarities</i> from Thunderbean Animation, as well as a few volumes from Tom&#39;s Vintage Film. Messmer Felix comic compilations have also begun to emerge including <i>Nine Lives to Live: A Classic Felix Celebration</i> by David Gerstein and more recently <i>The Comic Adventures of Felix the Cat</i> from Determined Productions.<p><a id="Use_of_Felix_by_United_States_Navy_aviators" name="Use_of_Felix_by_United_States_Navy_aviators"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Use of Felix by United States Navy aviators</span></h2>
      <p>&quot;Felix&quot; was originally officially adopted by the US Navy as a mascot for aviation squadrons in late 1928. VB-2B squadron in Coronado, California originally adopted Felix for their squadron insignia, and Lieutenant Chourre&rsquo; of VB-2B created the emblem of Felix happily carrying a bomb with a burning fuse. VB-2B retained the insignia through the 1930s when they became a fighter squadron under the designations VF-6B and, later, VF-3.<p>VF-3 Squadron swapped designations with VF-6 squadron in 1943 and both squadrons claimed the &quot;Felix&quot; mascot and call-sign after the switch, which caused a controversy for the next three years. The &quot;Felix&quot; patch was so popular, it was immediately adopted by the former VF-6 squadron, but &quot;Felix&quot; faced to the right instead of to the left.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_the_Cat&quot;</div>
