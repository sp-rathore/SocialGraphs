      <p><b>Fiction</b> (from the Latin <i>fingere</i>, &quot;to form, create&quot;) is the name given to <!--del_lnk--> imagined events, people or places and stands in contrast to <!--del_lnk--> non-fiction, which refers to factual claims and <!--del_lnk--> reality.<p>Fiction may be represented in media using &mdash;<a href="../../wp/n/Novel.htm" title="Novel">novels</a>, <!--del_lnk--> short stories, <!--del_lnk--> fables, <!--del_lnk--> fairy tales, <!--del_lnk--> films, <!--del_lnk--> comics, <!--del_lnk--> interactive fiction, <!--del_lnk--> cartoons, <a href="../../wp/c/Computer_and_video_games.htm" title="Computer and video games">video games</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Anime&mdash;<p>Fictional works may include or reference factual occurrences. The term is also often used synonymously with <a href="../../wp/l/Literature.htm" title="Literature">literature</a> and more specifically fictional prose. In this sense, fiction refers only to novels or short stories and is often divided into two categories, <!--del_lnk--> popular fiction (e.g., <!--del_lnk--> science fiction or <!--del_lnk--> mystery fiction) and <!--del_lnk--> literary fiction (e.g., <a href="../../wp/m/Marcel_Proust.htm" title="Marcel Proust">Marcel Proust</a> or <!--del_lnk--> William Faulkner).<p>

      <p>Fiction is largely perceived as a form of <a href="../../wp/a/Art.htm" title="Art">art</a> and/or <!--del_lnk--> entertainment, although not all fiction is necessarily artistic. Fiction may be created for the purpose of educating, such as fictional examples used in <!--del_lnk--> school textbooks. Fiction is also frequently instrumentalized by <a href="../../wp/p/Propaganda.htm" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Advertising.htm" title="Advertising">advertising</a>. Fiction may be propagated by parents to their children out of <!--del_lnk--> tradition (e.g. <a href="../../wp/s/Santa_Claus.htm" title="Santa Claus">Santa Claus</a>) or in order to instill certain beliefs and values. <!--del_lnk--> Fables with an explicit moral goal are not necessarily targeted at children, however. Fiction may over time blend with factual accounts and develop into <a href="../../wp/m/Mythology.htm" title="Mythology">mythology</a>. Many <!--del_lnk--> atheists perceive <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religion</a> as no different from any fictional tale, whereas members of religious groups typically explain their beliefs with <!--del_lnk--> faith and/or historical figures/events; and claim they are fundamentally different from fictional tales (although they may call other religious views fictional). The sociological school of <!--del_lnk--> constructivism argues that every view of reality is fundamentally a construction of the self and that a safe distinction between fact and fiction is impossible, whereas the <!--del_lnk--> philosophy of naturalism holds that reality can be approximated and <!--del_lnk--> truth can be demonstrated through usefulness, allowing the distinction from fiction.<p>Fiction has often been the target of <!--del_lnk--> censorship or <!--del_lnk--> boycotts, escalating into <!--del_lnk--> book burnings or <!--del_lnk--> bans. Extremist regimes like the <!--del_lnk--> Taliban have been even more prohibitive, restricting all reading to religious texts. There is an ongoing debate regarding sexual content in fiction and whether or not juveniles can be safely exposed to it; opponents of fiction with sexual content typically label it <!--del_lnk--> pornography. On the other hand fiction is also used to express religion (see <!--del_lnk--> Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; Faith in fiction and <!--del_lnk--> LDS fiction.)<p>The <a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">Internet</a> has had a massive impact on the distribution of fiction, calling into question the feasibility of <!--del_lnk--> copyright as a means to ensure <!--del_lnk--> royalties are payed to copyright holders. Also <!--del_lnk--> digital libraries such as <!--del_lnk--> Project Gutenberg have come into being which make <!--del_lnk--> public domain texts more readily available. The combination of inexpensive home computers, the Internet and the creativity of its users has also led to new forms of fiction, such as interactive <!--del_lnk--> computer games or computer-generated comics. Countless forums for <!--del_lnk--> fan fiction can be found online, where loyal followers of specific <!--del_lnk--> fictional realms create and distribute derivative stories. Through open writing systems like <!--del_lnk--> wikis, collaboratively written fiction is also becoming possible (see the <!--del_lnk--> Wikifiction initiative).<p>Fiction is a fundamental part of human <a href="../../wp/c/Culture.htm" title="Culture">culture</a>, and the ability to create fiction and other artistic works is frequently cited as one of the defining characteristics of <a href="../../wp/h/Human.htm" title="Humanity">humanity</a>.<p><a id="Categories_of_fiction" name="Categories_of_fiction"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Elements of fiction</span></h2>

      <p>The fiction writer might use the following to create artistic effects in his or her <!--del_lnk--> story:<p><b>Narratology</b> is the theory and study of <!--del_lnk--> narrative and <!--del_lnk--> narrative structure and (<!--del_lnk--> ) the way they affect our perception. The term was coined in French, <i>narratologie</i>, by <!--del_lnk--> Tzvetan Todorov in his 1969 <i>Grammaire du D&eacute;cam&eacute;ron</i> (Prince <!--del_lnk--> ). Its objects of study are all kinds of narrated <!--del_lnk--> texts - both fiction (<a href="../../wp/l/Literature.htm" title="Literature">literature</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Poetry.htm" title="Poetry">poetry</a>, etc.) and <!--del_lnk--> non-fiction (<!--del_lnk--> historiography, <!--del_lnk--> academic publishing, etc.), - as well as the dramatic structures, plot devices, characterization, settings, genres, and literary techniques. Usually, the term &quot;narratology&quot; is used in connection with fictional texts, which doesn&#39;t imply that non-fictional texts or other forms of fiction (<!--del_lnk--> theatre, <a href="../../wp/f/Film.htm" title="Film">films</a>, <!--del_lnk--> electronic entertainment, etc.) are not included in the studies&#39; field.<ul>
