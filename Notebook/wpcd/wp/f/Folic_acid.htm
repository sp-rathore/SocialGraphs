      <p>A key observation of researcher <!--del_lnk--> Lucy Wills in 1931 led to the identification of folate as the nutrient needed to prevent the <a href="../../wp/a/Anemia.htm" title="Anemia">anaemia</a> of pregnancy. Dr. Wills demonstrated that the anaemia could be corrected by <a href="../../wp/y/Yeast.htm" title="Brewer&#39;s yeast">brewer&#39;s yeast</a>. Folate was identified as the corrective substance in brewer&#39;s yeast in the late 1930s and was extracted from <!--del_lnk--> spinach leaves in 1941.

      <p>Folate is necessary for the production and maintenance of new cells. This is especially important during periods of rapid cell division and growth such as infancy and pregnancy. Folate is needed to replicate DNA. It also helps prevent changes to DNA that may lead to cancer. Thus folate deficiency hinders DNA synthesis and cell division, affecting most clinically the bone marrow, a site of rapid cell turnover. Because RNA and protein synthesis are not hindered, large red blood cells called megaloblasts are produced, resulting in <!--del_lnk--> megaloblastic anaemia. Both adults and children need folate to make normal <!--del_lnk--> red blood cells and prevent <a href="../../wp/a/Anemia.htm" title="Anemia">anaemia</a>.<p><a id="Biochemistry" name="Biochemistry"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Biochemistry</span></h2>
      <p>In the form of a series of tetrahydrofolate compounds, folate derivatives are <!--del_lnk--> substrates in a number of single-carbon-transfer reactions, and also are involved in the synthesis of dTMP (2&#39;-deoxythymidine-5&#39;-phosphate) from dUMP (2&#39;-deoxyuridine-5&#39;-phosphate). It helps convert vitamin B12 to one of its coenzyme forms and helps synthesize the DNA required for all rapidly growing cells.<p>The pathway in the formation of tetrahydrofolate (FH<sub>4</sub>) is the reduction of folate (F) to dihydrofolate (FH<sub>2</sub>) and then the subsequent <!--del_lnk--> reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate (FH<sub>4</sub>). Both these sequential reactions are carried out by <!--del_lnk--> dihydrofolate reductase <!--del_lnk--> EC 1.5.1.3.<p><b>Methylene tetrahydrofolate</b> (CH<sub>2</sub>FH<sub>4</sub>) is formed from tetrahydrofolate by the addition of <!--del_lnk--> methylene groups from one of three carbon donors: <!--del_lnk--> formaldehyde, <!--del_lnk--> serine, or <!--del_lnk--> glycine. <b>Methyl tetrahydrofolate</b> (CH<sub>3</sub>&ndash;FH<sub>4</sub>) can be made from methylene tetrahydrofolate by reduction of the methylene group, and <b>formyl tetrahydrofolate</b> (CHO-FH<sub>4</sub>, <!--del_lnk--> folinic acid) is made by <!--del_lnk--> oxidation of methylene tetrahydrofolate.<p>In other words:<p>F &rarr; FH<sub>2</sub> &rarr; FH<sub>4</sub> &rarr; CH<sub>2</sub>=FH<sub>4</sub> &rarr; 1-carbon chemistry<p>A number of drugs interfere with the biosynthesis of folic acid and tetrahydrofolate.

      <p>The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III 1988-91) and the Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (1994-96 CSFII) indicated that most adults did not consume adequate folate. However, the folic acid fortification program in the United States has increased folic acid content of commonly eaten foods such as <!--del_lnk--> cereals and <a href="../../wp/c/Cereal.htm" title="Cereal">grains</a>, and as a result diets of most adults now provide recommended amounts of folate equivalents.<p><a id="Folate_deficiency" name="Folate_deficiency"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Folate deficiency</span></h2>

      <p>Folic acid is very important for all women who may become <!--del_lnk--> pregnant. Adequate folate intake during the periconceptional period, the time just before and just after a woman becomes pregnant, helps protect against a number of congenital malformations including <!--del_lnk--> neural tube defects. Neural tube defects result in malformations of the spine (<!--del_lnk--> spina bifida), skull, and brain (<!--del_lnk--> anencephaly). The risk of neural tube defects is significantly reduced when supplemental folic acid is consumed in addition to a healthy diet prior to and during the first month following conception. Women who could become pregnant are advised to eat foods fortified with folic acid or take supplements in addition to eating folate-rich foods to reduce the risk of some serious birth defects. Taking 400 micrograms of synthetic folic acid daily from fortified foods and/or supplements has been suggested. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for folate equivalents for pregnant women is 600 micrograms.<p><a id="Folic_acid_supplements_and_masking_of_B12_deficiency" name="Folic_acid_supplements_and_masking_of_B12_deficiency"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Folic acid supplements and masking of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency</span></h2>
      <p>There has been concern about the interaction between <!--del_lnk--> vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and folic acid. Folic acid supplements can correct the anaemia associated with vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Unfortunately, folic acid will not correct changes in the nervous system that result from vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Permanent nerve damage could theoretically occur if vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency is not treated. Therefore, intake of supplemental folic acid should not exceed 1000 <!--del_lnk--> micrograms (1000 mcg or 1.000 mg) per day to prevent folic acid from masking symptoms of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. In fact, evidence that such masking actually occurs is scarce, and there is no evidence that folic acid fortification in Canada or the US has increased the prevalence of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency or its consequences. <!--del_lnk--> <p>Still it is important for older adults to be aware of the relationship between folic acid and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> because they are at greater risk of having a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. If you are 50 years of age or older, ask your physician to check your B<sub>12</sub> status before you take a supplement that contains folic acid.<p><a id="Health_risk_of_too_much_folic_acid" name="Health_risk_of_too_much_folic_acid"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Health risk of too much folic acid</span></h2>
      <p>The risk of toxicity from folic acid is low. The <!--del_lnk--> Institute of Medicine has established a tolerable upper intake level (UL) for folate of 1,000 &micro;g for adult men and women, and a UL of 800 &micro;g for pregnant and lactating (breast-feeding) women less than 18 years of age. Supplemental folic acid should not exceed the UL to prevent folic acid from masking symptoms of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.<p><a id="Some_current_issues_and_controversies_about_folate" name="Some_current_issues_and_controversies_about_folate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Some current issues and controversies about folate</span></h2>

      <p>Since the discovery of the link between insufficient folic acid and <!--del_lnk--> neural tube defects (NTDs), governments and health organisations worldwide have made recommendations concerning folic acid <i><!--del_lnk--> supplementation</i> for women intending to become <!--del_lnk--> pregnant. For example, the <!--del_lnk--> United States Public Health Service (see External links) recommends an extra 0.4 mg/day, which can be taken as a pill. However, many researchers believe that supplementation in this way can never work effectively enough since not all pregnancies are planned and not all women will comply with the recommendation.<p>This has led to the introduction in many countries of <i>fortification</i>, where folic acid is added to flour with the intention of everyone benefiting from the associated rise in blood folate levels. This is not uncontroversial, with issues having been raised concerning individual liberty, and the masking effect of folate fortification on <!--del_lnk--> pernicious anaemia (vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency). However, most North and South American countries now fortify their flour, along with a number of Middle Eastern countries and <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>. <a href="../../wp/m/Mongolia.htm" title="Mongolia">Mongolia</a> and a number of <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">ex-Soviet republics</a> are amongst those having widespread voluntary fortification; about five more countries (including <a href="../../wp/m/Morocco.htm" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>, the first African country) have agreed but not yet implemented fortification. Previously, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">UK</a> had decided not to fortify, mainly because of the vitamin B<sub>12</sub> concern. However, this decision is currently being reconsidered by the <!--del_lnk--> Food Standards Agency. Thus far, no <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">EU</a> country has yet fortified. <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a> is considering fortification, but a period for comments ending <!--del_lnk--> 2006-<!--del_lnk--> 07-31 attracted strong opposition from industry as well as academia.<p>In 1996, the United States <!--del_lnk--> Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published regulations requiring the addition of folic acid to enriched breads, cereals, flours, corn meals, pastas, rice, and other grain products. This ruling took effect <!--del_lnk--> 1998-<!--del_lnk--> 01-01, and was specifically targeted to reduce the risk of neural tube birth defects in newborns. There are concerns that the amount of <!--del_lnk--> folate added is insufficient<!--del_lnk--> . In October 2006, the Australian press claimed that U.S. regulations requiring fortification of grain products were being interpreted as disallowing fortification in non-grain products, specifically <!--del_lnk--> Vegemite (an Australian <!--del_lnk--> yeast extract containing folate). The FDA later said the report was inaccurate, and no ban or other action was being taken against Vegemite.<!--del_lnk--> <p>Since the folic acid fortification program took effect, fortified foods have become a major source of folic acid in the American diet. The <!--del_lnk--> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in <a href="../../wp/a/Atlanta%252C_Georgia.htm" title="Atlanta, Georgia">Atlanta, Georgia</a> used data from 23 birth defect registries that cover about half of United States births and extrapolated their findings to the rest of the country. This data indicates that since the addition of folic acid in grain-based foods as mandated by the <!--del_lnk--> Food and Drug Administration, the rate of neural tube defects dropped by 25 percent in the United States.<p>Although folic acid does reduce the risk of birth defects, it is only one part of the picture and should not be considered a cure. Even women taking daily folic acid supplements have been known to have children with neural tube defects.<p><a id="Folic_acid_and_heart_disease" name="Folic_acid_and_heart_disease"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Folic acid and heart disease</span></h3>
      <p>Low concentrations of folate, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, or vitamin B<sub>6</sub> may increase your level of <!--del_lnk--> homocysteine, an <!--del_lnk--> amino acid normally found in your blood. There is evidence that an elevated homocysteine level is an independent risk factor for heart disease and stroke. The evidence suggests that high levels of homocysteine may damage coronary arteries or make it easier for blood clotting cells called platelets to clump together and form a clot. However, there is currently no evidence available to suggest that lowering homocysteine with vitamins will reduce your risk of heart disease. Clinical intervention trials are needed to determine whether supplementation with folic acid, vitamin B<sub>12</sub> or vitamin B<sub>6</sub> can lower your risk of developing coronary heart disease. <!--del_lnk--> <b>The NORVIT trial</b>suggests that folic acid supplementation may do more harm than good.<p>As of <!--del_lnk--> 2006, studies have shown that giving folic acid to reduce levels of homocysteine does not result in clinical benefit and suggests that in combination with B<sub>12</sub> may even increase some cardiovascular risks.<p><a id="Folic_acid_and_cancer" name="Folic_acid_and_cancer"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Folic acid and cancer</span></h3>
      <p>Some evidence associates low blood levels of folate with a greater risk of <a href="../../wp/c/Cancer.htm" title="Cancer">cancer</a>. Folate is involved in the synthesis, repair, and functioning of <a href="../../wp/d/DNA.htm" title="DNA">DNA</a>, our genetic map, and a deficiency of folate may result in damage to DNA that may lead to cancer. Several studies have associated diets low in folate with increased risk of <!--del_lnk--> breast, <!--del_lnk--> pancreatic, and <!--del_lnk--> colon cancer. Findings from a study of over 121,000 nurses suggested that long-term folic acid supplementation (for 15 years) was associated with a decreased risk of colon cancer in women 55 to 69 years of age.<p>&quot;Folate intake counteracts breast cancer risk associated with alcohol consumption&quot;  and &quot;women who drink alcohol and have a high folate intake are not at increased risk of cancer&quot; . Those who have a high (200 micrograms or more per day) level of <!--del_lnk--> folate (folic acid or Vitamin B9) in their diet are not at increased risk of breast cancer compared to those who abstain from alcohol .<p>However, associations between diet and disease do not indicate a direct cause. Researchers are continuing to investigate whether enhanced folate intake from foods or folic acid supplements may reduce the risk of cancer. Until results from such clinical trials are available, folic acid supplements should not be recommended to reduce the risk of cancer.<p><a id="Folic_acid_and_methotrexate_for_cancer" name="Folic_acid_and_methotrexate_for_cancer"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Folic acid and methotrexate for cancer</span></h4>
      <p>Folate is important for cells and tissues that rapidly divide. Cancer cells divide rapidly, and drugs that interfere with folate metabolism are used to treat cancer. <!--del_lnk--> Methotrexate is a drug often used to treat cancer because it inhibits the production of the active form, <!--del_lnk--> tetrahydrofolate. Unfortunately, methotrexate can be toxic, producing side effects such as inflammation in the digestive tract that make it difficult to eat normally.<p><!--del_lnk--> Folinic acid is a form of folate that can help &quot;rescue&quot; or reverse the toxic effects of methotrexate. Folinic acid is <i>not</i> the same as folic acid. Folic acid supplements have little established role in cancer chemotherapy. There have been cases of severe adverse effects of accidental substitution of folic acid for folinic acid in patients receiving methotrexate cancer chemotherapy. It is important for anyone receiving methotrexate to follow medical advice on the use of folic or folinic acid supplements.<p><a id="Folic_acid_and_methotrexate_for_non-cancerous_diseases" name="Folic_acid_and_methotrexate_for_non-cancerous_diseases"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Folic acid and methotrexate for non-cancerous diseases</span></h3>
      <p>Low dose <!--del_lnk--> methotrexate is used to treat a wide variety of non-cancerous diseases such as <!--del_lnk--> rheumatoid arthritis, <!--del_lnk--> lupus, <!--del_lnk--> psoriasis, <a href="../../wp/a/Asthma.htm" title="Asthma">asthma</a>, <!--del_lnk--> sarcoidoisis, <!--del_lnk--> primary biliary cirrhosis, and <!--del_lnk--> inflammatory bowel disease. Low doses of methotrexate can deplete folate stores and cause side effects that are similar to folate deficiency. Both high folate diets and supplemental folic acid may help reduce the toxic side effects of low dose methotrexate without decreasing its effectiveness. Anyone taking low dose methotrexate for the health problems listed above should consult with a physician about the need for a folic acid supplement.<p><a id="Folic_acid_and_depression" name="Folic_acid_and_depression"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Folic acid and depression</span></h3>
      <p>Some evidence links low levels of folate with <!--del_lnk--> depression. There is some limited evidence from <!--del_lnk--> randomised controlled trials that using folic acid in addition to <!--del_lnk--> antidepressant medication may have benefits. However, the evidence is probably too limited at present for this to be a routine treatment recommendation.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folic_acid&quot;</div>
