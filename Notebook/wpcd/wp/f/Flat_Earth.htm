      <p>The notion of a <b>flat Earth</b> refers to the idea that the inhabited surface of <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a> is flat, rather than a <!--del_lnk--> curved <!--del_lnk--> spherical Earth. This article focuses on the views about the shape of the earth during the history of Europe, on historical evidence for and against the modern belief that people in Medieval Europe believed that the Earth was flat, on modern believers in a Flat Earth, and on the use of the idea of a Flat Earth in literature and popular culture.<p>In early <!--del_lnk--> Classical Antiquity, the Earth was generally believed to be flat. <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greek</a> philosophers from that time period were prone to form conclusions similar to those of <!--del_lnk--> Anaximander, who believed the Earth to be a short cylinder with a flat, circular top. It is conjectured that the first person to have advocated a spherical shape of the Earth was <a href="../../wp/p/Pythagoras.htm" title="Pythagoras">Pythagoras</a> (6th century BC), but this idea is not supported by the fact that most <!--del_lnk--> presocratic <!--del_lnk--> Pythagoreans considered the world to be flat. <!--del_lnk--> Eratosthenes, however, had already calculated that the earth was a sphere as well as its rough circumference by the third century B.C. <p>By the time of <!--del_lnk--> Pliny the Elder in the <a href="../../wp/1/1st_century.htm" title="1st century">1st century</a>, however, the Earth&#39;s spherical shape was generally acknowledged among the learned in the western world. Around then <a href="../../wp/p/Ptolemy.htm" title="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> derived his maps from a curved globe and developed the system of <!--del_lnk--> latitude, <!--del_lnk--> longitude, and <!--del_lnk--> climes. His writings remained the basis of <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European</a> <a href="../../wp/a/Astronomy.htm" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a> throughout the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, although <!--del_lnk--> Late Antiquity and the <!--del_lnk--> Early Middle Ages (ca. 3rd to 7th centuries) saw occasional arguments in favour of a flat Earth. The modern misconception that people of the Middle Ages believed that the Earth was flat first entered the popular imagination in the nineteenth century.<p>

      <p>Belief in a flat Earth is found in mankind&#39;s oldest writings. In early <!--del_lnk--> Mesopotamian thought, the world was portrayed as a flat disk floating in the <a href="../../wp/o/Ocean.htm" title="Ocean">ocean</a>, and this forms the premise for early <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greek</a> maps like those of <!--del_lnk--> Anaximander and <!--del_lnk--> Hecataeus.<p>By <!--del_lnk--> classical times an alternative idea, that Earth was spherical, had appeared. This was espoused by <a href="../../wp/p/Pythagoras.htm" title="Pythagoras">Pythagoras</a>, apparently on aesthetic grounds, as he also held all other <!--del_lnk--> celestial bodies spherical. <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> provided observational evidence for the spherical Earth, noting that travelers going south see southern <!--del_lnk--> constellations rise higher above the horizon. This is only possible if their horizon is at an angle to northerners&#39; horizon. Thus the Earth&#39;s surface cannot be flat. Also, the border of the shadow of Earth on the Moon during the partial phase of a <a href="../../wp/l/Lunar_eclipse.htm" title="Lunar eclipse">lunar eclipse</a> is always circular, no matter how high the Moon is over the horizon. Only a sphere casts a circular shadow in every direction, whereas a circular disk casts an <!--del_lnk--> elliptical shadow in most directions.<p>The Earth&#39;s circumference was measured around 240 BC by <!--del_lnk--> Eratosthenes. Eratosthenes knew that in Syene (now <!--del_lnk--> Aswan), in <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, the Sun was directly overhead at the summer <!--del_lnk--> solstice, while he estimated that a shadow cast by the Sun at Alexandria was 1/50th of a circle. He estimated the distance from Syene to Alexandria as 5,000 stades, and estimated the Earth&#39;s circumference was 250,000 stades and a degree was 700 stades (implying a circumference of 252,000 stades). Eratosthenes used rough estimates and round numbers, but depending on the length of the <!--del_lnk--> stadion, his result is within a margin of between 2% and 20% of the actual circumference, <!--del_lnk--> 40,008 kilometres. Note that Eratosthenes could only measure the <!--del_lnk--> circumference of the Earth by assuming that the distance to the Sun is so great that the rays of sunlight are essentially <!--del_lnk--> parallel. A similar measurement, reported in a Chinese mathematical treatise the <i>Zhoubi suanjing</i> (1st c. BC), was used to measure the distance to the Sun by assuming that the Earth was flat.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>During this period, Earth was generally thought of as divided into <!--del_lnk--> zones of climate, with a <i>frigid clime</i> at the <!--del_lnk--> poles, a deadly <i>torrid clime</i> near the <!--del_lnk--> equator, and a mild and habitable <i>temperate clime</i> between the two. It was thought that the different temperatures of these zones were related with proximity to the sun. They were wrong in believing that no one could cross the torrid clime and reach the unknown lands on the other half of the globe. At the time, these imagined lands as well as their inhabitants were both called <!--del_lnk--> antipodes.<p><!--del_lnk--> Lucretius (1st. c. BC) opposed the concept of a spherical Earth, because he considered the idea of <!--del_lnk--> antipodes absurd. But by the 1st century AD, <!--del_lnk--> Pliny the Elder was in a position to claim that everyone agrees on the spherical shape of Earth (<i><!--del_lnk--> Natural History</i>, 2.64), although there continued to be disputes regarding the nature of the antipodes, and how it is possible to keep the ocean in a curved shape. Interestingly, Pliny as an &quot;intermediate&quot; theory considers also the possibility of an imperfect sphere, &quot;shaped like a pinecone&quot;. (<i>Natural History</i>, 2.65)<p>In the Second century the Alexandrian astronomer <a href="../../wp/p/Ptolemy.htm" title="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> advanced many arguments for the sphericity of the Earth. Among them was the observation that when sailing towards mountains, they seem to rise from the sea, indicating that they were hidden by the curved surface of the sea.<p>In late antiquity such widely read encyclopedists as <!--del_lnk--> Macrobius (4th c.) and <!--del_lnk--> Martianus Capella (5th c.) discussed the circumference of the sphere of the Earth, its central position in the universe, the difference of the seasons in northern and southern hemispheres, and many other geographical details. In his commentary on <!--del_lnk--> Cicero&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Dream of Scipio</i>, Macrobius described the Earth as a globe of insignificant size in comparison to the remainder of the cosmos.<p><a id="The_Early_Church" name="The_Early_Church"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Early Church</span></h2>
      <p>From <!--del_lnk--> Late Antiquity, and from the beginnings of Christian theology, knowledge of the sphericity of the Earth had become widespread. As in secular culture a small minority contended with the flatness of the Earth. There was also some debate concerning the possibility of the inhabitants of the <!--del_lnk--> antipodes: people imagined as separated by an impassable torrid <!--del_lnk--> clime were difficult to reconcile with the Christian view of a unified human race descended from one couple and redeemed by a single Christ.<p><a href="../../wp/a/Augustine_of_Hippo.htm" title="Augustine of Hippo">Saint Augustine</a> (354&ndash;430) argued against assuming people inhabited the antipodes:<blockquote>
       <p>But as to the fable that there are Antipodes, that is to say, men on the opposite side of the earth, where the sun rises when it sets to us, men who walk with their feet opposite ours, that is on no ground credible. And, indeed, it is not affirmed that this has been learned by historical knowledge, but by scientific conjecture, on the ground that the earth is suspended within the concavity of the sky, and that it has as much room on the one side of it as on the other: hence they say that the part which is beneath must also be inhabited. But they do not remark that, although it be supposed or scientifically demonstrated that the world is of a round and spherical form, yet it does not follow that the other side of the earth is bare of water; nor even, though it be bare, does it immediately follow that it is peopled.</blockquote>
      <p>Since these people would have to be descended from <!--del_lnk--> Adam, they would have had to travel to the other side of the Earth at some point; Augustine continues:<blockquote>
       <p>[I]t is too absurd to say, that some men might have taken ship and traversed the whole wide ocean, and crossed from this side of the world to the other, and that thus even the inhabitants of that distant region are descended from that one first man.</blockquote>
      <p>Augustine does not deny the idea of a round Earth but explicitly describes the Earth as a globe in his writings.<p>A few Christian authors directly opposed the round Earth:<div class="thumb tright">

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Lactantius (245&ndash;325), after his conversion to Christianity and rejection of Greek philosophy, called it &quot;folly&quot; because he thought that people under the opposite side of the sphere would not &quot;obey&quot; gravity. He asked,<blockquote>
       <p>Is there any one so senseless as to believe that there are men whose footsteps are higher than their heads? That the crops and trees grow downward? That the rains and snow and hail fall upward toward the earth? I am at a loss what to say of those who, when they have once erred, steadily persevere in their folly and defend one vain thing by another.</blockquote>
      <p>Saint <!--del_lnk--> Cyril of Jerusalem (315&ndash;386) saw Earth as a firmament floating on water (though the relevant quotation is found in the course of a sermon to the newly baptized, and it is unclear whether he was speaking poetically or in a physical sense).<p>Saint <!--del_lnk--> John Chrysostom (344&ndash;408) saw a spherical Earth as contradictory to scripture.<!--del_lnk--> Diodorus of Tarsus (d. 394) also argued for a flat Earth based on scriptures; however, Diodorus&#39; opinion on the matter is known to us only by a criticism of it by <!--del_lnk--> Photius.<p><!--del_lnk--> Severian, Bishop of Gabala (d. 408), wrote: &quot;The earth is flat and the sun does not pass under it in the night, but travels through the northern parts as if hidden by a wall&quot;.<p>The Egyptian monk <!--del_lnk--> Cosmas Indicopleustes (547) in his <i>Topographia Christiana</i>, where the Covenant Ark was meant to represent the whole universe, argued on theological grounds that the Earth was flat, a <!--del_lnk--> parallelogram enclosed by four oceans. At least one early Christian writer, <!--del_lnk--> Basil of Caesarea (329&ndash;379), believed the matter to be theologically irrelevant.<p>Different historians have maintained that these advocates of the flat Earth were either influential (a view typified by <a href="../../wp/a/Andrew_Dickson_White.htm" title="Andrew Dickson White">Andrew Dickson White</a>) or relatively unimportant (typified by <!--del_lnk--> Jeffrey Russell) in the later Middle Ages. The scarcity of references to their beliefs in later medieval writings convinces most of today&#39;s historians that their influence was slight.<p><a id="The_Middle_Ages" name="The_Middle_Ages"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Middle Ages</span></h2>

      <p>With the end of Roman civilization, <!--del_lnk--> Western Europe entered the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> with great difficulties that affected the continent&#39;s intellectual production. Most scientific treatises of <!--del_lnk--> classical antiquity (in <!--del_lnk--> Greek) were unavailable, leaving only simplified summaries and compilations. Still, the dominant textbooks of the Early Middle Ages supported the sphericity of the Earth. For example: many early medieval manuscripts of Macrobius include maps of the Earth, including the antipodes, <!--del_lnk--> zonal maps showing the Ptolemaic climates derived from the concept of a spherical Earth and a diagram showing the Earth (labeled as <i>globus terrae</i>, the sphere of the Earth) at the centre of the hierarchically ordered planetary spheres. Images of some of these features can be found in <!--del_lnk--> Dream of Scipio.<p>Europe&#39;s view of the shape of the Earth in <!--del_lnk--> Late Antiquity and the <!--del_lnk--> Early Middle Ages may be best expressed by the writings of early Christian scholars:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Boethius (c. 480 &ndash; 524), who also wrote a theological treatise <i>On the Trinity</i>, repeated the Macrobian model of the Earth as an insignificant point in the centre of a spherical cosmos in his influential, and widely translated, <i><a href="../../wp/c/Consolation_of_Philosophy.htm" title="Consolation of Philosophy">Consolation of Philosophy</a></i>.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Bishop Isidore of Seville (560 &ndash; 636) taught in his widely read encyclopedia, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Etymologies,</i> that the Earth was round. His meaning was ambiguous and some writers think he referred to a disc-shaped Earth; his other writings make it clear, however, that he considered the Earth to be globular. He also admitted the possibility of people dwelling at the antipodes, considering them as legendary and noting that there was no evidence for their existence. Isidore&#39;s disc-shaped analogy continued to be used through the Middle Ages by authors clearly favouring a spherical Earth, e.g. the 9th century bishop <!--del_lnk--> Rabanus Maurus who compared the habitable part of the northern hemisphere (<a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>&#39;s northern temperate clime) with a wheel, imagined as a slice of the whole sphere.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>The monk <a href="../../wp/b/Bede.htm" title="Bede">Bede</a> (c.672 &ndash; 735) wrote in his influential treatise on <!--del_lnk--> computus, <i>The Reckoning of Time</i>, that the Earth was round, explaining the unequal length of daylight from &quot;the roundness of the Earth, for not without reason is it called &#39;the orb of the world&#39; on the pages of Holy Scripture and of ordinary literature. It is, in fact, set like a sphere in the middle of the whole universe.&quot; (<i>De temporum ratione</i>, 32). The large number of surviving manuscripts of <i>The Reckoning of Time</i>, copied to meet the <!--del_lnk--> Carolingian requirement that all priests should study the computus, indicates that many, if not most, priests were exposed to the idea of the sphericity of the Earth. <!--del_lnk--> &AElig;lfric of Eynsham, paraphrased Bede into Old English, saying &quot;Now the Earth&#39;s roundness and the Sun&#39;s orbit constitute the obstacle to the day&#39;s being equally long in every land.&quot;</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Bishop Vergilius of Salzburg (c.700 &ndash; 784) is sometimes cited as having been persecuted for teaching &quot;a perverse and sinful doctrine ... against God and his own soul&quot; regarding the sphericity of the earth. <!--del_lnk--> Pope Zachary decided that &quot;if it shall be clearly established that he professes belief in another world and other people existing beneath the earth, or in [another] sun and moon there, thou art to hold a council, and deprive him of his sacerdotal rank, and expel him from the church.&quot; The issue involved was not the sphericity of the Earth itself, but whether people living in the antipodes were not descended from Adam and hence were not in need of redemption. Vergilius succeeded in freeing himself from that charge; he later became a <!--del_lnk--> bishop and was <!--del_lnk--> canonised in the thirteenth century.</ul>
      <p>A non-literary but graphic indication that people in the Middle Ages believed that the Earth was a sphere, is the use of the <b>orb</b> (<!--del_lnk--> globus cruciger) in the regalia of many kingdoms and of the Holy Roman Empire. It is attested from the time of the Christian late-Roman emperor <!--del_lnk--> Theodosius II (<!--del_lnk--> 423) throughout the Middle Ages; the <i>Reichsapfel</i> was used in <!--del_lnk--> 1191 at the coronation of <!--del_lnk--> emperor Henry VI.<p>A recent study of medieval concepts of the sphericity of the Earth noted that &quot;since the eighth century, no cosmographer worthy of note has called into question the sphericity of the Earth.&quot; Of course it was probably not the few noted intellectuals who defined public opinion. It is difficult to tell what the wider population may have thought of the shape of the Earth &ndash; if they considered the question at all. It may have been as irrelevant to them as the Heisenberg <!--del_lnk--> uncertainty principle is to most of our contemporaries.<p><a id="Later_Middle_Ages" name="Later_Middle_Ages"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Later Middle Ages</span></h3>

      <p>By the 11th century, <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> had learned of <!--del_lnk--> Islamic astronomy. Around 1070 started the <!--del_lnk--> Renaissance of the 12th century, featuring an intellectual revitalization of Europe with strong <!--del_lnk--> philosophical and <!--del_lnk--> scientific roots, and increased appetite for the study of nature. By then, abundant records suggest that any doubts that Europeans may have had in earlier times in regard to the spherical shape of the Earth were generally eliminated.<p><!--del_lnk--> Hermannus Contractus (1013&ndash;1054) was among the earliest Christian scholars to estimate the circumference of Earth with <!--del_lnk--> Eratosthenes&#39; method. <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Aquinas.htm" title="Thomas Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a> (1225&ndash;1274), the most important and widely taught theologian of the Middle Ages, believed in a spherical Earth; and he even took for granted his readers also knew the Earth is round. Lectures in the <!--del_lnk--> medieval universities commonly advanced evidence in favour of the idea that the Earth was a sphere. Also, &quot;<i><!--del_lnk--> On the Sphere of the World</i>&quot;, the most influential <a href="../../wp/a/Astronomy.htm" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a> textbook of the <a href="../../wp/1/13th_century.htm" title="13th century">13th century</a> and required reading by students in all Western European universities, described the world as a sphere.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The late development of European <!--del_lnk--> vernacular languages also provides some evidence to the contention that the spherical shape of the Earth was common knowledge outside academic circles. At the time, scholarly work was typically written in <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a>. Works written in a native dialect or language (such as Italian or German) were generally intended for a wider audience.<p>Dante&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Divine Comedy, the last great work of <a href="../../wp/l/Literature.htm" title="Literature">literature</a> of the Middle Ages, written in Italian, portrays Earth as a sphere. Also, the Elucidarium of <!--del_lnk--> Honorius Augustodunensis (c. 1120), an important manual for the instruction of lesser clergy which was translated into Middle English, Old French, Middle High German, Old Russian, Middle Dutch, Old Norse, Icelandic, Spanish, and several Italian dialects, explicitly refers to a spherical Earth. Likewise, the fact that <!--del_lnk--> Bertold von Regensburg (mid-13th century) used the spherical Earth as a sermon illustration shows that he could assume this knowledge among his congregation. The sermon was held in the vernacular German, and thus was not intended for a learned audience.<p>Reinhard Kr&uuml;ger, a professor for Romance literature at the University of Stuttgart (Germany), has discovered more than 100 medieval latin and vernacular writers from the late antiquity to the 15th century who were all convinced that the earth was round like a ball. However, as late as 1400s, the Spanish theologian <!--del_lnk--> Tostatus still disputed the existence of any inhabitants at the <!--del_lnk--> antipodes. From a European perspective, <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> exploration of <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a> and Spanish explorations in the Americas in the 15th century and finally <a href="../../wp/f/Ferdinand_Magellan.htm" title="Ferdinand Magellan">Ferdinand Magellan</a>&#39;s circumnavigation of the earth brought the experimental proofs for the global shape of the earth.<p><a id="Modern_times" name="Modern_times"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Modern times</span></h2>
      <p>The common misconception that people before the <!--del_lnk--> age of exploration believed that Earth was flat entered the popular imagination after <!--del_lnk--> Washington Irving&#39;s publication of <i>The Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus</i> in 1828. In the United States, this belief persists in the popular imagination, and is even repeated in some widely read textbooks. Previous editions of <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Bailey&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> The American Pageant</i> stated that &quot;The superstitious sailors ... grew increasingly mutinous...because they were fearful of sailing over the edge of the world&quot;; however, no such historical account is known. Actually, sailors were probably among the first to know of the curvature of Earth from daily observations &mdash; seeing how shore landscape features (or masts of other ships) gradually descend/ascend near the horizon.<div class="thumb tleft">

The woodcut illustrates the statement in the text that a medieval missionary claimed that &quot;he reached the horizon where the Earth and the heavens met&quot;, an anecdote that may be traced back to <a href="../../wp/v/Voltaire.htm" title="Voltaire">Voltaire</a>, but not to any known medieval source. In its original form, the woodcut included a decorative border that places it in the 19th century; in later publications, some claiming that the woodcut did, in fact, date to the 16th century, the border was removed. Flammarion, according to anecdotal evidence, had commissioned the woodcut himself. In any case, no source of the image earlier than Flammarion&#39;s book is known.<p>In <i>Inventing the Flat Earth: Columbus and Modern Historians</i>, Jeffrey Russell (professor of history at University of California, Santa Barbara) claims that the Flat Earth theory is a fable used to impugn pre-modern civilization, especially that of the Middle Ages in Europe. Today essentially all professional medievalists agree with Russell that the &quot;medieval flat Earth&quot; is a nineteenth-century fabrication, and that the few verifiable &quot;flat Earthers&quot; were the exception.<p><a id="Transvaal_perspective" name="Transvaal_perspective"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Transvaal perspective</span></h3>

      <p>The last known group of Flat Earth proponents, the <!--del_lnk--> Flat Earth Society, kept the concept alive and at one time claimed a few thousand followers. The society declined in the 1990s following a fire at its headquarters in California and the death of its last president, <!--del_lnk--> Charles K. Johnson, in 2001. They still maintain a <!--del_lnk--> website and forum. However, a poll of contributors to the forum indicated that a majority believed in a round earth, and some of the claims to belief in a flat earth may have been facetious or tongue-in-cheek, especially when combined with an evolutionist rather than creationist view.<p>William Carpenter (1830-1896) maintained that &quot;There are rivers that flow for hundreds of miles towards the level of the sea without falling more than a few feet - notably, the Nile, which, in a thousand miles, falls but a foot. A level expanse of this extent is quite incompatible with the idea of the Earth&#39;s &quot;convexity.&quot;&quot; Carpenter also presented aeronautic testimony that even at the great observable heights no curvature of the earth is observed, and fits with the idea of a flat-earth, since it is the nature of level surfaces to rise to a level with the human eye.<p>English scientist Samuel Rowbotham (1816-1885), writing under the pseudonym &quot;Parallax,&quot; published results of many experiments which tested the curvatures of water over lakes. He also produced studies which purported to show the effects of ships disappearing into the horizon can be explained by the laws of perspective in relation to the human eye.<p>Flat-Earth president Charles K. Johnson, who spent years examining the studies of flat and round earth theories, produced supposed evidence of a conspiracy against flat-earth: &quot;The idea of a spinning globe is only a conspiracy of error that Moses, Columbus, and FDR all fought...&quot; His article was published in Science Digest, 1980, and has since achieved much controversy. The journal, Science Digest, goes on to state, &quot;If it is a sphere, the surface of a large body of water must be curved. The Johnsons have checked the surfaces of Lake Tahoe and the Salton Sea (a shallow salt lake in southern California near the Mexican border) without detecting any curvature.&quot;<p><a id="The_Flat_Earth_in_popular_culture" name="The_Flat_Earth_in_popular_culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Flat Earth in popular culture</span></h2>
