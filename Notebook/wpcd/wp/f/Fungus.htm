      <p>Fungi were originally classified as <a href="../../wp/p/Plant.htm" title="Plant">plants</a>, however they have since been separated as they are <!--del_lnk--> heterotrophs. This means they do not fix their own carbon through <a href="../../wp/p/Photosynthesis.htm" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>, but use carbon fixed by other organisms for <!--del_lnk--> metabolism. Fungi are now thought to be more closely related to <a href="../../wp/a/Animal.htm" title="Animal">animals</a> than to plants, and are placed with animals in the <!--del_lnk--> monophyletic group of <!--del_lnk--> opisthokonts. For much of the <!--del_lnk--> Paleozoic Era, the fungi appear to have been aquatic. The first land fungi probably appeared in the <a href="../../wp/s/Silurian.htm" title="Silurian">Silurian</a>, right after the first land plants appeared, even though their <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil.htm" title="Fossil">fossils</a> are fragmentary. Fungi absorb their food while animals <!--del_lnk--> ingest it; also unlike animals, the cells of fungi have <!--del_lnk--> cell walls. For these reasons, these organisms are placed in their own <!--del_lnk--> kingdom, <b>Fungi</b>.<p>The Fungi are a <!--del_lnk--> monophyletic group, meaning all varieties of fungi come from a common ancestor. The monophyly of the fungi has been confirmed through repeated tests of <!--del_lnk--> molecular phylogenetics; shared ancestral traits include <!--del_lnk--> chitinous cell walls and heterotrophy by absorption, along with other shared characteristics.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> taxonomy of the Fungi is in a state of rapid flux at present, especially due to recent papers based on DNA comparisons, which often overturn the assumptions of the older systems of classification. There is no unique generally accepted system at the higher taxonomic levels and there are constant name changes at every level, from species upwards. Web sites such as <!--del_lnk--> Index Fungorum, <!--del_lnk--> ITIS and <!--del_lnk--> Wikispecies define preferred up-to-date names (with cross-references to older synonyms), but do not always agree with each other or with names in Wikipedia in its various language variants.<p><a id="Types_of_fungi" name="Types_of_fungi"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Types of fungi</span></h3>
      <p>The major divisions (<!--del_lnk--> phyla) of fungi are mainly classified based on their sexual <!--del_lnk--> reproductive structures. Currently, five divisions are recognized:<ul>
       <li>The <!--del_lnk--> Chytridiomycota are commonly known as chytrids. These fungi produce zoospores that are capable of moving on their own through liquid menstrua by simple <!--del_lnk--> flagella.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Zygomycota are known as zygomycetes and reproduce sexually with meiospores called zygospores and asexually with sporangiospores. <!--del_lnk--> Black bread mold (<i>Rhizopus stolonifer</i>) is a common species that belongs to this group; another is <i><!--del_lnk--> Pilobolus</i>, which shoots specialized structures through the air for several meters. Medically relevant genera include <i>Mucor</i>, <i>Rhizomucor</i>, and <i>Rhizopus</i>. <!--del_lnk--> Molecular phylogenetic investigation has shown the zygomycota to be a <!--del_lnk--> polyphyletic group.<li>Members of the <!--del_lnk--> Glomeromycota are also known as the <!--del_lnk--> arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Only one species has been observed forming zygospores; all other species only reproduce asexually. This is an ancient association, with evidence dating to 350 million years ago.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Ascomycota, commonly known as sac fungi or ascomycetes, form meiotic spores called ascospores, which are enclosed in a special sac-like structure called an <!--del_lnk--> ascus. This division includes <!--del_lnk--> morels, some <!--del_lnk--> mushrooms and <!--del_lnk--> truffles, as well as single-celled <a href="../../wp/y/Yeast.htm" title="Yeast">yeasts</a> and many species that have only been observed undergoing asexual reproduction. Because the products of meiosis are retained within the sac-like ascus, several ascomyctes have been used for elucidating principles of genetics and heredity (e.g. <i><!--del_lnk--> Neurospora crassa</i>).<li>Members of the <!--del_lnk--> Basidiomycota, commonly known as the club fungi or basidiomycetes, produce meiospores called <!--del_lnk--> basidiospores on club-like stalks called <!--del_lnk--> basidia. Most common <!--del_lnk--> mushrooms belong to this group, as well as <!--del_lnk--> rust (fungus) and <!--del_lnk--> smut fungi, which are major pathogens of grains.</ul>
      <p>Although the <!--del_lnk--> water moulds and <!--del_lnk--> slime moulds have traditionally been placed in the kingdom Fungi and those who study them are still called mycologists, they are not true fungi. Unlike true fungi, the water moulds and slime moulds do not have cell walls made of <!--del_lnk--> chitin. In the <!--del_lnk--> 5-kingdom system, they are currently placed in the kingdom <!--del_lnk--> Protista. Water moulds are descended from algae, and are placed within the phylum <!--del_lnk--> Oomycota, within the Kingdom Protista.<p><a id="Structure" name="Structure"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Structure</span></h2>

      <p>Fungi may be single-celled or multicellular. Multicellular fungi are composed of networks of long hollow tubes called <!--del_lnk--> hyphae. The hyphae often aggregate in a dense network known as a <!--del_lnk--> mycelium. The mycelium grows through the medium on which the fungus feeds. Because fungi are embedded in the medium in which they grow, they are often not visible to the naked eye.<div class="thumb tright">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Although fungi lack true organs, the mycelia of ascomycetes and basidiomycetes may become organized into more complex reproductive structures called <!--del_lnk--> fruiting bodies, or sporocarps, when conditions are right. &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Mushroom&quot; is the common name given to the above-ground fruiting bodies of many fungal species. Although these above-ground structures are the most conspicuous to humans, they make up only a small portion of the entire fungal body. Some fungi form <!--del_lnk--> rhizoids, which are underground root-like structures that provide support and transport nutrients from the soil to the rest of the mycelium.<p>A fungus of the species <i><!--del_lnk--> Armillaria ostoyae</i> may be the largest organism on the planet. It was discovered in the <!--del_lnk--> Malheur National Forest in <a href="../../wp/o/Oregon.htm" title="Oregon">Oregon</a>, and its underground mycelial network covers an area of 8.9 km&sup2; (2200 acres). Whether or not this is an actual individual organism is disputed: some tests have indicated that they have the same <!--del_lnk--> genetic makeup, but this does not exclude its being a <!--del_lnk--> clonal colony of numerous smaller individuals.<p><a id="Reproduction" name="Reproduction"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Reproduction</span></h2>

      <p>Fungi may reproduce sexually or asexually. In <!--del_lnk--> asexual reproduction, the <!--del_lnk--> offspring are genetically identical to the &ldquo;parent&rdquo; organism (they are <!--del_lnk--> clones). During <!--del_lnk--> sexual reproduction, a mixing of <!--del_lnk--> genetic material occurs so that the offspring exhibit traits of both parents. Many species can use both strategies at different times, while others are apparently strictly sexual or strictly asexual. Sexual reproduction has not been observed in some fungi of the <!--del_lnk--> Glomeromycota and <!--del_lnk--> Ascomycota. These are commonly referred to as Fungi imperfecti or <!--del_lnk--> Deuteromycota.<p>Yeasts and other unicellular fungi can reproduce simply by <!--del_lnk--> budding, or &ldquo;pinching off&rdquo; a new cell. Many multicellular species produce a variety of different asexual spores that are easily dispersed and resistant to harsh environmental conditions. When the conditions are right, these spores will <!--del_lnk--> germinate and colonize new <!--del_lnk--> habitats.<p>Sexual reproduction in fungi is somewhat different from that of animals or plants, and each fungal division reproduces using different strategies. Fungi that are known to reproduce sexually all have a <!--del_lnk--> haploid stage and a <!--del_lnk--> diploid stage in their life cycles. Ascomycetes and basidiomycetes also go through a <!--del_lnk--> dikaryotic stage, in which the <!--del_lnk--> nuclei inherited by the two parents do not fuse right away, but remain separate in the hyphal cells (see <!--del_lnk--> heterokaryosis).<p>In zygomycetes, the haploid hyphae of two compatible individuals fuse, forming a <!--del_lnk--> zygote, which becomes a resistant <!--del_lnk--> zygospore. When this zygospore germinates, it quickly undergoes <!--del_lnk--> meiosis, generating new haploid hyphae and asexual <!--del_lnk--> sporangiospores. These sporangiospores may then be distributed and germinate into new genetically-identical individuals, each producing their own haploid hyphae. When the hyphae of two compatible individuals come into contact with one another, they will fuse and generate new zygospores, thus completing the cycle.<p>In ascomycetes, when compatible haploid hyphae fuse with one another, their nuclei do not immediately fuse. The dikaryotic hyphae form structures called <!--del_lnk--> asci (<i>sing.</i> ascus), in which <!--del_lnk--> karyogamy (nuclear fusion) occurs. These asci are embedded in an <!--del_lnk--> ascocarp, or fruiting body, of the fungus. Karyogamy in the asci is followed immediately by meiosis and the production of ascospores. The ascospores are disseminated and germinate to form new haploid mycelium. Asexual <!--del_lnk--> conidia may be produced by the haploid mycelium. Many ascomycetes appear to have lost the ability to reproduce sexually and reproduce only via conidia.<p>Sexual reproduction in basidiomycetes is similar to that of ascomycetes. Sexually compatible haploid hyphae fuse to produce a dikaryotic mycelium. This leads to the production of a <!--del_lnk--> basidiocarp. The most commonly-known basidiocarps are mushrooms, but they may also take many other forms. Club-like structures known as <!--del_lnk--> basidia generate haploid <!--del_lnk--> basidiospores following karyogamy and meiosis. These basidiospores then germinate to produce new haploid mycelia.<p><a id="Ecological_role" name="Ecological_role"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Ecological role</span></h2>

      <p>Although often inconspicuous, fungi occur in every environment on <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a> and play very important roles in most <!--del_lnk--> ecosystems. Along with bacteria, fungi are the major <!--del_lnk--> decomposers in most terrestrial (and some aquatic) ecosystems, and therefore play a critical role in <!--del_lnk--> biogeochemical cycles and in many <!--del_lnk--> food webs.<p>Many fungi are important as partners in <!--del_lnk--> symbiotic relationships with other organisms, as <!--del_lnk--> mutualists, <!--del_lnk--> parasites, or <!--del_lnk--> commensalists, as well as in symbiotic relationships that do not fall neatly into any of these categories. One of the most important of these relationships are various types of <!--del_lnk--> mycorrhiza, which is a kind of mutualistic relationship between fungi and plants, in which the plant&#39;s roots are closely associated with fungal hyphae and other structures. The plant donates to the fungus sugars and other carbohydrates that it manufactures from photosynthesis, while the fungus donates water and mineral nutrients that the hyphal network is able to find much more efficiently than the plant roots alone can, particularly <a href="../../wp/p/Phosphorus.htm" title="Phosphorus">phosphorus</a>. The fungi also protect against diseases and pathogens and provide other benefits to the plant. Recently, plants have been found to use mycorrhizas to deliver carbohydrates and other nutrients to other plants in the same community and in some cases can make plant species that would normally exclude each other able to coexist in the same plant community. Such mycorrhizal communities are called &quot;common mycorrhizal networks&quot;. Over 90% of the plant species on Earth are dependent on mycorrhizae of one type or another in order to survive, and it is hypothesized that the presence of terrestrial fungi may have been necessary in order for the first plants to colonize land.<p><!--del_lnk--> Lichens are formed by a symbiotic relationship between <!--del_lnk--> algae or <!--del_lnk--> cyanobacteria (referred to in lichens as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> photobionts&quot;) and fungi (mostly ascomycetes of various kinds and a few basidiomycetes), in which individual photobiont cells are embedded in a complex of fungal tissue. As in mycorrhizas, the photobiont provides sugars and other carbohydrates while the fungus provides minerals and water. The functions of both symbiotic organisms are so closely intertwined that they function almost as a single organism.<p>Certain insects also engage in mutualistic relationships with various types of fungi. Several groups of ants cultivate various fungi in the <!--del_lnk--> Agaricales as their primary food source, while <!--del_lnk--> ambrosia beetles cultivate various kinds of fungi in the bark of trees that they infest. <!--del_lnk--> <p>Some fungi are parasites on plants, animals (including <a href="../../wp/h/Human.htm" title="Humans">humans</a>), and even other fungi. Pathogenic fungi are responsible for numerous <!--del_lnk--> diseases, such as <!--del_lnk--> athlete&rsquo;s foot and <!--del_lnk--> ringworm in humans and <!--del_lnk--> Dutch elm disease in plants. Some fungi are <!--del_lnk--> predators of <!--del_lnk--> nematodes, which they capture using an array of devices such as constricting rings or adhesive nets <!--del_lnk--> .<p><a id="Human_uses_of_fungi" name="Human_uses_of_fungi"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Human uses of fungi</span></h2>
      <p>Fungi have a long history of use by humans. Many types of <!--del_lnk--> mushrooms and other fungi are eaten, including <!--del_lnk--> button mushrooms, <!--del_lnk--> shiitake mushrooms, and <!--del_lnk--> oyster mushrooms. Of course, many <!--del_lnk--> species of mushrooms are <!--del_lnk--> poisonous and are responsible for numerous cases of <!--del_lnk--> sickness and <!--del_lnk--> death every year. A type of single-celled fungus called <a href="../../wp/y/Yeast.htm" title="Yeast">yeast</a> is used in baking <a href="../../wp/b/Bread.htm" title="Bread">bread</a> and fermenting <!--del_lnk--> alcoholic beverages, while mycelial fungus is used to make <!--del_lnk--> Shoyu (<!--del_lnk--> soy sauce) and <!--del_lnk--> tempeh. Fungi are also used to produce industrial chemicals like <!--del_lnk--> lactic acid, <!--del_lnk--> antibiotics and even to make stonewashed <!--del_lnk--> jeans. Some types of fungi are ingested for their <!--del_lnk--> psychedelic properties, both <!--del_lnk--> recreationally and religiously (see main article, <i><!--del_lnk--> Psychedelic mushroom</i>).<p><a id="Edible_and_poisonous_fungi" name="Edible_and_poisonous_fungi"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Edible and poisonous fungi</span></h3>
      <p>Some of the most well-known types of fungi are the <!--del_lnk--> edible and <!--del_lnk--> poisonous mushrooms. Many species are commercially raised, but others must be harvested from the wild. <!--del_lnk--> Button mushrooms (<i>Agaricus bisporus</i>) are the most commonly eaten species, used in salads, soups, and many other dishes. <!--del_lnk--> Portobello mushrooms are the same species, but are allowed to grow to a much larger size. Other commercially-grown mushrooms that have gained in popularity in the West and are often available fresh in grocery stores include <!--del_lnk--> straw mushrooms (<i>Volvariella volvacea</i>), <!--del_lnk--> oyster mushrooms (<i>Pleurotus ostreatus</i>), <!--del_lnk--> shiitakes (<i>Lentinula edodes</i>), and <!--del_lnk--> enokitake (<i>Flammulina</i> spp.).<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Hundreds of mushroom species are toxic to humans, causing anything from upset stomachs to <!--del_lnk--> hallucinations to death. Some of the most deadly belong to the genus <i><!--del_lnk--> Amanita</i>, including <i><!--del_lnk--> A. virosa</i> (the &quot;destroying angel&quot;) and <i><!--del_lnk--> A. phalloides</i> (the &quot;death cap&quot;). Stomach cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea usually occur within 6-24 hours after ingestion of these mushrooms, followed by a brief period of remission (usually 1-2 days). Patients often fail to present themselves for treatment at this time, assuming that they have recovered. However, within 2-4 weeks <!--del_lnk--> liver and <!--del_lnk--> kidney failure leads to death if untreated. There is no antidote for the toxins in these mushrooms, but <!--del_lnk--> kidney dialysis and administration of <!--del_lnk--> corticosteroids may help. In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary (Kaminstein 2002). It is difficult to identify a &quot;safe&quot; mushroom without proper training and knowledge, thus it is often advised to assume that a mushroom in the wild is poisonous and leave it alone.<p><!--del_lnk--> Fly agaric mushrooms (<i>A. muscaria</i>) are also responsible for a large number of poisonings, but these cases rarely result in death. The most common symptoms are nausea and vomiting, drowsiness, and hallucinations. In fact, this species is used ritually and recreationally for its hallucinogenic properties. However, if it is taken in over a long period of time (regularly over more than six months), this species might cause a temporary loss of sight, which can last from several minutes to an hour.<p><a id="Fungi_in_the_biological_control_of_pests" name="Fungi_in_the_biological_control_of_pests"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Fungi in the biological control of pests</span></h3>
      <p>Many fungi compete with other organisms, or directly infect them. Some of these fungi are considered beneficial because they can restrict, and sometimes eliminate, the populations of noxious organisms like pest insects, <!--del_lnk--> mites, <a href="../../wp/w/Weed.htm" title="Weed">weeds</a>, <!--del_lnk--> nematodes and other fungi, such as those that kill plants. There is much interest on the manipulation of these beneficial fungi for the <!--del_lnk--> biological control of pests. Some of these fungi can be used as <!--del_lnk--> biopesticides, like the ones that kill insects (<!--del_lnk--> entomopathogenic fungi). Specific examples of fungi that have been developed as <!--del_lnk--> bioinsecticides are <i><!--del_lnk--> Beauveria bassiana</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Metarhizium anisopliae</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Hirsutella, <i><!--del_lnk--> Paecilomyces fumosoroseus</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Verticillium lecanii</i> (=<i><!--del_lnk--> Lecanicillium lecanii</i> ).<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus&quot;</div>
