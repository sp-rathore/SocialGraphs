<h2>Fundraise for SOS Children</h2>
<p>SOS Children relies almost entirely on the donations we receive from individuals, groups and societies, so we are always happy to help out with fundraising ideas and tips for organising an event.</p><p>Take a look below at how you can get involved and support SOS Children's work:</p><h3>Fundraising ideas</h3>
<img src="../../wp/f/Fancy_dress_fundraiser.jpg" width="126" height="180" alt="Fancy dress fundraising" class="left" /><p>Coffee mornings, sponsored swims and bring and buys are still great ways to raise money, but if you're after inspiration for something a bit more unusal - perhaps a fancy dress party - why not have a look at our <a href="../../wp/f/Fundraising_Ideas.htm">fundraising ideas page</a> and see what other people have done?</p><h3>Organising an event</h3>
<p>If you've already got your fundraising idea but need a bit of help with the planning and organisation, our fundraising team is happy to help. SOS Children can offer all the important advice and tips on <a href="../../wp/o/Organising_Fundraising.htm">organising a successful fundraising event</a>.</p><h3>Supporter Groups</h3>
<p>Up and down the country we are lucky enough to have specific SOS Children's Villages Supporter Groups raising money for our work. If you are interested in setting up a Supporter Group in your area or in joining an existing group, please contact Caroline, <a href="mailto:caroline@soschildren.org">caroline@soschildren.org</a> or find out more on our <a href="../../wp/s/Supporter_Groups.htm">Supporter Groups page</a>.</p><p>For an example of how a supporter group works, you can read more about the <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan_Supporters_Group.htm">Pakistan Supporters' Group</a>.</p><h3>Charity challenges</h3>
<p>Fancy doing something a bit unusual or visiting somewhere exotic to raise money for a good cause? Well, maybe a charity challenge is just for you. </p><p>From cycling across Cuba to walking the Great Wall of China, the possibilities are endless! Find out more about getting involved with a <a href="../../wp/c/Charity_Challenges.htm">charity challenge</a> here.</p><h3>Virtual challenges</h3>
<p>If you don't have the time, money or the nerves to do something out of the ordinary but would still like to do a challenge for charity, then how about a virtual challenge? Find out more about how to swim the Amazon without leaving the gym on our <a href="../../wp/v/Virtual_Challenges.htm">virtual challenges</a> page.</p><h3>Running events</h3>
<img src="../../wp/s/SOS_London10k_team.jpg" width="226" height="144" alt="An SOS team running in the 2006 British 10km run" class="right" /><p>Each year we have charity places in the British 10km Run in London (July) and the London Triathlon (August) - call or email Caroline, <a href="mailto:caroline@soschildren.org">caroline@soschildren.org</a> to reserve your place. A deposit and pledge to raise a minimum amount of sponsorship are required.</p><p>Anyone interested in running the <strong>2007 Flora London Marathon</strong> for charity, why not have a look at our <a href="../../wp/l/London_Marathon.htm">SOS Children London Marathon</a> pages. </p><p>To find out more about fun runs, triathlons, half marathons, marathons and ultra marathons to run in and raise money for SOS Children visit: www.runnersworld.co.uk</p><h3>Already signed up for a challenge?</h3>

Contact Caroline, <a href="mailto:caroline@soschildren.org">caroline@soschildren.org</a> for more information.</p><h3>Easy fundraising at Justgiving.com</h3>
