The flower structure contains the plant&#39;s reproductive organs, and its function is to produce <a href="../../wp/s/Seed.htm" title="Seed">seeds</a> through <!--del_lnk--> reproduction.

      <p>Flowering plants <i><b>heterosporangiate</b></i> (producing two types of reproductive <!--del_lnk--> spores). The <!--del_lnk--> pollen (male spores) and <!--del_lnk--> ovules (female spores) are produced in different <!--del_lnk--> organs, but the typical flower is a <i><b>bisporangiate strobilus</b></i> in that it contains both organs.<p>A flower is regarded as a modified <!--del_lnk--> stem (Eames, 1961) with shortened internodes and bearing, at its <!--del_lnk--> nodes, structures that may be highly modified <!--del_lnk--> leaves. In essence, a flower structure forms on a modified shoot or <i>axis</i> with an apical <!--del_lnk--> meristem that does not grow continuously (growth is <i>determinate</i>). The stem is called a <b>pedicel</b>, the end of which is the <b>torus</b> or <b><!--del_lnk--> receptacle</b>. The parts of a flower are arranged in <!--del_lnk--> whorls on the torus. The four main parts or whorls (starting from the base of the flower or lowest node and working upwards) are as follows:<ul>
       <li><i><b>Calyx</b></i> &ndash; the outer whorl of <i><!--del_lnk--> sepals</i>; typically these are green, but are petal-like in some species.<li><i><b>Corolla</b></i> &ndash; the whorl of <i><!--del_lnk--> petals</i>, which are usually thin, soft and colored to attract insects that help the process of pollination.<li><i><b>Androecium</b></i> (from Greek <i>andros oikia</i>: man&#39;s house) &ndash; one or two whorls of <b><!--del_lnk--> stamens</b>, each a <i>filament</i> topped by an <i>anther</i> where pollen is produced. Pollen contains the male <!--del_lnk--> gametes.<li><i><b>Gynoecium</b></i> (from Greek <i>gynaikos oikia</i>: woman&#39;s house) &ndash; one or more <b>pistils</b>. The female reproductive organ is the <b><!--del_lnk--> carpel</b>: this contains an ovary with ovules (which contain female gametes). A pistil may consist of a number of carpels merged together, in which case there is only one pistil to each flower, or of a single individual carpel (the flower is then called <b>apocarpous</b>). The sticky tip of the pistil, the <b>stigma</b>, is the receptor of pollen. The supportive stalk, the <b>style</b> becomes the pathway for <b>pollen tubes</b> to grow from pollen grains adhering to the stigma, to the ovules, carrying the reproductive material.</ul>

      <p>Although the floral structure described above is considered the &quot;typical&quot; structural plan, plant species show a wide variety of modifications from this plan. These modifications have significance in the evolution of flowering plants and are used extensively by botanists to establish relationships among plant species. For example, the two subclasses of flowering plants may be distinguished by the number of floral organs in each whorl: <!--del_lnk--> dicotyledons typically having 4 or 5 organs (or a multiple of 4 or 5) in each whorl and <!--del_lnk--> monocotyledons having three or some multiple of three. The number of carpels in a compound pistil may be only two, or otherwise not related to the above generalization for monocots and dicots.<p>In the majority of species individual flowers have both pistils and stamens as described above. These flowers are described by botanists as being <b>perfect</b>, <b>bisexual</b>, or <b><!--del_lnk--> hermaphrodite</b>. However, in some species of plants the flowers are <b>imperfect</b> or <b>unisexual</b>: having only either male (stamens) or female (pistil) parts. In the latter case, if an individual plant is either male or female the species is regarded as <i><b><!--del_lnk--> dioecious</b></i>. However, where unisexual male and female flowers appear on the same plant, the species is considered <i><b><!--del_lnk--> monoecious</b></i>.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Additional discussions on floral modifications from the basic plan are presented in the articles on each of the basic parts of the flower. In those species that have more than one flower on an axis&mdash;so-called <b>composite flowers</b>&mdash; the collection of flowers is termed an <b><!--del_lnk--> inflorescence</b>; this term can also refer to the specific arrangements of flowers on a stem. In this regard, care must be exercised in considering what a &lsquo;&lsquo;flower&rsquo;&rsquo; is. In botanical terminology, a single <!--del_lnk--> daisy or <a href="../../wp/s/Sunflower.htm" title="Sunflower">sunflower</a> for example, is not a flower but a flower <b><!--del_lnk--> head</b>&mdash;an inflorescence composed of numerous tiny flowers (sometimes called florets). Each of these flowers may be anatomically as described above.<p><a id="Floral_formula" name="Floral_formula"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Floral formula</span></h3>
      <p>A <b>floral formula</b> is a way to represent the structure of a flower using specific letters, numbers, and symbols. Typically, a general formula will be used to represent the flower structure of a plant <!--del_lnk--> family rather than a particular species. The following representations are used:<p><b>Ca</b> = calyx (sepal whorl; e.g. Ca<sup>5</sup> = 5 sepals)<br /><b>Co</b> = corolla (petal whorl; e.g., Co<sup>3(x)</sup> = petals some multiple of three )<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Z</b> = add if <i>zygomorphic</i> (e.g., CoZ<sup>6</sup> = zygomorphic with 6 petals)<br /><b>A</b> = <i>androecium</i> (whorl of stamens; e.g., A<sup>&infin;</sup> = many stamens)<br /><b>G</b> = <i>gynoecium</i> (carpel or carpels; e.g., G<sup>1</sup> = monocarpous)<br />
      <p><i>x</i> - to represent a &quot;variable number&quot;<br /> &infin; - to represent &quot;many&quot;<br />
      <p>A floral formula would appear something like this:<dl>
       <dd><b>Ca<sup>5</sup>Co<sup>5</sup>A<sup>10 - &infin;</sup>G<sup>1</sup></b></dl>
      <p>Several other symbols are used that will have to await drawings to illustrate here (see <!--del_lnk--> ).<p><a id="Pollination" name="Pollination"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Pollination</span></h2>

      <p><i>Also see the <!--del_lnk--> main article on pollination.<br /></i> The primary purpose of a flower is to join the pollen of one plant with the ovules of another (or in some cases its own ovules) in order to form seed which is genetically unique, allowing for <!--del_lnk--> adaptation to occur. As such, each flower has a specific design which best encourages the transfer of this pollen. Many flowers are dependent upon the wind to move pollen between flowers of the same species. Others rely on animals (especially <a href="../../wp/i/Insect.htm" title="Insect">insects</a>) to accomplish this feat. Even large animals such as birds, bats, and <!--del_lnk--> pygmy possums can be employed. The period of time during which this process can take place (the flower is fully expanded and functional) is called <b>anthesis</b>.<p><a id="Attraction_methods" name="Attraction_methods"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Attraction methods</span></h3>

      <p>Many flowers in nature have evolved to attract animals to pollinate the flower, the movements of the pollinating agent contributing to the opportunity for genetic recombination within a dispersed plant population. Flowers that are insect-pollinated are called <i><b>entomophilous</b></i> (literally &quot;insect-loving&quot;). Flowers commonly have glands called <b>nectaries</b> on their various parts that attract these animals. <a href="../../wp/b/Bird.htm" title="Bird">Birds</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Bee.htm" title="Bee">bees</a> are common <a href="../../wp/p/Pollinator.htm" title="Pollinator">pollinators</a>: both having colour vision, thus opting for &quot;colorful&quot; flowers. Some flowers have patterns, called <!--del_lnk--> nectar guides, that show pollinators where to look for nectar; they may be visible to us or only under <a href="../../wp/u/Ultraviolet.htm" title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> light, which is visible to bees and some other insects. Flowers also attract pollinators by <!--del_lnk--> scent. Many of their scents are pleasant to our sense of smell, but not all. Some plants, such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Rafflesia</i>, the <!--del_lnk--> titan arum, and the North American <!--del_lnk--> pawpaw (<i>Asimina triloba</i>), are pollinated by <!--del_lnk--> flies, so produce a scent <!--del_lnk--> imitating rotting meat. Flowers pollinated by night visitors such as bats or moths are especially likely to concentrate on scent - which can attract pollinators in the dark - rather than colour: most such flowers are white.<p>Still other flowers use mimicry to attract pollinators. Some species of orchids, for example, produce flowers resembling female bees in colour, shape, and scent. Male bees move from one such flower to another in search of a mate.<p><a id="Pollination_mechanism" name="Pollination_mechanism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Pollination mechanism</span></h3>
      <p>The pollination mechanism employed by a plant depends on what method of pollination is desired.<p>Entomophilous flowers (those which employ insects to transfer pollen) have an arrangement of the stamens that ensures that pollen grains are transferred to the bodies of the pollinator when it lands in search of its attractant (such as nectar, pollen, or a mate). In pursuing this attractant from many flowers of the same species, the pollinator transfers pollen to the stigmas - arranged with equally pointed precision - of all of the flowers it visits. Many flower rely on simple proximity between flower parts to ensure pollination. Others, such as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Sarracenia</i> or <!--del_lnk--> lady-slipper orchids, have elaborate designs to ensure pollination while preventing self-pollination.<p>The flowers of other species are pollinated by the wind (for example, <!--del_lnk--> grasses); they have no need to attract pollinators and therefore tend not to be &quot;showy&quot;. Wind-pollinated flowers are referred to as <i><b>anemophilous</b></i>. Whereas the pollen of entomophilous flowers tends to be large-grained, sticky, and rich in <a href="../../wp/p/Protein.htm" title="Protein">protein</a> (another &quot;reward&quot; for pollinators), anemophilous flower pollen is usually small-grained, very light, and of little nutritional value to <a href="../../wp/i/Insect.htm" title="Insect">insects</a>, though it may still be gathered in times of dearth. Honeybees and bumblebees actively gather anemophilous corn (<a href="../../wp/m/Maize.htm" title="Maize">maize</a>) pollen, though it is of little value to them.<p>
       <br />
      <p><a id="Flower-pollinator_relationships" name="Flower-pollinator_relationships"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Flower-pollinator relationships</span></h3>
      <p>Many flowers have close relationships with one or a few specific pollinating organisms. Many flowers, for example, attract only one specific species of insect, and therefore rely on that insect for successful reproduction. This close relationship is often given as an example of <!--del_lnk--> coevolution, as the flower and pollinator are thought to have developed together over a long period of time to match each other&#39;s needs.<p>This close relationship compounds the negative effects of <a href="../../wp/e/Extinction.htm" title="Extinction">extinction</a>. The extinction of either member in such a relationship would mean almost certain extinction of the other member as well.<p><a id="Fertilization" name="Fertilization"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Fertilization</span></h2>
      <p>
       <br /> Some flowers with both stamens and a pistil are capable of self-fertilization, which does increase the chance of producing seeds but limits genetic variation. The extreme case of self-fertilization occurs in flowers that always self-fertilize, such as many <a href="../../wp/d/Dandelion.htm" title="Dandelion">dandelions</a>. Conversely, many species of plants have ways of preventing self-fertilization. Unisexual male and female flowers on the same plant may not appear or mature at the same time, or pollen from the same plant may be incapable of fertilizing its ovules. The latter flower types, which have chemical barriers to their own pollen, are referred to as self-sterile or self-incompatible (see also: <!--del_lnk--> Plant sexuality).<p><a id="Seed_production" name="Seed_production"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Seed production</span></h2>

      <p>While land plants have existed for about 425 million years, the first ones <!--del_lnk--> reproduced by a simple adaptation of their aquatic counterparts; <!--del_lnk--> spores. In the sea, plants -- and some animals -- can simply scatter out little living copies of themselves to float away and grow elsewhere. This is how early plants, such as the modern fern, are thought to have reproduced. But plants soon began protecting these copies to deal with drying out and other abuse which is even more likely on land than in the sea. The protection became the <a href="../../wp/s/Seed.htm" title="Seed">seed</a>...but not, yet, flowers. Early seed-bearing plants include the <!--del_lnk--> ginkgo, <!--del_lnk--> conifers (like pines), and <!--del_lnk--> fir trees. But the first fossil proof of actual flowers appears only 130 million years ago.<p>Unfortunately, there is no fossil evidence of exactly how flowers evolved; the evidence has them springing in advanced form into the fossil record. This was recognized almost immediately during the development of evolution theory, the strange appearance of flowers in the fossil record being called by <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_Darwin.htm" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> the Abominable Mystery.<p>The general assumption is that the function of flowers, from the start, was to involve other animals in the reproduction process. Pollen can be scattered without bright colors and obvious shapes, which would therefore be a liability, using the plant&#39;s resources, unless they provide some other benefit. One proposed reason for the sudden, fully developed appearance of flowers is that they evolved in an isolated setting like an island, or chain of islands, where the plants bearing them were able to develop a highly specialized relationship with some specific animal (a wasp, for example), the way many island species develop today. This symbiotic relationship, with a hypothetical wasp bearing pollen from one plant to another much the way <!--del_lnk--> fig wasps do today, could have eventually resulted in both the plant(s) and their partners developing a high degree of specialization. <!--del_lnk--> Island genetics is believed to be a common source of speciation, especially when it comes to radical adaptations which seem to have required inferior transitional forms. Note that the wasp example is not incidental; bees, apparently evolved specifically for symbiotic plant relationships, are descended from wasps.<p>Likewise, most <a href="../../wp/f/Fruit.htm" title="Fruit">fruit</a> used in plant reproduction comes from the enlargement of parts of the flower. This fruit is frequently a tool which depends upon animals wishing to eat it, and thus scattering the seeds it contains.<p>While many such <!--del_lnk--> symbiotic relationships remain too fragile to survive competition with mainland animals and spread, flowers proved to be an unusually effective means of production, spreading (whatever their actual origin) to become the dominant form of land plant life.<p>While there is only hard proof of such flowers existing about 130 million years ago, there is some circumstantial evidence that they did exist up to 250 million years ago. A chemical used by plants to defend their flowers, <!--del_lnk--> oleanane, has been detected in fossil plants that old, including <!--del_lnk--> gigantopterids<!--del_lnk--> , which evolved at that time and bear many of the traits of modern, flowering plants, though they are not known to be flowering plants themselves, because only their stems and prickles have been found preserved in detail; one of the earliest examples of <!--del_lnk--> petrification.<p>The similarity in <!--del_lnk--> leaf and <!--del_lnk--> stem structure can be very important, because flowers are genetically just an adaptation of normal leaf and stem components on plants, a combination of genes normally responsible for forming new shoots<!--del_lnk--> . The most primitive flowers are thought to have had a variable number of flower parts, often separate from (but in contact with) each other. The flowers would have tended to grow in a spiral pattern, to be <!--del_lnk--> bisexual (in plants, this means both male and female parts on the same flower), and to be dominated by the <!--del_lnk--> ovary (female part). As flowers grew more advanced, some variations developed parts fused together, with a much more specific number and design, and with either specific sexes per flower or plant, or at least &quot;ovary inferior&quot;.<p>Flower evolution continues to the present day; modern flowers have been so profoundly influenced by humans that many of them cannot be pollinated in nature. Many modern, domesticated flowers used to be simple weeds, which only sprouted when the ground was disturbed. Some of them tended to grow with human crops, and the prettiest did not get plucked because of their beauty, developing a dependence upon and special adaptation to human affection<!--del_lnk--> .<p><a id="Uses_by_humans" name="Uses_by_humans"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Uses by humans</span></h2>

      <p>In modern times, people have sought ways to cultivate, buy, wear, or just be around flowers and blooming plants, partly because of their agreeable <!--del_lnk--> smell.

       <li>For new births or <!--del_lnk--> Christenings<li>As a corsage or boutonniere to be worn at social functions or for holidays<li>For <!--del_lnk--> wedding flowers for the bridal party, and decorations for the hall<li>As brightening decorations within the home<li>As a gift of remembrance for bon voyage parties, welcome home parties, and &quot;thinking of you&quot; gifts<li>For <!--del_lnk--> funeral flowers and expressions of <!--del_lnk--> sympathy for the grieving</ul>
      <p>People therefore grow flowers around their homes, dedicate entire parts of their living space to <!--del_lnk--> flower gardens, pick wildflowers, or buy flowers from <!--del_lnk--> florists who depend on an entire network of commercial growers and shippers to support their trade.<p><a id="Flowers_as_symbols" name="Flowers_as_symbols"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Flowers as symbols</span></h3>
