      <p>The <b>Falkland Islands</b>, also called <i>The Malvinas</i>, are an <!--del_lnk--> archipelago in the <!--del_lnk--> South Atlantic Ocean, located 300 miles (483 kilometres) from the coast of <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a>, 671 miles (1080 km) west of <a href="../../wp/s/South_Georgia_and_the_South_Sandwich_Islands.htm" title="South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands">South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands</a> <!--del_lnk--> (Shag Rocks), and 584 miles (940 km) north of <a href="../../wp/a/Antarctica.htm" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> <!--del_lnk--> (Elephant Island). They consist of two main islands, <!--del_lnk--> East Falkland and <!--del_lnk--> West Falkland, together with about 700 smaller islands. <a href="../../wp/s/Stanley%252C_Falkland_Islands.htm" title="Stanley, Falkland Islands">Stanley</a>, on East Falkland, is the capital and largest city. The islands are a self-governing <!--del_lnk--> Overseas Territory of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, but have been the subject of a <!--del_lnk--> claim to sovereignty by <a href="../../wp/a/Argentina.htm" title="Argentina">Argentina</a> since the early years of Argentina&#39;s independence from Spain.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1982 the islands were invaded by Argentina, precipitating the two-month-long undeclared <!--del_lnk--> Falklands War between Argentina and the United Kingdom, which resulted in the defeat and withdrawal of Argentine forces. Since the war there has been strong economic growth in both fisheries and tourism. The inhabitants of the islands, who are of mainly Scottish descent, are British citizens, and support British sovereignty.<p>

      <p>The islands are referred to in the <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English language</a> as &quot;[The] Falkland Islands&quot;. This name dates from an expedition led by John Strong in <!--del_lnk--> 1690, who named the islands after his patron, <!--del_lnk--> Anthony Cary, 5th Viscount Falkland. The <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_language.htm" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a> name for the islands, <i>&quot;Islas Malvinas&quot;</i>, is derived from the <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a> name <i>&quot;&Icirc;les Malouines&quot;</i>, bestowed in <!--del_lnk--> 1764 by <!--del_lnk--> Louis Antoine de Bougainville, after the mariners and fishermen from the <!--del_lnk--> Breton port of <!--del_lnk--> Saint-Malo who became the island&#39;s first known human settlers.<p>The Falkland Islanders, as well as many others, tend to consider as offensive the use of the name <i>Malvinas</i>, as for them it has an association with Argentina&#39;s military invasion of the islands in <!--del_lnk--> 1982. Some English-language media sources use the <!--del_lnk--> ISO designation of &quot;Falkland Islands (Malvinas)&quot;.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <dl>

      <p>The Falkland Islands have had a complex history since their discovery, with <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Britain, <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Argentina.htm" title="Argentina">Argentina</a> all claiming possession and establishing as well as abandoning settlements on the islands. The Spanish government&#39;s claim was continued by Argentina after the latter&#39;s independence in <!--del_lnk--> 1816 and the independence war in <!--del_lnk--> 1817, until <!--del_lnk--> 1833 when the United Kingdom took by force control of the islands, following the destruction of the Argentine settlement at <!--del_lnk--> Puerto Soledad by the American sloop <!--del_lnk--> USS Lexington (<!--del_lnk--> December 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1831). Argentina has continued to claim sovereignty over the islands, and the dispute was used by the military <a href="../../wp/m/Military_dictatorship.htm" title="Military dictatorship">junta</a> dictatorship as an excuse to invade and briefly occupy the islands before being defeated in the two-month-long undeclared <!--del_lnk--> Falklands War in 1982 by a United Kingdom task force which returned the islands to British control.<p>The islands were uninhabited when they were first discovered by <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European</a> explorers. There is disputed evidence of prior settlement by humans, based on the existence of the <!--del_lnk--> Falkland Island fox, or Warrah, on the islands, as well as a scattering of undated artifacts including arrowheads and the remains of a canoe. It is thought this <!--del_lnk--> canid was brought to the island by humans, although it may have reached the islands by itself via a land bridge during the last <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_age.htm" title="Ice age">ice age</a>.<p>The first European explorer widely credited with sighting the islands is <!--del_lnk--> Sebald de Weert, a <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> sailor, in <!--del_lnk--> 1600. Although several <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a> and Spanish historians maintain their own explorers discovered the islands earlier, some older maps, particularly Dutch ones, used the name &#39;Sebald Islands&#39;, after de Weert. However, the islands appear on numerous Spanish and other maps beginning in the <!--del_lnk--> 1520s.<p>In January <!--del_lnk--> 1690, English sailor <!--del_lnk--> John Strong, captain of the <i>Welfare</i>, was heading for <!--del_lnk--> Puerto Deseado (in Argentina), but driven off course by contrary winds, he reached the Sebald Islands instead and landed at Bold Cove. He sailed between the two principal islands and called the passage &quot;Falkland Channel&quot; (now <!--del_lnk--> Falkland Sound), after Anthony Cary, 5th Viscount Falkland (1659-1694), who as <!--del_lnk--> Commissioner of the <!--del_lnk--> Admiralty had financed the expedition and who later became First Lord of the Admiralty. From this body of water the island group later took its collective English name.<p>The first settlement on the Falkland Islands, called Port Saint Louis, was founded by the <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> navigator and military commander Louis Antoine de Bougainville in <!--del_lnk--> 1764 on Berkeley Sound, in present-day <!--del_lnk--> Port Louis, <!--del_lnk--> East Falkland.<p>Unaware of the French presence, in January <!--del_lnk--> 1765, English captain <!--del_lnk--> John Byron explored and claimed <!--del_lnk--> Saunders Island, at the western end of the group, where he named the harbour of <!--del_lnk--> Port Egmont, and sailed near other islands, which he also claimed for King <!--del_lnk--> George III of Great Britain. A British settlement was built at Port Egmont in <!--del_lnk--> 1766. Also in 1766, Spain acquired the French colony, and after assuming effective control in <!--del_lnk--> 1767, placed the islands under a governor subordinate to <a href="../../wp/b/Buenos_Aires.htm" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a>. Spain attacked Port Egmont, ending the British presence there in <!--del_lnk--> 1770, but Britain returned in <!--del_lnk--> 1771 and remained until <!--del_lnk--> 1774. Upon her withdrawal in <!--del_lnk--> 1774 Britain left behind a <!--del_lnk--> plaque asserting her claims, and in 1790, Britain officially ceded control of the islands to Spain, and renounced any and all colonial ambitions in South America, and its adjacent islands, as part of the <!--del_lnk--> Nootka Convention. In addition, the <!--del_lnk--> Nootka Convention provided for equal British, Spanish, and US rights to fish the surrounding waters of, as well as land on and erect temporary buildings to aid in such fishing operations, in any territory south of parts already occupied by Spain - the Falkland Islands being one of them since <!--del_lnk--> 1770 <!--del_lnk--> . From then on Spain ruled the islands unchallenged under the name &quot;Islas Malvinas&quot;, maintaining a settlement ruled from <a href="../../wp/b/Buenos_Aires.htm" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a> under the control of the <!--del_lnk--> Viceroyalty of the Rio de la Plata until <!--del_lnk--> 1811. On leaving in <!--del_lnk--> 1811, Spain, too, left behind a plaque asserting her claims.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>When Argentina declared its <!--del_lnk--> independence from Spain in <!--del_lnk--> 1816, it laid claim to the islands according to the <i><!--del_lnk--> uti possidetis</i> principle, as they had been under the administrative jurisdiction of the <!--del_lnk--> Viceroyalty of the Rio de la Plata. Following a proclamation of annexation in <!--del_lnk--> 1820, actual occupation began in <!--del_lnk--> 1826 with the foundation of a settlement and a penal colony. The settlement was destroyed by <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> warship in <!--del_lnk--> 1831 after the Argentinian governor of the islands <!--del_lnk--> Luis Vernet seized U.S. <!--del_lnk--> seal hunting ships during a dispute over fishing rights. They left behind escaped prisoners and pirates. In November <!--del_lnk--> 1832, Argentina sent another governor who was killed in a mutiny. In January <!--del_lnk--> 1833, British forces returned, <!--del_lnk--> took control, repatriated the remainder of the Argentine settlement, and began to repopulate the islands with British citizens.<div class="thumb tright">

The <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> naval battle, the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Falkland Islands took place in December <!--del_lnk--> 1914, with a British victory over the <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germans</a>.

In <!--del_lnk--> 1945, upon signing the <!--del_lnk--> UN Charter, Argentina stated that it reserved its right to sovereignty of the islands, as well as its right to recover them. The United Kingdom responded in turn by stating that, as an essential precondition for the fulfilment of <!--del_lnk--> UN Resolution 1514, regarding the de-colonization of all territories still under foreign occupation, the Falklanders first had to vote for the British withdrawal at a referendum to be held on the issue.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Talks between British and Argentine foreign missions took place in the 1960s, but failed to come to any meaningful conclusion. A major sticking point in all the negotiations was the 2,000 inhabitants of mainly British descent who preferred that the islands remained British territory.<dl>

The invasion was condemned by the United Nations Security Council, although world reaction ranged from support in the <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin American</a> countries (with the exception of <a href="../../wp/c/Chile.htm" title="Chile">Chile</a>), to opposition in Europe, the Commonwealth, and eventually the United States. The British sent a large expeditionary force to retake the islands leading to the <!--del_lnk--> Falklands War. After a short but fierce naval and air war, the British landed at San Carlos Water on <!--del_lnk--> May 21 and a land war followed until the Argentinean forces surrendered on <!--del_lnk--> June 14.<p>Following the war, the British increased their military presence on the islands, constructing <!--del_lnk--> RAF Mount Pleasant and increasing the military garrison. Falkland Islanders were also granted full British citizenship. Although the UK and Argentina since resumed diplomatic relations in <!--del_lnk--> 1989, no further negotiations on sovereignty have taken place.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>
      <p>Executive authority is vested in the Queen and is exercised by the <!--del_lnk--> Governor on her behalf. The Governor is also responsible for the administration of <a href="../../wp/s/South_Georgia_and_the_South_Sandwich_Islands.htm" title="South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands">South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands</a>, as these islands have no native inhabitants. Defence and Foreign Affairs are the responsibility of the United Kingdom. The current Governor is <!--del_lnk--> Alan Huckle, appointed <!--del_lnk--> July 2006.<p>Under the <!--del_lnk--> constitution, the latest version of which came into force in <!--del_lnk--> 1985, there is an <!--del_lnk--> Executive Council and a <!--del_lnk--> Legislative Council. The Executive Council, which advises the Governor, is also chaired by the Governor. It consists of the Chief Executive, Financial Secretary and three Legislative Councillors, who are elected by the other Legislative Councillors. The Legislative Council consists of the Chief Executive, Financial Secretary and the eight Legislative Councillors, of whom five are elected from Stanley and three from <!--del_lnk--> Camp, for four year terms. It is presided over by the Speaker, currently Darwin Lewis Clifton.<p>The loss of the war against Britain over control of the islands led to the collapse of the Argentine <a href="../../wp/m/Military_dictatorship.htm" title="Military dictatorship">military dictatorship</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1983. Disputes over control of the islands continue. In <!--del_lnk--> 2001, British Prime Minister <a href="../../wp/t/Tony_Blair.htm" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> became the first to visit Argentina since the war. On the 22nd anniversary of the war, Argentina&#39;s President <!--del_lnk--> N&eacute;stor Kirchner gave a speech insisting that the islands would once again be part of Argentina. Kirchner, campaigning for president in <!--del_lnk--> 2003, regarded the islands a top priority. In <!--del_lnk--> June 2003 the issue was brought before a United Nations committee, and attempts have been made to open talks with Britain to resolve the issue of the islands. As far as the Falkland Islands Government and people are concerned there is no issue to resolve. The Falkland Islanders themselves are almost entirely British and maintain their allegiance to the United Kingdom. (See also <!--del_lnk--> Sovereignty of the Falkland Islands.)<p>Falkland Islanders were granted full British citizenship from <!--del_lnk--> 1 January <!--del_lnk--> 1983 under the <!--del_lnk--> British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>The Falkland Islands comprise two main islands, <!--del_lnk--> East Falkland and <!--del_lnk--> West Falkland and about 700 small islands. The total land area is 4,700 <!--del_lnk--> square miles (12&nbsp;173&nbsp;km&sup2;), approximately the same area as <!--del_lnk--> Connecticut or <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, and a <!--del_lnk--> coastline estimated at 800 miles (1288&nbsp;km).<p>Much of the land is part of the two main islands separated by the <!--del_lnk--> Falkland Sound: <!--del_lnk--> East Falkland, home to the capital of <a href="../../wp/s/Stanley%252C_Falkland_Islands.htm" title="Stanley, Falkland Islands">Stanley</a> and the majority of the population, and <!--del_lnk--> West Falkland. Both islands have <!--del_lnk--> mountain ranges, rising to 2,313 <!--del_lnk--> feet (705&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> m) at <!--del_lnk--> Mount Usborne on East Falkland. There are also some <a href="../../wp/b/Bog.htm" title="Bog">boggy</a> <!--del_lnk--> plains, most notably <!--del_lnk--> Lafonia, the southern half of East Falkland. Virtually the entire area of the islands is used as <!--del_lnk--> pasture for <!--del_lnk--> sheep.<p>Smaller islands surround the main two. They include <!--del_lnk--> Barren Island, <!--del_lnk--> Beaver Island, <!--del_lnk--> Bleaker Island, <!--del_lnk--> Carcass Island, <!--del_lnk--> George Island, <!--del_lnk--> Keppel Island, <!--del_lnk--> Lively Island, <!--del_lnk--> New Island, <!--del_lnk--> Pebble Island, <!--del_lnk--> Saunders Island, <!--del_lnk--> Sealion Island, <!--del_lnk--> Speedwell Island, <!--del_lnk--> Staats Island, <!--del_lnk--> Weddell Island, <!--del_lnk--> West Point Island. The <!--del_lnk--> Jason Islands lie to the north west of the main archipelago, and <!--del_lnk--> Beauchene Island some distance to its south. Speedwell Island and George Island are split from East Falkland by <!--del_lnk--> Engle Passage.<p>The islands claim a territorial sea of 12 <!--del_lnk--> nautical miles (22&nbsp;km) and an <!--del_lnk--> exclusive fishing zone of 200 nautical miles (370&nbsp;km), which has been a source of disagreement with <a href="../../wp/a/Argentina.htm" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>.<p>The Falkland Islands have a cold marine climate with strong westerly winds. It is generally <a href="../../wp/c/Cloud.htm" title="Cloud">cloudy</a> and <!--del_lnk--> humid; <a href="../../wp/r/Rain.htm" title="Rain">rain</a> occurs on more than half the days in a typical year. Snow is rare, but can occur at almost any time of year. Islanders themselves talk about two main areas of the islands, namely Stanley and the rest, which they call &quot;the Camp&quot;, from the Spanish <i>campo</i> (&quot;countryside&quot;).<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Sheep farming was formerly the main source of income for the islands, and still plays an important part with high quality wool exports going to the UK, but efforts to diversify introduced in 1984 have made <a href="../../wp/f/Fishing.htm" title="Fishing">fishing</a> the largest part of the economy and brought increasing income from <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">tourism</a>. The government sale of fishing licences to foreign countries has brought in more than &pound;40 million a year in revenues, and local fishing boats are also in operation. More than 75% of the fish taken are <!--del_lnk--> squid, and most exports are to <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>. Tourism has shown rapid growth, with more than 30,000 visitors in <!--del_lnk--> 2001. The islands have become a regular port of call for the growing market of <!--del_lnk--> cruise ships. Attractions include the scenery and wildlife conservation with <a href="../../wp/p/Penguin.htm" title="Penguin">penguins</a>, seabirds, <!--del_lnk--> seals and <!--del_lnk--> sealions, and visits to battlefields, golf, fishing and wreck diving.<p>An agreement with Argentina has set the terms for exploitation of offshore resources including large oil reserves, but climatic conditions of the southern seas mean that exploitation will be difficult task, though economically viable, and the continuing sovereignty dispute with Argentina is hampering progress. Defence is provided by the UK and British military expenditure makes a significant contribution to the economy. The islands are self sufficient except for defence, exports account for more than &pound;125 million a year.<p>The largest company in the islands used to be the <!--del_lnk--> Falkland Islands Company (FIC), a publicly quoted company on the <!--del_lnk--> London Stock Exchange and was responsible for the majority of the economic activity on the islands, though its farms were sold in 1991 to the Falkland Islands Government. The FIC now operates several retail outlets in Stanley and is involved in port services and shipping operation.<p>The currency in use is the <!--del_lnk--> Falkland Pound, which remains in parity with <!--del_lnk--> Pounds Sterling--sterling, both notes and coins, circulate interchangeably with the local currency. The Falkland Islands also mint their own coins, and issue stamps which forms a source of revenue from overseas collectors.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>The population is 2,967 (<!--del_lnk--> July 2003 estimate), the majority of which are of British descent (approximately 70%).

      <p>The Falkland Islands has two airports with paved runways. <!--del_lnk--> RAF Mount Pleasant, 30 miles west of Stanley acts as the main international airport, with flights operated by the <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Air_Force.htm" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a> to <!--del_lnk--> RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> with a refueling stop at <!--del_lnk--> RAF Ascension Island. RAF flights are on <!--del_lnk--> Tri-Stars although it is common for charter aircraft to be used if the <!--del_lnk--> Tri-Stars are required for operational flights. At present (October 2006) the RAF air link is operated by Air Atlanta Icelandic, using <!--del_lnk--> 747s. Flights are also available to <a href="../../wp/c/Chile.htm" title="Chile">Chile</a> operated by <!--del_lnk--> LAN. <!--del_lnk--> Port Stanley Airport is a smaller airport outside the city, and is used for internal flights. Most settlements have grass air strips which are served by Islander aircraft of the <!--del_lnk--> Falkland Islands Government Air Service (FIGAS). The internal flight schedule is decided a day in advance according to passenger needs and an announcement made on the radio detailing arrival and departure times the night before. The <!--del_lnk--> British International (BRINTEL) company also operate two <!--del_lnk--> Sikorsky S61N helicopters for passenger flights between the islands. The <!--del_lnk--> British Antarctic Survey operates a transcontinental air link between the Falkland Islands and the <!--del_lnk--> Rothera base airfield servicing also other British bases in the <!--del_lnk--> British Antarctic Territory.<p>The road network has been improved in recent years, however, few paved roads exist outside Stanley and the RAF base.<p><a id="Mines_and_Ordnance" name="Mines_and_Ordnance"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Mines and Ordnance</span></h2>
      <p>Thousands of land mines remain from the 1982 war which are securely and clearly fenced off with free maps available from the EOD (<!--del_lnk--> Explosive Ordnance Disposal) office in Stanley. Care should still be taken as some beaches were mined and there have been concerns the tides could have moved some mines. The same applies where mine fields are close to rivers. Care should be taken in case mines have been washed out of the marked area by flooding. There is also ordnance left over from the war, although finds of this type are becoming rarer with the passage of time.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkland_Islands&quot;</div>
