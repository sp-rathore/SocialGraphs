      <p>Dostoevsky was the second of seven children born to Mikhail and Maria Dostoevsky. The family originated from the Polish <!--del_lnk--> Szlachta family Dostojewski <!--del_lnk--> Radwan Coat of Arms.<p>Dostoevsky&#39;s father was a retired military surgeon and a violent alcoholic, who served as a doctor at the Mariinsky Hospital for the Poor in <a href="../../wp/m/Moscow.htm" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>. The hospital was situated in one of the worst areas in Moscow. Local landmarks included a cemetery for criminals, a lunatic asylum, and an orphanage for abandoned infants. This urban landscape made a lasting impression on the young Dostoevsky, whose interests in and compassion for the poor and oppressed tormented him. Though his parents forbade it, Dostoevsky liked to wander out to the hospital garden, where the suffering patients sat to catch a glimpse of sun. The young Dostoevsky loved to spend time with these patients and hear their stories.<p>There are many stories of Dostoevsky&#39;s father&#39;s despotic treatment of his children. After returning home from work, he would take a nap and his children, ordered to keep absolutely silent, stood silently by their slumbering father in shifts and swatted flies around his head.<p>Shortly after his mother died of <a href="../../wp/t/Tuberculosis.htm" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1837, Dostoevsky and his brother were sent to the Military Engineering Academy at <!--del_lnk--> St Petersburg. Mikhail Dostoevsky, too, died in <!--del_lnk--> 1839. Though it has never been proven, it is widely believed that he was murdered by his own <!--del_lnk--> serfs. Reportedly, they became enraged during one of his drunken fits of violence, restrained him, and poured <!--del_lnk--> vodka into his mouth until he drowned. Another story holds that Mikhail died of natural causes, and a neighboring landowner invented the story of his murder so that he might buy the estate inexpensively. The figure of his domineering father would exert a large effect upon Dostoevsky&#39;s work, and is notably seen through the character of <!--del_lnk--> Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov, the &quot;wicked and sentimental buffoon&quot; father of the three main characters in his 1881 novel <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Brothers_Karamazov.htm" title="The Brothers Karamazov">The Brothers Karamazov</a></i>.<p>At the St Petersburg Academy of Military Engineering, Dostoevsky was taught mathematics, a subject he despised. However, he also studied literature by <a href="../../wp/w/William_Shakespeare.htm" title="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Blaise_Pascal.htm" title="Blaise Pascal">Pascal</a>, <a href="../../wp/v/Victor_Hugo.htm" title="Victor Hugo">Victor Hugo</a> and <!--del_lnk--> E.T.A. Hoffmann. Though he focussed on different areas to mathematics, he did well on the exams and received a commission in 1841. That year, he is known to have written two romantic plays, influenced by the German Romantic poet/playwright <!--del_lnk--> Friedrich Schiller: <i><!--del_lnk--> Mary Stuart</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Boris Godunov</i>. The plays have not been preserved. Though Dostoevsky, a self-described &quot;dreamer&quot; as a young man, at the time revered <!--del_lnk--> Schiller, in the years which yielded his great masterpieces he usually poked fun at him.<p><a id="Beginnings_of_a_literary_career" name="Beginnings_of_a_literary_career"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Beginnings of a literary career</span></h3>
      <p>Dostoevsky was made a lieutenant in <!--del_lnk--> 1842, and left the Engineering Academy the following year. He completed a translation into Russian of <!--del_lnk--> Balzac&#39;s novel <i><!--del_lnk--> Eugenie Grandet</i> in <!--del_lnk--> 1843, but it brought him little or no attention. Dostoevsky started to write his own fiction in late <!--del_lnk--> 1844 after leaving the army. In <!--del_lnk--> 1845, his first work, the epistolary short novel, <i><!--del_lnk--> Poor Folk</i>, published in the periodical &quot;The Contemporary&quot;, was met with great acclaim. The editor of the magazine, the poet <!--del_lnk--> Nikolai Nekrasov, walked into the office of the liberal critic <!--del_lnk--> Vissarion Belinsky, and announced: &quot;A new Gogol has arisen!&quot; <!--del_lnk--> Belinsky, his followers and many others agreed and after the novel was fully published in book form at the beginning of the next year, Dostoevsky became a literary celebrity at the age of 24.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1846, <!--del_lnk--> Belinsky and many others reacted negatively to his novella, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Double</i>, a psychological study of a bureaucrat whose alter ego overtakes his life. Dostoevsky&#39;s fame began to cool. Much of his work after <!--del_lnk--> Poor Folk was met with mixed reviews and it seemed that <!--del_lnk--> Belinsky&#39;s prediction that Dostoevsky would be one of the greatest writers of Russia was mistaken.<p><a id="Exile_in_Siberia" name="Exile_in_Siberia"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Exile in Siberia</span></h3>

      <p>Dostoevsky was arrested and imprisoned on <!--del_lnk--> April 23, <!--del_lnk--> 1849 for engaging in revolutionary activity against <!--del_lnk--> Tsar <!--del_lnk--> Nicholas I. On <!--del_lnk--> November 16 that year he was <!--del_lnk--> sentenced to death for anti-government activities linked to a liberal intellectual group, the <!--del_lnk--> Petrashevsky Circle. After a <!--del_lnk--> mock execution, in which he and other members of the group stood outside in freezing weather waiting to be shot by a <!--del_lnk--> firing squad, Dostoevsky&#39;s sentence was commuted to four years of <!--del_lnk--> exile with hard labor at a <!--del_lnk--> katorga prison camp in <!--del_lnk--> Omsk, <!--del_lnk--> Siberia. Dostoevsky described later to his brother the sufferings he went through as the years in which he was &quot;shut up in a coffin.&quot; Describing the dilapidated barracks which, as he put in his own words, &quot;should have been torn down years ago&quot;, he wrote:<blockquote>
       <p>&quot;In summer, intolerable closeness; in winter, unendurable cold. All the floors were rotten. Filth on the floors an inch thick; one could slip and fall...We were packed like herrings in a barrel...There was no room to turn around. From dusk to dawn it was impossible not to behave like pigs...Fleas, lice, and black beetles by the bushel...&quot;</blockquote>
      <p>His first recorded <!--del_lnk--> epileptic seizure occurred in 1850 at the prison camp. It is said that he suffered from a rare form of temporal lobe epilepsy, sometimes referred to as &quot;ecstatic epilepsy&quot;. It is also said that upon learning of his father&#39;s death before the elder could reply to a letter of criticism from Fyodor, the younger Dostoevsky experienced his first seizure.<p>Seizures recurred sporadically throughout his life, and Dostoevsky&#39;s experiences are thought to have formed the basis for his description of Prince Myshkin&#39;s epilepsy in the <i><!--del_lnk--> The Idiot</i>. He was released from prison in <!--del_lnk--> 1854, and was required to serve in the <!--del_lnk--> Siberian Regiment. Dostoevsky spent the following five years as a private (and later lieutenant) in the Regiment&#39;s Seventh Line Battalion, stationed at the fortress of <!--del_lnk--> Semipalatinsk, now in <a href="../../wp/k/Kazakhstan.htm" title="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>. While there, he began a relationship with Maria Dmitrievna Isaeva, the wife of an acquaintance in Siberia. They married in February 1857, after her husband&#39;s death.<p>Dostoevsky&#39;s experiences in prison and the army resulted in major changes in his political and religious convictions. He became disillusioned with &#39;Western&#39; ideas, and began to pay greater tribute to traditional Russian values. Perhaps most significantly, he had what his biographer Joseph Frank describes as a <!--del_lnk--> conversion experience in prison, which greatly strengthened his Christian, and specifically <!--del_lnk--> Orthodox, faith (the experience is depicted by Dostoevsky in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Peasant Marey</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1876)). In line with his new beliefs, Dostoevsky became a sharp critic of the <!--del_lnk--> Nihilist and <a href="../../wp/s/Socialism.htm" title="Socialism">Socialist</a> movements of his day, and he dedicated his book <i><!--del_lnk--> The Possessed</i> and his <i>The Diary of a Writer</i> to espousing conservatism and criticizing socialist ideas <!--del_lnk--> . He later formed a friendship with the reactionary statesman <!--del_lnk--> Konstantin Pobedonostsev.<p><a id="Later_literary_career" name="Later_literary_career"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Later literary career</span></h3>
      <p>In December <!--del_lnk--> 1859, Dostoevsky returned to St Petersburg, where he ran a series of unsuccessful literary journals, <i><!--del_lnk--> Vremya</i> (Time) and <i><!--del_lnk--> Epokha</i> (Epoch), with his older brother Mikhail. The latter had to be shut down as a consequence of its coverage of the <!--del_lnk--> Polish Uprising of 1863. That year Dostoevsky traveled to Europe and frequented the gambling casinos. There he met Apollinaria Suslova, the model for Dostoesvky&#39;s &quot;proud women&quot;, such as <!--del_lnk--> Katerina Ivanovna in both <i><a href="../../wp/c/Crime_and_Punishment.htm" title="Crime and Punishment">Crime and Punishment</a></i> and <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Brothers_Karamazov.htm" title="The Brothers Karamazov">The Brothers Karamazov</a></i>.<p>Dostoevsky was devastated by his wife&#39;s death in <!--del_lnk--> 1864, followed shortly thereafter by his brother&#39;s death. He was financially crippled by business debts and the need to provide for his wife&#39;s son from her earlier marriage and his brother&#39;s widow and children. Dostoevsky sank into a deep <!--del_lnk--> depression, frequenting gambling parlors and accumulating massive losses at the tables.<p>Dostoevsky suffered from an acute gambling compulsion as well as from its consequences. By one account <i><a href="../../wp/c/Crime_and_Punishment.htm" title="Crime and Punishment">Crime and Punishment</a></i>, possibly his best known novel, was completed in a mad hurry because Dostoevsky was in urgent need of an advance from his publisher. He had been left practically penniless after a gambling spree. Dostoevsky wrote <i><!--del_lnk--> The Gambler</i> simultaneously in order to satisfy an agreement with his publisher <!--del_lnk--> Stellovsky who, if he did not receive a new work, would have claimed the copyrights to all of Dostoevsky&#39;s writing.<p>Motivated by the dual wish to escape his creditors at home and to visit the casinos abroad, Dostoevsky traveled to Western Europe. There, he attempted to rekindle a love affair with Suslova, but she refused his marriage proposal. Dostoevsky was heartbroken, but soon met Anna Grigorevna Snitkina, a twenty-year-old <!--del_lnk--> stenographer. Shortly before marrying her in <!--del_lnk--> 1867, he dictated <i><!--del_lnk--> The Gambler</i> to her. This period resulted in the writing of what are generally considered to be his greatest books. From <!--del_lnk--> 1873 to <!--del_lnk--> 1881 he published the <i>Writer&#39;s Diary</i>, a monthly journal full of short stories, sketches, and articles on current events. The journal was an enormous success.<p>Dostoevsky is also known to have influenced and been influenced by the philosopher <!--del_lnk--> Vladimir Sergeyevich Solovyov. Solovyov is noted as the inspiration for the character <!--del_lnk--> Alyosha Karamazov. <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1877, Dostoevsky gave the keynote <!--del_lnk--> eulogy at the funeral of his friend, the poet <!--del_lnk--> Nekrasov, to much controversy. In <!--del_lnk--> 1880, shortly before he died, he gave his famous <!--del_lnk--> Pushkin speech at the unveiling of the Pushkin monument in Moscow. From that event on, Dostoevsky was acclaimed all over Russia as one of her greatest writers and hailed as a prophet, almost a mystic.<p>In his later years, Fyodor Dostoevsky lived for a long time at the resort of <!--del_lnk--> Staraya Russa, which was closer to <!--del_lnk--> St Petersburg and less expensive than German resorts. He died on <!--del_lnk--> February 9 (<!--del_lnk--> January 28 <!--del_lnk--> O.S.), <!--del_lnk--> 1881 of a lung hemorrhage associated with <!--del_lnk--> emphysema and an <!--del_lnk--> epileptic seizure. He was interred in <!--del_lnk--> Tikhvin Cemetery at the <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Nevsky Monastery, <!--del_lnk--> St Petersburg, Russia. Forty thousand mourners attended his funeral.<sup id="ref_IdiotIntro"><small>1</small></sup> His tombstone reads &quot;Verily, Verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.&quot; from John 12:24, which is also the epigraph of his final novel, <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Brothers_Karamazov.htm" title="The Brothers Karamazov">The Brothers Karamazov</a></i>.<p><a id="Works_and_influence" name="Works_and_influence"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Works and influence</span></h2>

       <br /> Dostoevsky&#39;s influence has been acclaimed by a wide variety of writers. From <!--del_lnk--> Herman Hesse to <a href="../../wp/m/Marcel_Proust.htm" title="Marcel Proust">Marcel Proust</a>, <!--del_lnk--> William Faulkner, <!--del_lnk--> Albert Camus, <a href="../../wp/f/Franz_Kafka.htm" title="Franz Kafka">Franz Kafka</a>,<!--del_lnk--> Ayn Rand, <a href="../../wp/f/Friedrich_Nietzsche.htm" title="Friedrich Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Henry Miller, <!--del_lnk--> Yukio Mishima, <!--del_lnk--> Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez, <a href="../../wp/j/Jack_Kerouac.htm" title="Jack Kerouac">Jack Kerouac</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Heller, virtually no great twentieth century writer escaped his long shadow (rare dissenting voices include <!--del_lnk--> Vladimir Nabokov, <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_James.htm" title="Henry James">Henry James</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Conrad and, more ambiguously, <!--del_lnk--> D.H. Lawrence). American novelist <a href="../../wp/e/Ernest_Hemingway.htm" title="Ernest Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>, in his autobiographic books, also cited Dostoevsky as a major influence on his work. Despite his death in 1881, Dostoevsky is often considered to have had an immense influence upon the modernist movements in twentieth century philosophy and psychology.<p>Though a writer of myth (and in this respect sometimes compared to <!--del_lnk--> Herman Melville), Dostoevsky displayed a nuanced understanding of human psychology in his major works. He created an opus of vitality and almost hypnotic power, characterized by the following traits: feverishly dramatized scenes (conclaves) where his characters are, frequently in scandalous and explosive atmosphere, passionately engaged in Socratic dialogues <i>&agrave; la Russe</i>; the quest for God, the problem of Evil and suffering of the innocents haunt the majority of his novels; characters fall into a few distinct categories: humble and self-effacing <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christians</a> (<!--del_lnk--> Prince Myshkin, <!--del_lnk--> Sonya Marmeladova, <!--del_lnk--> Alyosha Karamazov), self-destructive <!--del_lnk--> nihilists (<!--del_lnk--> Svidrigailov, <!--del_lnk--> Smerdyakov, <!--del_lnk--> Stavrogin, the underground man), cynical debauchers (<!--del_lnk--> Fyodor Karamazov), and rebellious intellectuals (<!--del_lnk--> Raskolnikov, <!--del_lnk--> Ivan Karamazov); also, his characters are driven by ideas rather than by ordinary biological or social imperatives. In comparison with <a href="../../wp/l/Leo_Tolstoy.htm" title="Leo Tolstoy">Tolstoy</a>, whose characters are realistic, the characters of <!--del_lnk--> Dostoevsky are usually more symbolic of the ideas they represent, thus <!--del_lnk--> Dostoevsky is often cited as one of the forerunners of <!--del_lnk--> Literary Symbolism.<p>Dostoevsky&#39;s novels are compressed in time (many cover only a few days) and this enables the author to get rid of one of the dominant traits of <!--del_lnk--> realist prose, the corrosion of human life in the process of the time flux &mdash; his characters primarily embody spiritual values, and these are, by definition, timeless. Other obsessive themes include <!--del_lnk--> suicide, wounded pride, collapsed family values, spiritual regeneration through suffering (the most important motif), rejection of the West and affirmation of <!--del_lnk--> Russian Orthodoxy and <!--del_lnk--> Tsarism. Literary scholars such as <!--del_lnk--> Bakhtin have characterized his work as &#39;<!--del_lnk--> polyphonic&#39;: unlike other novelists, Dostoevsky does not appear to aim for a &#39;single vision&#39;, and beyond simply describing situations from various angles, Dostoevsky engendered fully dramatic novels of ideas where conflicting views and characters are left to develop unevenly into unbearable crescendo.<p>Dostoevsky and the other giant of late 19th century Russian literature, <!--del_lnk--> Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy, never met in person, even though each praised (Dostoevsky remarked of Tolstoy&#39;s <i><a href="../../wp/a/Anna_Karenina.htm" title="Anna Karenina">Anna Karenina</a></i> that it was a &quot;flawless work of art&quot;), criticised (Tolstoy once denounced <i><a href="../../wp/c/Crime_and_Punishment.htm" title="Crime and Punishment">Crime and Punishment</a></i> in the account in the <!--del_lnk--> Henri Troyat biography where Tolstoy is reported to have remarked loosely that, &quot;Once you read the first few chapters you know pretty much how the novel will end up&quot;) and influenced the other. There was, however, a meeting arranged, but there was a confusion about where the meeting place was and they never rescheduled. Tolstoy reportedly burst into tears when he learnt of Dostoevsky&#39;s death. Since their time, the two are considered by the critics and public as two of the greatest novelists produced by their homeland.<p><!--del_lnk--> Nietzsche said of Jesus: &quot;it is regrettable that no Dostoevsky lived near him.&quot; He also stated &quot;Dostoevsky was the only psychologist from whom I had anything to learn: he belongs to the happiest windfalls of my life, happier even than the discovery of <!--del_lnk--> Stendhal.&quot; He said that <i>Notes from the Underground</i> &quot;cried truth from the blood.&quot; According to <!--del_lnk--> Mihajlo Mihajlov&#39;s &quot;The great catalyzer: Nietzsche and Russian neo-Idealism&quot; Nietzsche constantly refers to Dostoevsky in his notes and drafts through out the winter of 1886-1887. Nietzsche also wrote abstracts of several of Dostoevsky&#39;s works.<p><!--del_lnk--> Freud wrote an article entitled <!--del_lnk--> Dostoevsky and Parricide that asserts that the greatest works in world literature are all about parricide (though he is critical of Dostoevsky&#39;s work overall, the inclusion of <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Brothers_Karamazov.htm" title="The Brothers Karamazov">The Brothers Karamazov</a></i> in a set of the three greatest works of literature is remarkable).<p>By common critical consensus he is one among the handful of universal world authors, along with <a href="../../wp/h/Homer.htm" title="Homer">Homer</a>, <a href="../../wp/d/Dante_Alighieri.htm" title="Dante Alighieri">Dante</a>, <a href="../../wp/w/William_Shakespeare.htm" title="William Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Goethe, <a href="../../wp/m/Miguel_de_Cervantes.htm" title="Miguel de Cervantes">Cervantes</a>, <a href="../../wp/v/Victor_Hugo.htm" title="Victor Hugo">Hugo</a> and a few others, Dostoevsky has decisively influenced twentieth century literature, <a href="../../wp/e/Existentialism.htm" title="Existentialism">existentialism</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Expressionism.htm" title="Expressionism">expressionism</a> in particular. It might not be considered too far fetched to say that if one were to sum up literary modernism in two names, the names would be <!--del_lnk--> Nietzsche and the &quot;only psychologist from whom he had anything to learn,&quot; Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky (without forgetting, of course, the enormous differences between the two; for instance, Dostoevsky would have abhorred Nietzsche&#39;s Ubermensch).<p><a id="Major_works" name="Major_works"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Major works</span></h2>
