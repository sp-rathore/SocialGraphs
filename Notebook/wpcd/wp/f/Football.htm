      <p>While it is widely believed that the word &quot;football&quot; (or &quot;foot ball&quot;) originated in reference to the action of a foot kicking a ball, there is a rival explanation, which has it that football originally referred to a variety of games in <!--del_lnk--> medieval Europe, which were played <i>on foot</i>. These games were usually played by <!--del_lnk--> peasants, as opposed to the <!--del_lnk--> horse-riding sports often played by <!--del_lnk--> aristocrats. While there is no conclusive evidence for this explanation, the word football has always implied a variety of games played on foot, not just those that involved kicking a ball. In some cases, the word football has even been applied to games which have specifically outlawed kicking the ball.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Early_history" name="Early_history"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early history</span></h3>
      <p>Throughout the history of mankind, the urge to kick at stones and other such objects is thought to have led to many early activities involving kicking and/or running with a <!--del_lnk--> ball. Football-like games predate recorded history in all parts of the world, and thus the earliest forms of football are not known.<p><a id="Ancient_games" name="Ancient_games"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Ancient games</span></h4>
      <p>Documented evidence of what is possibly the oldest activity resembling football can be found in a <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">Chinese</a> <!--del_lnk--> military manual written during the <!--del_lnk--> Han Dynasty in about 2nd century BC. It describes a practice known as <i><!--del_lnk--> cuju</i>, which involved kicking a leather ball through a hole in a piece of silk cloth strung between two 30 foot poles.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Another <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asian</a> ball-kicking game, which may have been influenced by <i>cuju</i>, is <i><!--del_lnk--> kemari</i>. This is known to have been played within the <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japanese</a> imperial court in <!--del_lnk--> Kyoto from about 600 AD. In <i>kemari</i> several people stand in a circle and kick a ball to each other, trying not to let the ball drop to the ground (much like <!--del_lnk--> keepie uppie). The game appears to have died out sometime before the mid-19th century. (It was revived in 1903, and it can now be seen played for the benefit of tourists at a number of festivals.)<p><!--del_lnk--> Mesoamerican ballgames played with rubber balls are also well-documented as existing since before this time, and are thought to have resembled football in their earlier versions; but since later versions have more similarities to <a href="../../wp/b/Basketball.htm" title="Basketball">basketball</a> or <a href="../../wp/v/Volleyball.htm" title="Volleyball">volleyball</a>, and since their influence on modern football games is minimal, most do not class them as football.<p>The <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Ancient Greeks</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a> are known to have played many ball games some of which involved the use of the feet. The Roman writer <!--del_lnk--> Cicero describes the case of a man who was killed whilst having a shave when a ball was kicked into a barber&#39;s shop. The Roman game of <i><!--del_lnk--> Harpastum</i> is believed to have been adapted from a team game known as &quot;&epsilon;&pi;&iota;&sigma;&kappa;&upsilon;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;&quot; (<i>episkyros</i>) or <i>pheninda</i> that is mentioned by Greek playwright, <!--del_lnk--> Antiphanes (388-311BC) and later referred to by <!--del_lnk--> Clement of Alexandria. The game appears to have vaguely resembled <a href="../../wp/r/Rugby_football.htm" title="Rugby football">rugby</a>.<p>There are a number of references to <!--del_lnk--> traditional, <!--del_lnk--> ancient, and/or <!--del_lnk--> prehistoric ball games, played by <!--del_lnk--> indigenous peoples in many different parts of the world. For example, in 1586, men from a ship commanded by an English explorer named <!--del_lnk--> John Davis, went ashore to play a form of football with <!--del_lnk--> Inuit (Eskimo) people in <a href="../../wp/g/Greenland.htm" title="Greenland">Greenland</a>. There are later accounts of an Inuit game played on ice, called <i><!--del_lnk--> Aqsaqtuk</i>. Each match began with two teams facing each other in parallel lines, before attempting to kick the ball through each other team&#39;s line and then at a goal. In 1610, <!--del_lnk--> William Strachey of the <!--del_lnk--> Jamestown settlement, <!--del_lnk--> Virginia recorded a game played by <!--del_lnk--> Native Americans, called <i><!--del_lnk--> Pahsaheman</i>. In <!--del_lnk--> Victoria, Australia, <!--del_lnk--> Indigenous Australians played a game called <i><!--del_lnk--> Marn Grook</i> (&quot;ball game&quot;). An 1878 book by <!--del_lnk--> Robert Brough-Smyth, <i>The Aborigines of Victoria</i>, quotes a man called Richard Thomas as saying, in about 1841, that he had witnessed Aboriginal people playing the game: &quot;Mr Thomas describes how the foremost player will drop kick a ball made from the skin of a <!--del_lnk--> possum and how other players leap into the air in order to catch it.&quot; It is widely believed that <i>Marn Grook</i> had an influence on the development of <a href="../../wp/a/Australian_rules_football.htm" title="Australian rules football">Australian rules football</a> (see below).<p>These games and others may well go far back into antiquity and may have influenced later football games. However, the main sources of modern football codes appear to lie in western Europe, especially <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>.<p><a id="Games_in_Medi.C3.A6val_and_early_modern_Europe" name="Games_in_Medi.C3.A6val_and_early_modern_Europe"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Games in Medi&aelig;val and early modern Europe</span></h4>
      <p>The <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> saw a huge rise in popularity of annual <!--del_lnk--> Shrovetide football matches throughout Europe, particularly in England. The game played in England at this time may have arrived with the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Britain.htm" title="Roman Britain">Roman occupation</a>, but there is little evidence to indicate this. Reports of a game played in <!--del_lnk--> Brittany, <!--del_lnk--> Normandy, and <!--del_lnk--> Picardy, known as <i><!--del_lnk--> La Soule</i> or <i>Choule</i>, suggest that some of these football games could have arrived in <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> as a result of the <!--del_lnk--> Norman Conquest.<p>These archaic forms of football, typically classified as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> mob football&quot;, would be played between neighbouring towns and villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams, who would clash in a heaving mass of people struggling to drag an inflated <a href="../../wp/p/Pig.htm" title="Pig">pig</a>&#39;s bladder by any means possible to markers at each end of a town (sometimes instead of markers, the teams would attempt to kick the bladder into the balcony of the opponents&#39; church). A legend that these games in England evolved from a more ancient and bloody ritual of kicking the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Dane&#39;s head&quot; is unlikely to be true. Shrovetide games survived in a number of English towns in the modern era (see below).<p>The first detailed description of football in England was given by William FitzStephen (c. 1174-1183). He described the activities of <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> youths during the annual festival of <!--del_lnk--> Shrove Tuesday.<dl>
       <dd><i>After lunch all the youth of the city go out into the fields to take part in a ball game. The students of each school have their own ball; the workers from each city craft are also carrying their balls. Older citizens, fathers, and wealthy citizens come on horseback to watch their juniors competing, and to relive their own youth vicariously: you can see their inner passions aroused as they watch the action and get caught up in the fun being had by the carefree adolescents</i>.</dl>
      <p>Most of the very early references to the game speak simply of &quot;ball play&quot; or &quot;playing at ball&quot;. This reinforces the idea that the games played at the time did not necessarily involve a ball being kicked.<p>In the early <a href="../../wp/1/14th_century.htm" title="14th century">14th century</a>, Nicholas de Farndone, <!--del_lnk--> Lord Mayor of London issued a decree banning football (in the <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a> used by the English upper classes at the time. A translation reads: &quot;[f]orasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large foot balls [<i>rageries de grosses pelotes de pee</i>] in the fields of the public from which many evils might arise which God forbid: we command and forbid on behalf of the king, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future.&quot; This is the earliest reference to football or &quot;foot ball&quot;.<p>In 1363, King <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_III_of_England.htm" title="Edward III of England">Edward III of England</a> issued a similar proclamation banning &quot;...handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting, or other such idle games&quot;, showing that &quot;football&quot; &mdash; whatever its exact form in this case &mdash; was being differentiated from other games, such as handball.<p>Other firsts in the Medi&aelig;val and <!--del_lnk--> early modern eras:<ul>
       <li>the first mention of football in Ireland was in 1308, when a spectator at a football game at <!--del_lnk--> Newcastle, <!--del_lnk--> County Dublin was charged with accidentally stabbing a player. <li>&quot;a football&quot;, in the sense of a ball, was mentioned in 1486.<li>a pair of football boots was ordered by King <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_VIII_of_England.htm" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII of England</a> in 1526. <li>women playing a form of football was in 1580, when Sir <!--del_lnk--> Philip Sidney described it in one of his poems: &quot;[a] tyme there is for all, my mother often sayes, When she, with skirts tuckt very hy, with girles at football playes.&quot;<li>the first references to <i>goals</i> are in the late <a href="../../wp/1/16th_century.htm" title="16th century">16th</a> and early <a href="../../wp/1/17th_century.htm" title="17th century">17th centuries</a>. In 1584 and 1602 respectively, <!--del_lnk--> John Norden and <!--del_lnk--> Richard Carew referred to &quot;goals&quot; in <!--del_lnk--> Cornish hurling. Carew described how goals were made: &quot;they pitch two bushes in the ground, some eight or ten foote asunder; and directly against them, ten or twelue score off, other twayne in like distance, which they terme their Goales&quot;. The first direct reference to scoring a goal is in <!--del_lnk--> John Day&#39;s play <i><!--del_lnk--> The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green</i> (performed circa 1600; published 1659): &quot;I&#39;ll play a gole at <!--del_lnk--> camp-ball&quot; . (According to the first English-Latin dictionary, <i><!--del_lnk--> Promptorium Parvulorum</i> (1440) this was a version of &quot;foott balle&quot;..) Similarly in a poem in 1613, <!--del_lnk--> Michael Drayton refers to &quot;when the Ball to throw, And drive it to the Gole, in squadrons forth they goe&quot;.</ul>

      <p>In the 16th century, the city of <!--del_lnk--> Florence celebrated the period between <!--del_lnk--> Epiphany and <!--del_lnk--> Lent by playing a game which today is known as &quot;<i>calcio storico</i>&quot; (&quot;historic kickball&quot;) in the <!--del_lnk--> Piazza della Novere or the <!--del_lnk--> Piazza Santa Croce. The young aristocrats of the city would dress up in fine silk costumes and embroil themselves in a violent form of football. For example, <i>calcio</i> players could punch, shoulder charge, and kick opponents. Blows below the belt were allowed. The game is said to have originated as a military training exercise. In 1580, Count Giovanni de&#39; Bardi di Vernio wrote <i>Discorso sopra &#39;l giuoco del Calcio Fiorentino</i>. This is sometimes said to be the earliest code of rules for any football game. The game was not played after January 1739 (until it was revived in May 1930).<p><a id="Official_disapproval_and_attempts_to_ban_football" name="Official_disapproval_and_attempts_to_ban_football"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Official disapproval and attempts to ban football</span></h4>

      <p>Numerous attempts have been made to ban football games, particularly the most rowdy and disruptive forms. This was especially the case in England and in other parts of Europe, during the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> and <!--del_lnk--> early modern period. Between 1324 and 1667, football was banned in England alone by more than 30 royal and local laws. The need to repeatedly proclaim such laws demonstrated the difficulty in enforcing bans on popular games.<p>King <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_II_of_England.htm" title="Edward II of England">Edward II</a> was so troubled by the unruliness of football in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> that on <!--del_lnk--> April 13, <!--del_lnk--> 1314 he issued a proclamation banning it: &quot;Forasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large balls from which many evils may arise which God forbid; we command and forbid, on behalf of the King, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future.&quot;<p>The reasons for the ban by <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_III_of_England.htm" title="Edward III of England">Edward III</a>, on <!--del_lnk--> June 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1349, were explicit: football and other recreations distracted the populace from practicing <!--del_lnk--> archery, which was necessary for war.<p>By <!--del_lnk--> 1608, the local authorities in <a href="../../wp/m/Manchester.htm" title="Manchester">Manchester</a> were complaining that: &quot;With the ffotebale...[there] hath beene greate disorder in our towne of Manchester we are told, and glasse windowes broken yearlye and spoyled by a companie of lewd and disordered persons ...&quot; That same year, the word &quot;football&quot; was used disapprovingly by <a href="../../wp/w/William_Shakespeare.htm" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>. Shakespeare&#39;s play <i><!--del_lnk--> King Lear</i> contains the line: &quot;Nor tripped neither, you base football player&quot; (Act I, Scene 4). Shakespeare also mentions the game in <i><!--del_lnk--> A Comedy of Errors</i> (Act II, Scene 1):<dl>
       <dd><i>Am I so round with you as you with me,</i><br />
       <dd><i>That like a football you do spurn me thus?</i><br />
       <dd><i>You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:</i><br />
       <dd><i>If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.</i></dl>
      <p>&quot;Spurn&quot; literally means <i>to kick away</i>, thus implying that the game involved kicking a ball between players.<p>King <a href="../../wp/j/James_I_of_England.htm" title="James I of England">James I of England</a>&#39;s <i>Book of Sports</i> (1618) however, instructs Christians to play at football every Sunday afternoon after worship.

      <p>While football continued to be played in various forms throughout Britain, its public schools (known as private schools in other countries) are widely credited with four key achievements in the creation of modern football codes. First of all, the evidence suggests that they were important in taking football away from its &quot;mob&quot; form and turning it into an organised team sport. Second, many early descriptions of football and references to it were recorded by people who had studied at these schools. Third, it was teachers, students and former students from these schools who first codified football games, to enable matches to be played between schools. Finally, it was at British public schools that the division between &quot;kicking&quot; and &quot;running&quot; (or &quot;carrying&quot;) games first became clear.<p>The earliest evidence that games resembling football were being played at English <!--del_lnk--> public schools &mdash; mainly attended by boys from the upper, upper-middle and professional classes &mdash; comes from the <i>Vulgaria</i> by William Horman in 1519. Horman had been headmaster at <!--del_lnk--> Eton and <!--del_lnk--> Winchester colleges and his <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> textbook includes a translation exercise with the phrase &quot;We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde&quot;.<p><!--del_lnk--> Richard Mulcaster, a student at <!--del_lnk--> Eton College in the early <a href="../../wp/1/16th_century.htm" title="16th century">16th century</a> and later headmaster at other schools, has been described as &ldquo;the greatest sixteenth Century advocate of football&rdquo;. Among his contributions are the earliest evidence of organised team football. Mulcaster&#39;s writings refer to teams (&quot;sides&quot; and &quot;parties&quot;), positions (&quot;standings&quot;), a referee (&quot;judge over the parties&quot;) and a coach &quot;(trayning maister)&quot;. Mulcaster&#39;s &quot;footeball&quot; had evolved from the disordered and violent forms of traditional football:<dl>
       <dd><i>[s]ome smaller number with such overlooking, sorted into sides and standings, not meeting with their bodies so boisterously to trie their strength: nor shouldring or shuffing one an other so barbarously ... may use footeball for as much good to the body, by the chiefe use of the legges.</i></dl>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1633, David Wedderburn, a teacher from <a href="../../wp/a/Aberdeen.htm" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, mentioned elements of modern football games in a short <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> textbook called &quot;Vocabula&quot;. Wedderburn is the first to refer to things which, in modern English, translate as &quot;keeping goal&quot; and &quot;passing a ball&quot;. There is a reference to &quot;get hold of the ball&quot;, suggesting that some handling was allowed. It is clear that the tackles allowed included the charging and holding of opposing players (&quot;keep him out&quot;).<p>A more detailed description of football is given in <!--del_lnk--> Francis Willughby&#39;s <i>Book of Sports</i>, written in about <!--del_lnk--> 1660. Willughby, who had studied at <!--del_lnk--> Sutton Coldfield School, is the first to describe goals and a distinct playing field: &quot;a close that has a gate at either end. The gates are called Goals&quot;. His book includes a diagram illustrating a football field. He also mentions tactics (&quot;leaving some of their best players to guard the goal&quot;); scoring (&quot;they that can strike the ball through their opponents&#39; goal first win&quot;) and; the way teams were selected (&quot;the players being equally divided according to their strength and nimbleness&quot;). He is the first to describe a &quot;law&quot; of football: &quot;they must not strike [an opponent&#39;s leg] higher than the ball&quot;.<p>By the early <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a>, (before the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Factory Act</i> of 1850), most <!--del_lnk--> working class people in Britain had to work six days a week, often for over twelve hours a day. They had neither the time nor the inclination to engage in sport for recreation and, at the time, many <!--del_lnk--> children were part of the labour force. <!--del_lnk--> Feast day football played on the streets was in decline. Public school boys, who enjoyed some freedom from work, became the inventors of organised football games with formal codes of rules.<p>Football was adopted by a number of public schools as a way of encouraging competitiveness and keeping youths fit. Each school drafted its own rules, which varied widely between different schools and were changed over time with each new intake of pupils. Two schools of thought developed regarding rules. Some schools favoured a game in which the ball could be carried (as at Rugby, <!--del_lnk--> Marlborough and <!--del_lnk--> Cheltenham), while others preferred a game where kicking and dribbling the ball was promoted (as at Eton, <!--del_lnk--> Harrow, <!--del_lnk--> Westminster and <!--del_lnk--> Charterhouse). The division into these two camps was partly the result of circumstances in which the games were played. For example, Charterhouse and Westminster at the time had restricted playing areas; the boys were confined to playing their ball game within the school <!--del_lnk--> cloisters, making it difficult for them to adopt rough and tumble running games.<p><!--del_lnk--> William Webb Ellis, a pupil at <!--del_lnk--> Rugby school, is said to have &quot;showed a fine disregard for the rules of football, as played in his time&quot; by picking up the ball and running to the opponents&#39; goal in 1823. This act is usually said to be the beginning of Rugby football, but there is little evidence that it occurred, and most sports historians believe the story to be apocryphal. Nevertheless, by 1841 (some sources say 1842), <i>running</i> with the ball had become acceptable at Rugby, as long as a player gathered the ball on the full or from a bounce, he was not <!--del_lnk--> offside and he did not pass the ball.<p>During this period, the Rugby school rules appear to have spread at least as far, perhaps further, than the other schools&#39; codes. For example, two clubs which claim to be the world&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> first and/or oldest football club, in the sense of a club which is not part of a school or university, are both stongholds of rugby football: the <!--del_lnk--> Barnes Club, said to have been founded in <!--del_lnk--> 1839, and <!--del_lnk--> Guy&#39;s Hospital Football Club, reportedly founded in <!--del_lnk--> 1843. Neither date nor the variety of football played is well-documented, but such claims nevertheless allude to the popularity of rugby before other modern codes emerged.<p><!--del_lnk--> The boom in rail transport in Britain during the 1840s meant that people were able to travel further and with less inconvenience than they ever had before. Inter-school sporting competitions became possible. However, it was difficult for schools to play each other at football, as each school played by its own rules.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1845, three boys at Rugby school were tasked with codifying the rules then being used at the school. These were the first set of written rules (or code) for any form of football. This further assisted the spread of the Rugby game.<p><a id="Cambridge_Rules" name="Cambridge_Rules"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Cambridge Rules</span></h4>

      <p>In 1848 at <a href="../../wp/u/University_of_Cambridge.htm" title="University of Cambridge">Cambridge University</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Mr. H. de Winton and Mr. J.C. Thring, who were both formerly at <!--del_lnk--> Shrewsbury School, called a meeting at <a href="../../wp/t/Trinity_College%252C_Cambridge.htm" title="Trinity College, Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a> with 12 other representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, <!--del_lnk--> Winchester and Shrewsbury. An eight-hour meeting produced what amounted to the first set of modern rules, known as the <i>Cambridge Rules</i>. No copy of these rules now exists, but a revised version from circa 1856 is held in the library of Shrewsbury School. The rules clearly favour the kicking game. Handling was only allowed for a player to take a <i>clean catch</i> entitling them to a free kick and there was a primitive offside rule, disallowing players from &quot;loitering&quot; around the opponents&#39; goal. The <i>Cambridge Rules</i> were not widely adopted outside English public schools and universities but did influence the <!--del_lnk--> Football Association committee members responsible for formulating the rules of <a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Soccer">soccer</a> as it is played today .<p><a id="Other_developments_in_the_1850s" name="Other_developments_in_the_1850s"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Other developments in the 1850s</span></h4>
      <p>The increasing interest and development of the various English football games was shown in 1851, when <!--del_lnk--> Richard Lindon and <!--del_lnk--> William Gilbert both Boot and Shoemakers from <!--del_lnk--> Rugby, Warwickshire, exhibited both round and oval-shaped balls at the <!--del_lnk--> Great Exhibition in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>.

(For more details see: <!--del_lnk--> Oldest football clubs.)<p><!--del_lnk--> Sheffield Football Club, founded by former Harrow School pupils Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest, in <!--del_lnk--> 1857, was later recognised as the world&#39;s oldest Association football (soccer) club. However, the club initially played its own code of football: the <!--del_lnk--> Sheffield Rules. There were some similarities to the <!--del_lnk--> Cambridge Rules, but players were allowed to push or <i>hit</i> the ball with their hands, and there was no <i>offside</i> rule at all, so that players known as <i>kick throughs</i> could be permanently positioned near the opponents&#39; goal. The code spread to a number of clubs in the area and was popular until the 1870s.<p><a id="Australian_rules_football" name="Australian_rules_football"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Australian rules football</span></h4>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Tom Wills began to develop Australian football in <!--del_lnk--> Melbourne during 1858. Wills had been educated in England, at Rugby School and had played <a href="../../wp/c/Cricket.htm" title="Cricket">cricket</a> for Cambridge University. The extent to which Wills was directly influenced by British and Irish football games is unknown, but there were similarities between some of them and his game. There were <!--del_lnk--> pronounced similarities between Wills&#39;s game and <!--del_lnk--> Gaelic football (as it would be codified in 1887). It appears that Australian football also has some similarities to the <!--del_lnk--> indigenous Australian game of <i><!--del_lnk--> Marn Grook</i> (see above).<p><!--del_lnk--> Melbourne Football Club was also founded in 1858 and is the oldest surviving Australian football club, but the rules it used during its first season are unknown. The club&#39;s rules of 1859 are the oldest surviving set of laws for Australian rules. They were drawn up at the Parade Hotel, <!--del_lnk--> East Melbourne on <!--del_lnk--> 17 May, by Wills, W.J. Hammersley, J.B. Thompson and Thomas Smith (some sources include H.C.A. Harrison). These men had similar backgrounds to Wills and their code also had pronounced similarities to the Sheffield rules, most notably in the absence of an <i>offside</i> rule. A free kick was awarded for a <i>mark</i> (clean catch). However, <i>running</i> while holding the ball was allowed and although it was not specified in the rules, a rugby ball was used. The club shared many members with the <!--del_lnk--> Melbourne Cricket Club, which was based at the <!--del_lnk--> Melbourne Cricket Ground, and <i><!--del_lnk--> cricket ovals</i> &mdash; which vary in size and are much larger than the fields used in other forms of football &mdash; became the standard playing field for Australian rules. The 1859 rules did not include some elements which would soon become important to the game, such as the requirement to <i>bounce</i> the ball while running.<p>Australian rules is sometimes said to be the first form of football to be codified but &mdash; as was the case in all kinds of football at the time, there was no official body supporting the rules &mdash; and play varied from one club to another. By 1866, however, several other clubs in the <!--del_lnk--> Colony of Victoria had agreed to play an updated version of the Melbourne F.C. rules, which were later known as &quot;Victorian Rules&quot; and/or &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Australasian Rules&quot;. The formal name of the code later became Australian rules football (and, more recently, Australian football). By the end of the 19th century the code had spread to the <!--del_lnk--> other Australian colonies (although rugby football would remain more popular in <!--del_lnk--> New South Wales and <!--del_lnk--> Queensland) and <!--del_lnk--> other parts of the world.<p><a id="The_Football_Association" name="The_Football_Association"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The Football Association</span></h4>

      <p>During the early 1860s, there were increasing attempts in England to unify and reconcile the various public school games. In 1862, J. C. Thring, who had been one of the driving forces behind the original Cambridge Rules, was a master at <!--del_lnk--> Uppingham School and he issued his own rules of what he called &quot;The Simplest Game&quot; (these are also known as the Uppingham Rules). In early October 1863 another new revised version of the Cambridge Rules was drawn up by a seven member committee representing former pupils from Harrow, Shrewsbury, Eton, Rugby, Marlborough and Westminster.<p>At the Freemason&#39;s Tavern, Great Queen Street, <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> on the evening of <!--del_lnk--> October 26, <!--del_lnk--> 1863, representatives of several football clubs in the <!--del_lnk--> London Metropolitan area met for the inaugural meeting of <!--del_lnk--> The Football Association (FA). The aim of the Association was to establish a single unifying code and regulate the playing of the game among its members. Following the first meeting, the public schools were invited were sent to to join the association. All of them declined, except Charterhouse and Uppingham. In total, six meetings of the FA were held between October and December 1863. After the third meeting, a draft set of rules were published. However, at the beginning of the fourth meeting, attention was drawn to the Sheffield Rules and the 1863 version of the Cambridge Rules. There were two rules in the FA&#39;s draft which differed substantially from the Cambridge game:<dl>
       <dd><i>IX. A player shall be entitled to run with the ball towards his adversaries&#39; goal if he makes a fair catch, or catches the ball on the first bound; but in case of a fair catch, if he makes his mark [to take a free kick] he shall not run.</i></dl>
      <dl>
       <dd><i>X. If any player shall run with the ball towards his adversaries&#39; goal, any player on the opposite side shall be at liberty to charge, hold, trip or hack him, or to wrest the ball from him, but no player shall be held and hacked at the same time.</i></dl>
      <p>At the fifth meeting it was proposed that these two rules be removed. Most of the delegates supported this, but F. W. Campbell, the representative from <!--del_lnk--> Blackheath and the first FA treasurer, objected. He said: &quot;hacking is the true football&quot;. However, the motion to ban hacking was carried and Blackheath withdrew from the FA. After the final meeting on <!--del_lnk--> 8 December, the FA published the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Laws of Football&quot;, the first comprehensive set of rules for the game later known as <a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Football (soccer)">association football</a> (later known in some countries as soccer).<p>The first FA rules still contained elements that are no longer part of association football, but which are still recognisable in other games: for instance, a player could make a fair catch and claim a <i><!--del_lnk--> mark</i>, which entitled him to a free kick, and; if a player touched the ball behind the opponents&#39; goal line, his side was entitled to a <i>free kick</i> at goal, from 15 yards in front of the goal line.<p><a id="Rugby_football" name="Rugby_football"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Rugby football</span></h4>

      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> Britain, by 1870, there were about 75 clubs playing variations of the Rugby school game.

However, there was no generally accepted set of rules for rugby until 1871, when 21 clubs from London came together to form the <!--del_lnk--> Rugby Football Union (RFU). (Ironically, Blackheath now lobbied to ban <!--del_lnk--> hacking.) The first official RFU rules were adopted in June 1871. These rules allowed passing the ball. They also included the <!--del_lnk--> try, where touching the ball over the line allowed an attempt at goal, though drop-goals from marks and general play, and penalty conversions were still the main form of contest.<p><a id="North_American_football" name="North_American_football"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">North American football</span></h4>

      <p>Modern <a href="../../wp/a/American_football.htm" title="American football">American football</a> grew out of a match between <!--del_lnk--> McGill University of Montreal, and <!--del_lnk--> Harvard University in 1874. At the time, Harvard students are reported to have played the <!--del_lnk--> Boston Game &mdash; a <i>running</i> code &mdash; rather than the FA-based <i>kicking</i> games favored by US universities. This made it easy for Harvard to adapt to the rugby-based game played by McGill and the two teams alternated between their respective sets of rules. Within a few years, however, Harvard had both adopted McGill&#39;s rugby rules and had persuaded other US university teams to do the same. In 1876, at the <!--del_lnk--> Massasoit Convention, it was agreed by these universities to adopt most of the <!--del_lnk--> Rugby Football Union rules. However, a <i><!--del_lnk--> touch-down</i> only counted toward the score if neither side kicked a <i><!--del_lnk--> field goal</i>. The convention decided that, in the US game, four touchdowns would be worth one goal; in the event of a tied score, a goal converted from a touchdown would take precedence over four touch-downs.<p>Princeton, Rutgers and others continued to compete using soccer-based rules for a few years before switching to the rugby-based rules of Harvard and its competitors. US colleges did not generally return to soccer until the early twentieth century.<p>In 1880, <!--del_lnk--> Yale coach <!--del_lnk--> Walter Camp, devised a number of major changes to the American game, beginning with the reduction of teams from 15 to <i>11 players</i>, followed by reduction of the field area by almost half, and; the introduction of the <i>scrimmage</i>, in which a player heeled the ball backwards, to begin a game. These were complemented in 1882 by another of Camp&#39;s innovations: a team had to surrender possession if they did not gain five yards after three <i>downs</i> (i.e. successful tackles).<p>Over the years Canadian football absorbed some developments in American football, but also retained many unique characteristics. One of these was that Canadian football, for many years, did not officially distinguish itself from rugby. For example, the <b>Canadian Rugby Football Union</b>, founded in 1884 was the forerunner of the <!--del_lnk--> Canadian Football League, rather than a rugby union body. (The <!--del_lnk--> Canadian Rugby Union was not formed until 1965.) American football was also frequently described as &quot;rugby&quot; in the 1880s.<p><a id="Gaelic_football" name="Gaelic_football"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Gaelic football</span></h4>

      <p>In the mid-19th century, various traditional football games, referred to collectively as <i><!--del_lnk--> caid</i>, remained popular in Ireland, especially in <!--del_lnk--> County Kerry. One observer, Father W. Ferris, described two main forms of <i>caid</i> during this period: the &quot;field game&quot; in which the object was to put the ball through arch-like goals, formed from the boughs of two trees, and; the epic &quot;cross-country game&quot; which took up most of the daylight hours of a Sunday on which it was played, and was won by one team taking the ball across a <!--del_lnk--> parish boundary. &quot;Wrestling&quot;, &quot;holding&quot; opposing players, and carrying the ball were all allowed.<p>By the 1870s, Rugby and Association football had started to become popular in Ireland. <!--del_lnk--> Trinity College, Dublin was an early stronghold of Rugby (see the <!--del_lnk--> Developments in the 1850s section, above). The rules of the English FA were being distributed widely. Traditional forms of <i>caid</i> had begun to give way to a &quot;rough-and-tumble game&quot; which allowed tripping.<p>There was no serious attempt to unify and codify Irish varieties of football, until the establishment of the <!--del_lnk--> Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) in 1884. The GAA sought to promote traditional Irish sports, such as <!--del_lnk--> hurling and to reject imported games like Rugby and Association football. The first Gaelic football rules were drawn up by <!--del_lnk--> Maurice Davin and published in the <i>United Ireland</i> magazine on <!--del_lnk--> February 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1887. Davin&#39;s rules showed the influence of games such as hurling and a desire to formalise a distinctly Irish code of football. The prime example of this differentiation was the lack of an <!--del_lnk--> offside rule (an attribute which, for many years, was shared only by other Irish games like hurling, and by Australian rules football).<p><a id="The_split_in_Rugby_football" name="The_split_in_Rugby_football"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The split in Rugby football</span></h4>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) was founded in 1886, but rifts were beginning to emerge in the code. <!--del_lnk--> Professionalism was beginning to creep into the various codes of football.<p>In Britain, by the 1890s, a long-standing <!--del_lnk--> Rugby Football Union ban on <i>professional</i> players was causing regional tensions within rugby football, as many players in northern England were <!--del_lnk--> working class and could not afford to take time off to train, travel, play and recover from injuries. This was not very different from what had occurred ten years earlier in soccer in Northern England but the authorities reacted very differently in the RFU, attempting to alienate the working class support in Northern England. In <!--del_lnk--> 1895, following a dispute about a player being paid broken time payments, which replaced wages lost as a result of playing rugby, representatives of the northern clubs met in <!--del_lnk--> Huddersfield to form the <!--del_lnk--> Northern Rugby Football Union (NRFU). The new body initially permitted only various types of player wage replacements. However, within two years, NRFU players could be paid, but they were required to have a job outside sport.<p>The demands of a professional league dictated that rugby had to become a better &quot;spectator&quot; sport. Within a few years the NRFU rules had started to diverge from the RFU, most notably with the abolition of the <i><!--del_lnk--> line-out</i>. This was followed by the replacement of the <i><!--del_lnk--> ruck</i> with the &quot;play-the-ball ruck&quot;, which allowed a two-player ruck contest between the tackler at marker and the player tackled. <i><!--del_lnk--> Mauls</i> were stopped once the ball carrier was held, being replaced by a play-the ball-ruck. The separate Lancashire and Yorkshire competitions of the NRFU merged in 1901, forming the <i>Northern Rugby League</i>, the first time the name <!--del_lnk--> rugby league was used officially in England.<p>Over time, the RFU form of rugby, played by clubs which remained members of national federations affiliated to the IRFB, became known as <!--del_lnk--> rugby union.<p><a id="The_globalisation_of_association_football_.28soccer.29" name="The_globalisation_of_association_football_.28soccer.29"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The globalisation of association football (soccer)</span></h4>

      <p>The need for a single body to oversee Association football had become apparent by the beginning of the 20th century, with the increasing popularity of international fixtures. The English Football Association had chaired many discussions on setting up an international body, but was perceived as making no progress. It fell to associations from seven other European countries: <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Belgium.htm" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>, <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, and <a href="../../wp/s/Switzerland.htm" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, to form an international association. The <i>F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Internationale de Football Association</i> (<a href="../../wp/f/FIFA.htm" title="FIFA">FIFA</a>) was founded in <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a> on <!--del_lnk--> May 21, <!--del_lnk--> 1904. Its first president was <!--del_lnk--> Robert Gu&eacute;rin. The <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a> name and acronym has remained, even outside French-speaking countries.<p><a id="The_reform_of_American_football" name="The_reform_of_American_football"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The reform of American football</span></h4>
      <p>Both forms of rugby and American football were noted at the time for serious injuries, as well as the deaths of a significant number of players. By the early 20th century in the USA, this had resulted in national controversy and American football was banned by a number of colleges. Consequently, a series of meetings was held by 19 colleges in <!--del_lnk--> 1905&ndash;06. This occurred reputedly at the behest of President <a href="../../wp/t/Theodore_Roosevelt.htm" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>. He was considered a fancier of the game, but he threatened to ban it unless the rules were modified to reduce the numbers of deaths and disabilities. The meetings are now considered to be the origin of the <!--del_lnk--> National Collegiate Athletic Association.<p>One proposed change was a widening of the playing field. However, <!--del_lnk--> Harvard University had just built a concrete stadium and therefore objected to widening, instead proposing legalisation of the <i><!--del_lnk--> forward pass</i>. The report of the meetings introduced many restrictions on tackling and two more divergences from rugby: the forward pass and the banning of <i>mass formation plays</i>. The changes did not immediately have the desired effect, and 33 American football players were killed during 1908 alone. However, the number of deaths and injuries did gradually decline.<p><a id="Further_divergence_of_the_two_rugby_codes" name="Further_divergence_of_the_two_rugby_codes"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Further divergence of the two rugby codes</span></h4>
      <p>Rugby league rules diverged significantly from rugby union in 1906, with the reduction of the team from 15 to 13 players. In 1907, a <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> professional rugby team toured Australia and Britain, receiving an enthusiastic reponse, and professional <!--del_lnk--> rugby leagues were launched in Australia the following year. However, the rules of professional rugby varied from one country to another, and negotiations between various national bodies were required to fix the exact rules for each international match. This situation endured until 1948, when at the instigation of the French league, the <!--del_lnk--> Rugby League International Federation (RLIF) was formed at a meeting in <!--del_lnk--> Bordeaux.<p>During the second half of 20th century, the rules changed further. In 1966, rugby league officials borrowed the American football concept of <i><!--del_lnk--> downs</i>: a team could retain possession of the ball for no more than four tackles. The maximum number of tackles was later increased to six (in 1971), and in rugby league this became known as the <!--del_lnk--> <i>six tackle rule</i>.<p>With the advent of full-time professionals in the early 1990s, and the consequent speeding up of the game, the five metre off-side distance between the two teams became 10 metres, and the replacement rule was superseded by various interchange rules, among other changes.<p>The rules of rugby union also changed significantly and became very complex and technical during the 20th century. In addition, rucks and mauls became homogenised, and in line-outs players began to be lifted by their teammates to contest their opponents.<p>In 1995, rugby union became an &quot;open&quot; game, that is one which allowed professional players. Although the original dispute between the two codes has now disappeared &mdash; and despite the fact that officials from both forms of rugby football have sometimes mentioned the possibility of re-unification &mdash; the rules of both codes and their culture have diverged to such an extent that such a event is unlikely in the foreseeable future.<p><a id="Football_today" name="Football_today"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Football today</span></h2>

      <p>The word &quot;<i>football</i>&quot;, when used in reference to a specific game can mean any one of those described above. Because of this, much friendly controversy has occurred over the term <i>football</i>, primarily because it is used in different ways in different parts of the <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English-speaking world</a>. Most often, the word &quot;football&quot; is used to refer to the code of football that is considered dominant within a particular region.<p>In most English-speaking countries, the word &quot;football&quot; usually refers to <a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Football (soccer)">Association football</a>, also known as &quot;soccer&quot; (the name was originally a slang abbreviation of <i>Association</i>). Of the 45 national <a href="../../wp/f/FIFA.htm" title="FIFA">FIFA</a> affiliates in which <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> is an official or primary language, only three (<!--del_lnk--> Canada, <!--del_lnk--> Samoa and the <!--del_lnk--> United States) use &quot;soccer&quot; in their name, while the rest use football (although the Samoan Federation actually uses both). However, in some countries, such as <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, use of the word &quot;football&quot; by soccer bodies is a recent change (or a reversion to a long-abandoned name) and has been controversial.<p>The different codes are listed below and are described more fully in their own articles.<p><a id="Present_day_codes_and_.22families.22_of_football" name="Present_day_codes_and_.22families.22_of_football"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Present day codes and &quot;families&quot; of football</span></h3>
