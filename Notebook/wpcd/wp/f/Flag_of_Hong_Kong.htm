The flag was first officially hoisted on <!--del_lnk--> 1 July <!--del_lnk--> 1997, in a <!--del_lnk--> historical ceremony marking the <!--del_lnk--> transfer of sovereignty from the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> to the PRC. The precise use of the flag is regulated through laws passed by the 58th executive meeting of the <!--del_lnk--> State Council held in <a href="../../wp/b/Beijing.htm" title="Beijing">Beijing</a>.<p>The former colonial flag was used from <!--del_lnk--> 27 July <!--del_lnk--> 1959, to <!--del_lnk--> 30 June <!--del_lnk--> 1997, when Hong Kong was under <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> rule. It was a <!--del_lnk--> blue Union Jack ensign with the <!--del_lnk--> Hong Kong coat of arms on a white disk centred on the outer half of the flag. The 1876 design featured a colonial badge, showing a &quot;local scene&quot; instead of the Hong Kong coat of arms.<p>

      <p>The design of the flag carries cultural, political and regional meanings. The colour itself is significant: red is always the festive colour for the Chinese people, and one might remember that the <!--del_lnk--> People&#39;s Liberation Army was once called the Chinese Red Army. Thus, the colour conveys a sense of celebration and nationalism. Moreover, the red is identical to that used in the PRC flag, which implies the close linkage re-established between post-colonial Hong Kong and its mother country. The juxtaposition of red and white on the flag symbolises the <i><!--del_lnk--> one country two systems</i> political principle applied to the region, with the stylised <i><!--del_lnk--> Bauhinia blakeana</i> harmonising this dichotomy.<p>The bauhinia had been used as the <!--del_lnk--> official symbol of the now-defunct <!--del_lnk--> Urban Council since 1965 (depicted to the right). One may observe the design elements that have been incorporated into the Hong Kong flag.<p><a id="Construction" name="Construction"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Construction</span></h3>
      <p>When the flag is manufactured, the front and the back of the flag look identical to each other (<!--del_lnk--> mirror image). The Hong Kong government has specified specific sizes, colours, and manufacturing parameters for the flag to be made in.<p>The background of the rectangular flag is red. It is also intended to be the same colour as that used for the PRC. The ratio of its length to breadth is 1.5. In its centre is a five petal stylised white bauhinia. The circle which circumscribes the bauhinia has a <!--del_lnk--> diameter 0.6 times the entire height of the flag. The petals are uniformly spread around the centre point of the flag, and radiate outwards in a clockwise direction. Each petal bears a red 5-pointed <!--del_lnk--> red star with a red trace, suggestive of a flower <!--del_lnk--> stamen. The red trace makes each petal look as if it is being divided in half. The heading that is used to allow a flag to be slid or raised onto a pole is white.<p>

      <p>The flag of colonial Hong Kong underwent several changes in the last one and a half centuries. However, the history behind the changes is incomplete as some information regarding the authorities who commissioned the changes were not documented properly during that period.<p>In 1843, the <!--del_lnk--> Seal of Colony was instituted. The design was based on a local waterfront scene (see the 1876 flag below): three local merchants with their commercial goods can be found on the foreground, a square-rigged ship and a junk occupy the middle ground, while the background consists of some conical hills and cloud. In 1868 a Hong Kong flag was produced, with a badge based on the &quot;local scene&quot;, but was rejected by Governor <!--del_lnk--> Richard Graves Macdonell.<p>In 1870, a &quot;White crown over HK&quot; layout was proposed by the Colonial Secretary. The letters &quot;HK&quot; were omitted and the crown became full-colour three years later. It is unclear what the badge was like during that period of time, but it was unlikely to be the &quot;local scene&quot;. It should be a crown of some sort, which may, or may not, have had the letters &quot;HK&quot; below it. In 1879, the Seal badge was readopted with the <!--del_lnk--> Admiralty&#39;s approval.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 17 November <!--del_lnk--> 1923, Governor <!--del_lnk--> Reginald Edward Stubbs replied to a question regarding white circles on colonial Blue Ensigns, the issue of concern being &quot;<i>the dark green of the Peak would be against the blue of the Ensign</i>&quot;. The Colonial Office decided that the &quot;dark green&quot; writing at the border of the badge should consist of a series of tonal gradations from light blue, to light brown, and finally white. On <!--del_lnk--> 12 May <!--del_lnk--> 1924, Stubbs penned that the badge in the Flag Book had <i>...for some years past differed from the flag....Flag, that was even less attractive than that in the Flag Book, would be changed to correspond to it.</i><p>During the <!--del_lnk--> Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, the Japanese were harsh on the locals. They abolished many aspects of Chinese and British culture in Hong Kong, and forcefully instituted Japanese lifestyles in the region. The identity of Hong Kong was suppressed, and consequently all British and Chinese flags were abolished during this period; propaganda posters were distributed where the <!--del_lnk--> Japanese flag was canonised as Hong Kong&#39;s national flag.<p>In 1955 the idea of the Seal badge was revived. This occurred some years after <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. The new badge was similar to the 1876 badge, but had a slightly lower eye-line, and a more realistic mountain on the left-hand side. The mountain, and the ship and junk, were made more prominent and embossed. A <!--del_lnk--> Coat of Arms for Hong Kong was granted on <!--del_lnk--> 21 January <!--del_lnk--> 1959 by College of Arms in London.<p>From 1959 onwards, Arms on white circular ground were implemented on Union Jack and Blue Ensign, likewise on unauthorised Red Ensigns.<center>

      <p>Before the transfer of Hong Kong&#39;s sovereignty, a contest was held among <a href="../../wp/h/Hong_Kong.htm" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> people to help choose a <!--del_lnk--> flag for the newly created <!--del_lnk--> special administrative region. More than 7,000 designs were submitted for the contest; and a panel of political figures were nominated as judges. However, as the winning entries were rejected by the PRC, the famous architect <!--del_lnk--> Tao Ho was at last put in charge for the task.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Ho was originally chosen to be one of the panel judges to pick Hong Kong&#39;s new flag. The <a href="../../wp/s/Shanghai.htm" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>-born artist recalled that some of the designs had been rather funny - some even had a political twist to them: &quot;<i>One had a <!--del_lnk--> hammer and sickle on one side and a <!--del_lnk--> dollar sign on the other.</i>&quot; Six designs were chosen as finalists by the judges, but were all later rejected. Ho and two others were then asked by the PRC to submit new proposals.<p>Looking for inspiration, Ho wandered into a garden and picked up a bauhinia flower. He observed the symmetry of the five petals, and how their winding pattern conveyed a dynamic feeling. At last he incorporated this sense of energy into the flag to represent Hong Kong.<p><a id="Proper_flag_protocol" name="Proper_flag_protocol"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Proper flag protocol</span></h2>

      <p>The national and regional flags are flown daily from the <!--del_lnk--> Chief Executive&#39;s official residence, the <!--del_lnk--> Government House, the <!--del_lnk--> Hong Kong International Airport and at all border crossings and points of entry into Hong Kong. At major government offices and buildings, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Office of the Chief Executive, the <!--del_lnk--> Executive Council, the <!--del_lnk--> Court of Final Appeal, the <!--del_lnk--> Legislative Council, and the <!--del_lnk--> Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices overseas, the national and the regional flags are displayed during days when these offices are working. Other government offices and buildings, such as <!--del_lnk--> hospitals, <!--del_lnk--> schools, departmental headquarters, sports grounds and cultural venues can fly the national and regional flags on certain occasions, such as the <!--del_lnk--> National Day (1 October), the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Establishment Day (1 July), and the <!--del_lnk--> New Year&#39;s Day. The national and regional flags should be raised at <!--del_lnk--> sunrise (around 8:00 <!--del_lnk--> a.m.) and lowered around <!--del_lnk--> sunset (around 6:00 <!--del_lnk--> p.m.).<p><a id="Respect_for_the_flag" name="Respect_for_the_flag"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Respect for the flag</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Hong Kong Basic Law stipulates that the flag is the official symbol and ensign of the HKSAR. The Basic Law also stated that the residents of Hong Kong and various organisations <!--del_lnk--> respect and <a href="../../wp/l/Love.htm" title="Love">cherish</a> the regional flag. The use and display of the regional flag is governed by the <b>Regional Flag and Regional Emblem Ordinance</b>. This ordinance spells out specifications of the flag as well as appropriate and inappropriate uses of the flag. Examples of inappropriate handling of the flag include displaying the flag upside down, letting the flag touch either the ground or water, dipped into any substance, or flown in times of bad weather. This is in contrast to flags of regimental colours, organisational or institutional flags which may be dipped to show honour to a person or object. Other inappropriate uses include using the flag:<ol>
       <li>As a <!--del_lnk--> tablecloth<li>As a drapery on a platform<li>As covering for a <!--del_lnk--> statue, <!--del_lnk--> plaque, <!--del_lnk--> cornerstone, or similar object<li>As part of a costume, clothing or a uniform<li>In commercial <a href="../../wp/a/Advertising.htm" title="Advertising">advertising</a>.</ol>
      <p>Furthermore, certain actions such as writing on the flag or using the flag to hold objects may be considered <!--del_lnk--> flag desecration. An exception is the use of flower petals when unfurling the flag.<p><a id="Handling_of_the_flag" name="Handling_of_the_flag"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Handling of the flag</span></h3>
      <div class="floatright"><span><a class="image" href="../../images/249/24957.png.htm" title="Correct display of the flag."><img alt="Correct display of the flag." height="134" longdesc="/wiki/Image:HKSAR-flag-hv.png" src="../../images/249/24957.png" width="220" /></a></span></div>
      <p>There are a number of traditional rules of respect that should be observed when handling or displaying the flag. When the flag is used outdoors, the flag should always be hoisted at sunrise and lowered at sunset. However, weather conditions can make the use of a flag outdoors impossible. The flag may also be flown on a public building at night under special circumstances, such as the flag having lights pointed at it.<p>The flag should never be drawn, displayed or flown upside down. Tradition also states that when draped <!--del_lnk--> vertically, the flag should be rotated at a 90 <!--del_lnk--> degree angle and reversed. This is done because the top right (viewer&#39;s left) is the honour position of the flag. It is also considered disrespectful to display the flag that has been damaged, such as fraying of the edges (called the fly) or the colours of the flag are fading. Equipment that is used to fly flags, such as flag poles and halyards (ropes that are used to hoist the flag), should also be maintained on a regular basis.<p><a id="Correct_display" name="Correct_display"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Correct display</span></h3>

      <p>When two flags displayed on a wall horizontally behind a podium, their <!--del_lnk--> hoists should point towards each other with the saffron stripes at the uppermost. If the flag is displayed on a short flagpole, the flagpole is mounted at an 45 degree angle so the flag can be flown and there is nothing below touching the flag. If a national flag and a regional flag are displayed on crossed staffs, the hoists must be towards each other and the flags must be fully spread out. The flag should never be used as a table cloth to cover tables, cover podiums or be draped from railings.<p><a id="With_the_National_Flag" name="With_the_National_Flag"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">With the National Flag</span></h3>

For example, the PRC flag would be flown above and placed to the centre of the HKSAR flag.<p>In addition, the following rules apply:<ol>
       <li>The PRC flag is larger than the HKSAR flag<li>The PRC flag is raised first when both flags are raised<li>The PRC flag is always flown on the right of the HKSAR flag.<li>The PRC flag is found to the right of the speaker while the HKSAR flag is on the left<li>The PRC flag is placed to the viewer&#39;s right when outside, determined by a person standing in front of the building and looking towards the front entrance of the building.</ol>
      <p>However, for sporting event like Olympic medal ceremonies, since there is a chance that Hong Kong athletes win the gold medal while Mainland athletes win the silver or bronze, which with make the flag of China lower, or to the left of the Hong Kong flag, the rules do not apply.<p><a id="With_national_flags_of_other_countries" name="With_national_flags_of_other_countries"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">With national flags of other countries</span></h3>

      <p>When the Regional Flag is displayed outdoors with other national flags, the Regional Flag must be flying at the far right (viewer&#39;s left) of the national flags on separate poles. Then, the national flags are <!--del_lnk--> arranged alphabetically according to their names in <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a>. All the flags can be at the same sizes, but they cannot be larger than the Hong Kong flag.<p>The Regional Flag is allowed to be flown at the beginning and end of the row or included alphabetically in the middle of the row. In case when flags are flown in a closed circle, the Regional Flag should be flown from a significant point. The other flags should be raised in a clockwise manner until it comes back to the Regional Flag. The Regional Flag is the first to be raised and the last to be lowered.<p>When the flag is displayed on crossed poles, the pole using the Regional Flag should be in front and the flag is placed to the right (observers&#39; left). However, if the <!--del_lnk--> flag of the United Nations is displayed, the Regional Flag can be flown from either side of the UN flag. Generally, the flag is displayed at the farther-most right (i.e. farther-most left of an observer facing the flags).<p><a id="With_non-national_flags" name="With_non-national_flags"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">With non-national flags</span></h3>

      <p>When the flag is displayed with <a href="../../wp/c/Corporation.htm" title="Corporation">corporate</a> flags or <!--del_lnk--> advertising banners, the Regional Flag should be placed either in the middle of the flags. When doing so, the flagpole containing the Regional Flag must be in front of the other flag poles. However, if the flags are flown from the same pole, the Regional Flag must be flown on top of the others. If the flags are being used in a <!--del_lnk--> parade, the Regional Flag must be at front and centre of the marching group or to the <!--del_lnk--> marching right if other flags are in the marching group.<p><a id="Showing_the_flag_indoors" name="Showing_the_flag_indoors"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Showing the flag indoors</span></h3>

      <p>Whenever the flag is displayed indoors at public meetings or gatherings, the flag should be placed to the right of the speaker or podium (observers&#39; left), which is the position of honour. However, if the flag is not placed next to the speaker, the flag will be placed to the <!--del_lnk--> audience&#39;s far right.<p>When displaying the flag, the flag must include a saffron stripe on top.

Those who are wearing a military uniform will also present their salutes at this time. The same rules apply when the flag is in a moving column.
