      <p>The <b>Full Moon</b> is the <!--del_lnk--> lunar phase that occurs when the <a href="../../wp/m/Moon.htm" title="Moon">Moon</a> lies on the opposite side of <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a> from the <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">Sun</a>. The Moon as seen from the surface of Earth is fully illuminated by the Sun at this time, presenting a &quot;full&quot; round disk to viewers on Earth. As always, only half the total surface of the Moon is illuminated.<p>

</script><a id="Eclipses" name="Eclipses"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Eclipses</span></h2>
      <p>A Full Moon is the only time when a <a href="../../wp/l/Lunar_eclipse.htm" title="Lunar eclipse">lunar eclipse</a> is possible; at that time the Moon may move through the shadow cast by Earth. However, because of the tilt or inclination of the Moon&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> orbit around Earth relative to Earth&#39;s orbit around the Sun, the Moon usually passes to the north or south of Earth&#39;s shadow at Full Moon, so a lunar eclipse does not occur at every Full Moon.<p>Full Moons are generally a poor time to conduct <a href="../../wp/a/Astronomy.htm" title="Astronomy">astronomical</a> observations, since the bright reflected sunlight from the Moon overwhelms the dimmer light from stars.<p><a id="Numbers_and_formulae" name="Numbers_and_formulae"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Numbers and formulae</span></h2>
      <p>Although on average it takes only 27.322 days (<!--del_lnk--> sidereal month) for the Moon to complete one <!--del_lnk--> orbit around Earth, it requires about two more days than that to again catch up with the Sun. On average, the number of days between Full Moons is about 29.5306 days. The actual number of days may differ from the average number by more than a half day. From one Full Moon to the next, the number of days in one <i>lunation</i> can vary between 29.272 and 29.833 days.<p>The age and apparent size of the Full Moon vary in a cycle of just under 14 synodic <!--del_lnk--> months, which is called the <!--del_lnk--> Full moon cycle.<p>The combined date and time of Full Moon number <i>N</i>, using a fictitious moon that moves at a strictly mean rate is approximately:<dl>
       <dd><i>D</i> = 20.362954 + 29.5305888531 &times; <i>N</i> + 102.19 &times; 10<sup>-12</sup> &times; <i>N</i><sup>&nbsp;2</sup></dl>
      <ul>
       <li><i>D</i> is the number of days (and fractions) since <!--del_lnk--> 1 January <!--del_lnk--> 2000 00:00:00 <!--del_lnk--> UTC,<li><i>N</i> is a count of Full Moons, starting with <b>zero</b> for the first Full Moon that falls in the year 2000.</ul>
      <p>The <b>true</b> Full Moon may differ from this by up to about 14.5 hours, due to the normal anomaly in the Moon&#39;s <a href="../../wp/j/Johannes_Kepler.htm" title="Johannes Kepler">Keplerian</a> orbit, and due to the periodic perturbations on that Keplerian orbit by the Sun, by the equatorial bulge of Earth, and by the planets.<p>See the <!--del_lnk--> New Moon page for a detailed explanation of the formula.<p><a id="Folklore" name="Folklore"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Folklore</span></h2>
      <p>Southeast Asian and Western folklore long ago established the Full Moon as the time for werewolves and vampires to awaken, or appear most often. As suggested in the film <b><!--del_lnk--> Wolf</b> (1994; <!--del_lnk--> Jack Nicholson, <!--del_lnk--> Michelle Pfeiffer, <!--del_lnk--> James Spader; Directed by <!--del_lnk--> Mike Nichols) the creators of these myths explained away violence occurring during the middle of each month, when in fact the moon simply adds more light to the evening sky. This allows criminals to act more freely. It also helped assuage the guilt of the masses for not doing more to stop violent crime, and freed people to vilify brutality, while fantasizing and apologizing for it.<p>Full Moons are traditionally associated with temporal <!--del_lnk--> insomnia, <!--del_lnk--> insanity (hence the terms <i>lunacy</i> and <i>lunatic</i>) and various magical phenomena such as <!--del_lnk--> lycanthropy.<p>Psychologists have found that there is no strong evidence for effects on behaviour around Full Moon . They find that studies are not consistent, with some showing a positive effect, while others will show a negative effect. In one instance, the <!--del_lnk--> December 23, <!--del_lnk--> 2000 issue of the <i><!--del_lnk--> British Medical Journal</i> published two studies on dog bite admission to hospitals in <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>. The study of the <!--del_lnk--> Bradford Royal Infirmary found that dog bites were twice as common at Full Moon, while the study of public hospitals in Australia found they were less likely at Full Moon. Psychologists point out that there is a difference between <!--del_lnk--> correlation and <!--del_lnk--> causation. The mere fact that two events happen at the same time doesn&#39;t mean that there is a cause and effect relationship between the two.<p>Many <!--del_lnk--> neopagans hold a monthly ritual called an <!--del_lnk--> Esbat at each Full Moon, while some people practicing traditional Chinese religions prepare their ritual offerings to their ancestors and deities on every Full Moon and New Moon.<p><a id="Calendars" name="Calendars"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Calendars</span></h2>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Hindu Calendars, <a href="../../wp/h/Hebrew_calendar.htm" title="Hebrew calendar">Hebrew calendar</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Islamic calendar, <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan calendar Neopagan calendar, Celtic calendar, and the traditional <!--del_lnk--> Chinese calendar are all based on the phases of the Moon. None of these calendars, however, begin their months with the Full Moon.<p>In the <!--del_lnk--> Chinese calendar, <!--del_lnk--> Jewish Calendar and some <!--del_lnk--> Hindu calendars, the Full Moon is always the middle of a <!--del_lnk--> month. The <!--del_lnk--> Mid-Autumn Festival falls on the Full Moon of the eighth month. The <!--del_lnk--> Lantern Festival falls on the first Full Moon of the year.<p><a id="Full_Moon_names" name="Full_Moon_names"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Full Moon names</span></h2>
      <p>Folklore assigns a special name to each Full Moon, although the rule for determining which name will be assigned to which Moon has changed over time (see article at <!--del_lnk--> blue moon).<p>Modern practice is to assign the traditional names based on the <!--del_lnk--> Gregorian calendar month in which the Full Moon falls. This frequently results in the same name as the older method would, and is far more convenient in practice. The older method of assigning names is based on seasons and quarters of the year.<table class="wikitable">

      <p>Traditionally these names corresponded to the seasons rather than calendar months. So, for instance, the Egg Moon (the Full Moon before <!--del_lnk--> Easter) would always be the first moon after March 21st, and the Lenten Moon would always be the last moon on or before March 21st.<p><a id="The_Blue_moon" name="The_Blue_moon"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Blue moon</span></h2>

      <p>The origin of the folkloric term &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Blue Moon&quot; is complicated, because its meaning has changed over time. Modern practice is to name a Full Moon a <i>blue moon</i> if it is the second of two Full Moons to occur in the same calendar month. The original meaning of <i>blue moon</i> was the third Full Moon in a season when there were four Full Moons in that season.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon&quot;</div>
