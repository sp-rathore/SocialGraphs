      <p>The <b>Ffestiniog Railway</b> (in <!--del_lnk--> Welsh <i>Rheilffordd Ffestiniog</i>) is a <!--del_lnk--> narrow-gauge <!--del_lnk--> heritage railway, located in North West <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a>. It is a major <!--del_lnk--> tourist attraction mainly within the <a href="../../wp/s/Snowdonia_National_Park.htm" title="Snowdonia National Park">Snowdonia National Park</a>.<p>The railway is about 13.5 miles (21.5 km) long and runs from the harbour at <!--del_lnk--> Porthmadog to the <!--del_lnk--> slate mining town of <!--del_lnk--> Blaenau Ffestiniog. The line travels through spectacular mountainous scenery and is single track with passing places. The track gauge is 1&nbsp;ft&nbsp;11<small><sup>1</sup><big>&frasl;</big><sub>2</sub></small>&nbsp;in (597&nbsp;mm). The first part of the line runs along a mile-long embankment called &quot;the Cob&quot;, which is the <!--del_lnk--> dyke of the <!--del_lnk--> Traeth Mawr &quot;<!--del_lnk--> polder&quot;. The Cob was built between 1807 and 1811 by <!--del_lnk--> William Madocks and in addition to its land reclamation function in conjunction with sluice gates at the Britannia bridge, serves also as a roadway (since 1836 this has been at a lower level on the landward side) and a bridge across the Afon Glaslyn. Tolls were charged with a tollgate at <!--del_lnk--> Boston Lodge until 2003, when the rights were purchased by the <!--del_lnk--> National Assembly for Wales. The higher, original, section of the Cob carries, in addition to the railway, a public footpath throughout virtually its entire length. There is no fencing between the footpath and the railway.<p>

      <p>The railway company is properly known as the &quot;Festiniog Railway Company&quot;, and this contemporary anglicised spelling is still the official title of the company as defined by the Act (2 William IV cap.xlviii) that created the railway. It is the oldest surviving railway company in the world, having been founded by the Act of Parliament on <!--del_lnk--> 23 May <!--del_lnk--> 1832 with capital mostly raised in Dublin by <!--del_lnk--> Henry Archer, the company&#39;s first secretary and managing director. Most British railways were amalgamated into four large groups in 1921, and then into <!--del_lnk--> British Railways in 1948, but the Festiniog Railway Company, in common with most narrow gauge railways, remained independent: in 1921 this was due to political influence, whereas in 1947 it was left out of British Railways because it was closed for traffic despite vigorous local lobbying for it to be included.<p><a id="Horse_and_gravity_operation" name="Horse_and_gravity_operation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Horse and gravity operation</span></h3>
      <p>The line was constructed between 1833 and 1836 to transport <!--del_lnk--> slate from the quarries around the inland <!--del_lnk--> town of Blaenau Ffestiniog to the coastal town of Porthmadog, where it was loaded onto <a href="../../wp/s/Ship.htm" title="Ship">ships</a>. The railway was graded so that loaded wagons could be run by gravity downhill all the way from Blaenau Ffestiniog to the port. The empty wagons were hauled back up by horses, which travelled down in special <!--del_lnk--> &#39;dandy&#39; wagons. To achieve this continuous grade (about 1 in 80 for much of the way), the line followed natural contours and employs cuttings and embankments built of slate blocks without mortar. Prior to the completion in 1844 of a long tunnel through a spur in the Moelwyn Mountain, the slate trains were worked over the top via inclines (designed by <a href="../../wp/r/Robert_Stephenson.htm" title="Robert Stephenson">Robert Stephenson</a>) which can still be seen.<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" style="float: right;" width="150">

      <p>Up to six trains daily were operated in each direction, and a printed timetable was published on <!--del_lnk--> September 16, <!--del_lnk--> 1856 by <!--del_lnk--> Charles Easton Spooner who, following his father, served as Manager and Clerk for 30 years. It shows departures from the &quot;Quarry Terminus&quot; (at that time Dinas Junction) at 7:30, 9:28, 11:16, 1:14, 3:12 and 5:10. Trains waited ten minutes at the intermediate stations called &quot;Tunnel&quot;, &quot;Hafod Llyn&quot; and &quot;Rhiw Goch&quot;. The fastest journey time from Quarry Terminus to <!--del_lnk--> Boston Lodge was 1 hour 32 minutes, including three stops. From Boston Lodge the slate wagons were hauled to and from Porthmadog harbour by horses. Up trains took nearly six hours from Boston Lodge to the Quarry Terminus, and each train ran in up to four sections, each hauled by a horse and comprising eight empty slate wagons plus a horse dandy. This timetable gave a maximum annual capacity of 70,000 tons of dressed slate . Two brakesmen travelled on each down train, controlling the speed by the application of brakes as needed. At passing loops trains passed on the right and this continues to be a feature of Ffestiniog Railway operation.<p>There is evidence for tourist passengers being carried as early as 1850, without the blessing of the Board of Trade, but these journeys would also observe the timetable.<p><a id="Steam_and_gravity_operation" name="Steam_and_gravity_operation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Steam and gravity operation</span></h3>
      <p>In October 1863 steam locomotives were introduced, to allow longer slate trains to be run, and this also enabled the official introduction of passenger trains in 1865: the Ffestiniog was the first narrow-gauge railway in Britain to carry passengers. In 1869 the line&#39;s first double <!--del_lnk--> Fairlie <!--del_lnk--> articulated locomotive was introduced, and these double-ended machines have since become one of the most widely recognised features of the railway.<p>Down trains continued to run entirely by gravity, but faster up journeys and longer trains increased line capacity. A new timetable dated October 1863 shows six departures daily from each terminus at two hour intervals, starting at 7:00 am and taking 1 hour 50 minutes including stops (totalling 20 minutes) at Tanygrisiau, Hafod-y-Llyn and Penrhyn. Trains passed only at Hafod-y-Llyn (from 1872 Tan-y-Bwlch). When passenger services started, the practice was for locomotive hauled up trains to consist of passenger carriages, followed by loaded general goods wagons, followed by empty slate wagons. Down trains were run in up to four separate (uncoupled) portions: loaded slate wagons, goods wagons, passenger carriages and finally the locomotive running light. This unusual and labour intensive method of operation was short lived and eventually the passenger and goods portions were combined into a single train headed by the locomotive.<p>The loaded slate trains continued to operate by gravity until the end of passenger services in 1939. Slate trains eventually became very long - trains of less than eighty slate wagons carried two brakesmen, but over eighty wagons (and this became common) required three brakesmen. About one wagon in every six was equipped with a brake, the others were unbraked. Trains continued to pass at Tan-y-Bwlch and to a lesser extent at Minffordd. The Summer timetable for 1900 had nine trains daily in each direction, and trains had been accelerated to one hour from Porthmadog to Duffws including stops at Minffordd, Penrhyn, Tan-y-Bwlch, Dduallt (request), Tanygrisiau, Blaenau (LNWR) and Blaenau (GWR). Speeds in excess of 40 mph were then normal .<p>The original passenger coaches (some of which still survive) were small four wheeled vehicles with a very low centre of gravity. In 1872 the FR introduced the first bogie carriages to operate in Britain. The continuous vacuum brake was installed in 1893. The line was fully signalled with electric telegraph and staff and ticket working. Electric Train Staff instruments were introduced in 1912 and they continue in use to the present day.<p><a id="Decline_of_slate_and_development_of_tourism" name="Decline_of_slate_and_development_of_tourism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Decline of slate and development of tourism</span></h3>
      <p>By the 1920s the demand for slate as a roofing material dropped owing to the advent of newer materials and to the loss of the overseas trade in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>. As a result, the railway suffered a gradual decline in traffic.<p>In 1921 the Aluminium Corporation at Dolgarrog in the Conwy Valley bought for &pound;40,000 a controlling interest in the FR and Henry Jack became Chairman, the FR company&#39;s financial administration moving to Dolgarrog. Jack was also chairman of the new <!--del_lnk--> Welsh Highland Railway and was instrumental in getting government backing for its completion on the understanding that the FR and the WHR would be jointly managed from Porthmadog, with maintenance undertaken at Boston Lodge and with other economies of scale. In 1923, the FR line was joined to the WHR line at a station called &quot;Portmadoc New&quot;. The Welsh Highland line was almost totally dependent on tourism and this proved slow to develop.<p>To gain additional expertise in light railway operation which was being introduced on the FR and WHR to cut operating overheads, Colonel <!--del_lnk--> H. F. Stephens was in 1923 appointed part-time as Engineer to both companies. Stephens became Chairman and Managing Director of both companies in 1924. When the WHR was taken into receivership in 1927, Colonel Stephens was appointed as Receiver for the WHR and financial administration of both companies moved to Tonbridge in Kent. The fortunes of the WHR, despite great efforts, failed to improve and it became bankrupt in 1933. In order to protect their investments, the joint owners of both companies arranged for the WHR to be leased by the FR, but the WHR losses continued and it closed in 1937.<p>The FR continued to operate its slate traffic, a workmen&#39;s train on weekdays throughout the year and a summer tourist passenger service. Ordinary passenger services ceased on the FR on <!--del_lnk--> 15 September <!--del_lnk--> 1939, shortly after the outbreak of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. The workmen&#39;s passenger service ran for the last time on Saturday <!--del_lnk--> 16 September <!--del_lnk--> 1939. Slate trains were from then onwards operated three days each week, but gravity operation was discontinued. Slate traffic ceased on <!--del_lnk--> 1 August <!--del_lnk--> 1946, apart from the section from Duffws to the North Western yard through Blaenau Ffestiniog town centre, which was leased on <!--del_lnk--> 7 October <!--del_lnk--> 1946 to the quarry owners. This provided the railway company, which retained the services of a resident manager at Porthmadog, with a small income throughout the moribund years.<p>The original Act of Parliament, which permitted the building of the line, made no provision for its closure or abandonment. Although the main line had ceased functioning, the company could not dismantle the railway, so the track and infrastructure were left in place. However, without maintenance it soon became overgrown and unusable.<p><a id="Restoration" name="Restoration"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Restoration</span></h3>
      <p>From 1949, various groups of rail enthusiasts attempted to revitalise the railway. Eventually, on <!--del_lnk--> 24 June <!--del_lnk--> 1954 a group of volunteers funded by Alan Pegler purchased the company to run it as a tourist attraction, and gradually restored the line to working order. This was not helped by a decision by the <!--del_lnk--> Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) in 1954 to build the Ffestiniog Pumped Storage Scheme, including the Tan y Grisiau reservoir (Llyn Ystradau), which flooded part of the northern end of the line. The Festiniog Railway Company was able to obtain compensation in 1972, after the second-longest legal battle in British legal history, having taken eighteen years and two months. Two years later, as a result of the case, the <a href="../../wp/p/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">British Parliament</a> passed the Land Occupancy Act 1973.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 18 August <!--del_lnk--> 1954, prior to commencing the restoration, in an inspection, the first of many, Colonel McMullen of the <!--del_lnk--> Ministry of Transport, Railways Inspectorate, accompanied by Alan Pegler, several directors and other supporters walked the line from Blaenau Ffestiniog to Porthmadog. The work of restoration began on <!--del_lnk--> September 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1954 when Morris Jones, the foreman fitter who had last worked for the railway in March 1947, rejoined the staff to complete the rebuilding of the locomotive &#39;Prince&#39; on which he had been engaged when the works closed. He was joined at <!--del_lnk--> Boston Lodge works by two volunteers, Bill Harvey and Allan Garraway . <!--del_lnk--> November 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1954 marked the completion of sixty years service with the FR of Robert Evans (for almost 25 years as Manager) and a special train was run (with difficulty) from Minffordd to Porthmadog to celebrate the occasion and convey Mr Evans, his wife, Alan Pegler (Company Chairman) and guests en route to a clock presentation ceremony . Mr Evans continued in service as Manager until his retirement on <!--del_lnk--> June 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1955 when Allan Garraway was appointed as Manager.<p>The first public passenger train from <!--del_lnk--> Porthmadog to <!--del_lnk--> Boston Lodge ran on <!--del_lnk--> July 23, <!--del_lnk--> 1955. Prince returned to service on <!--del_lnk--> August 3, <!--del_lnk--> 1955 and, following extensive boiler repairs, Taliesin, then the latest of the FR <!--del_lnk--> Fairlie articulated engines, returned to service on <!--del_lnk--> September 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1956. The passenger service was extended to <!--del_lnk--> Minffordd on <!--del_lnk--> May 19, <!--del_lnk--> 1956, to <!--del_lnk--> Penrhyn on <!--del_lnk--> June 5, <!--del_lnk--> 1957 and to <!--del_lnk--> Tan-y-Bwlch on <!--del_lnk--> April 5, <!--del_lnk--> 1958. Increasing traffic was putting severe demands on the track - over seven miles had been reopened in four years. A long period of consolidation, rolling stock restoration and track renewal followed before the extension to <!--del_lnk--> Dduallt on <!--del_lnk--> April 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1968. Extension to Dduallt was celebrated on <!--del_lnk--> May 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1968 by the re-introduction of the <!--del_lnk--> Ffestiniog Railway Letter Service.<p><a id="The_Llyn_Ystradau_Deviation" name="The_Llyn_Ystradau_Deviation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Llyn Ystradau Deviation</span></h3>

      <p>Between 1965 and 1978, the Ffestiniog Railway Deviation, that 2&frac12; mile long diversionary route was constructed between Dduallt and Tanygrisiau in order to avoid the works of Tanygrisiau <!--del_lnk--> hydro-electric power station and its reservoir (Llyn Ystradau). The Deviation (this is the conventional name for such railway works) was built mostly by volunteers. At the southern end is the spectacular Dduallt <!--del_lnk--> spiral formation (unique on a public railway in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>). It was constructed with its bridge entirely by volunteers and gains an initial height rise of 35 feet in order (after a further mile of new volunteer built railway and a new tunnel) to clear the flooded track bed north of the former Moelwyn tunnel, which is plugged near its normally submerged northern end. Parts of the trackless former route can be clearly seen below the new route between Dduallt and the old tunnel.<p>The new 310 yard long tunnel was constructed (between 1975 and 1977) by three Cornish tin mining engineers with a small team of employees. It had to be <!--del_lnk--> blasted through a <a href="../../wp/g/Granite.htm" title="Granite">granite</a> spur of the Moelwyn mountain. The tunnel plant included stone crushing and grading plant to produce track ballast and other aggregates from the spoil for use on the railway. Following completion the new tunnel first had to be lined throughout its length with liquid cement reinforced with steel mesh in a process called &#39;shotcreting&#39;.<p>A <!--del_lnk--> pull and push service officially called <i>The Shuttle</i> and powered by diesel locomotive <i>Moel Hebog</i> with carriage 110 was operated from Dduallt to <b>Gelliwiog</b> from <!--del_lnk--> 26 May <!--del_lnk--> 1975, during two summers, to enable tourists to experience the Deviation route in advance of the opening of the new Moelwyn Tunnel.<p>North of the new tunnel is a long stretch along the west bank of the new reservoir. Full-length passenger trains first ran from Dduallt through the new tunnel to a temporary terminus known as <b>Llyn Ystradau</b> (now dismantled) on <!--del_lnk--> 25 June <!--del_lnk--> 1977. This station was alongside the Tanygrisiau reservoir, but passengers could not leave the station other than by train as it was on Central Electricity Generating Board land without public access.<p>The remaining section included some specialised engineering work at its summit where the new line passes over the power station pipelines. This was followed by two public road crossings with automatic signalling, during a fall in height to rejoin the old route in <!--del_lnk--> Tanygrisiau station, which was reopened on <!--del_lnk--> June 24, <!--del_lnk--> 1978.<p>The largely volunteer group building the Deviation was officially called the <i>Civil Engineering Group</i>, but its members were popularly known as and will always be remembered as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Deviationists</i> that completed an enormous task over 13 years.<p><a id="Project_Blaenau" name="Project_Blaenau"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Project Blaenau</span></h3>

      <p>The completion of the railway through to Tanygrisiau left the FR with just one and a half miles to go to its goal of Blaenau Ffestiniog but the complexities of reconstructing that unique but very derelict urban section of narrow gauge railway took a further four years. As well as 1&frac12; miles of new track and its formation, which was the responsibility of the FR permanent way department and its volunteers, much other work needed to be done. Most of the work, like the deviation itself, was undertaken by volunteers who in many cases assumed full responsibility for the design as well as the execution of discrete projects, each under a volunteer project leader. There were four decrepit footbridges each needing to be demolished and rebuilt to the new FR loading gauge. The primitive railway bridge across the Afon Barlwyd required total replacement but in similar form. Walls and fences throughout had to be repaired or replaced. These and the many other varied tasks formed <b>Project Blaenau</b>.<p>One major task near Tanygrisiau was the responsibility of <!--del_lnk--> Gwynedd County Council, which had at some time after 1955 taken advantage of the absence of trains to demolish what was probably Britain&#39;s lowest road under railway bridge. In early 1980, therefore, they replaced Dolrhedyn bridge and even managed to give it a few inches extra headroom for road vehicles.<p>Civil engineering contractors were employed in conjunction with <!--del_lnk--> British Rail and Gwynedd County Council for the new route with its bridges and roadworks and the new joint station on the former <!--del_lnk--> Great Western Railway station site. British rail commenced using the new station on <!--del_lnk--> March 22, <!--del_lnk--> 1982. Ffestiniog trains returned to Blaenau on Tuesday, <!--del_lnk--> May 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1982, thus marking the 150th Anniversary of Royal Assent to the Festiniog Railway Act of 1832. The new joint station with <!--del_lnk--> British Rail at <!--del_lnk--> Blaenau Ffestiniog was officially opened on <!--del_lnk--> April 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1983 by <!--del_lnk--> George Thomas, Speaker of the <a href="../../wp/b/British_House_of_Commons.htm" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a>, who unveiled a plaque that records his visit.<p>With the major project of track restoration to Blaenau finally complete, attention could be turned to other matters. More <!--del_lnk--> Fairlie locomotives were built or restored, and new carriages were built. At Minffordd a new hostel was built for volunteers, who support the permanent staff by working in every department of the railway. Stations were given new buildings, canopies and platforms, often replacing the previous temporary structures, and improving the image of the railway for the future.<p><a id="Welsh_Highland_Railway" name="Welsh_Highland_Railway"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Welsh Highland Railway</span></h3>
      <p>In 1988 the Festiniog Railway Company was involved in a highly controversial plan to stop the neighbouring Welsh Highland Railway being rebuilt. The plan would have involved the Company buying the original track bed of the Welsh Highland Railway from the old company&#39;s receiver and giving it to Gwynedd County Council, as long as no railway-related developments were allowed on the land. This, and other actions, may have delayed the start of rebuilding of the Welsh Highland Railway, although the alternative plan was dependent on the continued co-operation of Gwynedd council to assure that the track bed was used solely for railway purposes. This was not guaranteed, as pressure from various groups who objected to the rebuilding of the railway was significant.<p>Since 1990 the Festiniog Railway Company has been totally committed to the reopening of the <!--del_lnk--> Welsh Highland Railway. This required protracted legal procedures before the assets of the old company could be transferred and before final consent to rebuild the railway was given. The first section from <!--del_lnk--> Caernarfon to <!--del_lnk--> Dinas was opened and operated by the FR on <!--del_lnk--> October 11, <!--del_lnk--> 1997. This section was not hampered by these extended legal procedures and was built as a Light Railway Order, as it was not part of the original Welsh Highland Railway route and the site of Dinas station had been sold off and thus was not part of the assets of the old WHR company.<p>Restoration to <!--del_lnk--> Waunfawr was completed in 2000 and to <!--del_lnk--> Rhyd Ddu in 2003. Reconstruction of the remaining section through to Porthmadog is in progress from both ends. Track has already reached the Beddgelert Forest and works are in evidence as far south as Bryn-y-felin.<p>The completed Welsh Highland Railway, or <i>Rheilffordd Eryri</i> (its Welsh name), will comprise parts of the former <!--del_lnk--> London and North Western Railway (1867), <!--del_lnk--> North Wales Narrow Gauge Railways (1877-81), <!--del_lnk--> Portmadoc, Beddgelert and South Snowdon Railway and Welsh Highland (1922-3) Railway. In 2009 the Ffestiniog Railway intends to reconnect with the rebuilt Welsh Highland Railway at Harbour Station, linking <!--del_lnk--> Caernarfon to <!--del_lnk--> Porthmadog. The FR will also link with the WHR (Porthmadog) at Pen-y-Mount Station, north of Porthmadog.<p><a id="Tourism_and_heritage" name="Tourism_and_heritage"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Tourism and heritage</span></h2>
      <p>One of the earliest references to tourism is in the LNWR Tourist Guide for 1876, which waxed lyrical about the Ffestiniog Railway, which it illustrated with a drawing of a lady in Welsh national dress (then still in regular local use) travelling on an FR up train (since many empty slate wagons &ndash; with two standing brakesmen &ndash; were attached at the rear) with the caption &quot;On the Ffestiniog Railway&quot;. The guide uses the &quot;double F&quot; spelling throughout. . It was, however, in the inter-war years from 1919 to 1939 that tourism, though always valued, came to acquire a major importance.<p>Since restoration commenced in 1954, tourism has been the only significant source of income. The role of the Ffestiniog Railway in the promotion and fulfilment of tourism and in preserving railway heritage has been recognised many times, and notable mentions have included:<ul>
       <li>1964 Wales Tourist Board certificate for conspicuous service to Welsh tourism .<li>1972 Wales Tourist Board lists the FR as fifth most popular tourist site in Wales, after Caernarfon Castle, the Swallow Falls, the National Museum of Wales at Cardiff and Conwy Castle .<li>1979 The FR was one of only six sites in Wales to receive the British Tourist Authority&rsquo;s Golden Jubilee Award .<li>1987 The FR was the outright winner of the Independent Railway of the Year award .<li>2004 The &quot;Talking Train&quot; was awarded the Heritage Railway Association &#39;interpretation&#39; Award.<!--del_lnk--> </ul>
      <p>Recognition of the railway&rsquo;s importance to tourism and heritage has been increasingly marked by financial assistance given to the company towards capital expenditure. Prior to September 1987, the FR had received &pound;1,273,127 in gifts and grants. Of this: &pound;450,476 was Gifts from the FR Society and FR Trust and other supporters; &pound;379,335 from Wales Tourist Board; &pound;134,320 from EEC Grants and &pound;308,996 from other public sources .<p>Major grants received subsequently have been: In 1989 a grant of &pound;430,000 mainly from The EEC (National Programme of Community Interest for the promoting of tourism in Dyfed, Gwynedd and Powys); in 1995 a grant of &pound;500,000 to promote work in Blaenau Ffestiniog  and in 1998 a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of &pound;375,000 for the constuction of workshops to facilitate the restoration of historic vehicles .<p><a id="Rolling_stock" name="Rolling_stock"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Rolling stock</span></h2>

      <p>Note: A different zero point was formerly used in Porthmadog (see below), and the Deviation between Dduallt and Tanygrisiau added half a mile to the line. Mileages have therefore changed. The old mileage to the Duffws terminus, the original start of the line, was 13 miles 32 chains (21.57 km).<p>At Porthmadog, the original line came via the streets and across the Britannia bridge from the 1836 terminus at the northernmost end of the Welsh Slate Company&rsquo;s Wharf where the FR officially started. This was the datum point for all pre-1954 mileage calculations. The line over the bridge also connected with the Gorseddau and Croesor Tramways and was used by <!--del_lnk--> Welsh Highland Railway passenger trains from from 1923 to 1936. The line over the bridge was last used in 1958.<p><a id="Train_operation_since_1955" name="Train_operation_since_1955"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Train operation since 1955</span></h2>

      <p>As the line was extended, passing loops were brought into operation at Minffordd, Penrhyn and Tan-y-Bwlch. Due to the restrictions to the length of trains that could be passed at Penrhyn, Rhiw Goch was opened on 14 May 1975. Penrhyn loop remained in service for several more years before it was closed. By the end of the 1970s, the passing loops were at Minffordd, Rhiw Goch, Tan-y-Bwlch and Dduallt, and an intensive service was run in the peak summer seasons (although there were empty &quot;slots&quot; in the timetable which could be used by works trains). From the early 1980s, the peak summer timetable had three train sets in operation, generally passing at Rhiw Goch and Dduallt. Automatic signalling was installed at Tan-y-Bwlch in 1986.<p>As of the 1988 season, in part due to the challenges in maintenance of the top end points at Dduallt, and the planned automation of Minffordd, Dduallt and Rhiw Goch were taken out of service for crossing trains. At the end of May 1988, Dduallt ceased to be a token station and Dduallt loop was taken out of service altogether and became a siding. Rhiw Goch ceased to be used except on odd occasions, and was taken out of use as a means to cross passenger trains in 1989. The short section token instruments and the signal heads were removed, although the loop could still be used as a refuge for engineers trains.<p>In the late 1990s Rhiw Goch was recommissioned as a passing loop. From the 2005 season, the box has been regularly manned during the summer to provide additional operational flexibility. In 2006 an appeal was launched, through the FR Society, for funds to replace the life-expired signal box with a building of more traditional appearance. Fundraising has gone well and work is scheduled to be done during the closed season of 2006/7. Preparation work, including pouring extensions to the foundation slab, have been carried out during summer 2006.<p>Elsewhere, Tanygrisiau had been provided with a run-round loop whilst it had been the terminus between June 1978 and May 1982. This loop was removed when the line was re-opened to Blaenau Ffestiniog. In the mid-1990s a project was launched to install a fully signalled passing loop. This proceeded as a volunteer project, including the building of a signal box. However prior to commissioning, the project was abandoned in 2001. However the trackwork (apart for the siding off the Up Loop) remained in situ. In June 2002, the loop was once again used to run-round trains as part of the 2002 Gala to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the restoration of services to Blaenau Ffestiniog. The intended platform starter signals (posts, brackets and arms) have been recovered and are now in use on the Isle of Man Railway. In 2004 with new disc starter signals and spring loaded points installed, Tanygrisiau became a passing loop for the first time.<p><a id="Train_control_and_regulation" name="Train_control_and_regulation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Train control and regulation</span></h3>
      <p>The Ffestiniog Railway operates on the Electronic <!--del_lnk--> Token System (ETS) using a mixture of miniature and large train staffs, under the overall of the Duty Controller based at Porthmadog.<p>Miniature train staffs are provided for:-<ul>
       <li>Porthmadog to Minffordd (Intermediate Instrument at Boston Lodge)<li>Minffordd to Tanybwlch - Long Section (Intermediate Instrument at Rhiw Goch)<li>Tanybwlch to Tanygrisiau (Intermediate Instrument at Dduallt)<li>Tanygrisiau to Blaenau Ffestiniog</ul>
      <p>Large train staffs are provided for:-<ul>
       <li>Minffordd to Rhiw Goch - Short Section<li>Rhiw Goch to Tanybwlch - Short Section</ul>
      <p>The Short Section train staffs are brought into service by opening Rhiw Goch Signalbox, hence trapping the Minffordd to Tanybwlch Long Section Miniature train staff in the lever frame, when the signal box is opened and manned by a signalman.<p>The signalling and ETS equipment is primarily designed for train crew operation. To obtain permission to withdraw a train staff to enter a single line section, Control has to be contacted.<p>The Control Office regulates train running, giving permission for trains to enter the single line sections, recording train movements on the Train Graph, ensuring trains are formed of an appropriate number of carriages (depending on the expected train loadings), acting as the single point of contact in the rare event of a failure occurring with rolling stock, and making station announcements at Porthmadog<p>The Control Office also is responsible for the Train Operation on the <!--del_lnk--> Welsh Highland Railway between Caernarfon and Rhyd Ddu.<p><a id="Images" name="Images"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Images</span></h2>
