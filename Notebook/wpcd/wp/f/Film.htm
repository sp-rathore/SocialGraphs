      <p><b>Film</b> is a term that encompasses motion pictures as individual projects, as well as the field in general. The origin of the name comes from the fact that <!--del_lnk--> photographic film (also called <!--del_lnk--> filmstock) has historically been the primary <!--del_lnk--> medium for recording and displaying motion pictures. Many other terms exist for an individual motion picture, including <i>picture</i>, <i>picture show</i>, <i>photoplay</i>, <i>flick</i>, and most commonly, <i>movie</i>. Additional terms for the field in general include <i>the big screen</i>, <i>the silver screen</i>, <i>the cinema</i>, and <i>the movies</i>.<p>Films are produced by <!--del_lnk--> recording actual people and objects with <!--del_lnk--> cameras, or by creating them using <a href="../../wp/a/Animation.htm" title="Animation">animation</a> techniques and/or <!--del_lnk--> special effects. They comprise a series of individual frames, but when these images are shown rapidly in succession, the illusion of motion is given to the viewer. Flickering between <!--del_lnk--> frames is not seen due to an effect known as <!--del_lnk--> persistence of vision &mdash; whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after the source has been removed. Also of relevance is what causes the perception of motion; a psychological effect identified as <!--del_lnk--> beta movement.<p>Film is considered by many to be an important <a href="../../wp/a/Art.htm" title="Art">art</a> form; films entertain, educate, enlighten and inspire audiences. The visual elements of cinema need no translation, giving the motion picture a universal power of communication. Any film can become a worldwide attraction, especially with the addition of <!--del_lnk--> dubbing or <!--del_lnk--> subtitles that translate the dialogue. Films are also artifacts created by specific cultures, which reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them.<p>

      <p>Mechanisms for producing artificially created, two-dimensional images in motion were demonstrated as early as the 1860s, with devices such as the <!--del_lnk--> zoetrope and the <!--del_lnk--> praxinoscope. These machines were outgrowths of simple optical devices (such as <!--del_lnk--> magic lanterns), and would display sequences of still pictures at sufficient speed for the images on the pictures to appear to be moving, a phenomenon called <!--del_lnk--> persistence of vision. Naturally, the images needed to be carefully designed to achieve the desired effect &mdash; and the underlying principle became the basis for the development of film <a href="../../wp/a/Animation.htm" title="Animation">animation</a>.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>With the development of <!--del_lnk--> celluloid film for still <a href="../../wp/p/Photography.htm" title="Photography">photography</a>, it became possible to directly capture objects in motion in real time. Early versions of the technology sometimes required the viewer to look into a special device to see the pictures. By the 1880s, the development of the <!--del_lnk--> motion picture camera allowed the individual component images to be captured and stored on a single <!--del_lnk--> reel, and led quickly to the development of a <!--del_lnk--> motion picture projector to shine light through the processed and printed film and magnify these &quot;moving picture shows&quot; onto a screen for an entire audience. These reels, so exhibited, came to be known as &quot;motion pictures.&quot; Early motion pictures were static <!--del_lnk--> shots that showed an event or action with no <!--del_lnk--> editing or other cinematic techniques.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Motion pictures were purely <a href="../../wp/v/Visual_arts.htm" title="Visual arts">visual art</a> up to the late 19th century, but these innovative <a href="../../wp/s/Silent_film.htm" title="Silent film">silent films</a> had gained a hold on the public imagination. Around the turn of the twentieth century, films began developing a narrative structure by stringing <!--del_lnk--> scenes together to tell <!--del_lnk--> narratives. The scenes were later broken up into multiple shots of varying sizes and angles. Other techniques such as camera movement were realized as effective ways to portray a story on film. Rather than leave the audience in silence, theatre owners would hire a <a href="../../wp/p/Piano.htm" title="Piano">pianist</a> or <!--del_lnk--> organist or a full <!--del_lnk--> orchestra to play music fitting the mood of the film at any given moment. By the early 1920s, most films came with a prepared list of sheet music for this purpose, with complete <!--del_lnk--> film scores being composed for major productions.<p>The rise of European cinema was interrupted by the breakout of World War I while the film industry in United States flourished with the rise of <!--del_lnk--> Hollywood. However in the 1920s, European filmmakers such as <!--del_lnk--> Sergei Eisenstein and <!--del_lnk--> F. W. Murnau, along with American innovator <!--del_lnk--> D. W. Griffith and the contributions of <!--del_lnk--> Charles Chaplin, <!--del_lnk--> Buster Keaton and others, continued to advance the medium. In the 1920s, new technology allowed filmmakers to attach to each film a <!--del_lnk--> soundtrack of speech, music and <!--del_lnk--> sound effects synchronized with the action on the screen. These <!--del_lnk--> sound films were initially distinguished by calling them &quot;talking pictures&quot;, or <i>talkies</i>.<p>The next major step in the development of cinema was the introduction of <a href="../../wp/c/Color.htm" title="Color">colour</a>. While the addition of <a href="../../wp/s/Sound.htm" title="Sound">sound</a> quickly eclipsed silent film and theater musicians, color was adopted more gradually. The public was relatively indifferent to color photography as opposed to black-and-white. But as colour processes improved and became as affordable as <!--del_lnk--> black-and-white film, more and more movies were filmed in color after the end of World War II, as the industry in America came to view color an essential to attracting audiences in its competition with television, which remained a black-and-white medium until the mid-1960s. By the end of the 1960s, colour had become the norm for film makers.<p>Since the decline of the studio system in the 1960s, the succeeding decades saw changes in the production and style of film. <!--del_lnk--> New Hollywood, <!--del_lnk--> French New Wave and the rise of film school educated, independent filmmakers were all part of the changes the medium experienced in the latter half of the 20th Century. Digital technology has been the driving force in change throughout the 1990s and into the 21st Century.<p><a id="Film_theory" name="Film_theory"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Film theory</span></h2>

      <p>Film theory seeks to develop concise, systematic concepts that apply to the study of film/cinema as <a href="../../wp/a/Art.htm" title="Art">art</a>. Classical film theory provides a structural framework to address classical issues of techniques, <!--del_lnk--> narrativity, <!--del_lnk--> diegesis, cinematic codes, &quot;the image&quot;, <!--del_lnk--> genre, subjectivity, and authorship. More recent analysis has given rise to psychoanalytical film theory, structuralist film theory, feminist film theory and others.<p><a id="Film_criticism" name="Film_criticism"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Film criticism</span></h2>

      <p>Film criticism is the analysis and evaluation of films. In general, these works can be divided into two categories; academic criticism by film scholars, and journalistic film criticism that appears regularly in <a href="../../wp/n/Newspaper.htm" title="Newspaper">newspapers</a> and other media.<p>Film critics working for <a href="../../wp/n/Newspaper.htm" title="Newspaper">newspapers</a>, <!--del_lnk--> magazines, and <!--del_lnk--> broadcast media mainly review new releases. Normally they only see any given film once and have only a day or two to formulate opinions. Despite this, critics have an important impact on films, especially those of certain <!--del_lnk--> genres. Mass marketed <!--del_lnk--> action, <!--del_lnk--> horror, and <!--del_lnk--> comedy films tend not to be greatly affected by a critic&#39;s overall judgment of a film. The plot summary and description of a film that makes up the majority of any film review can still have an important impact on whether people decide to see a film. For prestige films such as most <!--del_lnk--> dramas, the influence of reviews is extremely important. Poor reviews will often doom a film to obscurity and financial loss.<p>The impact of a reviewer on a given film&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> box office performance is a matter of debate. Some claim that <!--del_lnk--> movie marketing is now so intense and well financed that reviewers cannot make an impact against it. However, the cataclysmic failure of some heavily-promoted movies which were harshly reviewed, as well as the unexpected success of critically praised independent movies indicates that extreme critical reactions can have considerable influence. Others note that positive film reviews have been shown to spark interest in little-known films. Conversely, there have been several films in which film companies have so little confidence that they refuse to give reviewers an advanced viewing to avoid widespread panning of the film. However, this usually backfires as reviewers are wise to the tactic and warn the public that the film may not be worth seeing and the films often do poorly as a result.<p>It is argued that journalist film critics should only be known as film reviewers, and true film critics are those who take a more academic approach to films. This line of work is more often known as <!--del_lnk--> film theory or film studies. These film critics attempt to come to understand how film and filming techniques work, and what effect they have on people. Rather than having their works published in newspapers or appear on television, their articles are published in scholarly journals, or sometimes in up-market magazines. They also tend to be affiliated with colleges or universities.<p><a id="Motion_picture_industry" name="Motion_picture_industry"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Motion picture industry</span></h2>

      <p>The making and showing of motion pictures became a source of profit almost as soon as the process was invented. Upon seeing how successful their new invention, and its product, was in their native France, the <!--del_lnk--> Lumi&egrave;res quickly set about touring the Continent to exhibit the first films privately to royalty and publicly to the masses. In each country, they would normally add new, local scenes to their catalogue and, quickly enough, found local entrepreneurs in the various countries of Europe to buy their equipment and photograph, export, import and screen additional product commercially. The <!--del_lnk--> Oberammergau Passion Play of 1898 was the first commercial motion picture ever produced. Other pictures soon followed, and motion pictures became a separate industry that overshadowed the vaudeville world. Dedicated <!--del_lnk--> theaters and companies formed specifically to produce and distribute films, while motion picture actors became major <!--del_lnk--> celebrities and commanded huge fees for their performances. Already by <!--del_lnk--> 1917, <a href="../../wp/c/Charlie_Chaplin.htm" title="Charlie Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a> had a contract that called for an annual salary of one million dollars.<p>In the United States today, much of the film industry is centered around <!--del_lnk--> Hollywood. Other regional centers exist in many parts of the world, and the <!--del_lnk--> Indian film industry (primarily centered around &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Bollywood&quot;) annually produces the largest number of films in the world. Whether the ten thousand-plus features a year produced by the <!--del_lnk--> Valley <!--del_lnk--> porn industry should qualify for this title is the source of some debate. Though the expense involved in making movies has led cinema production to concentrate under the auspices of <!--del_lnk--> movie studios, recent advances in affordable film making equipment have allowed independent film productions to flourish.<p>Profit is a key force in the industry, due to the costly and risky nature of filmmaking; many films have large <!--del_lnk--> cost overruns, a notorious example being Kevin Costner&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Waterworld. Yet many filmmakers strive to create works of lasting social significance. The <!--del_lnk--> Academy Awards (also known as <b>The Oscars</b>) are the most prominent film awards in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, providing recognition each year to films, ostensibly based on their artistic merits. Also, film quickly came to be used in education, in lieu of or in addition to lectures and texts.<p><a id="Stages_of_filmmaking" name="Stages_of_filmmaking"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Stages of filmmaking</span></h2>

      <p>The nature of the film determines the size and type of crew required during filmmaking. Many <!--del_lnk--> Hollywood <!--del_lnk--> adventure films need <!--del_lnk--> computer generated imagery (CGI), created by dozens of <!--del_lnk--> 3D modellers, <a href="../../wp/a/Animation.htm" title="Animation">animators</a>, <!--del_lnk--> rotoscopers and compositors. However, a low-budget, independent film may be made with a skeleton crew, often paid very little. Filmmaking takes place all over the world using different technologies, styles of acting and genre, and is produced in a variety of economic contexts that range from state-sponsored documentary in China to profit-oriented movie making within the American <!--del_lnk--> studio system.<p>A typical Hollywood-style filmmaking <!--del_lnk--> Production cycle comprises five main stages:<ol>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Development<li><!--del_lnk--> Pre-production<li><!--del_lnk--> Production<li><!--del_lnk--> Post-production<li><!--del_lnk--> Distribution</ol>
      <p>This production cycle typically takes three years. The first year is taken up with <i>development</i>. The second year comprises <i>preproduction</i> and <i>production</i>.

      <p>Independent filmmaking often takes place outside of Hollywood, or other major <!--del_lnk--> studio systems. An independent film (or indie film) is a film initially produced without financing or distribution from a <!--del_lnk--> major movie studio. Creative, business, and technological reasons have all contributed to the growth of the indie film scene in the late <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th</a> and early <a href="../../wp/2/21st_century.htm" title="21st century">21st century</a>.<p>Creatively, it was becoming increasingly difficult to get studio backing for experimental films. Experimental elements in theme and style are inhibitors for the big studios.<p>On the business side, the costs of big-budget studio films also leads to conservative choices in cast and crew. The problem is exacerbated by the trend towards co-financing (over two-thirds of the films put out by <!--del_lnk--> Warner Bros. in <!--del_lnk--> 2000 were joint ventures, up from 10% in <!--del_lnk--> 1987). An unproven director is almost never given the opportunity to get his or her big break with the studios unless he or she has significant industry experience in film or television. They also rarely produce films with unknown actors, particularly in lead roles.<p>Until the advent of <!--del_lnk--> digital alternatives, the cost of professional film equipment and stock was also a hurdle to being able to produce, direct, or star in a traditional studio film. The cost of <!--del_lnk--> 35 mm film is outpacing inflation: in <!--del_lnk--> 2002 alone, film negative costs were up 23%, according to <i><!--del_lnk--> Variety</i>. Film requires expensive lighting and <!--del_lnk--> post-production facilities.<p>But the advent of consumer <!--del_lnk--> camcorders in <!--del_lnk--> 1985, and more importantly, the arrival of high-resolution <!--del_lnk--> digital video in the early <!--del_lnk--> 1990s, have lowered the technology barrier to movie production significantly. Both production and post-production costs have been significantly lowered; today, the hardware and software for post-production can be installed in a commodity-based <!--del_lnk--> personal computer. Technologies such as <a href="../../wp/d/DVD.htm" title="DVD">DVDs</a>, <!--del_lnk--> FireWire connections and <!--del_lnk--> non-linear editing system pro-level software like <!--del_lnk--> Adobe Premiere Pro and Apple&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Final Cut Pro, and consumer level software such as Apple&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Final Cut Express and <!--del_lnk--> iMovie make movie-making relatively inexpensive.<p>Since the introduction of <!--del_lnk--> DV technology, the means of production have become more democratized. Filmmakers can conceivably shoot and edit a movie, create and edit the sound and music, and mix the final cut on a home computer. However, while the means of production may be democratized, financing, distribution, and marketing remain difficult to accomplish outside the traditional system. Most independent filmmakers rely on film festivals to get their films noticed and sold for distribution.<p><a id="Animation" name="Animation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Animation</span></h2>
      <dl>

      <p>Animation is the technique in which each frame of a film is produced individually, whether generated as a computer graphic, or by photographing a drawn image, or by repeatedly making small changes to a model unit (see <!--del_lnk--> claymation and <!--del_lnk--> stop motion), and then photographing the result with a special <!--del_lnk--> animation camera. When the frames are strung together and the resulting film is viewed at a speed of 16 or more frames per second, there is an illusion of continuous movement (due to the <!--del_lnk--> persistence of vision). Generating such a film is very labour intensive and tedious, though the development of <!--del_lnk--> computer animation has greatly sped up the process.<p><!--del_lnk--> File formats like <!--del_lnk--> GIF, <!--del_lnk--> QuickTime, <!--del_lnk--> Shockwave and <!--del_lnk--> Flash allow animation to be viewed on a computer or over the Internet.<p>Because animation is very time-consuming and often very expensive to produce, the majority of animation for <a href="../../wp/t/Television.htm" title="Television">TV</a> and movies comes from professional animation studios. However, the field of <!--del_lnk--> independent animation has existed at least since the <!--del_lnk--> 1950s, with animation being produced by independent studios (and sometimes by a single person). Several independent animation producers have gone on to enter the professional animation industry.<p><!--del_lnk--> Limited animation is a way of increasing production and decreasing costs of animation by using &quot;short cuts&quot; in the animation process. This method was pioneered by <!--del_lnk--> UPA and popularized (some say exploited) by <!--del_lnk--> Hanna-Barbera, and adapted by other studios as cartoons moved from <!--del_lnk--> movie theaters to <a href="../../wp/t/Television.htm" title="Television">television</a>.<p>Although most animation studios are now using digital technologies in their productions, there is a specific style of animation that depends on film. Cameraless animation, made famous by moviemakers like <!--del_lnk--> Norman McLaren, <!--del_lnk--> Len Lye and <!--del_lnk--> Stan Brakhage, is painted and drawn directly onto pieces of film, and then run through a projector.<p><a id="Film_venues" name="Film_venues"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Film venues</span></h2>
      <p>When it is initially produced, a film is normally shown to audiences in a <!--del_lnk--> movie theatre or cinema. The first theatre designed exclusively for cinema opened in <!--del_lnk--> Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in <!--del_lnk--> 1905. Thousands of such theaters were built or converted from existing facilities within a few years. In the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, these theaters came to be known as <!--del_lnk--> nickelodeons, because admission typically cost a nickel (five cents).<p>Typically, one film is the featured presentation (or <!--del_lnk--> feature film). There were &quot;double features&quot;; typically, a high quality &quot;A picture&quot; rented by an independent theatre for a lump sum, and a &quot;B picture&quot; of lower quality rented for a percentage of the gross receipts. Today, the bulk of the material shown before the feature film (those in theaters) consists of previews for upcoming movies and paid advertisements (also known as <!--del_lnk--> trailers or &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The Twenty&quot;).<p>Originally, all films were made to be shown in movie theaters. The development of <a href="../../wp/t/Television.htm" title="Television">television</a> has allowed films to be broadcast to larger audiences, usually after the film is no longer being shown in theaters. Recording technology has also enabled consumers to rent or buy copies of films on <!--del_lnk--> VHS or <a href="../../wp/d/DVD.htm" title="DVD">DVD</a> (and the older formats of <!--del_lnk--> laserdisc, <!--del_lnk--> VCD and <!--del_lnk--> SelectaVision &mdash; see also <!--del_lnk--> videodisc), and <a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">Internet</a> <!--del_lnk--> downloads may be available and have started to become revenue sources for the film companies. Some films are now made specifically for these other venues, being released as <!--del_lnk--> made-for-TV movies or <!--del_lnk--> direct-to-video movies. These are often considered to be of inferior quality compared to theatrical releases. And indeed, some films that are rejected by their own studios upon completion are dumped into these markets.<p>The movie theatre pays an average of about 55% of its ticket sales to the <!--del_lnk--> movie studio, as film rental fees. The actual percentage starts with a number higher than that, and decreases as the duration of a film&#39;s showing continues, as an incentive to theaters to keep movies in the theater longer. However, today&#39;s barrage of highly marketed movies ensures that most movies are shown in first-run theaters for less than 8 weeks. There are a few movies every year that defy this rule, often limited-release movies that start in only a few theaters and actually grow their theatre count through good word-of-mouth and reviews. According to a 2000 study by <!--del_lnk--> ABN AMRO, about 26% of Hollywood movie studios&#39; worldwide income came from box office ticket sales; 46% came from <!--del_lnk--> VHS and <a href="../../wp/d/DVD.htm" title="DVD">DVD</a> sales to consumers; and 28% came from television (broadcast, cable, and pay-per-view).<p><a id="Development_of_film_technology" name="Development_of_film_technology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Development of film technology</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Film stock consists of transparent <!--del_lnk--> celluloid, <!--del_lnk--> polyester, or <!--del_lnk--> acetate <!--del_lnk--> base coated with an emulsion containing light-sensitive chemicals. Cellulose nitrate was the first type of film base used to record motion pictures, but due to its flammability was eventually replaced by safer materials. Stock widths and the <!--del_lnk--> film format for images on the reel have had a rich history, though most large commercial films are still shot on (and distributed to theaters) as <!--del_lnk--> 35 mm prints.<p>Originally moving picture film was shot and projected at various speeds using hand-cranked <!--del_lnk--> cameras and <!--del_lnk--> projectors; though 16 frames per second is generally cited as a standard silent speed, research indicates most films were shot between 16-23 fps and projected from 18 fps on up (often reels included instructions on how fast each scene should be shown) <!--del_lnk--> . When sound film was introduced in the late 1920s, a constant speed was required for the sound head. 24 frames per second was chosen because it was the slowest (and thus cheapest) speed which allowed for sufficient sound quality. Improvements since the late <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a> include the mechanization of cameras &mdash; allowing them to record at a consistent speed, quiet camera design &mdash; allowing sound recorded on-set to be usable without requiring large &quot;blimps&quot; to encase the camera, the invention of more sophisticated <!--del_lnk--> filmstocks and <!--del_lnk--> lenses, allowing <!--del_lnk--> directors to film in increasingly dim conditions, and the development of synchronized sound, allowing sound to be recorded at exactly the same speed as its corresponding action. The soundtrack can be recorded separately from shooting the film, but for live-action pictures many parts of the soundtrack are usually recorded simultaneously.<p>As a medium, film is not limited to motion pictures, since the technology developed as the basis for <a href="../../wp/p/Photography.htm" title="Photography">photography</a>. It can be used to present a progressive sequence of still images in the form of a slideshow. Film has also been incorporated into <!--del_lnk--> multimedia presentations, and often has importance as primary historical documentation. However, historic films have problems in terms of preservation and storage, and the motion picture industry is exploring many alternatives. Most movies on cellulose nitrate base have been copied onto modern safety films. Some studios save colour films through the use of <!--del_lnk--> separation masters &mdash; three B&amp;W negatives each exposed through red, green, or blue filters (essentially a reverse of the <!--del_lnk--> Technicolor process). Digital methods have also been used to restore films, although their continued obsolescence cycle makes them (as of 2006) a poor choice for long-term preservation. <!--del_lnk--> Film preservation of decaying film stock is a matter of concern to both film historians and archivists, and to companies interested in preserving their existing products in order to make them available to future generations (and thereby increase revenue). Preservation is generally a higher-concern for nitrate and single-strip color films, due to their high decay rates; black and white films on safety bases and colour films preserved on Technicolor imbibition prints tend to keep up much better, assuming proper handling and storage.<p>Some films in recent decades have been recorded using <!--del_lnk--> analog <a href="../../wp/v/Video.htm" title="Video">video</a> technology similar to that used in television production. Modern <!--del_lnk--> digital video cameras and <!--del_lnk--> digital projectors are gaining ground as well. These approaches are extremely beneficial to moviemakers, especially because footage can be evaluated and edited without waiting for the film stock to be processed. Yet the migration is gradual, and as of 2005 most major motion pictures are still recorded on film.<p><a id="Endurance_of_films" name="Endurance_of_films"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Endurance of films</span></h2>
      <p>Films have been around for more than a century; however this is not long when one considers it in relation to other arts like painting and sculpture. There was a perceived &quot;threat&quot; by television during the early 1950&#39;s, especially when the FCC expanded television during its 1952 TV license expansion. Trade magazines were publishing articles on the &quot;death&#39; of local theatres. Nonetheless, many at present believe that film will be a long enduring art form because motion pictures appeal to diverse human emotions.<p>Apart from societal norms and cultural changes, there are still close resemblances between theatrical plays throughout the ages and films of today. Romantic motion pictures about a girl loving a guy but not being able to be together for some reason, movies about a hero who fights against all odds a more powerful fiendish enemy, comedies about everyday life, etc. all involve plots with common threads that existed in books, plays and other venues.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film&quot;</div>
