      <p>The <b>fauna of Australia</b> consists of a huge variety of unique <a href="../../wp/a/Animal.htm" title="Animal">animals</a>; some 83% of <a href="../../wp/m/Mammal.htm" title="Mammal">mammals</a>, 89% of <a href="../../wp/r/Reptile.htm" title="Reptile">reptiles</a>, 90% of <a href="../../wp/f/Fish.htm" title="Fish">fish</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/Insect.htm" title="Insect">insects</a> and 93% of <!--del_lnk--> amphibians that inhabit the continent are <!--del_lnk--> endemic to <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>. This high level of endemism can be attributed to the continent&#39;s long geographic isolation, <a href="../../wp/p/Plate_tectonics.htm" title="Plate tectonics">tectonic</a> stability, and the effects of an unusual pattern of climate change on the soil and <!--del_lnk--> flora over geological time. A unique feature of Australia&#39;s fauna is the relative scarcity of native <!--del_lnk--> placental <a href="../../wp/m/Mammal.htm" title="Mammal">mammals</a>. Consequently the <!--del_lnk--> marsupials, a group of mammals that raise their young in a <!--del_lnk--> pouch, including the <!--del_lnk--> macropods, <!--del_lnk--> possums and <!--del_lnk--> dasyuromorphs, occupy many of the <!--del_lnk--> ecological niches that elsewhere in the world are filled by placental mammals. Australia is home to two of the five known extant species of <!--del_lnk--> monotremes, and has numerous <!--del_lnk--> venomous species, which include the <a href="../../wp/p/Platypus.htm" title="Platypus">Platypus</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Spider.htm" title="Spider">spiders</a>, <!--del_lnk--> scorpions, <!--del_lnk--> octopus, <!--del_lnk--> jellyfish, <!--del_lnk--> molluscs, <!--del_lnk--> stonefish, and <a href="../../wp/s/Stingray.htm" title="Stingray">stingrays</a>. Uniquely, Australia has more venomous than non-venomous species of <!--del_lnk--> snakes.<p>The settlement of Australia by <!--del_lnk--> Indigenous Australians more than 40,000&nbsp;years ago, and by Europeans from 1788, has had a significant effect on the fauna. Hunting, the introduction of non-native species, and land-management practices involving the modification or destruction of habitats have led to numerous <a href="../../wp/e/Extinction.htm" title="Extinction">extinctions</a>. Some examples include the <!--del_lnk--> Paradise Parrot, <!--del_lnk--> Pig-footed Bandicoot and the <!--del_lnk--> Broad-faced Potoroo. Unsustainable land use continues to threaten the survival of many species. In recognition of the threats to the survival of its fauna, Australia has passed wide-ranging federal and state legislation and established numerous <!--del_lnk--> protected areas. However, many people believe that these measures fail to address the imminent threats to the survival of many species.<p>

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Both <!--del_lnk--> geologic and climatic events helped to make Australia&#39;s fauna unique. Australia was once part of the southern supercontinent <!--del_lnk--> Gondwana, which also included <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Antarctica.htm" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>. Gondwana began to break up 140&nbsp;million years ago (MYA); 50 MYA Australia separated from Antarctica, and was relatively isolated until the collision of the <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Australian Plate with Asia in the <a href="../../wp/m/Miocene.htm" title="Miocene">Miocene</a> era 5.3 MYA. The establishment and <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">evolution</a> of the present-day fauna was apparently shaped by the unique climate and the geology of the continent. As Australia <!--del_lnk--> drifted, it was, to some extent, isolated from the effects of global climate change. The unique fauna that originated in Gondwana, such as the marsupials, survived and <!--del_lnk--> adapted in Australia.<p>After the Miocene, fauna of Asian origin were able to establish themselves in Australia. The <!--del_lnk--> Wallace Line&mdash;the hypothetical line separating the <!--del_lnk--> zoogeographical regions of Asia and Australasia&mdash;marks the <a href="../../wp/p/Plate_tectonics.htm" title="Plate tectonics">tectonic</a> boundary between the <!--del_lnk--> Eurasian and Indo-Australian plates. This continental boundary prevented the formation of land bridges and resulted in a distinct zoological distribution, with limited overlap, of most Asian and Australian fauna, with the exception of birds. Following the emergence of the circumpolar current in the mid-<a href="../../wp/o/Oligocene.htm" title="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> era (some 15 MYA), the Australian climate became increasingly <a href="../../wp/d/Desert.htm" title="Desert">arid</a>, giving rise to a diverse group of arid-specialised organisms, just as the wet tropical and seasonally wet areas gave rise to their own uniquely adapted species.<p><a id="Mammals" name="Mammals"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Mammals</span></h2>
      <p>Australia has a rich mammalian fossil history, as well as a variety of extant mammalian species, dominated by the marsupials. The fossil record shows that <!--del_lnk--> monotremes have been present in Australia since the <!--del_lnk--> Early Cretaceous 145&ndash;99 MYA, and that <!--del_lnk--> marsupials and placental mammals date from the <a href="../../wp/e/Eocene.htm" title="Eocene">Eocene</a> 56&ndash;34 MYA, when modern mammals first appeared in the fossil record. Although marsupials and placental mammals did coexist in Australia in the Eocene, only marsupials have survived to the present. The placental mammals made their reappearance in Australia in the <a href="../../wp/m/Miocene.htm" title="Miocene">Miocene</a> , when Australia moved closer to <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, and <a href="../../wp/b/Bat.htm" title="Bat">bats</a> and <!--del_lnk--> rodents started to appear reliably in the fossil record. The marsupials evolved to fill specific <!--del_lnk--> ecological niches, and in many cases they are physically similar to the placental mammals in <!--del_lnk--> Eurasia and <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a> that occupy similar niches, a phenomenon known as <!--del_lnk--> convergent evolution. For example, the top predator in Australia, the <!--del_lnk--> Tasmanian Tiger, bore a striking resemblance to <!--del_lnk--> canids such as the <a href="../../wp/g/Gray_Wolf.htm" title="Gray Wolf">Gray Wolf</a>; <!--del_lnk--> gliding possums and <!--del_lnk--> flying squirrels have similar adaptations enabling their arboreal lifestyle; and the <!--del_lnk--> Numbat and <!--del_lnk--> anteaters are both digging insectivores.<p><a id="Monotremes_and_marsupials" name="Monotremes_and_marsupials"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Monotremes and marsupials</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Monotremes are mammals with a unique method of reproduction: they lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. Two of the five known living species of monotreme occur in Australia: the <a href="../../wp/p/Platypus.htm" title="Platypus">Platypus</a> and the <a href="../../wp/s/Short-beaked_Echidna.htm" title="Short-beaked Echidna">Short-beaked Echidna</a>. The Platypus &mdash; a venomous, egg-laying, duck-billed, amphibious mammal &mdash; is one of the strangest creatures in the animal kingdom. When a Platypus pelt was first presented by <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Banks to English naturalists in the late 1700s, they were convinced it must be a cleverly created hoax. Another strange monotreme is the Short-beaked Echidna; covered in hairy spikes, with a tubular snout in the place of a mouth, it has a tongue that can move in and out of the snout about 100 times a minute to capture <!--del_lnk--> termites.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Australia is also home to the world&#39;s largest and most diverse selection of <!--del_lnk--> marsupials, mammals with a pouch in which they rear their young. The marsupial <a href="../../wp/c/Carnivore.htm" title="Carnivore">carnivores</a> &mdash; order <!--del_lnk--> Dasyuromorphia &mdash; are represented by two surviving families: the <!--del_lnk--> Dasyuridae with 51 members, and the Myrmecobiidae with the <!--del_lnk--> Numbat as its sole surviving member.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Tasmanian Tiger was the largest Dasyuromorphia and the last living specimen of the family Thylacinidae; however, the last known specimen died in captivity in 1936. The world&#39;s largest surviving carnivorous marsupial is the <a href="../../wp/t/Tasmanian_Devil.htm" title="Tasmanian Devil">Tasmanian Devil</a>; it is the size of a small dog and can hunt, although it is mainly a scavenger. It became extinct on the mainland some 600 years ago, and is now found only in <!--del_lnk--> Tasmania. There are four species of <!--del_lnk--> quoll, or native cat, all of which are threatened species. The remainder of the Dasyuridae are referred to as &#39;marsupial mice&#39;; most weigh less than 100&nbsp;g. There are two species of <!--del_lnk--> Marsupial Mole &mdash; order <!--del_lnk--> Notoryctemorphia &mdash; that inhabit the deserts of <!--del_lnk--> Western Australia. These rare, blind, earless carnivores spend most of their time underground; little is known about them.<div class="thumb tright">

There are seven species in Australia, most of which are endangered. These small creatures share several characteristic physical features: a plump, arch-backed body with a long, delicately tapering snout, large upright ears, long, thin legs, and a thin tail. The evolutionary origin of this group is unclear, but they share characteristics from both carnivorous and herbivorous marsupials.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The marsupial <a href="../../wp/h/Herbivore.htm" title="Herbivore">herbivores</a> are classified in the order <!--del_lnk--> Diprotodontia, and further into the suborders <!--del_lnk--> Vombatiformes, <!--del_lnk--> Phalangeriformes and <!--del_lnk--> Macropodiformes. The Vombatiformes include the <!--del_lnk--> Koala and the three species of <a href="../../wp/w/Wombat.htm" title="Wombat">wombat</a>. One of Australia&#39;s best-known marsupials, the Koala is an arboreal (tree-dwelling) species that feeds on the leaves of some 120 species of <!--del_lnk--> eucalyptus. Wombats, on the other hand, live on the ground and feed on <!--del_lnk--> grasses, <!--del_lnk--> sedges and <!--del_lnk--> roots. Wombats use their rodent-like front teeth and powerful claws to dig extensive burrow systems; they are mainly <!--del_lnk--> crepuscular and <!--del_lnk--> nocturnal.<p>The Phalangeriformes includes <!--del_lnk--> possums and is a diverse group of arboreal marsupials, including six families and 26 species. They vary in size from the <!--del_lnk--> Little Pygmy Possum, weighing just 7&nbsp;g, to the cat-sized <!--del_lnk--> Common Ringtail and <!--del_lnk--> Brushtail possums. The <!--del_lnk--> Sugar and <!--del_lnk--> Squirrel Gliders are common species of gliding possum, found in the eucalyptus forests of eastern Australia, while the <!--del_lnk--> Feathertail Glider is the smallest glider species. The gliding possums have membranes, called &quot;patagiums,&quot; that extend from the fifth finger of their forelimb back to the first toe of their hind foot. These membranes, when outstretched, allow them to glide between trees.<p>The Macropodiformes are divided into three families that are found in all Australian environments except <!--del_lnk--> alpine areas: the Hypsiprymnodontidae, with the <!--del_lnk--> Musky Rat-kangaroo as its only member; the <!--del_lnk--> Potoroidae, with 10 species; and the <!--del_lnk--> Macropodidae which had 53 members in Australia but some species are extinct. The Potoroidae include the bettongs, potaroos and rat-kangaroos, small species that make nests and carry plant material with their tails. The Macropodiae include <a href="../../wp/k/Kangaroo.htm" title="Kangaroo">kangaroos</a>, <a href="../../wp/w/Wallaby.htm" title="Wallaby">wallabies</a> and associated species; size varies widely within this family. Most macropods move in a <!--del_lnk--> bipedal, energy-efficient hopping motion. They have powerfully muscled <!--del_lnk--> tails and large hind legs with long, narrow hind feet. The hind feet have a distinctive arrangement of four toes, while the short front legs have five separate digits. The Musky Rat-kangaroo is the smallest macropod and the only species that is not bipedal, while the male <!--del_lnk--> Red Kangaroo is the largest, reaching a height of about 2&nbsp;m and weighing up to 85&nbsp;kg.<p><a id="Placental_mammals" name="Placental_mammals"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Placental mammals</span></h3>

      <p>Australia has indigenous placental mammals from two orders: the <a href="../../wp/b/Bat.htm" title="Bat">bats</a>, order Chiroptera, represented by six families, and the mice and rats, order <!--del_lnk--> Rodentia, family <!--del_lnk--> Muridae. Bats and rodents are relatively recent arrivals to Australia. Bats probably arrived from Asia, and they are present in the fossil record only from as recently as 15 MYA. Although 7% of the world&#39;s bats species live in Australia, there are only two endemic <!--del_lnk--> genera of bats. Rodents first arrived in Australia 5&ndash;10 MYA and underwent a wide radiation to produce the species collectively known as the &quot;old endemic&quot; rodents. The old endemics are represented by 14 extant genera. About a million years ago, the <!--del_lnk--> rat entered Australia from <!--del_lnk--> New Guinea and evolved into seven species of <i>Rattus</i>, collectively called the &quot;new endemics.&quot;<p>Since human settlement, many <!--del_lnk--> placental mammals have been introduced to Australia and are now <!--del_lnk--> feral. The first was the <a href="../../wp/d/Dingo.htm" title="Dingo">Dingo</a>; fossil evidence suggests that people from the north brought the Dingo to Australia about 5000 years ago. When Europeans settled Australia they intentionally released many species into the wild, including the <!--del_lnk--> Red Fox, <!--del_lnk--> Brown Hare, and the <!--del_lnk--> European Rabbit. Other domestic species have escaped and over time have produced wild populations including the <a href="../../wp/c/Cat.htm" title="Cat">cat</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Fallow Deer, <!--del_lnk--> Red Deer, <!--del_lnk--> Sambar Deer, <!--del_lnk--> Rusa Deer, <!--del_lnk--> Chital, <!--del_lnk--> Hog Deer, <!--del_lnk--> Domestic Horse, <!--del_lnk--> Donkey, <!--del_lnk--> Pig, <a href="../../wp/d/Domestic_goat.htm" title="Domestic goat">Domestic Goat</a>, <a href="../../wp/w/Water_Buffalo.htm" title="Water Buffalo">Water Buffalo</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Blackbuck and the <!--del_lnk--> Dromedary.

      <p>Forty-six marine mammals from the order <!--del_lnk--> Cetacea are found in Australian coastal waters, but since many of these species have a global distribution, some authors do not consider them Australian species. There are nine species of <!--del_lnk--> baleen whale, including the enormous <a href="../../wp/h/Humpback_Whale.htm" title="Humpback Whale">Humpback Whale</a>. There are 37 species of toothed whale, which include all six genera of the family Ziphiidae (<!--del_lnk--> Beaked whales), and 21 species of <!--del_lnk--> oceanic dolphin, including the <!--del_lnk--> Australian Snubfin Dolphin, a species first described in 2005. Some oceanic dolphins, such as the <a href="../../wp/o/Orca.htm" title="Orca">Orca</a>, can be found in all waters around the continent; others, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Irrawaddy Dolphin, are confined to the warm northern waters. The <!--del_lnk--> Dugong (Order <!--del_lnk--> Sirenia) is an endangered marine species that inhabits the waters of northeastern and northwestern Australia, particularly the <!--del_lnk--> Torres Strait. It can grow up to 3&nbsp;m long and weigh as much as 400&nbsp;kg. The dugong is the only herbivorous marine mammal in Australia, feeding on <!--del_lnk--> sea grass in coastal areas. The destruction of sea grass beds is a threat to the survival of this species.<p>Ten species of seals and sea-lions (superfamily <!--del_lnk--> Pinnipedia) live off the southern Australian coast and in Sub-Antarctic Australian territories.<p><a id="Birds" name="Birds"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Birds</span></h2>

      <p>Australia and its territories are home to over 800 species of <a href="../../wp/b/Bird.htm" title="Bird">bird</a>; about 350 of these are endemic to the zoogeographic region that covers Australia, New Guinea and <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>. The fossil record of birds in Australia is patchy; however, there are records of the ancestors of contemporary species as early as the <a href="../../wp/o/Oligocene.htm" title="Oligocene">Late Oligocene</a>. Birds with a Gondwanan history include the flightless <!--del_lnk--> ratites (the <a href="../../wp/e/Emu.htm" title="Emu">Emu</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Southern Cassowary), <!--del_lnk--> megapodes (the <!--del_lnk--> Malleefowl and <!--del_lnk--> Australian Brush-turkey), and a huge group of endemic <!--del_lnk--> parrots, order Psittaciformes. Australian parrots comprise a sixth of the world&rsquo;s parrots, including many <!--del_lnk--> cockatoos and <a href="../../wp/g/Galah.htm" title="Galah">galahs</a>. The <a href="../../wp/k/Kookaburra.htm" title="Kookaburra">Kookaburra</a> is the largest species of the <!--del_lnk--> kingfisher family, known for its call, which sounds uncannily like loud, echoing human laughter.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> passerines of Australia, also known as songbirds or perching birds, include <a href="../../wp/w/Wren.htm" title="Wren">wrens</a>, <!--del_lnk--> robins, the <!--del_lnk--> magpie group, <!--del_lnk--> thornbills, <!--del_lnk--> pardalotes, the huge <!--del_lnk--> honeyeater family, <!--del_lnk--> treecreepers, <!--del_lnk--> lyrebirds, <!--del_lnk--> birds of paradise and <!--del_lnk--> bowerbirds. The <!--del_lnk--> Satin Bowerbird is a fascinating bird that has attracted the interest of evolutionary psychologists: it has a complex courtship ritual in which the male creates a bower filled with blue, shiny items to woo mates.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Relatively recent colonists from <!--del_lnk--> Eurasia are <!--del_lnk--> swallows, <!--del_lnk--> larks, <a href="../../wp/t/Thrush_%2528bird%2529.htm" title="Thrush (bird)">thrushes</a>, <!--del_lnk--> cisticolas, <!--del_lnk--> sunbirds, and some <a href="../../wp/b/Bird_of_prey.htm" title="Bird of prey">raptors</a>, including the large <!--del_lnk--> Wedge-tailed Eagle. A number of bird species have been introduced by humans; some, like the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Goldfinch.htm" title="European Goldfinch">European Goldfinch</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Greenfinch, coexist happily with Australian species, while others, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Common Starling, <!--del_lnk--> European Blackbird, <a href="../../wp/h/House_Sparrow.htm" title="House Sparrow">House Sparrow</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Indian Mynah, are destructive of some native bird species and thus destabilise the native ecosystem.<p>About 200 species of <!--del_lnk--> seabird live on the Australian coast, including many species of migratory seabird. Australia is at the southern end of the East Asian-Australasian flyway for migratory water birds, which extends from <!--del_lnk--> Far-East Russia and <!--del_lnk--> Alaska through <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asia to Australia and <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>. About two million birds travel this route to and from Australia each year. One very common large seabird is the <!--del_lnk--> Australian Pelican, which can be found in most waterways in Australia.

      <p>Australia has four families of native frogs and one introduced <!--del_lnk--> toad, the <!--del_lnk--> Cane Toad. In 1935 the Cane Toad was introduced to Australia in a failed attempt to control pests in <a href="../../wp/s/Sugarcane.htm" title="Sugarcane">sugarcane</a> crops. It has since become a devastating pest, spreading across northern Australia. As well as competing with native insectivores for food, the Cane Toad produces a venom that is toxic to native fauna, as well as to humans. The <!--del_lnk--> Myobatrachidae, or southern frogs, are Australia&#39;s largest group of frogs, with 120 species from 21 genera. A notable member of this group is the colourful and endangered <!--del_lnk--> Corroboree Frog. The <a href="../../wp/t/Tree_frog.htm" title="Tree frog">tree frogs</a>, from family Hylidae, are common in high rainfall areas on the north and east coasts; there are 77 Australian species from three genera. The 18 species from two genera of the <!--del_lnk--> Microhylidae frogs are restricted to the rainforests; the smallest species, the <!--del_lnk--> Scanty Frog, is from this family. There is a single species from the world&#39;s dominant frog group, family <!--del_lnk--> Ranidae &mdash; the <!--del_lnk--> Australian Wood Frog &mdash; which only occurs in the Queensland rainforests. As elsewhere, there has been a precipitous <!--del_lnk--> decline in Australia&#39;s frog populations in recent years. Although the full reasons for the decline are uncertain, it can be at least partly attributed to the fatal amphibian <!--del_lnk--> fungal disease <!--del_lnk--> chytridiomycosis.<div class="thumb tleft">

The Saltwater Crocodile, known colloquially as the &quot;salty,&quot; is the largest living crocodile species; reaching up to 7&nbsp;m and weighing up to 1000&nbsp;kg, they can and do kill humans. They live on the coast and in the freshwater rivers and wetlands of northern Australia, and they are farmed for their meat and leather. Freshwater Crocodiles, found only in Northern Australia, are not considered dangerous to humans.<p>The Australian coast is visited by six species of <!--del_lnk--> sea turtle: the <!--del_lnk--> Flatback, <!--del_lnk--> Green Sea, <!--del_lnk--> Hawksbill, <!--del_lnk--> Olive Ridley, <!--del_lnk--> Loggerhead and the <!--del_lnk--> Leatherback Sea Turtles; all are protected in Australian waters. There are 29 species of Australian freshwater <a href="../../wp/t/Turtle.htm" title="Turtle">turtles</a> from eight genera of family <!--del_lnk--> Chelidae. The <!--del_lnk--> Australasian Pig-Nose Turtle is the only Australian member of that family.

      <p>Australia is the only continent where venomous snakes outnumber their non-venomous cousins. Australian snakes belong to seven families. Of these, the most venomous species, including the <!--del_lnk--> Fierce Snake, <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Brown Snake, <!--del_lnk--> Taipan and <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Tiger Snake are from the family <!--del_lnk--> Elapidae. Of the 200 species of elapid, 86 are found only in Australia. Thirty-three <!--del_lnk--> sea snakes from family Hydrophiidae inhabit Australia&#39;s northern waters; many are extremely venomous. Two species of sea snake from the <!--del_lnk--> Acrochordidae also occur in Australian waters. Australia has only 11 species from the world&#39;s most significant snake family <!--del_lnk--> Colubridae; none are endemic, and they are considered to be relatively recent arrivals from Asia. There are 15 species of <a href="../../wp/b/Boa.htm" title="Boa">boa</a>, and 31 species of insectivorous <!--del_lnk--> blind snake.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>There are more lizards in Australia than anywhere else in the world, with representatives of five families. There are 114 species in 18 genera of <!--del_lnk--> gecko found throughout the Australian continent. The <!--del_lnk--> Pygopodidae is a family of limbless lizards endemic to the Australian region; of the 34 species from eight genera, only one species does not occur in Australia. The <!--del_lnk--> Agamidae or Dragon lizards are represented by 66 species in 13 genera, including the <!--del_lnk--> Thorny Devil, <!--del_lnk--> Bearded Dragon and <!--del_lnk--> Frill-necked Lizard. There are 26 species of <!--del_lnk--> monitor lizard, family Varanidae, in Australia, where they are commonly known as <!--del_lnk--> goannas. The largest Australian monitor is the <!--del_lnk--> Perentie, which can reach up to 2&nbsp;m in length. There are 389 species of <!--del_lnk--> skink from 38 genera, comprising about 50% of the total Australian lizard fauna; this group includes the <!--del_lnk--> blue-tongued lizards.<p><a id="Fish" name="Fish"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Fish</span></h2>

      <p>More than 4400 species of fish inhabit Australia&#39;s waterways; of these, 90% are endemic. However, due to the relative scarcity of freshwater waterways, Australia has only 170 species of freshwater fish. Two families of freshwater fish have ancient origins: the <!--del_lnk--> Arowana or &quot;bony tongues,&quot; and the <!--del_lnk--> Queensland Lungfish. The Queensland Lungfish is the most primitive of the <!--del_lnk--> lungfish, having evolved before Australia separated from <!--del_lnk--> Gondwana. One of the smallest freshwater fish, peculiar to the south-west of <!--del_lnk--> Western Australia, is the <!--del_lnk--> Salamanderfish, which can survive desiccation in the dry season by burrowing into mud. Other families with a potentially Gondwanan origin include the <!--del_lnk--> Retropinnidae, <!--del_lnk--> Galaxiidae, <!--del_lnk--> Aplochitonidae and <!--del_lnk--> Percichthyidae. Apart from the ancient freshwater species, 70% of Australia&#39;s freshwater fish have affinities with tropical Indo-Pacific marine species that have adapted to freshwater. Nevertheless, fossil evidence indicates that many of these freshwater species are still ancient in origin. These species include freshwater <!--del_lnk--> lampreys, <!--del_lnk--> herrings, <!--del_lnk--> catfish, <!--del_lnk--> rainbowfish, and some 50 species of <!--del_lnk--> gudgeon, including the <!--del_lnk--> Sleepy Cod. Native freshwater game fish include the <!--del_lnk--> Barramundi, <!--del_lnk--> Murray Cod, and <!--del_lnk--> Golden Perch. Two species of endangered <!--del_lnk--> freshwater shark are found in the <!--del_lnk--> Northern Territory.<p>A number of exotic freshwater fish species, including <a href="../../wp/b/Brown_trout.htm" title="Brown trout">Brown</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Brook and <!--del_lnk--> Rainbow Trout, <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic and <!--del_lnk--> Chinook Salmon, <!--del_lnk--> Redfin Perch, <!--del_lnk--> Carp and <!--del_lnk--> Mosquitofish, have been introduced to Australian waterways. The Mosquitofish is a particularly aggressive species known for harassing and nipping the fins of other fish. It has been linked to declines and localised extinctions of a number of small native fish species. The introduced trout species have had serious negative impacts on a number of <!--del_lnk--> upland native fish species including <!--del_lnk--> Trout Cod, <!--del_lnk--> Macquarie perch and <i><!--del_lnk--> Galaxias</i> species as well as other upland fauna such as the <!--del_lnk--> Spotted Tree Frog. The Carp is strongly implicated in the dramatic loss in waterweed, decline of small native fish species and permanently elevated levels of turbidity in the <!--del_lnk--> Murray-Darling Basin of southwest Australia.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Most of Australia&#39;s fish species are marine. Groups of interest include the <!--del_lnk--> Moray eels and <!--del_lnk--> squirrelfish, as well as the <!--del_lnk--> pipefish and <!--del_lnk--> seahorses, whose males incubate their partner&#39;s eggs in a specialised pouch. There are 80 species of <!--del_lnk--> grouper in Australian waters, including one of the world&#39;s biggest <!--del_lnk--> bony fish, the <!--del_lnk--> Giant Grouper, which can grow as large as 2.7&nbsp;m and weigh up to 400&nbsp;kg. The <!--del_lnk--> trevally, a group of 50 species of silver schooling fish, and the <!--del_lnk--> snappers are popular species for commercial fishing. The <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Barrier_Reef.htm" title="Great Barrier Reef">Great Barrier Reef</a> supports a huge variety of small- and medium-sized reef fish, including the <!--del_lnk--> damselfish, <!--del_lnk--> butterflyfish, <!--del_lnk--> angelfish, <!--del_lnk--> gobies, <!--del_lnk--> cardinalfish, <!--del_lnk--> wrasse, <!--del_lnk--> triggerfish and <!--del_lnk--> surgeonfish. There are a number of venomous fish, among them several species of <!--del_lnk--> stonefish and <!--del_lnk--> pufferfish and the <!--del_lnk--> Red Lionfish, all of which have toxins that can kill humans. There are 11 venomous species of <a href="../../wp/s/Stingray.htm" title="Stingray">stingray</a>, the largest of which is the <!--del_lnk--> Smooth Stingray. The <a href="../../wp/b/Barracuda.htm" title="Barracuda">barracudas</a> are one of the reef&#39;s largest species.

      <p><a href="../../wp/s/Shark.htm" title="Shark">Sharks</a> inhabit all the coastal waters and estuarine habitats of Australia&rsquo;s coast. There are 166 species, including 30 species of <!--del_lnk--> requiem shark, 32 of <!--del_lnk--> catshark, six of <!--del_lnk--> wobbegong shark, and 40 of <!--del_lnk--> dogfish shark. There are three species from the family <!--del_lnk--> Heterodontidae: the <!--del_lnk--> Port Jackson shark, the <!--del_lnk--> Zebra Horn Shark and the <!--del_lnk--> Crested Horn Shark. In 2004, there were 12 unprovoked shark attacks in Australia, of which two were fatal. Only 3 species of shark pose a significant threat to humans: the <a href="../../wp/b/Bull_shark.htm" title="Bull shark">Bull shark</a>, the <a href="../../wp/t/Tiger_shark.htm" title="Tiger shark">tiger shark</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Great White Shark. Some popular beaches in <!--del_lnk--> Queensland and <!--del_lnk--> New South Wales are protected by <!--del_lnk--> shark netting, a method that has reduced the population of both dangerous and harmless shark species through accidental entanglement. The overfishing of sharks has also significantly reduced shark numbers in Australian waters, and several species are now endangered. A <!--del_lnk--> megamouth shark was found on a <a href="../../wp/p/Perth%252C_Western_Australia.htm" title="Perth, Western Australia">Perth</a> beach in 1988; very little is known about this species, but this discovery may indicate the presence of the species in Australian coastal waters.<p><a id="Invertebrates" name="Invertebrates"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Invertebrates</span></h2>

      <p>Australia has a wide variety of <!--del_lnk--> arachnids, including 135 species of <a href="../../wp/s/Spider.htm" title="Spider">spider</a> that are familiar enough to have common names. There are a number of highly venomous species, including the notorious <!--del_lnk--> Sydney Funnel-web and <!--del_lnk--> red-back spiders, whose bites can be deadly. There are thousands of species of mites and ticks from order <!--del_lnk--> Acarina. Australia also has eight species of <!--del_lnk--> pseudoscorpion and nine <!--del_lnk--> scorpion species.<p>In the subclass <!--del_lnk--> Oligochaeta there are many families of aquatic worms, but only two families of native terrestrial <a href="../../wp/w/Worm.htm" title="Worm">worms</a>: the <!--del_lnk--> Enchytraeidae, and the <!--del_lnk--> Megascolecidae. The latter includes the world&#39;s largest earthworm, the <!--del_lnk--> giant Gippsland earthworm, found only in <!--del_lnk--> Gippsland, <!--del_lnk--> Victoria. On average they reach 80&nbsp;cm in length, but specimens up to 3.7&nbsp;m in length have been found.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The large family <!--del_lnk--> Parastacidae includes 124 species of Australian freshwater crayfish. These include the world&#39;s smallest crayfish, the <!--del_lnk--> swamp crayfish, which does not exceed 30&nbsp;mm in length, and the world&#39;s largest crayfish, the <!--del_lnk--> Tasmanian giant freshwater crayfish, measuring up to 76&nbsp;cm long and weighing 4.5&nbsp;kg. The crayfish genus <i><!--del_lnk--> Cherax</i> includes the <!--del_lnk--> common yabby, in addition to the farmed species <!--del_lnk--> marron and <!--del_lnk--> Queensland red claw. Species from the genus <i><!--del_lnk--> Engaeus</i>, commonly known as the land crayfish, are also found in Australia. <i>Engaeus</i> species are not entirely aquatic, because they spend most of their lives living in burrows. Australia has seven species of freshwater crab from the genus <i><!--del_lnk--> Austrothelphusa</i>. These crabs live burrowed into the banks of waterways and can plug their burrows, surviving through several years of drought. The extremely primitive freshwater <!--del_lnk--> mountain shrimp, found only in Tasmania, are a unique group, resembling species found in the fossil record from 200 MYA.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>A huge variety of marine invertebrates are found in Australian waters, with the <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Barrier_Reef.htm" title="Great Barrier Reef">Great Barrier Reef</a> an important source of this diversity. Families include the <!--del_lnk--> Porifera or sea sponges, the <!--del_lnk--> Cnidaria (includes the <!--del_lnk--> jellyfish, <!--del_lnk--> corals and <!--del_lnk--> sea anemones, <!--del_lnk--> comb jellies), the <!--del_lnk--> Echinodermata (includes the <!--del_lnk--> sea urchins, <!--del_lnk--> starfish, <!--del_lnk--> brittle stars, <!--del_lnk--> sea cucumbers, the <!--del_lnk--> lamp shells) and the Mollusca (includes <!--del_lnk--> snails, <!--del_lnk--> slugs, <!--del_lnk--> limpets, <!--del_lnk--> squid, <!--del_lnk--> octopus, <!--del_lnk--> cockles, <!--del_lnk--> oysters, <!--del_lnk--> clams, and <!--del_lnk--> chitons). Venomous invertebrates include the <!--del_lnk--> box jellyfish, the <!--del_lnk--> blue-ringed octopus, and ten species of <!--del_lnk--> cone snail, which can cause respiratory failure and death in humans. The <!--del_lnk--> Crown-of-Thorns starfish usually inhabits the Reef at low densities. However, under conditions that are not yet well understood, they can reproduce to reach an unsustainable population density when coral is devoured at a rate faster than it can regenerate. This presents a serious reef management issue. Other problematic marine invertebrates include the native species <!--del_lnk--> purple sea-urchin and the <!--del_lnk--> white urchin, which have been able to take over marine habitats and form urchin barrens due to the over harvesting of their natural predators which include <!--del_lnk--> abalone and <!--del_lnk--> rock lobster. Introduced invertebrate pests include the <!--del_lnk--> Asian mussel, <!--del_lnk--> New Zealand green-lipped mussel, <!--del_lnk--> black-striped mussel and the <!--del_lnk--> Northern Pacific seastar, all of which displace native shellfish.<p>There are many unique marine crustaceans in Australian waters. The best-known class, to which all the edible species of crustacean belong, is <!--del_lnk--> Malacostraca. The warm waters of northern Australia are home to many species of <!--del_lnk--> decapod crustaceans, including <!--del_lnk--> crabs, <!--del_lnk--> false crabs, <!--del_lnk--> hermit crabs, <!--del_lnk--> lobsters, <!--del_lnk--> shrimps, and <!--del_lnk--> prawns. The <!--del_lnk--> Peracarids, including the <!--del_lnk--> amphipods and <!--del_lnk--> isopods, are more diverse in the colder waters of southern Australia. Less-well-known marine groups include the classes <!--del_lnk--> Remipedia, <!--del_lnk--> Cephalocarida, <!--del_lnk--> Branchiopoda, <!--del_lnk--> Maxillopoda (which includes the <a href="../../wp/b/Barnacle.htm" title="Barnacle">barnacles</a>, <!--del_lnk--> copepods and <!--del_lnk--> fish lice), and the <!--del_lnk--> Ostracoda. Notable species include the <!--del_lnk--> Tasmanian giant crab, the second largest crab species in the world, found in deep water, and weighing up to 13&nbsp;kg, and the Australian <!--del_lnk--> spiny lobsters, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Western rock lobster, which are distinct from other <!--del_lnk--> lobster species as they do not have claws.<p><a id="Human_impact_and_conservation" name="Human_impact_and_conservation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Human impact and conservation</span></h2>

      <p>For at least 40,000 years, Australia&#39;s fauna played an integral role in the traditional lifestyles of <!--del_lnk--> Indigenous Australians, who exploited many species as a source of food and skins, and for sport and pest control. Vertebrates commonly harvested included macropods, possums, seals, fish and the <!--del_lnk--> Short-tailed Shearwater, most commonly known as the Muttonbird. Invertebrates used as food included insects like the <!--del_lnk--> Bogong moth and larvae collectively called <!--del_lnk--> witchetty grubs and molluscs. The use of <!--del_lnk--> fire-stick farming, in which large swathes of bushland were burnt to facilitate hunting, modified both flora and fauna &mdash; including large herbivores with a specialised diet, such as the flightless birds from the genus <i><!--del_lnk--> Genyornis</i>. The role of hunting and landscape modification by aboriginal people in the extinction of the <!--del_lnk--> Australian megafauna is debated.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The impact of Aborigines on native species populations is widely considered to be less significant than that of the European settlers, whose impact on the landscape has been on a relatively large scale. Since European settlement, direct exploitation of native fauna, habitat destruction and the introduction of exotic predators and competitive herbivores has led to the extinction of some 27 mammal, 23 bird and 4 frog species. Much of Australia&#39;s fauna is protected by legislation; a notable exception is kangaroos, which are prolific and are regularly culled. The federal <i><!--del_lnk--> Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</i> was created to meet Australia&#39;s obligations as a signatory to the 1992 <!--del_lnk--> Convention on Biological Diversity. This act protects all native fauna and provides for the identification and protection of <!--del_lnk--> threatened species. In each state and territory, there is statutory listing of threatened species. At present, 380 animal species are classified as either endangered or threatened under the EPBC Act, and other species are protected under state and territory legislation. More broadly, a complete cataloguing of all the species within Australia has been undertaken, a key step in the conservation of Australian fauna and biodiversity. In 1973, the federal government established the <!--del_lnk--> Australian Biological Resources Study (ABRS), which coordinates research in the taxonomy, identification, classification and distribution of flora and fauna. The ABRS maintains free online databases cataloguing much of the described Australian flora and fauna.<p>Australia is a member of the <!--del_lnk--> International Whaling Commission and is strongly opposed to commercial whaling&mdash;all Cetacean species are protected in Australian waters. Australia is also a signatory to the <a href="../../wp/c/Convention_on_the_International_Trade_in_Endangered_Species_of_Wild_Flora_and_Fauna.htm" title="Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna">CITES</a> agreement and prohibits the export of endangered species. <!--del_lnk--> Protected areas have been created in every state and territory to protect and preserve the country&#39;s unique ecosystems. These protected areas include national parks and other reserves, as well as 64 wetlands registered under the <!--del_lnk--> Ramsar Convention and 16 <a href="../../wp/w/World_Heritage_Site.htm" title="World Heritage Site">World Heritage Sites</a>. As of 2002, 10.8% (774,619.51&nbsp;km&sup2;) of the total land area of Australia is within protected areas. Protected marine zones have been created in many areas to preserve marine biodiversity; as of 2002, these areas cover about 7% (646,000&nbsp;km&sup2;) of Australia&#39;s marine jurisdiction. The <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Barrier_Reef.htm" title="Great Barrier Reef">Great Barrier Reef</a> is managed by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority under specific federal and state legislation. Some of Australia&#39;s fisheries are already overexploited, and quotas have been set for the sustainable harvest of many marine species.<p>The <i>State of the Environment Report, 2001</i>, prepared by independent researchers for the federal government, concluded that the condition of the environment and environmental management in Australia had worsened since the previous report in 1996. Of particular relevance to wildlife conservation, the report indicated that many processes&mdash;such as <a href="../../wp/s/Soil_salination.htm" title="Soil salination">salinity</a>, changing hydrological conditions, land clearing, fragmentation of ecosystems, poor management of the coastal environment, and <!--del_lnk--> invasive species&mdash;pose major problems for protecting Australia&#39;s biodiversity.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fauna_of_Australia&quot;</div>
