      <p>The early history of the Faroe Islands is not very clear. The earliest text which is believed to include a description of the Faroe Islands, was written by an <!--del_lnk--> Irish monk named <!--del_lnk--> Dicuil. Dicuil had met a &quot;man worthy of trust&quot; who related to his master, the abbot Sweeney (Suibhne), how he had landed on the Faroe Islands after having navigated &quot;two days and a summer night in a little vessel of two banks of oars.&quot; Around A.D. 825, Dicuil wrote a book, <i>Liber de Mensura Orbis Terrae</i>, (Measure/description of the sphere of the earth) in which he states:<dl>
       <dd><i>&quot;Many other islands lie in the northerly British Ocean. One reaches them from the northerly <!--del_lnk--> British islands, by sailing directly for two days and two nights with a full sail in a favou&shy;rable wind the whole time.... Most of these islands are small, they are separated by narrow channels, and for nearly a hund&shy;red years hermits lived there, coming from our Scotland (i.e. <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>) by boat. But just as these islands have been uninhabi&shy;ted from the beginning of the world, so now the Norwegian pirates have driven away the monks; but countless sheep and many different species of sea-fowl are to be found there...&quot;</i></dl>
      <p>The physical description of these islands and the travel time described, fits the Faroe Islands, and the name <i>Faeroe</i> is thought to mean <i>Sheep Islands</i>. According to this, the first settlers in the Faroe Islands were <!--del_lnk--> Irish monks, who introduced <!--del_lnk--> sheep and <a href="../../wp/o/Oat.htm" title="Oats">oats</a> to Faroe. Proving this theory, recent <!--del_lnk--> pollen analysis show that <a href="../../wp/o/Oat.htm" title="Oats">oats</a> were grown in the Faroes about the year 650 A.D.<p>Later the <a href="../../wp/v/Viking.htm" title="Vikings">Vikings</a> replaced the <!--del_lnk--> Irish settlers, bringing the <!--del_lnk--> Old Norse language to the islands, which locally evolved into the modern <!--del_lnk--> Faroese language spoken today. Although the settlers were Norwegians, most of them probably didn&#39;t come from <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a>, but rather from the Norwegian settlements in <a href="../../wp/s/Shetland.htm" title="Shetland">Shetland</a>, <a href="../../wp/o/Orkney.htm" title="Orkney">Orkney</a> and around the <a href="../../wp/i/Irish_Sea.htm" title="Irish Sea">Irish Sea</a>, so-called <!--del_lnk--> Norse-Gaels.<br /> The first Norwegian settler in the Faroe Isles mentioned in the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Landnama B&oacute;k&quot; was called <i>Gr&iacute;mr Camban</i>. While his fist name &quot;Gr&iacute;mr&quot; is obvious <!--del_lnk--> Norwegian, his surname &quot;Camb&aacute;n&quot; is <!--del_lnk--> Gaelic. Thus he most likely was a so-called Norse-Gael from the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Isles.htm" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>. These Norse-Gaels had intermarried with the local <!--del_lnk--> Gaelic speaking people in <!--del_lnk--> Britain, a feature that is still visible in the <!--del_lnk--> Faroese genes today, which prove to be mixed Scandinavian-British.<p>The fact that settlers from <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a> also settled in the Faroe Islands is proven by a <!--del_lnk--> rune stone found in the village of <!--del_lnk--> Sandav&aacute;gur on <!--del_lnk--> V&aacute;goy Island. It says: <i>&quot;&THORN;orkil &Oslash;nundsson, austma&eth;r af Hrua landi, bygg&eth;i &thorn;ennan sta&eth; fystr&quot;</i>. I.e. <i>&quot;Thorkil Oenundsson, eastman (Norwegian) from Rogaland, settled first in this place (Sandav&aacute;gur)&quot;.</i><br /> This description &quot;eastman&quot; (from Norway) has to be seen together with the discription &quot;westman&quot; (From Ireland/Scotland) which is to be found in local place-names such as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Vestmanna-havn&quot; i.e. &quot;Irish-mens harbour&quot; in the Faroe Isles, and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Vestmannaeyjar&quot; i.e. &quot;Irish-mens islands&quot; in <a href="../../wp/i/Iceland.htm" title="Iceland">Iceland</a>.<p>According to <!--del_lnk--> F&aelig;reyinga Saga emigrants who left <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a> to escape the tyranny of <!--del_lnk--> Harald I of Norway settled in the islands about the beginning of the <a href="../../wp/9/9th_century.htm" title="9th century">9th century</a>. Early in the <a href="../../wp/1/11th_century.htm" title="11th century">11th century</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Sigmund, whose family had flourished in the southern islands but had been almost exterminated by invaders from the northern islands, escaped to Norway and was sent back to take possession of the islands for <!--del_lnk--> Olaf Tryggvason, king of Norway. He introduced <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> and, though he was subsequently murdered, Norwegian supremacy was upheld. Norwegian control of the islands continued until <!--del_lnk--> 1380, when Norway entered into a union with <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, which gradually evolved into Danish control of the islands. The <!--del_lnk--> reformation reached the Faroes in <!--del_lnk--> 1538. When the union between Denmark and Norway was dissolved as a result of the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Kiel in <!--del_lnk--> 1814, Denmark retained possession of the Faroe Islands.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> monopoly trade over the Faroe Islands was abolished in <!--del_lnk--> 1856. Since then, the country developed towards a modern fishery nation with its own fleet. The national awakening since <!--del_lnk--> 1888 was first based on a struggle for the <!--del_lnk--> Faroese language, and thus more culturally oriented, but after <!--del_lnk--> 1906 was more and more politically oriented after the foundation of the <!--del_lnk--> political parties of the Faroe Islands.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> April 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1940, the Faroes were <!--del_lnk--> invaded and occupied by <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> troops. The move followed the invasion of Denmark by <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and had the objective of strengthening British control of the North Atlantic (see <!--del_lnk--> Second Battle of the Atlantic). In <!--del_lnk--> 1942&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 43 the British <!--del_lnk--> Royal Engineers built the only airport in the Faroes, the <!--del_lnk--> V&aacute;gar Airport. Control of the islands reverted to Denmark following the war, but in <!--del_lnk--> 1948 a home rule regime was implemented granting a high degree of local autonomy. The Faroes declined to join Denmark in entering the European Community (now <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a>) in <!--del_lnk--> 1973. The islands experienced considerable economic difficulties following the collapse of the fishing industry in the early <!--del_lnk--> 1990s, but have since made efforts to diversify the economy. Support for independence has grown and is the objective of the government.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The islands are administratively divided into <!--del_lnk--> 34 municipalities with about <!--del_lnk--> 120 cities and villages.<p>Traditionally, there are also the <!--del_lnk--> 6 s&yacute;slur (<!--del_lnk--> Nor&eth;oyar, <!--del_lnk--> Eysturoy, <!--del_lnk--> Streymoy, <!--del_lnk--> V&aacute;gar, <!--del_lnk--> Sandoy and <!--del_lnk--> Su&eth;uroy). <!--del_lnk--> S&yacute;sla means district and although it is only a police district today, it is still commonly understood as a geographical region. In earlier times, each s&yacute;sla had its own <!--del_lnk--> ting, the so called <i>v&aacute;rting</i> (spring ting).<p>Today, elections are held in the municipalities, on a national level for the <!--del_lnk--> L&oslash;gting, and inside the Kingdom of Denmark for the <!--del_lnk--> Folketing. For the L&oslash;gting elections there are 7 electoral districts, each one comprising a <i>s&yacute;sla</i>, while Streymoy is divided into a northern and southern part (T&oacute;rshavn region).<p>The Government of the Faroes holds the executive power in local government affairs. The Head of the government is called the <!--del_lnk--> L&oslash;gma&eth;ur or <i>Prime Minister</i> in English. Any other member of the cabinet is called a <!--del_lnk--> landsst&yacute;risma&eth;ur.<p><a id="The_Faroes_and_Denmark" name="The_Faroes_and_Denmark"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Faroes and Denmark</span></h3>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Kiel in <!--del_lnk--> 1814 terminated the <!--del_lnk--> Danish-Norwegian union. <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a> came under the rule of the <!--del_lnk--> King of Sweden, but the Faroe Islands, <a href="../../wp/i/Iceland.htm" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/Greenland.htm" title="Greenland">Greenland</a> remained as possessions of <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>. In continuation of this the <!--del_lnk--> L&oslash;gting was abolished (<!--del_lnk--> 1816), and the Faroe Islands were to be governed as a regular <!--del_lnk--> Danish amt, with the <!--del_lnk--> Amtmand as its head of government. In <!--del_lnk--> 1851 the <!--del_lnk--> L&oslash;gting was resurrected, but served mainly as an advisory power until <!--del_lnk--> 1948.<p>At the end of the <!--del_lnk--> Second World War a portion of the population favoured independence from <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, and on <!--del_lnk--> September 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1946 a public election was held on the question of <!--del_lnk--> secession. It is not considered a referendum, as the parliament was not bound to follow the decision of the vote. This was the first time that the Faroese people were asked if they favoured independence or if they wanted to continue as a part of the <!--del_lnk--> Danish Kingdom. The outcome of the vote produced a small majority in favour of <!--del_lnk--> secession, but the coalition in parliament could not reach a resolution on how this election should be interpreted and implemented, and because of these irresolvable differences the coalition fell apart. A parliament election was held just a few months later, in which the political parties who favoured staying in the Danish Kingdom went up in votes and formed a coalition. Based on their growth in votes they chose not to pass the secession. Instead a compromise was made and the <!--del_lnk--> Folketing passed a home-rule law which came into effect in <!--del_lnk--> 1948. The Faroe Islands&#39; status as a <!--del_lnk--> Danish amt was brought to an end with the home-rule law; the Faroe Islands were given a high degree of self-governance, supported by a substantial annual subsidy from <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>.<p>The islanders are about evenly split between those favouring independence and those who prefer to continue as a part of the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Denmark. Within both camps there is, however, a wide range of opinions. Of those who favour independence some are in favour of an immediate unilateral declaration. Others see it as something to be attained gradually and in full consent with the Danish government and the <!--del_lnk--> Danish nation. In the unionist camp there are also many who foresee and welcome a gradual increase in autonomy even as strong ties to Denmark are maintained.<p><a id="The_Faroes_and_the_EU" name="The_Faroes_and_the_EU"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Faroes and the EU</span></h3>
      <p>The Faroe Islands are not part of the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">EU</a>, as explicitly asserted by both <!--del_lnk--> Rome treaties. Moreover, a <!--del_lnk--> protocol to the treaty of accession of Denmark to the European Communities stipulates that Danish nationals residing in the Faroe Islands are not to be considered as Danish nationals within the meaning of the treaties. Hence, Danish people living in the Faroes are not citizens of the European Union (however, other EU nationals living there remain EU citizens). The Faroes are not covered by the <!--del_lnk--> Schengen free movement agreement but there are no border checks when travelling between the Faroes and any Schengen country.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

There are 1,117 kilometres (694&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mi) of coastline, and no land boundaries with any other country. The only island that is uninhabited is <!--del_lnk--> L&iacute;tla D&iacute;mun.<p>The Faroe Islands generally have cool summers and mild winters, with a usually overcast sky and frequent <!--del_lnk--> fog and heavy <a href="../../wp/w/Wind.htm" title="Wind">winds</a>. The fog often causes delays of aeroplanes. The islands are rugged and rocky with some low peaks; the coasts are mostly bordered by cliffs.

      <p>After the severe economic troubles of the early <!--del_lnk--> 1990s, brought on by a drop in the vital <a href="../../wp/f/Fish.htm" title="Fish">fish</a> catch and poor management of the economy, the Faroe Islands have come back in the last few years, with unemployment down to 5% in mid-<!--del_lnk--> 1998. In 2006 unemployment declined to 3%, one of the lowest rates in Europe. Nevertheless, the almost total dependence on fishing means the economy remains extremely vulnerable. The Faroese hope to broaden their economical base by building new fish-processing plants. <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">Petroleum</a> found close to the Faroese area gives hope for deposits in the immediate area, which may lay the basis to sustained economic prosperity.<p>Since <!--del_lnk--> 2000, new <!--del_lnk--> information technology and business projects have been fostered in the Faroe Islands to attract new investment. The result from these projects is not yet known but is hoped to bring a better market economy to the Faroe Islands.<p>The Faroes have one of the lowest unemployment rates in Europe, but this is not necessarily a sign of a recovering economy, as many young students move to Denmark and other countries once they are finished with high school. This leaves a largely middle-aged and elderly population that may lack the skills and knowledge to take IT positions on the Faroes.<p><a id="Transportation" name="Transportation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transportation</span></h2>

Altogether, on the Faroe Islands there are people from 77 different nationalities.<p><!--del_lnk--> Faroese is spoken in the entire country. It is not possible to say exactly how many people speak the Faroese language. This is because of two reasons: Firstly, many ethnic Faroese live in Denmark and few who are born there return to the Faroes with their parents or as adults. Secondly, there are some established Danish families on the Faroes who speak Danish at home.<p>The Faroese language is the smallest of the <!--del_lnk--> Germanic languages.

      <p>If the first inhabitants of the Faroe Islands were Irish monks, then they must have lived as a very small group of settlers. Later, when the Vikings colonised the Islands, there was a considerable increase in the population. However, it never exceeded 5000 until the <!--del_lnk--> 18th Century. Around <!--del_lnk--> 1349 about half of the islands&#39; people died of the plague.<p>Only through the rise of the deep sea fishery (and thus independence from the difficult agriculture) and with general progress in the health service was a rapid population growth possible in the Faroes; beginning in the 18th Century, the population increased tenfold in 200 years.<p>At the beginning of the <!--del_lnk--> 1990s the Faroe Islands entered a heavy economic crisis with heavy, noticeable emigration; however this trend reversed in subsequent years to a net immigration.<table border="1" cellspacing="0">

      <p>The Faroese population is spread across most of the country; and it was not until recent decades that significant <!--del_lnk--> urbanization occurred. Industrialization has been remarkably decentralized and the country has therefore maintained quite a viable rural culture. Nevertheless, villages with poor harbour facilities have been the losers of the development from agriculture to fishing, and in the most peripheral agricultural areas there are scarcely any young people left. This includes areas such as <!--del_lnk--> Fugloy, <!--del_lnk--> Sv&iacute;noy, <!--del_lnk--> Mykines, <!--del_lnk--> Sk&uacute;voy and <!--del_lnk--> D&iacute;mun, which have extremely poor connections to the rest of the country, and cannot always be reached every day, often due to bad weather. In recent decades, the village-based social structure has nevertheless been placed under pressure; instead there has been a rise in &quot;centres&quot; that are able to provide goods in demand in the periphery. This has meant that shops and services are now relocating en masse from the villages into the centres.<p><a id="Religion" name="Religion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h3>

However, a find at a dig site in <!--del_lnk--> Leirv&iacute;k suggests that the Faroes were Christian maybe 150 years before that. The <!--del_lnk--> reformation was completed in the Faroe Islands on <!--del_lnk--> 1 January <!--del_lnk--> 1540. According to official statistics from <!--del_lnk--> 2002, 84.1% of the Faroese population are members of the state church, the <!--del_lnk--> Faroese People&#39;s Church (F&oacute;lkakirkjan), a form of <!--del_lnk--> Lutheranism.

A Nordic competition for architects was held in <!--del_lnk--> 1977, where 158 architects participated.

      <p>Traditional Faroese food is mainly based on meat and <a href="../../wp/p/Potato.htm" title="Potato">potatoes</a> and uses few fresh vegetables. <!--del_lnk--> Mutton is the basis of many meals, and one of the most popular treats is <i><!--del_lnk--> skerpikj&oslash;t</i>, well aged, wind-dried mutton which is quite chewy. The drying shed, known as a <i>hjallur</i>, is a standard feature in many Faroese homes, particularly in the small towns and villages. Other traditional foods are <i>r&aelig;st kj&oslash;t</i> (semi-dried mutton) and <i>r&aelig;stur fiskur</i>, matured fish. Another Faroese specialty is <i>grind og spik</i>, <!--del_lnk--> pilot whale meat and <!--del_lnk--> blubber. Well into the last century meat and blubber from the pilot whale meant food for a long time. Fresh fish also features strongly in the traditional local diet, as do <!--del_lnk--> seabirds, such as <a href="../../wp/p/Puffin.htm" title="Puffin">puffins</a>, and their eggs.<p><a id="The_Faroe_Islands_in_popular_culture" name="The_Faroe_Islands_in_popular_culture"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Faroe Islands in popular culture</span></h3>
