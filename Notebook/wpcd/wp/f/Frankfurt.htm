      <p>Frankfurt has played a central role in the political history of Germany and the German states for centuries. From <!--del_lnk--> 855 to <!--del_lnk--> 1792 Frankfurt was the electoral city for the Emperors of the <a href="../../wp/h/Holy_Roman_Empire.htm" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation</a>. In the <!--del_lnk--> 1848-49 revolutions, it became a sort of revolutionary capital and was the seat of the first democratically elected German parliament, the <!--del_lnk--> Frankfurt Parliament, which met in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Frankfurter Paulskirche</i>, or the St. Paul&#39;s Church.<p>The three pillars of Frankfurt&#39;s economy are finance, transport, and trade fairs. Frankfurt has been Germany&#39;s financial capital for centuries, and it is the home of a number of major banks and brokerages. The <!--del_lnk--> Frankfurt Stock Exchange is Germany&#39;s largest, and one of the world&#39;s most important. Frankfurt houses the <!--del_lnk--> European Central Bank, which sets monetary policy for the <!--del_lnk--> Eurozone economy, and the German <!--del_lnk--> Bundesbank. It also houses a number of major commercial banks, including <!--del_lnk--> Deutsche Bank, <!--del_lnk--> Dresdner Bank, and <!--del_lnk--> Commerzbank.<p>Frankfurt has an excellent transportation infrastructure and a major international airport and European transportation hub, the <!--del_lnk--> Frankfurt International Airport. Frankfurt Airport ranks among the world&#39;s top ten airports and serves 304 flight destinations in 110 countries.Depending whether total passengers or flights are used to measure, it ranks as the second or third busiest in Europe alongside London <!--del_lnk--> Heathrow Airport and Paris&#39; <!--del_lnk--> Charles de Gaulle. Its central location at Europe&#39;s heart and its excellent accessibility by air, rail and road make Frankfurt Airport City especially attractive. In addition, many large trade fairs take place in Frankfurt each year, notably the <!--del_lnk--> Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung (<i>Frankfurt Motor Show</i>) and the <!--del_lnk--> Frankfurt Book Fair, which have far over 100,000 visitors each, but also important special interest fairs like the <i>LinuxWorld Conference &amp; Expo</i> or <i>Musikmesse Frankfurt</i>.<p>Frankfurt is often nicknamed &quot;Bankfurt&quot;, &quot;Mainhattan&quot; (derived from the local <!--del_lnk--> Main River) or &quot;The Big &Auml;ppel&quot; (named for its apple wine industry). It is one of only four <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European</a> cities that have a significant number of high-rise <!--del_lnk--> skyscrapers. With eleven skyscrapers taller than 150 m (492 ft) in 2004, Frankfurt is second behind <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a> (<!--del_lnk--> La D&eacute;fense and <!--del_lnk--> Montparnasse, with twelve skyscrapers taller than 150 m, not counting the <!--del_lnk--> Eiffel Tower), but ahead of <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> (<!--del_lnk--> Canary Wharf and the <!--del_lnk--> City, with eight skyscrapers taller than 150 m) and <a href="../../wp/m/Moscow.htm" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> (seven skyscrapers taller than 150 m). The city of Frankfurt contains the tallest skyscraper in the European Union, the <!--del_lnk--> Commerzbank Tower, which is also the second tallest on the continent (after the <!--del_lnk--> Triumph-Palace building in <a href="../../wp/m/Moscow.htm" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>).<p>Frankfurt is also home to many cultural and educational institutions, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit&auml;t</i>, many museums, most of them lined up along the <!--del_lnk--> Main river on the <i><!--del_lnk--> Museumsufer</i> (museum embankment), and a large botanical garden, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Palmengarten</i>. Frankfurt&#39;s second major university, <!--del_lnk--> Business School of Finance and Management, focuses on finance. The best-known museums are <i>das St&auml;delsche Kunstinstitut und St&auml;dtische Galerie</i>, called <i><!--del_lnk--> St&auml;del</i>, and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Senckenberg Natural History Museum</i>. Others include the <i><!--del_lnk--> Museum for Modern Art</i>, the <!--del_lnk--> Schirn Art Gallery, museums for architecture, movies, communications and the <!--del_lnk--> Jewish Museum<!--del_lnk--> / Museum Judengasse.<p>During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> Frankfurt was heavily bombed and its medieval city centre was destroyed. The city recovered relatively quickly after the war, and its modern shape was formed. Part of the rebuilding process involved creating one of Europe&#39;s most efficient underground transportation systems in the 1970&#39;s. That system includes a subway train system (<!--del_lnk--> S-Bahn) capable of reaching outlying communities as well as the city centre, and a deep subway with smaller coaches (<!--del_lnk--> U-Bahn) also capable of traveling above ground on street rails.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p>In the area of the <i>R&ouml;mer</i>, Roman settlements were established, probably in the first century; some artifacts from that era are found to this day. The city district <i>Bonames</i> has a name probably dating back to Roman times &mdash; it is thought to be derived from <i>bona me(n)sa</i>. <i>Nida</i> (Heddernheim) was also a Roman civitas capital.<p>The name of Frankfurt on the <!--del_lnk--> Main is derived from the <i>Franconofurt</i> of the Germanic tribe of the <a href="../../wp/f/Franks.htm" title="Franks">Franks</a>; <i>Furt</i> (<!--del_lnk--> cf. <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> <i><!--del_lnk--> ford</i>) denotes a low point passage across a stream or river. <!--del_lnk--> Alemanni and Franks lived there and by <!--del_lnk--> 794 <a href="../../wp/c/Charlemagne.htm" title="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> presided over an imperial assembly and church synod, at which <i>Franconofurd</i> (-furt -vurd) is first mentioned. However, since <i>frank</i> is also an old German word for <i>frei</i> (&quot;free&quot;), Frankfurt was a &quot;free ford,&quot; an opportunity to cross the river <!--del_lnk--> Main without paying a toll.<p>In the <a href="../../wp/h/Holy_Roman_Empire.htm" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>, Frankfurt was one of the most important cities. From <!--del_lnk--> 855 the <!--del_lnk--> German kings and emperors were elected in Frankfurt and crowned in <a href="../../wp/a/Aachen.htm" title="Aachen">Aachen</a>. From <!--del_lnk--> 1562 the kings/emperors were also crowned in Frankfurt, <!--del_lnk--> Maximilian II being the first one. This tradition ended in <!--del_lnk--> 1792, when <!--del_lnk--> Franz II was elected. He was crowned, on purpose, on <!--del_lnk--> Bastille Day, <!--del_lnk--> 14 July, the anniversary of the <!--del_lnk--> storming of the Bastille. The elections and coronations took place in St. Bartholom&auml;us cathedral, known as the <i>Kaiserdom</i> (en: Emperor&#39;s Cathedral), or in its predecessors.<p>The <i>Frankfurter Messe</i> (en: Frankfurt trade fair) was first mentioned in 1150. In 1240, <a href="../../wp/f/Frederick_II%252C_Holy_Roman_Emperor.htm" title="Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor">Emperor Friedrich II</a> granted an Imperial privilege to its visitors, meaning they would be protected by the Empire. Since 1478 book trade fairs have been held in Frankfurt, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Frankfurter Buchmesse</i> being still the most important in Germany and, some might say, the world.<p>In 1372 Frankfurt became a <i>Reichsstadt</i> (en:<!--del_lnk--> Imperial city), i.e. directly subordinate to the <!--del_lnk--> Holy Roman Emperor and not to a regional ruler or a local nobleman.<p>Frankfurt managed to remain neutral during the <!--del_lnk--> Thirty Years&#39; War, but it suffered from the <!--del_lnk--> bubonic plague that was brought to the city by refugees. After the end of the war, Frankfurt regained its wealth.<p>In the <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleonic_Wars.htm" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> Frankfurt was occupied or cannonaded several times by French troops. It nevertheless still remainded a free city until the total collapse of the <a href="../../wp/h/Holy_Roman_Empire.htm" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> in 1805/6. In 1806 it become part of the principality of Aschaffenburg under the <i>F&uuml;rstprimas</i> (&#39;<!--del_lnk--> Prince-Primate&#39;, 25 July 1806 &ndash; 19 October 1813: Karl Theodor Anton Maria K&auml;mmerer von Worms, Reichsfreiherr von Dalberg (b. 1744 &ndash; d. 1817), 1803&ndash;1806 <!--del_lnk--> Prince-archbishop of Regensburg). This also meant, that Frankfurt was incorporated into the <!--del_lnk--> confederation of the Rhine. In 1810 Dalberg adopted the title of a Grand Duke of Frankfurt. Napoleon intended to make his adopted son <!--del_lnk--> Eug&egrave;ne de Beauharnais, already <i>prince de Venise</i> (&quot;<!--del_lnk--> prince of Venice&quot;, a newly established primogeniture in Italy) Grand Duke of Frankfurt after Dalberg&#39;s death (since the latter as a Catholic bishop didn&#39;t have legitimate heirs). The Grand Duchy remained a short episode lasting from 1810 to 1813, when military tide turned in favor of the Anglo-Prussian lead allies, which turns over the Napoleonic order of central Europe. Dalberg abdicated in favour of <!--del_lnk--> Eug&egrave;ne de Beauharnais, which of course was only a symbolic action, as the latter effectively never did rule after the ruin of the French armies and Frankfurt being taken by the allies!<p>After Napoleon&#39;s final defeat and abdication, the <!--del_lnk--> Congress of Vienna (1812-1815, redrawing the map of Europe) dissolved the grand-duchy, and Frankfurt entered the newly founded <!--del_lnk--> German Confederation (till 1866) as a free city, becoming the seat of its <i>Bundestag</i>, the confederal parliament where the nominally presiding Habsburg Emperor of Austria was represented by an Austrian &quot;presidential envoy&quot;.<p>After the ill-fated <!--del_lnk--> revolution of 1848, Frankfurt was home to the first <!--del_lnk--> German National Assembly (<i>Nationalversammlung</i>), which resided in St. Paul&#39;s Church (<i>Paulskirche</i>) (see <!--del_lnk--> German Confederation for details) and was opened on <!--del_lnk--> 18 May <!--del_lnk--> 1848. The institution failed in 1849 when the Prussian king declared that he would not accept &quot;a crown from the gutter&quot;. In the year of its existence, the assembly developed a common constitution for a unified Germany, with the Prussian king as its monarch.<p>Frankfurt lost its independence after <!--del_lnk--> Austro-Prussian War as Prussia annexed in <!--del_lnk--> 1866 several smaller states, among them the free city of Frankfurt. The Prussian administration incorporated Frankfurt into its province of <!--del_lnk--> Hesse-Nassau. The formerly independent towns of Bornheim and Bockenheim were incorporated in <!--del_lnk--> 1890.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1914 the citizens of Frankfurt founded the <!--del_lnk--> University of Frankfurt, later called Johann Wolfgang Goethe University. This is the only civic foundation of a university in Germany; today it is one of Germany&#39;s largest universities.<p>After World War I Frankfurt was occupied by French troops as a means of reprisal, because the French found the German side guilty of having violated in some details the clauses of the peace treaty of Versailles concerning the demilitarisation of the Rhineland.<sup title="title"><i>[Quote from source requested on <!--del_lnk--> talk page to verify interpretation of source]</i></sup> In 1924 <!--del_lnk--> Ludwig Landmann became the first <a href="../../wp/j/Judaism.htm" title="Judaism">Jewish</a> Mayor of the city, and led a significant expansion during the following years. However, during the <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi era</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> synagogues of Frankfurt were destroyed.<p>The city of Frankfurt was severely bombed in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. About 5 500 residents were killed during the raids, and the once famous medieval city centre, by that time the largest in Germany, was destroyed. The reconstruction after the war took place in an (often-simple) modern style, thus irrevocably changing the architectural face of Frankfurt. Only very few landmark buildings have been reconstructed historically, albeit in a simplified manner.<p>After the end of the war Frankfurt became a part of the newly founded state of Hesse, consisting of the old Hesse-(Darmstadt) and the Prussian Hesse provinces. Frankfurt was the original choice for the provisional capital of West Germany &mdash; they even went as far as constructing a new parliament building that has never been used for its intended purpose, and is now a TV studio. In the end, <!--del_lnk--> Konrad Adenauer (the first post-war Chancellor) preferred the tiny city of <!--del_lnk--> Bonn, for the most part because it was close to his hometown, but also for another reason; many other prominent politicians opposed the choice of Frankfurt out of concern that Frankfurt, one of the largest German cities, and a former centre of the old German-dominated Holy Roman Empire, would be accepted as a &quot;permanent&quot; capital of Germany, thereby weakening the West German population&#39;s support for reunification and the eventual return of the capital city to <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin.htm" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>.<p><a id="Population" name="Population"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Population</span></h3>
      <p>Frankfurt is a multicultural city. Most immigrants are from Turkey, the former Yugoslavia, or Italy. The Frankfurt Area is also home to the largest Korean community in Europe. 180 different nationalities reside in Frankfurt.<p>For a long time Frankfurt was a Protestant-dominated city. However, during the 19th century an increasing number of Catholics moved to the city. Today a narrow plurality of citizens are Catholic.

      <p>St. Paul&#39;s Church (<i>Paulskirche</i>) is a national historic monument in Germany with great political symbolism, because it was the seat of the first democratically elected Parliament in <!--del_lnk--> 1848.

The attempt failed because the monarchs of Prussia and Austria did not want to lose power, and in <!--del_lnk--> 1849 Prussian troops ended the democratic experiment by force of arms and the parliament was dissolved.

The high number of around 600,000 positions with only 650,000 inhabitants of the city itself is explained by the high number of commuters who work in the city, which raises the per capital GDP of the resident population significantly. Furthermore, it is only on work days and certain Saturdays when shops are open that Frankfurt can claim to have a million inhabitants. On other days, the statistics regarding Frankfurt&#39;s wealth are reduced, in favour of the communities and towns of the so-called <!--del_lnk--> Speckg&uuml;rtel (literally <i>bacon belt</i>), such as <!--del_lnk--> Bad Homburg v.d. H&ouml;he, <!--del_lnk--> K&ouml;nigstein im Taunus, <!--del_lnk--> Kronberg im Taunus and <!--del_lnk--> Bad Soden am Taunus, many of whose inhabitants work in Frankfurt. Frankfurt has the highest concentration of lawyers in Germany, with one lawyer per 99 inhabitants, and also the highest per-capita level of debt in Germany (excepting Germany&#39;s three city-states), because of a set of massive public works projects in the 1980s under <!--del_lnk--> CDU mayors <!--del_lnk--> Walter Wallmann and <!--del_lnk--> Wolfram Br&uuml;ck.<p>Frankfurt also occupies the fifth position on another list ranking major cities according to list ranking major cities according to <!--del_lnk--> quality of life. Despite that, Frankfurt also had, as of <!--del_lnk--> 2003, the highest levels of crime per 100,000 inhabitants in Germany. However, this statistic is a result of the commuter population, for it is calculated based on the 650,000-inhabitant figure, and also includes crimes committed at the airport, such as smuggling. Frankfurt is therefore a very safe city, confirmed by surveys among the inhabitants.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Frankfurt Airport is the single largest place of work in Germany.<p><a id="Electronic_Communication" name="Electronic_Communication"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Electronic Communication</span></h3>
      <p>Frankfurt is also an important location for the internet.
