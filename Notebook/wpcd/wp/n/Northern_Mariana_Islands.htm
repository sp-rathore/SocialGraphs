The volcano on Agrihan is the highest elevation in the islands at 965 meters. About one-fifth of the land is arable, another tenth is permanent pasture. The primary natural resource is fish, which causes conflict with the protection of <!--del_lnk--> endangered species. Past development has created <!--del_lnk--> landfills that must be cleaned up and has caused contamination of groundwater on Saipan, which may contribute to disease.<p><!--del_lnk--> Anatahan Volcano is a small volcanic island located 120 km (80 miles) north of Saipan Island and 320&nbsp;km (200 miles) north of <a href="../../wp/g/Guam.htm" title="Guam">Guam</a>. The island is about 9&nbsp;km (5.6 miles) long and 3&nbsp;km (2 miles) wide. Anatahan began erupting suddenly from its east crater on <!--del_lnk--> May 10, <!--del_lnk--> 2003 at about 5:00&nbsp;p.m. (17:00h). Since then it has continued to alternate between eruptive and calm periods. On April 6, 2005, approximately 50,000 cubic meters of ash and rock were ejected, causing a large, black cloud to drift southward over Saipan and Tinian. Recent eruptions have caused some commercial flights to re-route.<p>The islands have a tropical marine climate moderated by seasonal northeast <!--del_lnk--> trade winds. There is little seasonal temperature variation; the dry season runs from December to June, and the rainy season from July to October can include <!--del_lnk--> typhoons. The <!--del_lnk--> Guinness Book of World Records has cited <!--del_lnk--> Saipan as having the most equable temperature in the world.<!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>The first European in these waters was <a href="../../wp/f/Ferdinand_Magellan.htm" title="Ferdinand Magellan">Ferdinand Magellan</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1521, who landed on nearby <a href="../../wp/g/Guam.htm" title="Guam">Guam</a> and claimed the islands for Spain. After being met offshore and accepting the refreshments offered to them by the native <!--del_lnk--> Chamorros, the latter then in exchange helped themselves to a small boat belonging to Magellan&#39;s fleet. This was a clash of Cultures because in the old Chamorro culture there was little if any private property and to take something that one needed such as a boat to fish with was not a crime and not thievery in their eyes. (The Catholic Church has done much to change this but today some young Chomorros grieving over the cultural heritage that they have lost sometimes try to resurrect inappropriate aspects of their culture in a modern world and have come in conflict with the Law over this on the Islands) Due to this cultural misunderstanding, over half a dozen locals were killed and a village of 40 homes burned before the boat was retrieved, and the archipelago subsequently acquired the ignominious name <i>Islas de los Ladrones</i> (&quot;Islands of the Thieves&quot;). Three days after he had arrived, Magellan fled the archipelago under attack--a portentous beginning to its relationship with the Spanish. The islands were henceforth considered by <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> to be <!--del_lnk--> annexed and therefore under their governance, from the <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>, as part of the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish East Indies. The Spanish built a Royal Palace in Guam for the Govenor of the Islands (it&#39;s remains can still be seen in 2006). Guam was an important stop over from Mexico for galleons carrying Gold and other goods to and the Philippines and to Spain. There are several unfound sunken Spanish galleons off Guam. In <!--del_lnk--> 1668 their name was changed by Padre Diego Luis de Sanvitores to <i>Las Marianas</i> after <!--del_lnk--> Mariana of Austria, widow of Spain&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Philip IV. Nearly all of the islands&#39; native population (90%-95%) died out under Spanish rule, but new settlers, primarily from the Philippines and the <!--del_lnk--> Caroline Islands, were brought in to repopulate them. Despite this, the <!--del_lnk--> Chamorro population did gradually resurge, and Chamorro, <!--del_lnk--> Filipino and <!--del_lnk--> Carolinian language and ethnic differences remain basically distinct in the Marianas to this day.<p>The Marianas came under German contol for a brief period when Spain sold them to Germany, exclusive of Guam. In 1919 the Japanese invaded and occupied these islands and the <a href="../../wp/l/League_of_Nations.htm" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a>, pre-cursor of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>, awarded them to Japan by Mandate. The Japanese used the Islands as a military outpost. They did not treat the native population well.<p>The Japanese captured Guam in World War II and Japanese Government of the Islands moved to Guam. As stated before, the Japanese did not treat the natives and others well who lived there. They were close supporters and allies, in this period of the Nazi Government of Germany, as such they believed themselves to be a superior race---until they found out that Orientals were at the bottom of the inferior race heap of the Nazis. The Japanese tortured and killed for the fun of it residents of Guam and the Northern Marianas. This lead to certain Chamorros giving them information about Chamorros on Guam and counter. The impact of this is that the Chamorros of Guam and Saipan bear a grudges against each other, even after some seventy years, as traitors and as the result both are territories instead of the States that they could be. Many people still hate the Japanese although Japanese tourists are a major contributor to the economy of Saipan and Guam.<p>In 1943; the United States Marines invaded Guam at great cost of lives. From the sea the Japanese fortresses (even today 2006 (they have been preserved) ) are not obvious. The Marines were mowed down as they came in by Japanese Gunfire. The Marines were successful and also took over Saipan and Islands further Northern Islands. The Japanese Commander wrote a letter to Emperor Hirohito apologizing for the lost of the islands and then committed <!--del_lnk--> hara-kiri.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> June 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1944, during World War II, U.S. Marines landed on the islands and eventually won the bitterly fought three-week <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Saipan. That would have been the end of War in the Marianas except that Guam and Saipan provided the take off point for the bombing of Hiroshima. When the Armistice was signed the War was over---well for most people. In 1990, a Japanese Soldier apparently did not get the message and had been hiding out in Guam since WWII. He was the last soldier on active military duty of WWII left in the Islands and his family thought that he had been killed in action.<p>After Japan&#39;s defeat, the islands were administered by the United States as part of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> <!--del_lnk--> Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands; thus, defense and foreign affairs are the responsibility of the U.S. The people of the Northern Mariana Islands decided in the <!--del_lnk--> 1970s not to seek independence, but instead to forge closer links with the U.S. Negotiations for territorial status began in <!--del_lnk--> 1972. A covenant to establish a commonwealth in political union with the U.S. was approved in <!--del_lnk--> 1975. A new government and constitution went into effect in <!--del_lnk--> 1978.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>

      <p>Politics of the Northern Mariana Islands takes place in a framework of a <!--del_lnk--> presidential <!--del_lnk--> representative democratic system, whereby the <!--del_lnk--> Governor is <!--del_lnk--> head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system. The Northern Mariana Islands are a commonwealth in political union with the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. Federal funds to the Commonwealth are administered by the Office of Insular Affairs of the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Department of the Interior. <!--del_lnk--> Executive power is exercised by the government. <!--del_lnk--> Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of parliament. The <!--del_lnk--> Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.<p>The Northern Mariana Islands have also come into the news recently due to their connection to the <!--del_lnk--> scandals involving <!--del_lnk--> Jack Abramoff and allegedly former House <!--del_lnk--> Majority Leader <!--del_lnk--> Tom DeLay <!--del_lnk--> . As a direct result of lobbying by Abramoff and associates, the Northern Mariana Islands received special federal subsidies. <!--del_lnk-->  As well, <!--del_lnk--> Congressman Bob Ney allegedly received free trips to the Northern Mariana Islands from Abramoff, in violation of federal law. <!--del_lnk--> <p>The Northern Marianas Islands are also the site of another controversy involving Rep. <!--del_lnk--> John Doolittle (R-CA), <!--del_lnk--> Jack Abramoff, and Rep. <!--del_lnk--> Richard Pombo (R-CA) and the alleged links to the Saipan Garment Manufacturers Association and the Northern Mariana Islands, role in stopping legislation aimed at cracking down on sweatshops and sex shops&rdquo; on the islands in 2001.<p>The Northern Marianas Islands allegedly harbour the most abusive labor practices of anywhere in the United States. According to the progressive think tank American Progress Action Fund, &quot;Human &#39;brokers&#39; bring thousands there to work as sex slaves and in cramped sweatshop garment factories where clothes (complete with &#39;Made in U.S.A.&#39; tag) have been produced for all the major brands.&quot;<p><a id="Political_status" name="Political_status"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Political status</span></h2>
      <p>In 1947, the Northern Mariana Islands became part of the post-World War II United Nations <!--del_lnk--> Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI). The United States became the TTPI&#39;s administering authority under the terms of a trusteeship agreement. In 1976, Congress approved the mutually negotiated Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) in Political Union with the United States. The CNMI Government adopted its own constitution in 1977, and the constitutional government took office in January 1978. The Covenant was fully implemented on November 3, 1986, pursuant to Presidential Proclamation no. 5564, which conferred United States citizenship on legally qualified CNMI residents.<p>On December 22, 1990, the Security Council of the United Nations terminated the TTPI as it applied to the CNMI and five other [the <a href="../../wp/m/Marshall_Islands.htm" title="Marshall Islands">Marshall Islands</a> and the Federated States of <!--del_lnk--> Micronesia (Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei and Yap)] of the TTPI&#39;s original seven districts.<p>Under the Covenant, in general, Federal law applies to CNMI. However, the CNMI is outside the customs territory of the United States and, although the internal revenue code does apply in the form of a local income tax, the income tax system is largely locally determined. According to the Covenant, the federal minimum wage and federal immigration laws &quot;will not apply to the Northern Mariana Islands except in the manner and to the extent made applicable to them by the Congress by law after termination of the Trusteeship Agreement&quot; <!--del_lnk--> <p>On <!--del_lnk--> September 23, <!--del_lnk--> 2004, Congressman <!--del_lnk--> Richard Pombo of <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a> introduced H.R. 5135 - the <i>Northern Mariana Islands Delegate Act</i>. The bill, had it become law, would have allowed CNMI to elect a non-voting delegate to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_House_of_Representatives.htm" title="United States House of Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> starting with the <!--del_lnk--> 2006 election. The bill died at the end of the 108th Congress. But, on <!--del_lnk--> February 18, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, the <i>Delegate Act</i> was reintroduced by Pombo with a new number, H.R. 873. <!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>

      <p>The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands benefits from substantial subsidies and development assistance from the federal government of the United States. The economy also relies heavily on <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">tourism</a>, especially, from <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>, and the rapidly dwindling <!--del_lnk--> garment <a href="../../wp/m/Manufacturing.htm" title="Manufacturing">manufacturing</a> sector. The tourism industry is also dwindling. Since late 2006, tourist arrivals fell 15.23 percent (73,000 potential visitors) from the eleven months prior.<!--del_lnk--> <p>The Northern Mariana Islands has successfully used its position as a free trade area with the U.S., while at the same time not being subject to the same <!--del_lnk--> labor laws. For example, the $3.05 per hour minimum wage in the Commonwealth is lower than in the U.S. and some other worker protections are weaker leading to lower production costs. This allows garments to be labelled &quot;Made in USA&quot; without having to comply with all U.S. labor laws.<p>In the extreme, the island&#39;s exemption from U.S. labor laws have led to many alleged exploitations including recent claims of the existence of sweatshops, child labor, child prostitution and even forced abortions.<!--del_lnk--> <p>A separate immigration system outside of federal U.S. control has resulted in a large number of Chinese migrant workers employed in the Islands&#39; garment trade. However, the lifting of <!--del_lnk--> World Trade Organisation restrictions on Chinese imports to the US has put the Commonwealth-based trade under severe pressure, leading to a number of recent factory closures.<p>Agricultural production, primarily of <!--del_lnk--> tapioca, <a href="../../wp/c/Cattle.htm" title="Cattle">cattle</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Coconut.htm" title="Coconuts">coconuts</a>, <!--del_lnk--> breadfruit, <!--del_lnk--> tomatoes, and <!--del_lnk--> melons exists, but is of relatively minor economic importance.<p><a id="Exemptions_from_some_Federal_regulations" name="Exemptions_from_some_Federal_regulations"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Exemptions from some Federal regulations</span></h3>
      <p>Although the CNMI is part of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, several <!--del_lnk--> GOP members of Congress have fought hard to keep regulation out of the CNMI, preserving it as a more pure form of capitalism, without labor regulation. In 1998, Republican Congressman Tom Delay called the CNMI a &quot;perfect Petri dish of capitalism.&quot; And two years later, in addressing the Governor of the Islands, Delay famously said:<blockquote>

      <p>However, the lack of labor regulation is not without controversy. The inapplicability of Federal labor regulations has resulted in some extreme labor practices, not common elsewhere in the United States. Some of these labor practices include forcing workers to have abortions, as exposed in the March 18, <!--del_lnk--> 1998 episode of <!--del_lnk--> ABC News&#39; <!--del_lnk--> 20/20, and enslaving women and forcing them into prostitution, as the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Department of Justice conviction of several CNMI traffickers in <!--del_lnk--> 1999 attests. In <!--del_lnk--> 2005-<!--del_lnk--> 2006, the issue of these regulatory exemptions in the CNMI was brought up during the <!--del_lnk--> American political scandals of <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_House_of_Representatives.htm" title="United States House of Representatives">Congressman</a> <!--del_lnk--> Tom DeLay and <!--del_lnk--> lobbyist <!--del_lnk--> Jack Abramoff.<p><a id="Transportation" name="Transportation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transportation</span></h2>
