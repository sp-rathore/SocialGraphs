      <p><i><b>Newsround</b></i> (originally called <i><b>John Craven&#39;s Newsround</b></i>, before the departure of Craven) is a <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a> children&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> news programme, which has run continuously since <!--del_lnk--> 4 April <!--del_lnk--> 1972, and was the world&#39;s first television news magazine aimed specifically at children.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">History</span></h3>
      <p>Originally called <i><b>John Craven&#39;s Newsround</b></i>, it was mostly presented by <!--del_lnk--> John Craven between <!--del_lnk--> 4 April <!--del_lnk--> 1972 and <!--del_lnk--> 22 June <!--del_lnk--> 1989, though presenters including <!--del_lnk--> Roger Finn and <!--del_lnk--> Helen Rollason also presented during the 1980s.<p>On Craven&#39;s departure, the show was renamed <i><b>Newsround</b></i>, and its presenters who regularly rotate have included <!--del_lnk--> Juliet Morris, <!--del_lnk--> Krishnan Guru-Murthy, <!--del_lnk--> Julie Etchingham, <!--del_lnk--> Chris Rogers, <!--del_lnk--> Kate Sanderson, <!--del_lnk--> Matthew Price, and <!--del_lnk--> Becky Jago. Regular reporters on the programme, who have also presented it, include <!--del_lnk--> Paul McDowell, <!--del_lnk--> Paul Welsh and <!--del_lnk--> Terry Baddoo. For over 25 years, it was usually broadcast on <!--del_lnk--> BBC One at 5 p.m.<p><i>Newsround</i> was the first BBC television programme to break the news of the loss of the Space Shuttle <i><a href="../../wp/s/Space_Shuttle_Challenger.htm" title="Space Shuttle Challenger">Challenger</a></i> on <!--del_lnk--> 28 January <!--del_lnk--> 1986. As the event was shown during the opening titles, it is often erroneously stated that the tragedy happened live on air, but it in fact happened about fifteen minutes earlier. This edition was presented by Roger Finn, who had only recently joined the programme.<p><a id="Current_format_and_presenters" name="Current_format_and_presenters"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Current format and presenters</span></h2>
      <p>The Newsround edition broadcast at 5:25 pm on CBBC One has <!--del_lnk--> Ellie Crisell as its main anchor, with <!--del_lnk--> Lizo Mzimba taking Ellie&#39;s main role when she is absent. All of the presenters make reports. On the CBBC Channel, the Newsround bulletins are read by <!--del_lnk--> Sonali Gudka and <!--del_lnk--> Gavin Ramjaun. The other reporters are <!--del_lnk--> Laura Jones and <!--del_lnk--> Adam Fleming. <!--del_lnk--> Lizzie Greenwood is a reporter for Sportsround, Newsround&#39;s sister show.<p>Newsround&#39;s editor is Tim Levell with deputy editor Sinead Rocks. The main TV producer is Paul Arnold. The main online producer is Clare Youell.<p><a id="Newsround_Extra" name="Newsround_Extra"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Newsround Extra</span></h3>
      <p>A variation on the regular format of <i>Newsround</i> is a series of short (typically ten-minute) documentary films broadcast under the title <i>Newsround Extra</i>, which have been a regular feature since the late 1970s. There are two or three series of these documentaries during the year, which replace the regular bulletins on one day of the week (usually Monday, although sometimes on Fridays, particularly during the 1980s).<div class="thumb tright">
      </div>
      <p>There was a Newsround Extra on <!--del_lnk--> 1 December <!--del_lnk--> 2006 called <i>The Wrong <!--del_lnk--> Trainers</i> a rather dark film consisting of six short animations dealing with <!--del_lnk--> child poverty and related issues. In one of the presentations Chris says the Government is not spending money as wisely as they should be. Afterwards, there was a linked <!--del_lnk--> BBCi special following up the issues. Newsround - The Wrong Trainers won the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Television Society Award for best children&#39;s programme 2006.<p><a id="Newsround_Showbiz" name="Newsround_Showbiz"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Newsround Showbiz</span></h3>
      <p>Originally called <i>Newsround Lite</i>, <i>Newsround Showbiz</i> ran from 2003 to 2005 and was a weekly round-up of showbiz news. It was aired every Saturday and Sunday at 3.50pm on the CBBC Channel, and was hosted by Lizzie, Adam, Rachel or Thalia who were regular <i>Newsround</i> presenters. The show lasted for ten minutes and contained celebrity news and gossip.<p><a id="Newsround_Investigates" name="Newsround_Investigates"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Newsround Investigates</span></h3>
      <p><i>Newsround Investigates</i> is a special half-hour documentary series for CBBC, taking an in-depth look at issues affecting children&rsquo;s lives. The first edition on <!--del_lnk--> May 8, <!--del_lnk--> 2006 investigated the subject of arson in schools.<p><a id="Sportsround" name="Sportsround"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Sportsround</span></h3>
      <p>In September 2005, a new spin-off of <i>Newsround</i> was launched, entitled <i><!--del_lnk--> Sportsround</i>. It contains reoprts from major sporting events and local sport competitions. The show is presented by <!--del_lnk--> Jake Humphrey.<p><a id="Newsround_on_the_web" name="Newsround_on_the_web"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Newsround on the web</span></h3>
      <div class="thumb tright">
      </div>
      <p>Newsround has its own <!--del_lnk--> website as part of the main <!--del_lnk--> CBBC web site, featuring:<ul>
       <li>The latest news headlines, grouped into the relevant sections (e.g. World, UK, Sci-Tech, etc.)<li>An <a href="../../wp/r/RSS_%2528file_format%2529.htm" title="RSS (file format)">RSS</a> feed for each of the sections (e.g. an RSS feed for World news, UK news, etc.)<li>A games section, with many <!--del_lnk--> Flash games.<li>Message boards for different topics (e.g. Current News, Doctor Who, etc.)<li>A voting section, where users can vote on different popular topics such as favourite film, etc.<li>Quizzes.<li>Competitions.<li>Presenter blogs.</ul>
      <p>In February, an online video <!--del_lnk--> podcast was released called <i>And Finally</i> . This is a summary of the entire week&#39;s news, and a new edition is released every Thursday. There is also a podcast for <!--del_lnk--> Sportsround called <i>Action Replay</i>. This can either be downloaded as an <!--del_lnk--> MPEG-4 Part 14 file or as a podcast which includes both <i>And Finally</i> and <i>Action Replay</i>.<p><a id="Newsround_Quiz" name="Newsround_Quiz"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Newsround Quiz</span></h3>
      <p>From <!--del_lnk--> 18 December <!--del_lnk--> 2006 to <!--del_lnk--> 5 January <!--del_lnk--> 2007, digital satellite and Freeview viewers could access the free and interactive Newsround Review of The Year Quiz by pressing the red button on their remote control. Viewers watched video questions and then selected their answer by pressing the coloured keys on their remote control.<p><a id="Criticisms" name="Criticisms"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Criticisms</span></h2>
      <p>The programme has been criticized by young people, on its own CBBC message boards, as being &quot;patronizing.&quot; In one instance, a caption banner read <i>&quot;Chechnians are from Chechnya&quot;</i> and also <i>&quot;David Tennant: The 10th Doctor, he is the Tenth Person to play Doctor Who&quot;</i>. From a <!--del_lnk--> diversity perspective, Newsround <!--del_lnk--> discriminates against <!--del_lnk--> LGBT people by not including relevant issues or storiesFor instance, when <!--del_lnk--> Matt Lucas and Kevin McGee <!--del_lnk--> &quot;married&quot; in <!--del_lnk--> December 2006, the story was quite widely reported in the press but it went unreported on Newsround. Posts about <!--del_lnk--> gay rights have been removed from Newsround&#39;s messageboards.<p>Also, the programme&#39;s website appears to discriminate against older children. It frequently reports news stories and asks for people&#39;s thoughts on the stories. Although they say that they will try to put up as many replies as possible, very few replies from 14 and 15 year olds are published.<p>Newsround&#39;s editor, Tim Levell, was involved in commissioning a filmed report about a 9 year old <!--del_lnk--> bullfighter in <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. A number of people were angry that the BBC had carried the item, and two viewers aired their complaints on the <!--del_lnk--> 12 January <!--del_lnk--> 2007 edition of BBC&#39;s Newswatch programme. One complained about &quot;portraying this medieval barbaric ritual as a cultural form of entertainment.&quot; Mr Levell explained his reasoning on Newswatch. He said that children in the UK would find the 9 year old Mexican bullfighter &quot;absolutely fascinating.&quot;<p><a id="Former_presenters" name="Former_presenters"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Former presenters</span></h2>
