      <p>New Zealand is one of the most recently settled major land masses. <!--del_lnk--> Polynesian settlers arrived in their <!--del_lnk--> waka some time between the <a href="../../wp/1/11th_century.htm" title="11th century">11th century</a> and the <a href="../../wp/1/13th_century.htm" title="13th century">13th century</a> to establish the <!--del_lnk--> indigenous <!--del_lnk--> M&#x101;ori <!--del_lnk--> culture. New Zealand&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> M&#x101;ori name, <i>Aotearoa</i>, is usually translated as &quot;Land of the long white cloud&quot;, reputedly referring to the cloud the explorers saw on the horizon as they approached. Settlement of the <!--del_lnk--> Chatham Islands to the east of the mainland produced the <!--del_lnk--> Moriori people; linguistic evidence, in particular the innovations uniquely shared by the Moriori and M&#x101;ori languages, indicates that they moved there from New Zealand. Most of New Zealand was divided into tribal territories called <i>rohe</i>, resources within which were controlled by <i><!--del_lnk--> hap&#x16B;</i> (&#39;subtribes&#39;). <!--del_lnk--> M&#x101;ori adapted their tropically-based culture to eating the local marine resources, flora and fauna for food. They also hunted the giant flightless <!--del_lnk--> moa (which soon became extinct). They showed great ingenuity in adapting their tropical agricultural technology to a temperate climate, successfully cultivating <!--del_lnk--> taro, gourds, <!--del_lnk--> kumara (sweet potato), and other plants which they introduced from Polynesia; it is thought that k&#x16B;mara were grown as far south as Banks Peninsula in the middle of the South Island. While it was fairly easy to grow these crops in the north, these warm-climate crops were impractical in the south of the South Island. However, inter-regional trade and the exploitation of the few food plants of the local flora made up the difference. They also introduced other plants such as the paper mulberry or &#39;aute&#39;, used to make barkcloth for kites and for personal adornment.<p>The first <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="European">Europeans</a> known to have reached New Zealand were led by <a href="../../wp/a/Abel_Tasman.htm" title="Abel Tasman">Abel Janszoon Tasman</a>, who sailed up the west coasts of the South and North Islands in <!--del_lnk--> 1642. He named it <i>Staten Landt</i>, believing it to be part of the land <!--del_lnk--> Jacob Le Maire had seen in <!--del_lnk--> 1616 off the coast of <a href="../../wp/c/Chile.htm" title="Chile">Chile</a>. <i>Staten Landt</i> appeared on Tasman&#39;s first maps of New Zealand, but this was changed by <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> <!--del_lnk--> cartographers to <i>Nova Zeelandia</i>, after the Dutch province of <!--del_lnk--> Zeeland, some time after <!--del_lnk--> Hendrik Brouwer proved the supposedly South American land to be an island in <!--del_lnk--> 1643. The <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>Nova Zeelandia</i> became <i>Nieuw Zeeland</i> in <a href="../../wp/d/Dutch_language.htm" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a>. Captain <a href="../../wp/j/James_Cook.htm" title="James Cook">James Cook</a> subsequently called the archipelago <i>New Zealand</i> (a slight corruption, as <!--del_lnk--> Zealand is not an alternative spelling of <!--del_lnk--> Zeeland, a province in the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, but of <!--del_lnk--> Sj&aelig;lland, the island in <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> that includes <a href="../../wp/c/Copenhagen.htm" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>), although the M&#x101;ori names he recorded for the North and South Islands (as Aehei No Mouwe and Tovy Poenammu respectively) were rejected, and the main three islands became known as North, Middle and South, with the Middle Island being later called the South Island, and the earlier South Island becoming Stewart Island. Cook began extensive surveys of the islands in <!--del_lnk--> 1769, leading to European <!--del_lnk--> whaling expeditions and eventually significant European <!--del_lnk--> colonisation. From as early as the 1780s, M&#x101;ori had encounters with European sealers and whalers. Acquisition of <!--del_lnk--> muskets by those <!--del_lnk--> iwi in close contact with European visitors destabilised the existing balance of power between M&#x101;ori tribes and there was a temporary but intense period of bloody inter-tribal warfare, known as the <!--del_lnk--> Musket Wars, which ceased only when all iwi were so armed.<div class="thumb tright">

      </div>
      <p>Concerned about the exploitation of M&#x101;ori by Europeans, the British <!--del_lnk--> Colonial Office appointed <!--del_lnk--> James Busby as British Resident to New Zealand in <!--del_lnk--> 1832. In 1834, Busby convened the <!--del_lnk--> United Tribes of New Zealand to select a flag and declare their independence, which led to the <!--del_lnk--> Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand. This declaration did not allay the fears of the <!--del_lnk--> Church Missionary Society, who continued lobbying for British annexation. Increasing <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> interest in the region led the British to annex New Zealand by Royal Proclamation in January 1840. To legitimise the British annexation, Lieutenant Governor <!--del_lnk--> William Hobson had been dispatched in 1839; he hurriedly negotiated the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Waitangi with northern iwi on his arrival. The Treaty was signed in February, and in recent years it has come to be seen as the founding document of New Zealand. The M&#x101;ori translation of the treaty promised the M&#x101;ori tribes &quot;<i><!--del_lnk--> tino rangatiratanga</i>&quot; would be preserved in return for ceding <!--del_lnk--> kawanatanga, which the English version translates as &quot;chieftainship&quot; and &quot;sovereignty&quot;; the real meanings are now disputed. Disputes over land sales and sovereignty caused the <!--del_lnk--> New Zealand land wars, which took place between <!--del_lnk--> 1845 and <!--del_lnk--> 1872. In <!--del_lnk--> 1975 the Treaty of Waitangi Act established the <!--del_lnk--> Waitangi Tribunal, charged with hearing claims of Crown violations of the Treaty of Waitangi. Some M&#x101;ori tribes and the <!--del_lnk--> Moriori never signed the treaty.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>New Zealand was initially administered as a part of the colony of <!--del_lnk--> New South Wales, and it became a separate colony in November <!--del_lnk--> 1840. The first capital was <!--del_lnk--> Okiato or old <!--del_lnk--> Russell in the <!--del_lnk--> Bay of Islands but it soon moved to <a href="../../wp/a/Auckland.htm" title="Auckland">Auckland</a>. European settlement progressed more rapidly than anyone anticipated, and settlers soon outnumbered M&#x101;ori. Self-government was granted to the settler population in 1852. There were political concerns following the discovery of <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a> in <!--del_lnk--> Central Otago in <!--del_lnk--> 1861 that the South Island would form a separate colony, so in <!--del_lnk--> 1865 the capital was moved to the more central <a href="../../wp/w/Wellington.htm" title="Wellington">Wellington</a>. New Zealand was involved in a Constitutional Convention in March <!--del_lnk--> 1891 in <a href="../../wp/s/Sydney.htm" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>, <!--del_lnk--> New South Wales, along with the Australian colonies. This was to consider a potential constitution for the proposed <!--del_lnk--> federation between all the <!--del_lnk--> Australasian colonies. New Zealand lost interest in joining <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a> in a federation following this convention.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1893 New Zealand became the first nation to grant women the right to vote on the same basis as men; however, women were not eligible to stand for parliament until <!--del_lnk--> 1919.<p>New Zealand became an independent <!--del_lnk--> dominion on <!--del_lnk--> 26 September <!--del_lnk--> 1907, by Royal Proclamation. Full independence was granted by the <!--del_lnk--> United Kingdom Parliament with the <!--del_lnk--> Statute of Westminster in <!--del_lnk--> 1931; it was taken up upon the Statute&#39;s adoption by the <!--del_lnk--> New Zealand Parliament in <!--del_lnk--> 1947. Since then New Zealand has been a sovereign constitutional monarchy within the <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth of Nations.<p>New Zealand was one of the first to join <!--del_lnk--> the Allies when it declared war on <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> on <!--del_lnk--> 3 September <!--del_lnk--> 1939, along with <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a> after the <!--del_lnk--> invasion of Poland. New Zealand troops fought in <!--del_lnk--> North Africa, <!--del_lnk--> Greece, <!--del_lnk--> Crete, <!--del_lnk--> Italy and in the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific. The <!--del_lnk--> navy and airforce were also involved.<p>In 1951, <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>, New Zealand and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> formally became allies with the signing of the <!--del_lnk--> ANZUS Treaty. In 1985, New Zealand declared itself a <!--del_lnk--> nuclear-free zone. As a result, US <!--del_lnk--> warships could no longer enter New Zealand ports without declaring themselves to be free of nuclear weapons or power. As such a declaration would be against US Government policy, effectively the ships were banned from New Zealand. The United States suspended its obligations to New Zealand under the ANZUS Treaty.<p><a id="Government" name="Government"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Government</span></h2>

      <p>New Zealand is a <a href="../../wp/c/Constitutional_monarchy.htm" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a> with a <!--del_lnk--> parliamentary democracy. Under the New Zealand Royal Titles Act (<!--del_lnk--> 1953), <!--del_lnk--> Queen Elizabeth II is <!--del_lnk--> Queen of New Zealand and is represented as <!--del_lnk--> head of state by the <!--del_lnk--> Governor-General, currently <!--del_lnk--> Anand Satyanand.<p>New Zealand is the only country in the world in which all the highest offices in the land have been occupied simultaneously by women, between March 2005 and August 2006 - The Sovereign, <!--del_lnk--> Queen Elizabeth II; <!--del_lnk--> Governor-General Dame <!--del_lnk--> Silvia Cartwright; Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> Helen Clark; <!--del_lnk--> Speaker of the <!--del_lnk--> New Zealand House of Representatives <!--del_lnk--> Margaret Wilson; and Chief Justice Dame <!--del_lnk--> Sian Elias.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> New Zealand Parliament has only <!--del_lnk--> one chamber, the <!--del_lnk--> House of Representatives, which usually seats 120 Members of Parliament. <!--del_lnk--> Parliamentary general elections are held every three years under a form of <!--del_lnk--> proportional representation called <!--del_lnk--> Mixed Member Proportional. The <!--del_lnk--> 2005 General Election created an &#39;<!--del_lnk--> overhang&#39; of one extra seat, occupied by the <!--del_lnk--> M&#x101;ori Party, due to that party winning more seats in electorates than the number of seats its proportion of the party vote would have given it.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>There is no written <!--del_lnk--> constitution: the <i><!--del_lnk--> Constitution Act 1986</i> is the principal formal statement of New Zealand&#39;s constitutional structure. The Governor-General has the power to appoint and dismiss Prime Ministers and to dissolve Parliament. The Governor-General also chairs the <!--del_lnk--> Executive Council, which is a formal committee consisting of all ministers of the Crown. Members of the Executive Council are required to be Members of Parliament, and most are also in <!--del_lnk--> Cabinet. Cabinet is the most senior policy-making body and is led by the <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister, who is also, by convention, the Parliamentary leader of the governing party or coalition.<p>The current Prime Minister is <!--del_lnk--> Helen Clark, leader of the <!--del_lnk--> Labour Party. She is serving her third term as Prime Minister. On <!--del_lnk--> 17 October <!--del_lnk--> 2005 she announced that she had come to a complex arrangement that guaranteed the support of enough parties for her Labour-led coalition to govern. The formal coalition consists of the Labour Party and <!--del_lnk--> Jim Anderton, the <!--del_lnk--> Progressive Party&#39;s only MP. In addition to the parties in formal coalition, <!--del_lnk--> New Zealand First and <!--del_lnk--> United Future provide confidence and supply in return for their leaders being ministers outside cabinet. A further arrangement has been made with the <!--del_lnk--> Green Party, which has given a commitment not to vote against the government on <!--del_lnk--> confidence and supply. This commitment assures the government of a majority of seven MPs on confidence.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Leader of the Opposition, <!--del_lnk--> National Party leader <!--del_lnk--> Don Brash, formerly Governor of the <!--del_lnk--> Reserve Bank announced his resignation on <!--del_lnk--> November 23, <!--del_lnk--> 2006. Although <!--del_lnk--> John Key seems the most likely candidate to replace Brash, it is unknown whether this will be the case. The <!--del_lnk--> ACT party and the <!--del_lnk--> M&#x101;ori Party are both also in opposition. The Greens, New Zealand First and United Future all vote against the government on some legislation.<p>Major political parties:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Labour Party (50 seats)<li><!--del_lnk--> National Party (48 seats)</ul>
      <p>Minor political parties (in Parliament):<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> ACT New Zealand (2 seats)<li><!--del_lnk--> Green Party (6 seats)<li><!--del_lnk--> Jim Anderton&#39;s Progressive Party (1 seat)<li><!--del_lnk--> M&#x101;ori Party (4 seats)<li><!--del_lnk--> New Zealand First (7 seats)<li><!--del_lnk--> United Future (3 seats)</ul>
      <p>The highest court in New Zealand is the <!--del_lnk--> Supreme Court of New Zealand, which was established in 2004 following the passage of the Supreme Court Act 2003. The Act abolished the option to appeal Court of Appeal rulings to the <!--del_lnk--> Privy Council in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>. The current Chief Justice is <!--del_lnk--> Dame Sian Elias. New Zealand&#39;s judiciary also includes the <!--del_lnk--> High Court, which deals with serious criminal offences and civil matters, and the <!--del_lnk--> Court of Appeal, and subordinate courts.<p><a id="Foreign_relations_and_the_military" name="Foreign_relations_and_the_military"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Foreign relations and the military</span></h2>

      <p>New Zealand maintains a strong profile on <!--del_lnk--> environmental protection, <a href="../../wp/h/Human_rights.htm" title="Human rights">human rights</a> and <!--del_lnk--> free trade, particularly in <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>.<p>New Zealand is a member of the following geo-political organisations: <!--del_lnk--> APEC, <!--del_lnk--> East Asia Summit, <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth of Nations, <!--del_lnk--> OECD and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>. It has signed up to a number of free trade agreements, of which the most important is <!--del_lnk--> Closer Economic Relations with Australia.<p>For its first hundred years, New Zealand followed the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>&#39;s lead on foreign policy. &quot;Where she goes, we go; where she stands, we stand&quot;, said Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> Michael Savage, in declaring war on <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> on <!--del_lnk--> 3 September <!--del_lnk--> 1939. However, New Zealand came under the influence of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States of America">United States of America</a> for the generation following the war (although New Zealand does still have a good working relationship with the UK).<p>New Zealand has traditionally worked closely with Australia, whose foreign policy followed a similar historical trend. In turn, many Pacific Islands such as <!--del_lnk--> Western Samoa have looked to New Zealand&#39;s lead. The American influence on New Zealand was weakened by the disappointment with the <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_War.htm" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> sinking of the Rainbow Warrior by France, and by disagreements over environmental and agricultural trade issues and New Zealand&#39;s nuclear-free policy.<p>New Zealand is a party to the <!--del_lnk--> ANZUS security treaty between Australia, New Zealand and the United States. In February 1985 New Zealand refused <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_power.htm" title="Nuclear power">nuclear-powered</a> or <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_weapon.htm" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear-armed</a> ships access to its ports. In <!--del_lnk--> 1986 the United States announced that it was suspending its treaty security obligations to New Zealand pending the restoration of port access. The <!--del_lnk--> New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987 prohibits the stationing of nuclear weapons on the territory of New Zealand and the entry into New Zealand waters of nuclear armed or propelled ships. This legislation remains a source of contention and the basis for the United States&#39; continued suspension of treaty obligations to New Zealand.<p>In addition to the various wars between iwi, and between the British settlers and iwi, New Zealand has fought in the <a href="../../wp/s/Second_Boer_War.htm" title="Second Boer War">Second Boer War</a>, <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Korean War, the <!--del_lnk--> Malayan Emergency (and committed troops, fighters and bombers to the subsequent confrontation with <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>), the <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_War.htm" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf War and the <!--del_lnk--> Afghanistan War, and briefly sent a unit of army engineers to help with rebuilding <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq.htm" title="Iraq">Iraqi</a> infrastructure.<p>The New Zealand military has three branches: the <!--del_lnk--> New Zealand Army, the <!--del_lnk--> Royal New Zealand Navy, and the <!--del_lnk--> Royal New Zealand Air Force.

      <p>The early European settlers divided New Zealand into <!--del_lnk--> provinces. These were abolished in <!--del_lnk--> 1876 so that government could be centralised, for financial reasons. As a result, New Zealand has no separately represented <!--del_lnk--> subnational entities such as provinces, states or territories, apart from its local government. The spirit of the provinces however still lives on, and there is fierce rivalry exhibited in sporting and cultural events. Since 1876, <!--del_lnk--> local government has administered the various regions of New Zealand. In 1989, the government completely reorganised local government, implementing the current two-tier structure of <!--del_lnk--> regional councils and <!--del_lnk--> territorial authorities.<p>Today New Zealand has 12 regional councils for the administration of environmental and transport matters and 74 territorial authorities that administer roading, sewerage, building consents, and other local matters. The territorial authorities are 16 city councils, 57 district councils, and the Chatham Islands County Council. Four of the territorial councils (one city and three districts) and the Chatham Islands County Council also perform the functions of a regional council and thus are known as <!--del_lnk--> unitary authorities. Territorial authority districts are not subdivisions of regional council districts, and a few of them straddle regional council boundaries.<p><!--del_lnk--> Regions are (asterisks denote unitary authorities): <!--del_lnk--> Northland, <!--del_lnk--> Auckland, <!--del_lnk--> Waikato, <!--del_lnk--> Bay of Plenty, <!--del_lnk--> Gisborne*, <!--del_lnk--> Hawke&#39;s Bay, <!--del_lnk--> Taranaki, <!--del_lnk--> Manawatu-Wanganui, <!--del_lnk--> Wellington, <!--del_lnk--> Marlborough*, <!--del_lnk--> Nelson*, <!--del_lnk--> Tasman*, <!--del_lnk--> West Coast, <!--del_lnk--> Canterbury, <!--del_lnk--> Otago, <!--del_lnk--> Southland, <!--del_lnk--> Chatham Islands*.<p>As a major <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">South Pacific</a> nation, New Zealand has a close working relationship with many <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Island nations, and continues a political association with the <a href="../../wp/c/Cook_Islands.htm" title="Cook Islands">Cook Islands</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/Niue.htm" title="Niue">Niue</a>, and <a href="../../wp/t/Tokelau.htm" title="Tokelau">Tokelau</a>. New Zealand operates <!--del_lnk--> Scott Base in its <a href="../../wp/a/Antarctica.htm" title="Antarctica">Antarctic</a> territory, the <!--del_lnk--> Ross Dependency.

      <p>New Zealand comprises two main islands (called the North and South Islands in English, <i>Te-Ika-a-Maui</i> and <i>Te Wai Pounamu</i> in <!--del_lnk--> M&#x101;ori) and a number of <!--del_lnk--> smaller islands. The total land area, 268,680 <!--del_lnk--> square kilometres (103,738 <!--del_lnk--> sq&nbsp;miles), is a little less than that of Italy and <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>, and a little more than the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. The country extends more than 1600&nbsp;kilometres (1000&nbsp;miles) along its main, north-north-east axis, with approximately 15,134 km of coastline. The most significant of the smaller inhabited islands include <!--del_lnk--> Stewart Island/Rakiura; <!--del_lnk--> Waiheke Island, in Auckland&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Hauraki Gulf; <!--del_lnk--> Great Barrier Island, east of the Hauraki Gulf; and the <!--del_lnk--> Chatham Islands, named <i>R&#x113;kohu</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Moriori. The country has extensive marine resources, with the seventh-largest <!--del_lnk--> Exclusive Economic Zone in the world, covering over four million square kilometres (1.5 million sq&nbsp;mi), more than 15 times its land area.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> South Island is the largest land mass, and is divided along its length by the <!--del_lnk--> Southern Alps, the highest peak of which is <!--del_lnk--> Aoraki/Mount Cook at 3754&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> metres (12,316&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ft). There are 18 peaks of more than 3000&nbsp;metres (9800&nbsp;ft) in the South Island. The <!--del_lnk--> North Island is less mountainous than the South, but is marked by volcanism. The tallest North Island mountain, <!--del_lnk--> Mount Ruapehu (2797&nbsp;m&nbsp;/&nbsp;9176&nbsp;ft), is an active cone <a href="../../wp/v/Volcano.htm" title="Volcano">volcano</a>.

      <p>Because of its long isolation from the rest of the world and its island <!--del_lnk--> biogeography, New Zealand has extraordinary <!--del_lnk--> flora and <!--del_lnk--> fauna. About 80% of the New Zealand flora occurs only in New Zealand, including more than 40 <!--del_lnk--> endemic <!--del_lnk--> genera. The two main types of forest have been dominated by <!--del_lnk--> podocarps including the giant <!--del_lnk--> kauri and <!--del_lnk--> southern beech. The remaining vegetation types in New Zealand are grasslands of <!--del_lnk--> tussock and other grasses, usually in sub-alpine areas, and the low shrublands between grasslands and forests.<p>Until the arrival of humans, 80% of the land was <a href="../../wp/f/Forest.htm" title="Forest">forested</a> and, barring three species of <a href="../../wp/b/Bat.htm" title="Bat">bat</a> (one now extinct), there were no non-marine <a href="../../wp/m/Mammal.htm" title="Mammal">mammals</a>. Instead, New Zealand&#39;s forests were inhabited by a diverse range of birds including the flightless <!--del_lnk--> moa (now extinct), and the <!--del_lnk--> kiwi, <a href="../../wp/k/Kakapo.htm" title="Kakapo">kakapo</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> takah&#x113;, all endangered by human actions. Unique birds capable of flight include the <!--del_lnk--> Haast&#39;s eagle, which was the world&#39;s largest <a href="../../wp/b/Bird_of_prey.htm" title="Bird of prey">bird of prey</a> (now extinct), and the large <!--del_lnk--> k&#x101;k&#x101; and <!--del_lnk--> kea <a href="../../wp/p/Parrot.htm" title="Parrot">parrots</a>. Reptiles present in New Zealand include <!--del_lnk--> skinks, <!--del_lnk--> geckos and <a href="../../wp/t/Tuatara.htm" title="Tuatara">tuatara</a>. There are four endemic species of <!--del_lnk--> primitive frogs. There are no <!--del_lnk--> snakes and there is only one <!--del_lnk--> venomous <a href="../../wp/s/Spider.htm" title="Spider">spider</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> katipo, which is rare and restricted to coastal regions. However, there are many endemic species of insects, including the <!--del_lnk--> weta, one species of which may grow as large as a <!--del_lnk--> house mouse and is the heaviest insect in the world.<p>New Zealand has led the world in clearing offshore islands of introduced mammalian pests and reintroducing rare native species to ensure their survival. A more recent development is the mainland <!--del_lnk--> ecological island.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>

      <p>New Zealand has a modern developed economy with an estimated GDP of $101.685 billion (2005).<p>The country has a high standard of living with GDP per capita estimated at $26,400 (comparative figures are Australia $31,900 and United States $41,800). The standard of living has also been measured in other forms, including being ranked 19th on the 2005 <!--del_lnk--> Human Development Index and 15th in <!--del_lnk--> The Economist&#39;s 2005 world-wide quality-of-life index.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> tertiary sector is the largest sector in the economy and constitutes 67.6% of GDP, followed by the <!--del_lnk--> secondary sector on 27.8% and the <!--del_lnk--> primary sector on 4.7% (2005 estimate).<p>New Zealand is a country heavily dependent on trade, particularly in agricultural products, as almost 20% of the country&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> output is exported (by comparison it is 21% for the United Kingdom, 49% for Finland and 83% for Belgium). This leaves New Zealand particularly vulnerable to slumps in commodity prices and global <!--del_lnk--> economic slowdowns. Its principal export industries are agriculture, horticulture, fishing and forestry making up about half of the country&#39;s exports. Its major export partners are Australia 22.4%, US 11.3%, Japan 11.2%, China 9.7%, Germany 5.2% (2004). This is a dramatic change from 1965, when the United Kingdom received over half of New Zealand&rsquo;s exports.<p>Traditionally, New Zealand enjoyed a high standard of living with stable commodity exports, based not least on a strong relationship with the United Kingdom. In 1973 the United Kingdom joined the <!--del_lnk--> European Community and began to adhere to its trade policy and at the same time other factors such as the oil crises undermined the viability of the New Zealand economy. This lead to a protracted and very severe economic crisis, during which living standards in New Zealand fell behind those of Australia and Western Europe.<p>Since <!--del_lnk--> 1984, successive governments have engaged in major <!--del_lnk--> macroeconomic restructuring, transforming New Zealand from a highly protectionist and regulated economy to a liberalised <!--del_lnk--> free-trade economy. Pursuant to this policy, during the late <!--del_lnk--> 1980s and early <!--del_lnk--> 1990s the New Zealand Government sold a number of former government-owned enterprises including its <!--del_lnk--> telecommunications company, <!--del_lnk--> railway network, a number of <!--del_lnk--> radio stations, and two financial institutions. However, the government continues to own a number of significant businesses, collectively known as <!--del_lnk--> State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs). These SOEs are operated through arms-length shareholding arrangements and are required to operate profitably, just like privately-owned enterprises.<p>The current government&#39;s economic objectives are centred on pursuing free-trade agreements and building a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> knowledge economy&quot;. In <!--del_lnk--> 2004 the government began discussing a free trade agreement with the <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">People&#39;s Republic of China</a>, one of the first countries to do so.<p>In recent years, New Zealand has been perceived as a vigorous economy and attracted international attention. After the economic restructuring of the 1980s, the New Zealand economy sank into a recession starting with the sharemarket crash in October 1987. The recession deepened in the early 1990s when unemployment topped 10%. However in 1993 the economy rebounded smartly and apart from a smaller recession in the late 1990s, New Zealand enjoyed a substantial economic boom up until 2005. New Zealand&rsquo;s unemployment rate is now the second lowest of the 27 OECD nations with comparable data.<p>Ongoing economic challenges for New Zealand include a current account deficit of 9% of GDP (<!--del_lnk--> ), slow development of non-commodity exports, tepid growth of labour productivity, and an unofficial poverty rate of about twenty percent.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>New Zealand has a population of about 4.1 million. About 80% <!--del_lnk-->  of the population are of European descent. New Zealanders of European descent are collectively known as <!--del_lnk--> P&#x101;keh&#x101; - this term is used variously and some M&#x101;ori use it to refer to all non-M&#x101;ori New Zealanders. Most European New Zealanders are of <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/Irish_people.htm" title="Irish people">Irish</a> ancestry with smaller percentages of <!--del_lnk--> Dutch, <!--del_lnk--> South Slav, and/or <!--del_lnk--> Italian ancestry. <!--del_lnk--> <p><!--del_lnk--> Indigenous <!--del_lnk--> M&#x101;ori people are the largest non-European ethnic group (the percentage of the population of full or part-M&#x101;ori ancestry is 14.7%; those who checked M&#x101;ori only are 7.9%). Between the 1996 and 2001 census, the number of people of Asian origin (6.6%) overtook the number of people of <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Island origin (6.5%) (note that the census allowed multiple ethnic affiliations). New Zealand has relatively open immigration policies; its government is committed to increasing its population by about 1% annually. At present, immigrants from the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> constitute the largest single group (30%) but immigrants are drawn from many nations, and increasingly from <!--del_lnk--> East Asia (<!--del_lnk--> Chinese, <!--del_lnk--> Japanese and <!--del_lnk--> Korean are the most numerous of this group, but includes <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asian and <!--del_lnk--> Indian peoples).<p>According to the 2001 census <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> is the predominant religion with around 60% identification. Around 30% identified that they were &quot;non-religious&quot;, and 6% objected to answering, leaving only 4% for other religions. The main <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christian</a> denominations are <!--del_lnk--> Anglicanism, <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholicism, <!--del_lnk--> Presbyterianism and <!--del_lnk--> Methodism. There are also significant numbers who identify themselves with <!--del_lnk--> Pentecostal and <!--del_lnk--> Baptist churches and with the <!--del_lnk--> LDS (Mormon) church. The New Zealand-based <!--del_lnk--> Ratana church has many adherents among M&#x101;ori. According to <!--del_lnk--> census figures, other significant minority religions include <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Islam, and <a href="../../wp/j/Judaism.htm" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

      <p>Contemporary New Zealand has a diverse culture with influences from English, Scottish, Irish, and M&#x101;ori cultures, along with those of other European cultures and &ndash; more recently &ndash; Polynesian (including Samoan, Tongan, Niuean, Cook Islands M&#x101;ori, Tahitian, and Hawaiian), southern Asian (Indian), Southeast Asian (Filipino, Malaysian, Cambodian, and Vietnamese), and east Asian (Chinese, Korean, and Japanese) cultures. Although primary migration was from <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> there were also many people from <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> amongst the early British settlers and elements of their culture persist; New Zealand is said to have more <!--del_lnk--> pipebands than Scotland. Cultural links between New Zealand and the United Kingdom are maintained by a common language, sustained migration from the United Kingdom and the fact that many young New Zealanders spend time in the United Kingdom on their &quot;overseas experience&quot; (OE).<p>Pre-European contact M&#x101;ori culture had no metal tools, relying on stone and wood. M&#x101;ori culture survives as M&#x101;ori continue to support and develop their culture on their own terms and conditions - much as any other living and thriving culture does in the world.<p>Use of the M&#x101;ori language (Te Reo M&#x101;ori) as a living, community language remained only in a few remote areas in the post-war years, but is currently undergoing a renaissance, thanks in part to M&#x101;ori language medium schools and a <!--del_lnk--> M&#x101;ori television channel after being set up from recommendations set down by the Waitangi Tribunal. M&#x101;ori Television is the only nationwide television channel to have the majority of its prime-time content delivered in M&#x101;ori (sometimes with sub-titles in English). M&#x101;ori Television is also the only television channel that tries to generate new content in M&#x101;ori and subtitles English programmes in M&#x101;ori. None of the other television channels present a substantial number of M&#x101;ori programmes, or subtitle English language programmes in M&#x101;ori, despite the fact that it is an official language equal to English.<p>New Zealand&#39;s landscape has appeared in a number of <!--del_lnk--> television programmes and <!--del_lnk--> films. In particular, the television series <i><!--del_lnk--> Hercules: The Legendary Journeys</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Xena: Warrior Princess</i> were filmed around <a href="../../wp/a/Auckland.htm" title="Auckland">Auckland</a>, and the film <i><!--del_lnk--> Heavenly Creatures</i> in <!--del_lnk--> Christchurch. The television series <i><!--del_lnk--> The Tribe</i> is set and filmed in New Zealand. New Zealand director <!--del_lnk--> Peter Jackson shot the epic <a href="../../wp/t/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_film_trilogy.htm" title="The Lord of the Rings film trilogy"><i>The Lord of the Rings</i> film trilogy</a> in various locations around the country, taking advantage of the spectacular and relatively unspoiled landscapes, and <!--del_lnk--> Mount Taranaki was used as a stand-in for <!--del_lnk--> Mount Fuji in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Last Samurai</i>. The latest major movies shot in New Zealand are <i><a href="../../wp/k/King_Kong_%25282005_film%2529.htm" title="King Kong (2005 film)">King Kong</a></i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</i>. New Zealand has also become a popular filming site for Indian movie makers.<p><!--del_lnk--> Taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateapokaiwhenuakitanatahu is the longest M&#x101;ori word. It is the name of a hill in the <!--del_lnk--> Hawke&#39;s Bay region of the North Island. <i><!--del_lnk--> The Guinness Book of World Records</i> lists this as the longest geographical name in the world.<p><!--del_lnk--> New Zealand music is a vibrant expression of the culture of New Zealand. As the largest nation in <!--del_lnk--> Polynesia, New Zealand&#39;s music is influenced by the <!--del_lnk--> indigenous <!--del_lnk--> M&#x101;ori and immigrants from the Pacific region. The origins of New Zealand&#39;s musical culture lie in its British colonial history, with contributions from Europe and America. Local artists have mixed these styles with local influences to create music that is uniquely New Zealand in style.<p><a id="Sports" name="Sports"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sports</span></h2>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Rugby union is closely linked to New Zealand&#39;s national identity. The national rugby team, the <a href="../../wp/a/All_Blacks.htm" title="All Blacks">All Blacks</a>, has the best winning record of any national team. They hosted and won the inaugural <!--del_lnk--> Rugby World Cup in 1987, and will host the <!--del_lnk--> 2011 Rugby Union World Cup. Variations of the phrase &quot;All Black&quot; have been adapted by several other national sporting codes such as the <a href="../../wp/b/Basketball.htm" title="Basketball">basketball</a> team (the <!--del_lnk--> Tall Blacks), the <a href="../../wp/c/Cricket.htm" title="Cricket">cricket</a> team (<!--del_lnk--> Black Caps) and the <!--del_lnk--> hockey team (<!--del_lnk--> Black Sticks). The <a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Football (soccer)">soccer</a> team is called the <!--del_lnk--> All Whites. New Zealand&#39;s national sporting colours are black and white (silver). The <!--del_lnk--> silver fern is a national emblem worn by New Zealanders representing their country in sport and also features as the name of New Zealand&#39;s highly successful national <a href="../../wp/n/Netball.htm" title="Netball">netball</a> team, the <!--del_lnk--> Silver Ferns.
