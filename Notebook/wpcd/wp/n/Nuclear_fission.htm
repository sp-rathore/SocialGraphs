      <p><b>Nuclear fission</b>&mdash;also known as atomic fission&mdash;is a process in <!--del_lnk--> nuclear physics and <!--del_lnk--> nuclear chemistry in which the <!--del_lnk--> nucleus of an atom splits into two or more smaller nuclei as <!--del_lnk--> fission products, and usually some by-product particles. Hence, fission is a form of <!--del_lnk--> elemental transmutation. The by-products include free <a href="../../wp/n/Neutron.htm" title="Neutron">neutrons</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Photon.htm" title="Photon">photons</a> usually in the form <!--del_lnk--> gamma rays, and other nuclear fragments such as <!--del_lnk--> beta particles and <!--del_lnk--> alpha particles. Fission of heavy elements is an <!--del_lnk--> exothermic reaction and can release substantial amounts of useful <a href="../../wp/e/Energy.htm" title="Energy">energy</a> both as gamma rays and as <!--del_lnk--> kinetic energy of the fragments (<a href="../../wp/h/Heat.htm" title="Heat">heating</a> the bulk material where fission takes place).<p>Nuclear fission produces energy for <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_power.htm" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a> and to drive explosion of <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_weapon.htm" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapons</a>. Fission is useful as a power source because some materials, called <!--del_lnk--> nuclear fuels, both generate neutrons as part of the fission process and also undergo triggered fission when impacted by a free neutron. Nuclear fuels can be part of a self-sustaining <!--del_lnk--> chain reaction that releases energy at a controlled rate in a <!--del_lnk--> nuclear reactor or at a very rapid uncontrolled rate in a <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_weapon.htm" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapon</a>.<p>The amount of <!--del_lnk--> free energy contained in nuclear fuel is millions of times the amount of free energy contained in a similar mass of chemical fuel such as <!--del_lnk--> gasoline, making nuclear fission a very tempting source of energy; however, the <!--del_lnk--> waste products of nuclear fission are highly <!--del_lnk--> radioactive and remain so for <!--del_lnk--> millennia, giving rise to a <!--del_lnk--> nuclear waste problem. Concerns over nuclear waste accumulation and over the immense destructive potential of nuclear weapons counterbalance the desirable qualities of fission as an energy source, and give rise to intense ongoing <a href="../../wp/p/Politics.htm" title="Politics">political</a> debate over nuclear power.<p>

      <p>Nuclear fission differs from other forms of <!--del_lnk--> radioactive decay in that it can be harnessed and controlled via a <!--del_lnk--> chain reaction: free <!--del_lnk--> neutrons released by each fission event can trigger yet more events, which in turn release more neutrons and cause more fissions. <a href="../../wp/c/Chemical_element.htm" title="Chemical element">Chemical</a> <!--del_lnk--> isotopes that can sustain a fission chain reaction are called <!--del_lnk--> nuclear fuels, and are said to be <!--del_lnk--> fissile. The most common nuclear fuels are <!--del_lnk--> <sup>235</sup>U (the isotope of <a href="../../wp/u/Uranium.htm" title="Uranium">uranium</a> with an <!--del_lnk--> atomic mass of 235) and <!--del_lnk--> <sup>239</sup>Pu (the isotope of <a href="../../wp/p/Plutonium.htm" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a> with an atomic mass of 239). These fuels break apart into a range of chemical elements with atomic masses near 100 (fission products). Most nuclear fuels undergo <!--del_lnk--> spontaneous fission only very slowly, decaying mainly via an <!--del_lnk--> alpha/<!--del_lnk--> beta <!--del_lnk--> decay chain over periods of <!--del_lnk--> millennia to <!--del_lnk--> eons. In a <!--del_lnk--> nuclear reactor or nuclear weapon, most fission events are induced by bombardment with another particle such as a neutron.<p>Typical fission events release several hundred <!--del_lnk--> MeV of energy for each fission event, which is why nuclear fission is used as an <!--del_lnk--> energy source. By contrast, most <!--del_lnk--> chemical <!--del_lnk--> oxidation reactions (such as burning <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a> or <!--del_lnk--> TNT) release at most a few tens of <!--del_lnk--> eV per event, so nuclear fuel contains at least ten million times more usable energy than does chemical fuel. The energy of nuclear fission is released as <!--del_lnk--> kinetic energy of the fission products and fragments, and as <a href="../../wp/e/Electromagnetic_radiation.htm" title="Electromagnetic radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a> in the form of <!--del_lnk--> gamma rays; in a nuclear reactor, the energy is converted to <a href="../../wp/h/Heat.htm" title="Heat">heat</a> as the particles and gamma rays collide with the atoms that make up the reactor and its <!--del_lnk--> working fluid, usually <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a> or occasionally <!--del_lnk--> heavy water.<p>Nuclear fission of heavy elements produces energy because the specific <!--del_lnk--> binding energy (binding energy per mass) of intermediate-mass nuclei with <!--del_lnk--> atomic numbers and <!--del_lnk--> atomic masses close to <sup>61</sup>Ni and <sup>56</sup>Fe is greater than the specific binding energy of very heavy nuclei, so that energy is released when heavy nuclei are broken apart.<p>The total mass of the fission products (<b>Mp</b>) from a single reaction, after their kinetic energy has been dissipated, is less than the mass of the original fuel nucleus. The excess mass <b>&Delta;m</b> is associated with the released energy which carries it away, according to Einstein&#39;s relation <!--del_lnk--> E=mc&sup2;, where the mass is <b>&Delta;m</b>. In comparison, the specific binding energies of many lighter elements [elements 1 (hydrogen) through approximately 12 (magnesium)] are also significantly less than that of intermediate-mass nuclei, so if the lighter elements undergo <!--del_lnk--> nuclear fusion (the counterpart to nuclear fission), this process also releases heat energy (is &quot;exothermic&quot;).<p><img alt="E=M_{U^{235}}~c^2- M_P~c^2" class="tex" src="../../images/339/33993.png" /><p>The variation in specific binding energy with atomic number is due to the interplay of the two fundamental <a href="../../wp/f/Force.htm" title="Force">forces</a> acting on the component <!--del_lnk--> nucleons (<a href="../../wp/p/Proton.htm" title="Proton">protons</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/Neutron.htm" title="Neutron">neutrons</a>) that make up the nucleus. Nuclei are bound by an attractive <!--del_lnk--> strong nuclear force between nucleons, which overcomes the <!--del_lnk--> electrostatic repulsion between protons. However, the strong nuclear force acts only over extremely short ranges, since it follows a <!--del_lnk--> Yukawa potential. For this reason large nuclei are less tightly bound per unit mass than small nuclei, and breaking a very large nucleus into two or more intermediate-sized nuclei releases energy. In practice, as noted, most of this energy appears as kinetic energy as the two smaller nuclei mutually repel and fly away from each other at high speed.<p>In nuclear fission events the nuclei may break into any combination of lighter nuclei, but the most common event is not fission to equal mass nuclei of about mass 120; the most common event (depending on isotope and process) is a slightly unequal fission in which one daughter nucleus has a mass of about 90 to 100 <b>u</b> and the other the remaining 130 to 140 <b>u</b> <!--del_lnk--> . Unequal fissions are energetically more favorable because this allows one product to be closer to the energetic minimum near mass 60 <b>u</b> (only a quarter of the average fissionable mass), while the other nucleus with mass 135 <b>u</b> is still not far out of the range of the most tightly bound nuclei (another statement of this, is that the atomic <!--del_lnk--> binding energy curve is slightly steeper to the left of mass 120 <b>u</b> than to the right of it).<p>Because of the short range of the strong binding force, large nuclei must contain proportionally more neutrons than do light elements, which are most stable with a 1-1 ratio of protons and neutrons. Extra neutrons stabilize heavy elements because they add to strong-force binding without adding to proton-proton repulsion. Fission products have, on average, about the same ratio of neutrons and protons as their parent nucleus, and are therefore usually unstable because they have proportionally too many neutrons compared to stable isotopes of similar mass. This is the fundamental cause of the problem of <!--del_lnk--> radioactive <!--del_lnk--> high level waste from nuclear reactors. Fission products tend to be <!--del_lnk--> beta emitters, <!--del_lnk--> emitting fast-moving <a href="../../wp/e/Electron.htm" title="Electron">electrons</a> to conserve <a href="../../wp/e/Electric_charge.htm" title="Electric charge">electric charge</a> as excess neutrons convert to protons inside the nucleus of the fission product atoms.<p>The most common nuclear fuels, <sup>235</sup>U and <sup>239</sup>Pu, are not major radiologic hazards by themselves: <sup>235</sup>U has a <!--del_lnk--> half-life of approximately 700 million years, and although <sup>239</sup>Pu has a half-life of only about 24,000 years, it is a pure <!--del_lnk--> alpha particle emitter and hence not particularly dangerous unless ingested. Once a <!--del_lnk--> fuel element has been used, the remaining fuel material is intimately mixed with highly radioactive fission products that emit energetic <!--del_lnk--> beta particles and <!--del_lnk--> gamma rays. Some fission products have half-lives as short as seconds; others have half-lives of tens of thousands of years, requiring long-term storage in facilities such as <!--del_lnk--> Yucca mountain until the fission products decay into non-radioactive stable isotopes.<p><a id="Spontaneous_and_induced_fission.3B_chain_reactions" name="Spontaneous_and_induced_fission.3B_chain_reactions"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Spontaneous and induced fission; chain reactions</span></h3>
      <p>Many heavy elements, such as <a href="../../wp/u/Uranium.htm" title="Uranium">uranium</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Thorium.htm" title="Thorium">thorium</a>, and <a href="../../wp/p/Plutonium.htm" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a>, undergo both <!--del_lnk--> spontaneous fission, a form of <!--del_lnk--> radioactive decay and <i>induced fission</i>, a form of <!--del_lnk--> nuclear reaction. Elemental isotopes that undergo induced fission when struck by a free <a href="../../wp/n/Neutron.htm" title="Neutron">neutron</a> are called <!--del_lnk--> fissionable; isotopes that undergo fission when struck by a <!--del_lnk--> thermal, slow moving neutron are also called <!--del_lnk--> fissile. A few particularly fissile and readily obtainable isotopes (notably <sup>235</sup>U and <sup>239</sup>Pu) are called <!--del_lnk--> nuclear fuels because they can sustain a chain reaction and can be obtained in large enough quantities to be useful.<p>All fissionable and fissile isotopes undergo a small amount of spontaneous fission which releases a few free neutrons into any sample of nuclear fuel. The neutrons typically escape rapidly from the fuel and become a <!--del_lnk--> free neutron, with a <!--del_lnk--> half-life of about 15 minutes before they decay to protons and beta rays. The neutrons usually impact and are absorbed by other nuclei in the vicinity before this happens. However, some neutrons will impact fuel nuclei and induce further fissions, releasing yet more neutrons. If enough nuclear fuel is assembled into one place, or if the escaping neutrons are sufficiently contained, then these freshly generated neutrons outnumber the neutrons that escape from the assembly, and a <i>sustained nuclear chain reaction</i> will take place.<p>An assembly that supports a sustained nuclear chain reaction is called a <!--del_lnk--> critical assembly or, if the assembly is almost entirely made of a nuclear fuel, a <!--del_lnk--> critical mass. The word &quot;critical&quot; refers to a <!--del_lnk--> cusp in the behaviour of the <a href="../../wp/d/Differential_equation.htm" title="Differential equation">differential equation</a> that governs the number of free neutrons present in the fuel: if less than a critical mass is present, then the amount of neutrons is determined by <!--del_lnk--> radioactive decay, but if a critical mass or more is present, then the amount of neutrons is controlled instead by the physics of the chain reaction. The actual <!--del_lnk--> mass of a <i>critical mass</i> of nuclear fuel depends strongly on the geometry and surrounding materials.<p>Not all fissionable isotopes can sustain a chain reaction. For example, <sup>238</sup>U, the most abundant form of uranium, is fissionable but not fissile: it undergoes induced fission when impacted by an energetic neutron with over 1 MeV of kinetic energy. But too few of the neutrons produced by <sup>238</sup>U fission are energetic enough to induce further fissions in <sup>238</sup>U, so no chain reaction is possible with this isotope. Instead, bombarding <sup>238</sup>U with slow neutrons causes it to absorb them (becoming <sup>239</sup>U) and decay by <!--del_lnk--> beta emission to <sup>239</sup>Pu; that process is used to manufacture <sup>239</sup>Pu in <!--del_lnk--> breeder reactors, but does not contribute to a neutron chain reaction.<p>Fissionable, non-fissile isotopes can be used as fission energy source even without a chain reaction. Bombarding <sup>238</sup>U with fast neutrons induces fissions, releasing energy as long as the external neutron source is present. That effect is used to augment the energy released by modern <!--del_lnk--> thermonuclear weapons, by jacketing the weapon with <sup>238</sup>U to react with neutrons released by <!--del_lnk--> nuclear fusion at the centre of the device.<p><a id="Fission_reactors" name="Fission_reactors"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Fission reactors</span></h3>
      <p>Critical fission reactors are the most common type of <!--del_lnk--> nuclear reactor. In a critical fission reactor, neutrons produced by fission of fuel atoms are used to induce yet more fissions, to sustain a controllable amount of energy release. Devices that produce engineered but non-self-sustaining fission reactions are <i>subcritical fission reactors</i>. Such devices use <!--del_lnk--> radioactive decay or <!--del_lnk--> particle accelerators to trigger fissions.<p>Critical fission reactors are built for three primary purposes, which typically involve different engineering trade-offs to take advantage of either the heat or the neutrons produced by the fission chain reaction:<ul>
       <li><i><!--del_lnk--> power reactors</i> are intended to produce heat for nuclear power, either as part of a <!--del_lnk--> generating station or a local power system such as a <!--del_lnk--> nuclear submarine.<li><i><!--del_lnk--> research reactors</i> are intended to produce neutrons and/or activate radioactive sources for scientific, medical, engineering, or other research purposes.<li><i><!--del_lnk--> breeder reactors</i> are intended to produce nuclear fuels in bulk from more abundant <!--del_lnk--> isotopes. The most common type makes <sup>239</sup>Pu (a nuclear fuel) from the naturally very abundant <sup>238</sup>U (not a nuclear fuel).</ul>
      <p>While, in principle, all fission reactors can act in all three capacities, in practice the tasks lead to conflicting engineering goals and most reactors have been built with only one of the above tasks in mind. (There are several early counter-examples, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Hanford <!--del_lnk--> N reactor, now decommissioned). Power reactors generally convert the kinetic energy of fission products into heat, which is used to heat a <!--del_lnk--> working fluid and drive a <!--del_lnk--> heat engine that generates mechanical or electrical power. The working fluid is usually water with a steam turbine, but some designs use other materials such as gaseous <a href="../../wp/h/Helium.htm" title="Helium">helium</a>. Research reactors produce neutrons that are used in various ways, with the heat of fission being treated as an unavoidable waste product. Breeder reactors are a specialized form of research reactor, with the caveat that the sample being irradiated is usually the fuel itself, a mixture of <sup>238</sup>U and <sup>235</sup>U.<p>For a more detailed description of the physics and operating principles of critical fission reactors, see <!--del_lnk--> nuclear reactor physics.

      <p>One class of <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_weapon.htm" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapon</a>, a <i>fission bomb</i> (not to be confused with the <i>fusion bomb</i>), otherwise known as an <i>atomic bomb</i> or <i>atom bomb</i>, is a fission reactor designed to liberate as much energy as possible as rapidly as possible, before the released energy causes the reactor to explode (and the chain reaction to stop). Development of nuclear weapons was the motivation behind early research into nuclear fission: the <!--del_lnk--> Manhattan Project of the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. military during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> carried out most of the early scientific work on fission chain reactions, culminating in the <!--del_lnk--> Little Boy and <!--del_lnk--> Fat Man bombs that were exploded over <!--del_lnk--> Hiroshima and <!--del_lnk--> Nagasaki, <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> in August of <!--del_lnk--> 1945.<p>Even the first fission bombs were thousands of times more <!--del_lnk--> explosive than a comparable mass of <!--del_lnk--> chemical explosive. For example, Little Boy weighed a total of about four tons (of which 60 kg was nuclear fuel), and yielded an explosion equivalent to about 15,000 tons of <!--del_lnk--> TNT, destroying a large part of the city of <!--del_lnk--> Hiroshima. Modern nuclear weapons (which include a thermonuclear <i>fusion</i> as well as one or more fission stages) are literally hundreds of times more energetic for their weight than the first pure fission atomic bombs, so that a modern single missile warhead bomb weighing less than 1/8th as much as Little Boy (see for example <!--del_lnk--> W88) has a yield of 475,000 tons of TNT, and could bring destruction to 10 times the city area.<p>While the fundamental physics of the fission <!--del_lnk--> chain reaction in a nuclear weapon is similar to the physics of a controlled nuclear reactor, the two types of device must be engineered quite differently (see <!--del_lnk--> nuclear reactor physics). It would be extremely difficult to convert a <!--del_lnk--> nuclear reactor to cause a true nuclear explosion (though fuel <!--del_lnk--> meltdowns and <!--del_lnk--> steam explosions have occurred), and similarly difficult to extract useful power from a nuclear explosive (though at least one <!--del_lnk--> rocket propulsion system, <!--del_lnk--> Project Orion, was intended to work by exploding fission bombs behind a massively padded vehicle!).<p>The <!--del_lnk--> strategic importance of nuclear weapons is a major reason why the <a href="../../wp/t/Technology.htm" title="Technology">technology</a> of nuclear fission is politically sensitive. Viable fission bomb designs are within the capabilities of bright undergraduates (see <!--del_lnk--> John Aristotle Phillips), but nuclear fuel to realize the designs is thought to be difficult to obtain (see <!--del_lnk--> uranium enrichment and <!--del_lnk--> nuclear fuel cycle).<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p>The results of the bombardment of uranium by neutrons had proved interesting and puzzling. First studied by <!--del_lnk--> Enrico Fermi and his colleagues in <!--del_lnk--> 1934, they were not properly interpreted until several years later.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> January 16, <!--del_lnk--> 1939, <a href="../../wp/n/Niels_Bohr.htm" title="Niels Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> of <a href="../../wp/c/Copenhagen.htm" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, arrived in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> to spend several months in <!--del_lnk--> Princeton, New Jersey, and was particularly anxious to discuss some abstract problems with <a href="../../wp/a/Albert_Einstein.htm" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>. (Four years later Bohr was to escape to Sweden from <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">Nazi</a>-occupied Denmark in a small boat, along with thousands of other Danish Jews, in large scale operation.) Just before Bohr left Denmark, two of his colleagues, <!--del_lnk--> Otto Robert Frisch and <!--del_lnk--> Lise Meitner (both refugees from Germany), had told him their guess that the absorption of a neutron by a uranium nucleus sometimes caused that nucleus to split into approximately equal parts with the release of enormous quantities of energy, a process that Frisch dubbed &quot;<i>nuclear fission</i>&quot; (<i><!--del_lnk--> fission</i>, as previously used up to this point, was a term which was borrowed from biology, where it was and is used to describe the splitting of one living cell into two). In 1939, Frisch and Meitner submitted their article &quot;Disintegration of uranium by neutrons: a new type of nuclear reaction&quot; to the scientific journal <i><!--del_lnk--> Nature</i>.<p>The occasion for this <!--del_lnk--> hypothesis was the basic and historically most momentous discovery of <!--del_lnk--> Otto Hahn and <!--del_lnk--> Fritz Strassmann in Germany (published in their first famous article in <i>Naturwissenschaften</i>, January 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1939) which proved that an isotope of barium was produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Bohr had promised to keep the Meitner/Frisch interpretation secret until their paper was published to preserve priority, but on the boat he discussed it with <!--del_lnk--> L&eacute;on Rosenfeld, but forgot to tell him to keep it secret. Rosenfeld immediately upon arrival told everyone at <a href="../../wp/p/Princeton_University.htm" title="Princeton University">Princeton University</a>, and from them the news spread by word of mouth to neighboring physicists including <!--del_lnk--> Enrico Fermi at <!--del_lnk--> Columbia University. As a result of conversations among Fermi, <!--del_lnk--> John R. Dunning, and <!--del_lnk--> G. B. Pegram, a search was undertaken at Columbia for the heavy pulses of ionization that would be expected from the flying fragments of the <a href="../../wp/u/Uranium.htm" title="Uranium">uranium</a> nucleus. On <!--del_lnk--> January 26, <!--del_lnk--> 1939, there was a conference on theoretical physics at <a href="../../wp/w/Washington%252C_D.C..htm" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, sponsored jointly by the <!--del_lnk--> George Washington University and the <!--del_lnk--> Carnegie Institution of Washington.<p>Fermi left New York to attend this meeting before the Columbia fission experiments had been tried. At the meeting Bohr and Fermi discussed the problem of fission, and in particular Fermi mentioned the possibility that neutrons might be emitted during the process. Although this was only a guess, its implication of the possibility of a <i>nuclear</i> chain reaction was obvious. &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Chain reactions&quot; at that time were a known phenomenon in <i>chemistry</i>, but the analogous process in nuclear physics using neutrons had been foreseen as early as 1933 by <!--del_lnk--> Leo Szilard, although Szilard at that time had no idea with what materials the process might be initiated. Now, with the discovery of neutron-induced fission of heavy elements, a number of sensational articles were published in the press on the subject of nuclear chain reactions. Before the meeting in Washington was over, several other experiments to confirm fission had been initiated, and positive experimental confirmation was reported from four laboratories (<!--del_lnk--> Columbia University, Carnegie Institution of Washington, <!--del_lnk--> Johns Hopkins University, <!--del_lnk--> University of California) in the <!--del_lnk--> February 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1939, issue of the Physical Review. By this time Bohr had heard that similar experiments had been made in his laboratory in Copenhagen about <!--del_lnk--> January 15. (Letter by Frisch to Nature dated <!--del_lnk--> January 16, <!--del_lnk--> 1939, and appearing in the <!--del_lnk--> February 18 issue.) <!--del_lnk--> Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Joliot in <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a> had also published his first results in the <i>Comptes Rendus</i> of <!--del_lnk--> January 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1939. From this time on there was a steady flow of papers on the subject of fission, so that by the time (<!--del_lnk--> December 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1939) L. A. Turner of Princeton wrote a review article on the subject in the Reviews of Modern Physics nearly one hundred papers had appeared. Complete analysis and discussion of these papers have appeared in Turner&#39;s article and elsewhere.<p>A major focus of early fission research was on producing a controllable nuclear chain reaction, which would mark the first harnessing of nuclear power. This led to the development of <!--del_lnk--> Chicago Pile-1, the world&#39;s first man-made critical nuclear reactor (which used <a href="../../wp/u/Uranium.htm" title="Uranium">uranium</a>, the only natural nuclear fuel available in macroscopic quantities), and then to the <!--del_lnk--> Manhattan project to develop a nuclear weapon.<p>Producing a fission chain reaction in uranium fuel is far from trivial. Early nuclear reactors did not use isotopically enriched uranium, and in consequence they were required to use large quantities of highly purified graphite as neutron moderation materials. Use of ordinary water (as opposed to <!--del_lnk--> heavy water) in nuclear reactors requires enriched fuel--- the partial separation and relative enrichment of the rare <sup>235</sup>U isotope from the far more common <sup>238</sup>U isotope. Typically, reactors also require inclusion of extremely chemically pure <!--del_lnk--> neutron moderator materials such as <!--del_lnk--> deuterium (in <!--del_lnk--> heavy water), <a href="../../wp/h/Helium.htm" title="Helium">helium</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Beryllium.htm" title="Beryllium">beryllium</a>, or carbon, usually as the <!--del_lnk--> graphite (The high purity is required because many chemical impurities such as the boron-10 component of natural <a href="../../wp/b/Boron.htm" title="Boron">boron</a>, are very strong neutron absorbers and thus <!--del_lnk--> poison the chain reaction).<p>Production of such materials at industrial scale had to be solved for nuclear power generation and weapons production to be accomplished. Up to <!--del_lnk--> 1940, the total amount of uranium metal produced in the USA was not more than a few grams and even this was of doubtful purity; of metallic beryllium not more than a few kilograms; concentrated deuterium oxide (<!--del_lnk--> heavy water) not more than a few kilograms; and finally carbon had never been produced in quantity with anything like the purity required of a moderator.<p>The problem of producing large amounts of high purity uranium was solved by <!--del_lnk--> Frank Spedding using the <!--del_lnk--> thermite process. <!--del_lnk--> Ames Laboratory was established in 1942 to produce the large amounts of natural (unenriched) uranium that would be necessary for the research to come. The success of the <!--del_lnk--> Chicago Pile-1 which used unenriched (natural) uranium, like all of the atomic &quot;piles&quot; which produced the plutonium for the atomic bomb, was also due specifically to Szilard&#39;s realization that very pure graphite could be used for the moderator of even natural uranium &quot;piles&quot;. In wartime Germany, failure to appreciate the qualities of very pure graphite led to reactor designs dependent on heavy water, which in turn was denied the Germans by allied attacks in Norway, where <!--del_lnk--> heavy water was produced. These difficulties prevented the Nazis from building a nuclear reactor capable of criticality during the war.<p>Unknown until 1972, when French physicist <!--del_lnk--> Francis Perrin discovered the <!--del_lnk--> Oklo Fossil Reactors, nature had beaten humans to the punch by engaging in large-scale uranium fission chain reactions, some 2,000 million years in the past. This ancient process was able to use normal water as a moderator, only because 2,000 million years in the past, natural uranium was &quot;enriched&quot; with the shorter-lived fissile isotope <sup>235</sup>U, as compared with the natural uranium available today.<p>For more detail on the early development of <!--del_lnk--> nuclear reactors and <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_weapon.htm" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapons</a>, see <!--del_lnk--> Manhattan Project.<p><a id="External_links" name="External_links"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission&quot;</div>
