      <p><b>Nature</b>, in the broadest sense, is equivalent to the <b>natural world</b>, <b>physical universe</b>, <b>material world</b> or <b>material universe</b>. &quot;Nature&quot; refers to the <!--del_lnk--> phenomena of the <!--del_lnk--> physical world, and also to life in general. The term generally does not include manufactured objects and human interaction unless qualified in ways such as, e.g., &quot;human nature&quot; or &quot;the whole of nature&quot;. Nature is also generally distinguished from the <!--del_lnk--> supernatural. It ranges in scale from the <!--del_lnk--> subatomic to the <a href="../../wp/g/Galaxy.htm" title="Galaxy">galactic</a>.<p>The word &quot;nature&quot; derives from the Latin word <i>natura</i>, or &quot;the course of things, natural character.&quot; <i>Natura</i> was a Latin translation of the Greek word <i><!--del_lnk--> physis</i> (&phi;&#x3CD;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;), which originally related to the innate way in which plants and animals grow of their own accord, and to the Greek word for plants generally. The concept of nature as a whole, the physical <a href="../../wp/u/Universe.htm" title="Universe">universe</a>, is a more recent development that gained increasingly wide use with the advent of modern <!--del_lnk--> scientific method in the last several centuries.<p>Within the various uses of the word today, &quot;nature&quot; may refer to the general realm of various types of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects &ndash; the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the <a href="../../wp/w/Weather.htm" title="Weather">weather</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/Geology.htm" title="Geology">geology</a> of the Earth, and the <a href="../../wp/m/Matter.htm" title="Matter">matter</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Energy.htm" title="Energy">energy</a> of which all these things are composed. It is often taken to mean the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> natural environment&quot; or <!--del_lnk--> wilderness &ndash; wild animals, rocks, forest, beaches, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. This more traditional concept of natural things which can still be found today implies a distinction between the <a href="../../wp/n/Nature.htm" title="Natural">natural</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> artificial, with the latter being understood as that which has been brought into being by a <a href="../../wp/h/Human.htm" title="Human">human</a> or human-like <!--del_lnk--> consciousness or <a href="../../wp/m/Mind.htm" title="Mind">mind</a>.<p>

      <p><b>Earth</b> (or, &quot;the Earth&quot;) is the fifth largest <a href="../../wp/p/Planet.htm" title="Planet">planet</a> in the <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_System.htm" title="Solar system">solar system</a>, third in order of distance from the <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">Sun</a>. It is the largest of its <!--del_lnk--> planetary system&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> terrestrial planets and the only place in the <a href="../../wp/u/Universe.htm" title="Universe">universe</a> known to support life.<p>The most prominent features of the earth&#39;s climate are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow <a href="../../wp/t/Temperate.htm" title="Temperate">temperate</a> zones, and a wide <!--del_lnk--> equatorial <!--del_lnk--> tropical to <!--del_lnk--> subtropical region. <!--del_lnk--> Precipitation patterns vary widely according to location, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. About 70 percent of the surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents and islands, with the vast majority of the habitable land in the <!--del_lnk--> Northern Hemisphere.<p>Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions. The <a href="../../wp/c/Crust_%2528geology%2529.htm" title="Crust (geology)">outer surface</a> is divided into several <a href="../../wp/p/Plate_tectonics.htm" title="Tectonic plate">tectonic plates</a> that gradually migrate across the surface over geologic time spans, which at least several times have changed relatively quickly. The interior of the planet remains active, with a thick layer of molten <!--del_lnk--> Earth mantle and an iron-filled core that generates a <!--del_lnk--> magnetic field. The <!--del_lnk--> atmospheric conditions have been significantly altered from the original conditions by the presence of life forms, which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions. Despite the wide regional variations in climate by <!--del_lnk--> latitude and other geographic factors, the long-term average global climate is quite finely regulated, and variations of a degree or two of average global temperature have historically had major effects on the ecological balance, and on the actual geography of the Earth.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Based on the available evidence, scientists have reconstructed detailed information about the planet&#39;s past. Earth is believed to have formed about 4.55 billion years ago out of the <!--del_lnk--> solar nebula, along with the Sun and other planets. The moon formed relatively soon afterwards (roughly 20 million years later, or 4.53 billion years ago). Initially molten, the outer layer of the planet cooled, resulting in the solid crust. Outgassing and <a href="../../wp/v/Volcano.htm" title="Volcano">volcanic</a> activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing <!--del_lnk--> water vapor, augmented by <a href="../../wp/i/Ice.htm" title="Ice">ice</a> delivered by <a href="../../wp/c/Comet.htm" title="Comet">comets</a>, <!--del_lnk--> produced the oceans. The highly energetic chemistry is believed to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4 billion years ago.<p>Continents formed, then broke up and reformed as the surface of Earth reshaped itself over the course of hundreds of millions of years, occasionally combining to form a <!--del_lnk--> supercontinent. Roughly 750 million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent <!--del_lnk--> Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form <!--del_lnk--> Pannotia which broke apart about 540 million years ago, then finally <!--del_lnk--> Pangaea, which broke apart about 180 million years ago.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>There is significant evidence, still being discussed among scientists, that a severe <a href="../../wp/g/Glacier.htm" title="Glacier">glacial</a> action during the <!--del_lnk--> Neoproterozoic era covered much of the planet in a sheet of ice. This hypothesis has been termed the &quot;<a href="../../wp/s/Snowball_Earth.htm" title="Snowball Earth">Snowball Earth</a>&quot;, and it is of particular interest as it precedes the <a href="../../wp/c/Cambrian_explosion.htm" title="Cambrian explosion">Cambrian explosion</a> in which multicellular life forms began to widely proliferate about 530-540 million years ago.<p>Since the <a href="../../wp/c/Cambrian_explosion.htm" title="Cambrian explosion">Cambrian explosion</a> there have been five distinctly identifiable <!--del_lnk--> mass extinctions. The last mass extinction occurred some 65 million years ago, when a meteorite collision probably triggered the extinction of the <!--del_lnk--> non-avian <a href="../../wp/d/Dinosaur.htm" title="Dinosaur">dinosaurs</a> and other large reptiles, but spared small animals such as <a href="../../wp/m/Mammal.htm" title="Mammal">mammals</a>, which then resembled <!--del_lnk--> shrews. Over the past 65 million years, mammalian life diversified.<p>Several million years ago, a species of small African ape gained the ability to stand upright. The subsequent advent of human life, and the development of agriculture and further <a href="../../wp/c/Civilization.htm" title="Civilization">civilization</a> allowed humans to affect the Earth in a relatively short timespan like no other life form had before, affecting both the nature and quantity of other life forms as well as global climate.<p>A 1998 survey by the American Museum of Natural History found that 70% of biologists view the present era as part of a mass extinction event, the <!--del_lnk--> Holocene extinction event, the fastest to have ever occurred. Some, such as <!--del_lnk--> E. O. Wilson of <!--del_lnk--> Harvard University, predict that human destruction of the <a href="../../wp/b/Biosphere.htm" title="Biosphere">biosphere</a> could cause the extinction of one-half of all species in the next 100 years.  The extent of the current extinction event is still being researched, debated and calculated by biologists.<p><a id="Weather_and_climate" name="Weather_and_climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Weather and climate</span></h3>

      <p>The atmosphere of the Earth serves as a key factor in sustaining the planetary <!--del_lnk--> ecosystem. The thin layer of <a href="../../wp/g/Gas.htm" title="Gas">gases</a> that envelops the Earth are held in place by the planet&#39;s gravity. It consists of 78% <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen.htm" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, 21% <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a>, and traces of other gases. The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude, and has a <!--del_lnk--> scale height of 8.5 kilometres: the height at which the atmospheric pressure has delined by a factor of <i><!--del_lnk--> e</i>. The <!--del_lnk--> ozone layer of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere plays an important role in depleating the amount of <a href="../../wp/u/Ultraviolet.htm" title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> radiation that reaches the surface. As <a href="../../wp/d/DNA.htm" title="DNA">DNA</a> readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.<p>Terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the <!--del_lnk--> lower part of the atmosphere, and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat. Ocean currents are another important factor in determining climate, particularly the major underwater <!--del_lnk--> thermohaline circulation which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions. These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones. Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the polar regions much colder.<p>Weather can have both beneficial and harmful effects. Extremes in weather, such as <a href="../../wp/t/Tornado.htm" title="Tornado">tornadoes</a> or <a href="../../wp/t/Tropical_cyclone.htm" title="Hurricane">hurricanes</a> and <!--del_lnk--> cyclones, can expend large amounts of energy in their path and produce devastation. Surface vegetation has evolved a dependence on the seasonal variation of the weather, and sudden changes lasting only a few years can have a dramatic effect, both on the vegetation and on the animals dependent on the growths for food.<p>The planetary climate is a measure of the long-term trends in the weather. Various factors are known to <a href="../../wp/c/Climate_change.htm" title="Climate change">influence the climate</a>, including ocean currents, surface <!--del_lnk--> albedo, <!--del_lnk--> greenhouse gases, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the planet&#39;s orbit. Based on historical records, the Earth is known to have undergone drastic climate changes in the past, including <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_age.htm" title="Ice age">ice ages</a>. The climate of a region is dependent on a number of factors including latitude. A latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region. There are a number of such regions, ranging from the <!--del_lnk--> tropical climate at the equator to the <!--del_lnk--> polar climate in the northern and southern extremes. Weather is also influenced by the <!--del_lnk--> seasons, which result from the <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> axis being <!--del_lnk--> tilted to its <!--del_lnk--> orbital plane. Thus, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the planet is more directly exposed to the rays of the <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">Sun</a> (see <i>Fig. 1</i>). This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. At any given time, regardless of season, the <!--del_lnk--> northern and <!--del_lnk--> southern hemispheres experience opposite seasons.<p>Weather is a <!--del_lnk--> chaotic system that is readily modified by small changes to the environment, so accurate <a href="../../wp/m/Meteorology.htm" title="Meteorology">weather forecasting</a>, is currently limited to only a few days. Overall, two things are currently happening worldwide: (1) temperature is increasing on the average; and (2) weather patterns are changing and becoming increasingly chaotic.<p><a id="Life" name="Life"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Life</span></h2>

      <p>The advent of <a href="../../wp/p/Photosynthesis.htm" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a> in very basic forms of plant life worldwide allowed the sun&#39;s energy to be harvested to create conditions allowing for more complex life. The resultant <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> accumulated in the atmosphere and gave rise to the <!--del_lnk--> ozone layer. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the <!--del_lnk--> development of yet more complex cells called <!--del_lnk--> eukaryotes. Cells within colonies became increasingly specialized, resulting in true multicellular organisms. With the ozone layer absorbing harmful <!--del_lnk--> ultraviolet radiation, life colonized the surface of Earth.<p>Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by <a href="../../wp/o/Organism.htm" title="Organism">organization</a>, <!--del_lnk--> metabolism, <!--del_lnk--> growth, <!--del_lnk--> adaptation, response to <!--del_lnk--> stimuli and <!--del_lnk--> reproduction. Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of <a href="../../wp/o/Organism.htm" title="Organism">organisms</a>. Properties common to terrestrial organisms (<a href="../../wp/p/Plant.htm" title="Plant">plants</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Animal.htm" title="Animal">animals</a>, <!--del_lnk--> fungi, <!--del_lnk--> protists, <!--del_lnk--> archaea and <a href="../../wp/b/Bacteria.htm" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a>) are that they are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. An entity with these properties is generally considered life. However, not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential. Human-made <!--del_lnk--> analogs of life may also be considered to be life.<p>The <a href="../../wp/b/Biosphere.htm" title="Biosphere">biosphere</a> is the part of Earth&#39;s outer shell &mdash; including air, land, surface rocks and water &mdash; within which life occurs, and which <!--del_lnk--> biotic processes in turn alter or transform. From the broadest <!--del_lnk--> geophysiological point of view, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the <!--del_lnk--> lithosphere (rocks), <!--del_lnk--> hydrosphere (water), and <!--del_lnk--> atmosphere (air). Currently the entire Earth contains over 75 billion tons (150 <i>trillion</i> pounds or about 6.8 x10<sup>13</sup> kg) of <!--del_lnk--> biomass (life), which lives within various environments within the biosphere. Over nine-tenths of the total biomass on Earth is plant life, on which animal life depends very heavily for its existence. More than 2 million species of plant and animal life have been identified to date, and estimates of the actual number of existing species range from several million to well over 50 million. The number of individual species of life is constantly in some degree of flux, with new species appearing and others ceasing to exist on a continual basis. The total number of species presently is in rapid decline.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The distinction between plant and animal life is not sharply drawn, with some categories of life that stand between or across the two. Originally <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> divided all living things between plants, which generally do not move, and animals. In <a href="../../wp/c/Carolus_Linnaeus.htm" title="Carolus Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a>&#39; system, these became the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdoms <!--del_lnk--> Vegetabilia (later <!--del_lnk--> Plantae) and <a href="../../wp/a/Animal.htm" title="Animal">Animalia</a>. Since then, it has become clear that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the <a href="../../wp/f/Fungus.htm" title="Fungus">fungi</a> and several groups of <!--del_lnk--> algae were removed to new kingdoms. However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts. Bacterial life is sometimes included in flora, and some classifications use the term <i>bacterial flora</i> separately from <i>plant flora</i>.<p>Among the many ways of classifying plants are by regional <!--del_lnk--> floras, which, depending on the purpose of study, can also include <i>fossil flora</i>, remnants of plant life from a previous era. People in many regions and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic flora, which can vary widely across the globe due to differences in climate and <!--del_lnk--> terrain. Regional floras commonly are divided into categories such as <i>native flora</i> and <i>agricultural and garden flora</i>, the latter of which are intentionally grown and cultivated. Some types of &quot;native flora&quot; actually have been introduced centuries ago by people migrating from one region or continent to another, and become an integral part of the native, or natural flora of the place to which they were introduced. This is an example of how human interaction with nature can blur the boundary of what is considered nature. Another category of plant has historically been carved out for <i>weeds</i>. Though the term has fallen into disfavor among <!--del_lnk--> botanists as a formal way to categorize &quot;useless&quot; plants, the informal use of the word &quot;weeds&quot; to describe those plants that are deemed worthy of elimination is illustrative of the general tendency of people and societies to seek to alter or shape the course of nature. Similarly, animals are often categorized in ways such as <i>domestic</i>, <i>farm animals</i>, <i>wild animals</i>, <i>pests</i>, etc. according to their relationship to human life.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Animals as a category have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things, though not traced by scientists to having legs or wings instead of roots and leaves. Animals are <a href="../../wp/e/Eukaryote.htm" title="Eukaryote">eukaryotic</a> and usually <!--del_lnk--> multicellular (although see <!--del_lnk--> Myxozoa), which separates them from <a href="../../wp/b/Bacteria.htm" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a>, <!--del_lnk--> archaea and most <!--del_lnk--> protists. They are <!--del_lnk--> heterotrophic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from <a href="../../wp/p/Plant.htm" title="Plant">plants</a> and <!--del_lnk--> algae. They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and <a href="../../wp/f/Fungus.htm" title="Fungus">fungi</a> by lacking <!--del_lnk--> cell walls. With a few exceptions, most notably the <!--del_lnk--> sponges (Phylum Porifera), animals have bodies differen&shy;tiated into separate <!--del_lnk--> tissues. These include <!--del_lnk--> muscles, which are able to contract and control locomotion, and a <!--del_lnk--> nervous system, which sends and processes signals. There is also typically an internal <!--del_lnk--> digestive chamber. The eukaryotic cells possessed by all animals are surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of <!--del_lnk--> collagen and elastic <!--del_lnk--> glycoproteins. This may be calcified to form structures like <!--del_lnk--> shells, <!--del_lnk--> bones, and <!--del_lnk--> spicules, a framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized during development and maturation, and which supports the complex anatomy required for mobility.<p>Although humans currently comprise only about one-half of one percent of the total living biomass on Earth, the human effect on nature is disproportionately large. Because of the extent of human influence, the boundaries between what we regard as nature and &quot;made environments&quot; is not clear cut except at the extremes. Even at the extremes, the amount of natural environment that is free of discernible human influence is presently diminishing at an increasingly rapid pace, or, according to some, has already disappeared.<p><a id="Ecosystems" name="Ecosystems"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Ecosystems</span></h2>

      <p>All forms of life are highly interactive with the environment in which they exist, and also with other life forms. In the 20th century this premise gave rise to the concept of <b>ecosystems</b>, which can be defined as any situation where there is interaction between organisms and their environment. Ecosystems are composed of a variety of <!--del_lnk--> abiotic and <!--del_lnk--> biotic components that function in an interrelated way. Some of the more important components are: soil, atmosphere, radiation from the sun, water, and living organisms. Each living organism has a continual relationship with every other element that makes up its environment. Within the ecosystem, species are connected and dependent upon one another in the <!--del_lnk--> food chain, and exchange <a href="../../wp/e/Energy.htm" title="Energy">energy</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Matter.htm" title="Matter">matter</a> between themselves as well as with their environment. Michael Pidwirny, in <i>Fundamentals of Physical Geography</i>, describes the concept as follows:<blockquote>
       <p>Ecosystems are dynamic entities composed of the biological community and the abiotic environment. An ecosystem&#39;s abiotic and biotic composition and structure is determined by the state of a number of interrelated environmental factors. Changes in any of these factors (for example: nutrient availability, temperature, light intensity, grazing intensity, and species population density) will result in dynamic changes to the nature of these systems. For example, a fire in the temperate deciduous forest completely changes the structure of that system. There are no longer any large trees, most of the mosses, herbs, and shrubs that occupy the forest floor are gone, and the nutrients that were stored in the biomass are quickly released into the soil, atmosphere and hydrologic system. After a short time of recovery, the community that was once large mature trees now becomes a community of grasses, herbaceous species, and tree seedlings.</blockquote>
      <p>Every species has limits of tolerance to factors that affect its survival, reproductive success and ability to continue to thrive and interact sustainably with the rest of its environment, which in turn may have effects on these factors for many other species or even on the whole of life. The concept of an ecosystem is thus an important subject of study, as such study provides information needed to make decisions about how human life may interact in a way that allows the various ecosystems to be sustained for future use rather than used up or otherwise rendered ineffective. For the purpose of such study, a unit of smaller size is called a <i><!--del_lnk--> microecosystem</i>. For example, an ecosystem can be a stone and all the life under it. A <i>macroecosystem</i> might involve a whole <!--del_lnk--> ecoregion, with its <!--del_lnk--> drainage basin.<p>The following ecosystems are examples of the kinds currently under intensive study:<ul>
       <li>&quot;continental ecosystems&quot;, such as &quot;forest ecosystems&quot;, &quot;meadow ecosystems&quot; such as <!--del_lnk--> steppes or <!--del_lnk--> savannas), or <!--del_lnk--> agro-ecosystems,<li>systems in inland waters, such as <!--del_lnk--> lentic ecosystem&quot;s such as <!--del_lnk--> lakes or <a href="../../wp/p/Pond.htm" title="Pond">ponds</a>; or <!--del_lnk--> lotic ecosystems such as <a href="../../wp/r/River.htm" title="River">rivers</a>,<li><!--del_lnk--> oceanic ecosystems.</ul>
      <p>Another classification can be made by reference to its communities, such as in the case of a <!--del_lnk--> human ecosystem. The broadest classification, today under wide study and analysis, and also subject to widespread arguments about its nature and validity, is that of the entire sum of life seen as analogous to a self-sustaining organism, known as the <!--del_lnk--> Gaia theory.<p><a id="Human_relationship_with_nature" name="Human_relationship_with_nature"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Human relationship with nature</span></h2>
      <p>The development of technology by the human race has allowed the greater exploitation of natural resources and has helped to alleviate some of the risk from natural hazards. In spite of this progress, however, the fate of human civilization remains closely linked to changes in the enviroment. There exists a highly complex feedback-loop between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood.<p>Humans employ nature for both leisure and economic activities. The acquisition of natural resources for industrial use remains a primary component of the world&#39;s economic system. Some activities, such as <!--del_lnk--> hunting and <a href="../../wp/f/Fishing.htm" title="Fishing">fishing</a>, are used for both sustenance and leisure, often by different people. <!--del_lnk--> the adoption of agriculture was first adopted around the <!--del_lnk--> 9th millennium BCE. Ranging from food production to <a href="../../wp/e/Energy.htm" title="Energy">energy</a>, nature influences economic wealth.<p>Human beings have also made medicinal use of plants for thousands of years. Plant extracts can treat cramps, heal rhumatism and cure lung inflammation .. While science has enabled us to process natural substances into pills, tinctures, powders and essential oils., the market economy and the &#39;authority&#39; status attributed to the medical fraternity have made their use less popular. The term <!--del_lnk--> alternative medicine is often attributed to the use of natural plants and extracts for healing purposes.<p>Manmade threats to nature include <a href="../../wp/p/Pollution.htm" title="Pollution">pollution</a>, <!--del_lnk--> deforestation, and disasters such as oil spills.

      <p><b>Wilderness</b> is generally defined as a <!--del_lnk--> natural environment on <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a> that has not been directly modified by <a href="../../wp/h/Human.htm" title="Human">human</a> activity. <!--del_lnk--> Ecologists consider wilderness areas to be an integral part of the planet&#39;s self-sustaining natural <!--del_lnk--> ecosystem (the <a href="../../wp/b/Biosphere.htm" title="Biosphere">biosphere</a>).<p>The word, &quot;wilderness&quot;, derives from the notion of <!--del_lnk--> wildness; in other words that which is not controllable by humans. The word&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> etymology is from the <!--del_lnk--> Old English <i>wildeornes</i>, which in turn derives from <i>wildeor</i> meaning <i>wild <!--del_lnk--> beast</i> (wild + deor = beast, deer). From this point of view, it is the wildness of a place that makes it a wilderness. The mere presence or activity of people does not disqualify an area from being &quot;wilderness.&quot; Many ecosystems that are, or have been, inhabited or influenced by activities of people may still be considered &quot;wild.&quot; This way of looking at wilderness includes areas within which <strong class="selflink">natural processes</strong> operate without very noticeable human interference.<p>Looked at through the lens of the <a href="../../wp/v/Visual_arts.htm" title="Visual arts">visual arts</a>, nature and wildness have been important subjects in various epochs of world history. An early tradition of <!--del_lnk--> landscape art occurred in the <!--del_lnk--> Tang Dynasty (618-907). The tradition of representing nature <i>as it is</i> became one of the aims of <!--del_lnk--> Chinese painting and was a significant influence in Asian art. Artists learned to depict mountains and rivers &ldquo;from the perspective of nature as a whole and on the basis of their understanding of the laws of nature &hellip; as if seen through the eyes of a bird.&rdquo; In the 13th century, <!--del_lnk--> Shih Erh Chi listed &quot;scenes lacking any places made inaccessible by nature,&rdquo; as one of the 12 things to avoid in painting. <p>In the <!--del_lnk--> Western world the idea of wilderness having intrinsic value emerged in the 1800s, especially in the works of the <!--del_lnk--> Romantic movement. <!--del_lnk--> British artists <a href="../../wp/j/John_Constable.htm" title="John Constable">John Constable</a> and <!--del_lnk--> JMW Turner turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings. Before that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings. <!--del_lnk--> William Wordsworth&rsquo;s poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place. Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture. <p><a id="Beauty_in_nature" name="Beauty_in_nature"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Beauty in nature</span></h2>

      <p>Beauty in nature is a common theme in modern life and in art, and books emphasizing beauty in nature fill large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much <a href="../../wp/a/Art.htm" title="Art">art</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Photography.htm" title="Photography">photography</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Poetry.htm" title="Poetry">poetry</a> and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Why this association exists, and what the association consists of, is studied by the branch of philosophy called <a href="../../wp/a/Aesthetics.htm" title="Aesthetics">aesthetics</a>. Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless.<p>Many scientists, who study nature in more specific and organized ways, also share the conviction that nature is beautiful; the French mathematician, <!--del_lnk--> Jules Henri Poincar&eacute; (1854-1912) said:<blockquote>
       <p>The scientist does not study nature because it is useful; he studies it because he delights in it, and he delights in it because it is beautiful.<br /> If nature were not beautiful, it would not be worth knowing, and if nature were not worth knowing, life would not be worth living. Of course I do not here speak of that beauty which strikes the senses, the beauty of qualities and of appearance; not that I undervalue such beauty, far from it, but it has nothing to do with science; I mean that profounder beauty which comes from the harmonious order of the parts and which a pure intelligence can grasp.</blockquote>
      <p>A common classical idea of beautiful art involves the word <!--del_lnk--> mimesis, the imitation of nature. Also in the realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that the perfect is implied through symmetry, equal division, and other perfect mathematical <!--del_lnk--> forms and notions.<div class="thumb tleft">
