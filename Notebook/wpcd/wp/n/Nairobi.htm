Founded in <!--del_lnk--> 1899, the city was handed capital status from <!--del_lnk--> Mombasa in <!--del_lnk--> 1907. It is also the capital of the <!--del_lnk--> Nairobi Province. The city lies on the <!--del_lnk--> Nairobi River, in the south of the nation, and has an elevation of 5450ft (1661m) above <!--del_lnk--> sea-level.<p>Nairobi has the highest urban population in <a href="../../wp/e/East_Africa.htm" title="East Africa">East Africa</a>, estimated at between 3 and 4 million (according to the 1999 Census, in the administrative area of Nairobi, 2,143,254 inhabitants lived within 684 km&sup2;). Since its foundation as a railway camp in 1899, Nairobi has grown to become the largest city in <a href="../../wp/k/Kenya.htm" title="Kenya">Kenya</a>, and one of the largest cities in <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>.<p>Nairobi is now one of the prime cities in Africa politically and financially. Home to many companies and organizations, Nairobi is established as a hub for business and culture. The <!--del_lnk--> GaWC defines Nairobi as a prominent social centre.<p>

      <p>The area was an essentially uninhabited <!--del_lnk--> swamp until in <!--del_lnk--> 1899 a supply <!--del_lnk--> depot of the <!--del_lnk--> Uganda Railway was built, which soon became the railway&#39;s headquarters. The city was named after a water hole known in <!--del_lnk--> Maasai as <i>Ewaso Nyirobi</i>, meaning &quot;cool waters&quot;. It was totally rebuilt in the early <!--del_lnk--> 1900s after an outbreak of <!--del_lnk--> plague and the burning of the original town.<p>Nairobi replaced Mombasa as the capital of the <!--del_lnk--> British East Africa Protectorate in <!--del_lnk--> 1905. The railway brought wealth into the city, which made it grow dramatically. It then became Kenya&#39;s second largest town after Mombasa.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1901 it became the capital of the <!--del_lnk--> British <!--del_lnk--> protectorate, and the city grew around <!--del_lnk--> administration and <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">tourism</a>, initially in the form of <!--del_lnk--> big game hunting. As the British colonialists started to explore the region, they started using Nairobi as their first port of call. This prompted the colonial government to build several <!--del_lnk--> grand hotels in the city. The main occupants were British <!--del_lnk--> game hunters.<p>Nairobi continued to grow under the British rule, and many British peoples settled within the city&#39;s suburbs. The continuous expansion of the city began to anger the <!--del_lnk--> Maasai people, as the city was devouring their land to the south. It also angered the <!--del_lnk--> Kikuyu people, who wanted the land returned to them.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In 1919, Nairobi was declared to be a <!--del_lnk--> municipality. Between the years of 1920 and 1950, the number of white settlers within Nairobi rose from 9,000 to 80,000. There was, however, friction that existed between these settlers and the local peoples. Nairobi was granted <a href="../../wp/c/City.htm" title="City">city</a> status in 1954.<p>After the end of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, this friction developed into the <!--del_lnk--> Mau Mau rebellion. <!--del_lnk--> Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya&#39;s future president, was jailed for his involvement even though there was no evidence linking him to the rebellion. Pressure exerted from the locals onto the British resulted in Kenyan independence in 1963, with Nairobi as the capital of the new republic.<p>After independence, Nairobi grew rapidly and this growth put pressure on the city&#39;s infrastructure. Power cuts and water shortages were a common occurrence, though in the past few years better city planning has helped to put some these problems in check.<p>The <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">U.S.</a> Embassy in Nairobi was bombed in August <!--del_lnk--> 1998 by <!--del_lnk--> Al-Qaida, killing over 200 civilians, one of a series of <!--del_lnk--> U.S. embassy bombings. It is now the site of a memorial park.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>
      <p>Nairobi is a cosmopolitan and multicultural religious city, with many immigrants from former British colonies, including <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Somalia.htm" title="Somalia">Somalia</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Sudan.htm" title="Sudan">Sudan</a>. This is highlighted in the number of churches, mosques, temples and <!--del_lnk--> gurdwaras within the city. As a reflection of the cities multicultural composition, the night life offers a diverse range of watering holes.<p>Nairobi has the informal title &quot;The Green City in the Sun.&quot;<p><a id="Literature_and_Film" name="Literature_and_Film"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Literature and Film</span></h3>
      <p>Perhaps the most famous book and film set in Nairobi, is <!--del_lnk--> Out of Africa. The book was written by <!--del_lnk--> Karen Blixen (pen name Isak Dinesen), and it is her account of living in <a href="../../wp/k/Kenya.htm" title="Kenya">Kenya</a>. Karen Blixen lived in the Nairobi Area from 1917 to 1931, and the neighbourhood in which she lived, <!--del_lnk--> Karen, is named after her.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1985, <!--del_lnk--> Out of Africa was made into a film, directed by <!--del_lnk--> Sydney Pollack. The film won 28 awards, including 7 <!--del_lnk--> Academy Awards. The popularity of the film prompted the opening of Nairobi&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Karen Blixen Museum.<p>Nairobi has been the set of several other <a href="../../wp/c/Cinema_of_the_United_States.htm" title="Cinema of the United States">American</a> and <!--del_lnk--> British films. The most recent of these was <!--del_lnk--> The Constant Gardener (2005), a large part of which was filmed in the city. The story revolves around a British <!--del_lnk--> diplomat in Nairobi whose wife is murdered in northern Kenya. Much of the filming was in the <!--del_lnk--> Kibera slum.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>At 1860 metres, Nairobi enjoys a fairly moderate climate. The altitude makes for some chilly evenings, especially in the June/July season when the temperature can drop to 10&deg;C . The sunniest and warmest part of the year are from December to March, when temperatures average the mid-twenties during the day. The temperature usually peaks at 25 &deg;C. There are two rainy seasons but rainfall can be moderate. The cloudiest part of the year is just after the first rainy season, when, until September, conditions are usually overcast with drizzle. As Nairobi is situated close to the equator, the differences between the seasons are minimal. The seasons are referred to as the <!--del_lnk--> wet season and <!--del_lnk--> dry season. The timing of sunrise and sunset do not vary tremendously throughout the year.<p><a id="Parks_and_Gardens" name="Parks_and_Gardens"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Parks and Gardens</span></h2>

      <p>Nairobi is served primarily by <!--del_lnk--> Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. It is the largest airport in East and Central Africa and handled over 4 million passengers in 2005. The airport is a major transit hub for passengers flying to East Africa&#39;s natural attractions, and other smaller African cities. The airport is situated 20km from Nairobi&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Central Business District, and is served by taxis, shuttle services and coaches. The airport directly serves intercontinental passengers from <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a>.<p><!--del_lnk--> Wilson Airport is a small, busy airport to the west of Nairobi. It handles small aircraft that generally operate within Kenya, although some offer services to other East African destinations.<p><!--del_lnk--> Eastleigh Airport was the original landing strip in the pre-<!--del_lnk--> jet <!--del_lnk--> airline era. It was used in a landing point on the <!--del_lnk--> 1930s and <!--del_lnk--> 1940s <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> passenger and <!--del_lnk--> mail route from <a href="../../wp/s/Southampton.htm" title="Southampton">Southampton</a> to <a href="../../wp/c/Cape_Town.htm" title="Cape Town">Cape Town</a>.

      <p>Buses are the most common form of public transport in Nairobi. <!--del_lnk--> Matatus, privately owned minibuses, are the most popular form of local transport, and generally transport up to 12 people. Matatus operate within Nairobi and from Nairobi to other towns. The matatu&#39;s destination is imprinted on the side of the bus.<p>Matatus were easily distinguishable by their extravagant paint schemes. Owners would paint their matau with their favourite <a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Association football">football</a> team or <a href="../../wp/h/Hip_hop_music.htm" title="Hip hop music">hip hop</a> artist. They were notorious for their poor safety records, which was a result of overcrowding and reckless driving. Matatu drivers were pressured to make as many round trips as possible to maximize profits for their operator.<p>However, in 2004 a law was passed in which all matatus had to include seat-belts, speed governors, and all be painted in a uniform white with yellow band across it. At first, this caused a furore amongst matatu operators, but they were pressured by government and public pressure to make the changes. The limit to matatus is now 80<!--del_lnk--> kph.<p><!--del_lnk--> Citi Hoppa is the newest bus fleet operating in Nairobi. Run privately, the Citi Hoppa offer modern buses on many routes within the city. The Citi Hoppa buses are distinguishable by their green livery.<p><a id="Railways" name="Railways"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Railways</span></h3>
      <p>Nairobi was founded as a railway town, and the <!--del_lnk--> Kenya Railways (KR) main headquarters are still situated there, near the city centre. The line runs through Nairobi, from <!--del_lnk--> Mombasa to <!--del_lnk--> Kampala. Its main use is freight traffic, but regular nightly passenger trains connect Mombasa, Nairobi and Kisumu. A number of morning and evening commuter trains connect the centre with the suburbs, but the city has no proper light rail, tramway or subway lines. A JKI airport shuttle rail service is being contemplated.<p>Nairobi is also the junction for a branch railway to <!--del_lnk--> Nanyuki.<p><a id="Central_business_district_and_skyline" name="Central_business_district_and_skyline"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Central business district and skyline</span></h2>

      <p>Nairobi grew around the <!--del_lnk--> central business district. It takes a rectangular shape, around the Uhuru Highway, Haille Selasse Avenue, Moi Avenue and University Way. It includes many of Nairobi&#39;s important buildings, including the City Hall and Parliament Building. The city square is also located within the perimeter.<p>A feature of the central business district that strikes foreign tourists the most is the <!--del_lnk--> skyline. Nairobi&#39;s skyline has been compared to many Asian and American cities. This is due to a construction boom after independence, and another construction boom in the late <!--del_lnk--> 1990s and early <!--del_lnk--> 2000s. Most of the skyscrapers in this region are the headquarters of businesses and corporations, such as I&amp;M. The United States Embassy bombing took place in this district, prompting the new embassy building to be located in the suburbs.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 2006, a large beautification project took place in the CBD, as the city prepared to host the 2006 <!--del_lnk--> Afri-Cities summit. Iconic buildings such as the <!--del_lnk--> Kenyatta International Conference Centre had their exteriors cleaned and repainted.<p>The district is bordered to the south-west by Nairobi&#39;s largest park: <!--del_lnk--> Uhuru Park and <!--del_lnk--> Central Park. The <!--del_lnk--> Mombasa to <!--del_lnk--> Kampala railway runs to the south-east of the district.<p>Today, many businesses have, or are considering relocating or establishing their headquarters outside the Central Business District. This is because land is cheaper, and better facilities can be easily built and maintained elsewhere. Two areas that are seeing a growth in companies and office-space are Upper Hill, approximately 2 km from the CBD and <!--del_lnk--> Westlands, approximately the same distance. Companies that have moved from the CBD to Upper Hill include Citibank.<p>To accommodate the large demand for floorspace in Nairobi, various commercial projects are being constructed. New business parks are being built along Mombasa Road, including the flagship <!--del_lnk--> Nairobi Business Park. Nairobi is currently being considered by a Middle-Eastern company, interested in building a high-rise headquarters in Africa.<p><a id="List_of_Nairobi.27s_tallest_skyscrapers" name="List_of_Nairobi.27s_tallest_skyscrapers"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">List of Nairobi&#39;s tallest skyscrapers</span></h3>

      <p>Nairobi is home to several <!--del_lnk--> slums. The growth of these slums is a result of migration from rural areas to the capital. Unable to find work, these migrants settle in the slums.<p><!--del_lnk--> Kibera is the largest and poorest slum in Africa <!--del_lnk--> , and is situated to the west of Nairobi. Between 500,000 and 1 million people live in Kibera, which dates from a 1920 settlement for <!--del_lnk--> Nubian soldiers (&quot;Kibera&quot; is the Nubian word for &quot;forest&quot;). The slums cover two square kilometres <!--del_lnk-->  and is on government land. Kibera has been the setting for several films, the most recent being the <!--del_lnk--> Constant Gardener.<p>Other notable slums include <!--del_lnk--> Mathare and <!--del_lnk--> Korogocho. Among other low and lower-middle income estates are <!--del_lnk--> Kariokor, <!--del_lnk--> Dandora, <!--del_lnk--> Kariobangi, <!--del_lnk--> Embakasi, <!--del_lnk--> Huruma and <!--del_lnk--> Dagoretti.

      <p>Most Nairobi non slum-dwellers live in relatively good housing conditions. Large houses can be found in many neighbourhoods, especially to the west of Nairobi. Historically, British immigrants have settled in <!--del_lnk--> Langata and <!--del_lnk--> Karen. Other middle and high income estates include <!--del_lnk--> Parklands, <!--del_lnk--> Westlands, <!--del_lnk--> Hurlingham, <!--del_lnk--> Milimani and <!--del_lnk--> Nairobi Hill.<p>To accommodate the growing middle-class, many new apartments and housing developments are being built in and around the city. The most notable development is <i>Greenpark</i>, at <!--del_lnk--> Athi River town, 25 km from Nairobi&#39;s CBD. Over 5,000 houses, villas and apartments are being constructed at this development, including leisure, retail and commercial facilities. The development is being marketed at families, as are most within the city.<p><a id="Crime" name="Crime"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Crime</span></h2>

Due to their lack of wealth, they are left with no option but to settle in <!--del_lnk--> slums such as Kibera.<p>Most large houses now have a watchguard, burglar grills on windows and doors, and dogs to patrol their grounds during the night.
