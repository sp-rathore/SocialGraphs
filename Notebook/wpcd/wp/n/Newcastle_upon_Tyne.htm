      <p><b>Newcastle upon Tyne</b>, often shortened to <b>Newcastle</b>, is a <a href="../../wp/c/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="City status in the United Kingdom">city</a> and <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan borough of <!--del_lnk--> Tyne and Wear situated on the north bank of the <!--del_lnk--> River Tyne, in <!--del_lnk--> North East England. The city was founded in <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman</a> times under the name <i>Pons Aelius</i>, with the current name being adopted from 1080 onwards. It was once the <!--del_lnk--> county town of <!--del_lnk--> Northumberland <!--del_lnk--> .<p>The city is the <!--del_lnk--> 20th most populous in England and the <!--del_lnk--> Tyneside conurbation, of which Newcastle forms part, is the <!--del_lnk--> 5th most populous conurbation in England. Newcastle is a member of the <!--del_lnk--> English Core Cities Group.<p>Technically, people from Newcastle are <i>Novocastrians</i> (a <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> term which can equally be applied to residents of <!--del_lnk--> any place called Newcastle), although the term <!--del_lnk--> Geordie is now more commonly used.<p>The name of the city is pronounced <i>new-CASS-el</i> in the north of England, and <i>NEW-cah-sel</i> in the south.<p>

      <p>Newcastle, known at the time as &quot;Pons Aelius&quot; was founded by the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Hadrian, whose <a href="../../wp/h/Hadrian%2527s_Wall.htm" title="Hadrian&#39;s Wall">Wall</a> is still visible in parts of Newcastle, particularly along the West Road. The course of the &quot;Roman Wall&quot; can also be traced eastwards to <!--del_lnk--> Wallsend (<!--del_lnk--> Segedunum).<p>After the Roman withdrawal from Britain, Newcastle became part of the powerful <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon kingdom of <!--del_lnk--> Northumbria and was known throughout this period as <i>Monkchester</i>. After a series of conflicts with the <!--del_lnk--> Danes and the devastation north of the <!--del_lnk--> River Tyne inflicted by <!--del_lnk--> Odo after the 1080 rebellion against the <!--del_lnk--> Normans, Monkchester was all but destroyed. Because of its strategic position, <!--del_lnk--> Robert Curthose, son of <a href="../../wp/w/William_I_of_England.htm" title="William I of England">William the Conqueror</a>, erected a wooden castle there in 1080 and the town was henceforth known as Novum Castellum or <i>New Castle</i>.<p>Throughout the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, Newcastle was England&#39;s northern fortress. A 25ft high stone <!--del_lnk--> wall was built around the town to defend it from invaders during the <!--del_lnk--> Border war against <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>. The Scots king <!--del_lnk--> William the Lion was imprisoned in Newcastle in 1174, and <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_I_of_England.htm" title="Edward I of England">Edward I</a> brought the <!--del_lnk--> Stone of Scone and <!--del_lnk--> William Wallace south through the town. Newcastle was successfully defended against the Scots three times during the <!--del_lnk--> 14th century and around this time became a <!--del_lnk--> county corporate.<p>King <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_I_of_England.htm" title="Charles I of England">Charles</a> bestowed upon Newcastle the East of England coal trading rights. This monopoly helped Newcastle prosper, but it had its impact on the growth of near-neighbours <!--del_lnk--> Gateshead and <!--del_lnk--> Sunderland, causing a North of Tyne/South of Tyne and a <!--del_lnk--> Tyne-Wear rivalry that still exists. During the <!--del_lnk--> English Civil War, Newcastle supported the king and in 1644 was stormed (&#39;with roaring drummes&#39;) by <a href="../../wp/o/Oliver_Cromwell.htm" title="Oliver Cromwell">Cromwell&#39;s</a> Scots allies, based in pro-Parliament Sunderland. The grateful King bestowed the <!--del_lnk--> motto <i>&quot;Fortiter Defendit Triumphans&quot;</i> (&quot;Triumphing by a brave defence&quot;) upon the town. Ironically, Charles was imprisoned in Newcastle by the Scots in 1646-7.<p>In the 18th century, Newcastle was the country&#39;s largest print centre after London, Oxford and Cambridge, and the <!--del_lnk--> Literary and Philosophical Society of 1793, with its erudite debates and large stock of books in several languages predated the <!--del_lnk--> London Library by half a century. Newcastle also became the greatest glass producer in the world. Newcastle&#39;s development as a major city, however, owed most to its central role in the export of <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a>. The phrase <i><!--del_lnk--> taking coals to Newcastle</i> was first recorded in 1538. In the <!--del_lnk--> nineteenth century, <!--del_lnk--> shipbuilding and heavy <a href="../../wp/e/Engineering.htm" title="Engineering">engineering</a> were central to the city&#39;s prosperity; and the city was a powerhouse of the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>. Innovation in Newcastle and surrounding areas included the development of <!--del_lnk--> Safety lamps, <!--del_lnk--> Stephenson&#39;s Rocket, <!--del_lnk--> Lord Armstrong&#39;s artillery, <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Swan&#39;s electric light bulbs, and <!--del_lnk--> Charles Parsons&#39; invention of the <!--del_lnk--> steam turbine, which led to the revolution of marine propulsion and the production of <!--del_lnk--> cheap electricity.<p>Heavy industries in Newcastle declined in the second half of the <!--del_lnk--> twentieth century; office and retail employment are now the city&#39;s staples.<p><a id="Urban_development" name="Urban_development"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Urban development</span></h3>

      <p>The city has an extensive <!--del_lnk--> neoclassical centre, largely developed in the 1830s by <!--del_lnk--> Richard Grainger and <!--del_lnk--> John Dobson, and recently extensively restored. <!--del_lnk--> Grey Street, which curves down from <!--del_lnk--> Grey&#39;s Monument towards the valley of the <!--del_lnk--> River Tyne, was voted as England&#39;s finest street in 2005 in a survey of <!--del_lnk--> BBC Radio 4 listeners. A portion of <!--del_lnk--> Grainger Town was demolished in the 1960s to make way for the <!--del_lnk--> Eldon Square <!--del_lnk--> shopping centre, including all but one side of the original Eldon Square itself.<p><a id="Parks_and_open_space" name="Parks_and_open_space"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Parks and open space</span></h4>
      <p>Immediately to the northwest of the city centre is Leazes Park, established in 1873 after a petition by 3,000 working men of the city for &quot;ready access to some open ground for the purpose of health and recreation&quot;. Just outside one corner of this is <!--del_lnk--> St James&#39; Park, the stadium home of <!--del_lnk--> Newcastle United F.C. which dominates the view of the city from the south.<p>Another green space in Newcastle is the vast <!--del_lnk--> Town Moor, lying immediately north of the city centre. It is larger than <!--del_lnk--> Hyde Park and <a href="../../wp/h/Hampstead_Heath.htm" title="Hampstead Heath">Hampstead Heath</a> put together and the <!--del_lnk--> freemen of the city have the right to graze cattle on it. Unlike other cities where similar rights exist, they often take advantage of this, leading to the somewhat bizarre sight of cattle grazing within yards of the city&#39;s town hall or &quot;Civic Centre&quot;. The right incidentally extends to the pitch of St James&#39; Park, Newcastle United Football Club&#39;s ground, though this is not exercised. Honorary freemen include <!--del_lnk--> Bob Geldof, <a href="../../wp/n/Nelson_Mandela.htm" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Alan Shearer and the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Shakespeare Company. <!--del_lnk--> The Hoppings <!--del_lnk--> funfair, said to be the largest travelling <!--del_lnk--> fair in Europe, is held here annually in June.<p>The wooded gorge of the Ouseburn in the east of the city is known as <!--del_lnk--> Jesmond Dene and forms another popular recreation area, linked by Armstrong Park and Heaton Park to the Ouseburn Valley, where the river finally reaches the <!--del_lnk--> River Tyne.<p><a id="Recent_developments" name="Recent_developments"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Recent developments</span></h3>
      <p>The development of the city in the 1960s and 1970s saw the demoliton of part of Graingertown as a prelude to the modernist rebuilding initiatives of <!--del_lnk--> T. Dan Smith, the leader of Newcastle City Council. A corruption scandal was uncovered involving Smith and <!--del_lnk--> John Poulson, a property developer, and both were jailed. Echoes of the scandal were revisited in the late 1990s in the <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a> TV mini-series, <i><!--del_lnk--> Our Friends in the North</i>.<p>The Tyne gorge between Newcastle (on the north Bank) and <!--del_lnk--> Gateshead (an administratively separate borough) on the south, is famous for a series of dramatic bridges, including the <!--del_lnk--> Tyne Bridge of 1928 and <a href="../../wp/r/Robert_Stephenson.htm" title="Robert Stephenson">Robert Stephenson</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> High Level Bridge of 1849, the first road/rail bridge in the world. Large-scale <!--del_lnk--> regeneration has replaced former shipping premises with imposing new office developments; an innovative tilting bridge, the <!--del_lnk--> Gateshead Millennium Bridge was commissioned by <!--del_lnk--> Gateshead and has integrated the older Newcastle <!--del_lnk--> Quayside more closely with major cultural developments in Gateshead, including the <!--del_lnk--> BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art and the <!--del_lnk--> Norman Foster-designed <!--del_lnk--> Sage music centre. NewcastleGateshead Quayside is now a thriving, cosmopolitan area with an abundance of bars, restaurants and public spaces. As a tourist promotion, Newcastle and Gateshead have linked together under the banner &quot;NewcastleGateshead&quot;, but otherwise remain separate.<p>Notable Newcastle housing developments include <!--del_lnk--> Ralph Erskine&#39;s the <!--del_lnk--> Byker Wall designed in the 1960s and now <!--del_lnk--> Grade II-listed. It is on <!--del_lnk--> UNESCO&#39;s list of outstanding 20th century buildings.<p>Newcastle&#39;s thriving <!--del_lnk--> Chinatown lies in the northwest of <!--del_lnk--> Grainger Town, centered on Stowell Street. A new Chinese Arch, or <i>paifang</i>, providing a landmark entrance, was handed over to the City with a ceremony in 2005.<p><a id="Science_city" name="Science_city"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Science city</span></h4>
      <p>The UK&#39;s first Biotechnology Village, the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Centre for Life&quot; is located in the City Centre close to the <!--del_lnk--> Central Station.

      <p>Located on the northern outskirts of the city, near <!--del_lnk--> Ponteland, is Newcastle Airport, which has recently been rebranded as <i>Newcastle International</i>. The airport currently handles over five million passengers per year, and is one of the fastest growing airports in the UK. As of 2006, more than 80 destinations are available world-wide. It is currently the UK&#39;s ninth biggest airport. A large scale development in unused land near the edge of the city close to the airport should help growth further. The development is called Newcastle Great Park. If Newcastle&#39;s super casino bid is a success then that should also contribute to growth.<p>A recent article revealed that the airport hoped to achieve 10 million passangers by 2016, and 15 million by 2030.<p><a id="Bus" name="Bus"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Bus</span></h3>

      <p>Newcastle is a principal stop on the <!--del_lnk--> East Coast Main Line and <!--del_lnk--> Cross Country Route. The <!--del_lnk--> central station was the first covered railway station in the world and was much copied across the UK. It has a fine neoclassical frontage originally designed by the architect John Dobson and was constructed in collaboration with <a href="../../wp/r/Robert_Stephenson.htm" title="Robert Stephenson">Robert Stephenson</a>. The station was opened in 1850 by <a href="../../wp/v/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a>, with the first services being operated by the <!--del_lnk--> North Eastern Railway company.<p>Today, train operator <!--del_lnk--> GNER provides a half-hourly frequency of trains to <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, with a journey time of a little less than three hours. <!--del_lnk--> Virgin Trains, <!--del_lnk--> Northern Rail and <!--del_lnk--> Transpennine Express operate regular services to many other destinations including <a href="../../wp/b/Birmingham.htm" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Bristol.htm" title="Bristol">Bristol</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Cardiff.htm" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Carlisle, <a href="../../wp/e/Edinburgh.htm" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Glasgow.htm" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Leeds.htm" title="Leeds">Leeds</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Liverpool.htm" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Sheffield.htm" title="Sheffield">Sheffield</a>.<p>The city&#39;s other mainline station, <!--del_lnk--> Manors, is situated to the north east of the city centre.<p><a id="Road" name="Road"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Road</span></h3>

As part of the redevelopment the 1970&#39;s Green Market will be closed down in early 2007 and rebuilt.<p>The main shopping street in the city is <!--del_lnk--> Northumberland Street. In <!--del_lnk--> a 2004 report, it was ranked as the most expensive shopping road in the UK for rent, outside London. Other shopping centres in Newcastle include the relatively modern <!--del_lnk--> Eldon Garden and Monument Mall complexes, the Newgate Centre, Central Arcade and the traditional Grainger Market. The largest suburban shopping areas are Gosforth and Byker. The largest indoor shopping centre in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>, The <!--del_lnk--> MetroCentre in <!--del_lnk--> Gateshead is also nearby.<p>Out of town, just a few miles to the East lie the coastal resorts of Tynemouth, Whitley Bay and Cullercoats which offer a great selection of shopping attractions. The up and coming Saville Quarter of North Shields, just 15 minutes from Newcastle City Centre is home to the North Shields Fish Quay with its eclectic mix of pubs and restaurants. Relax after shopping with a pint and a bar meal at the ubiquitous Magnesia Bank which is just around the corner, or the upmarket Saville Exchange across the road. The attractions described here can also be easily reached by Metro, bus, car, the Shields Ferry that runs between North and South Shields and the DFDS seaways ferry at the North Shields terminal, adjacent to the Royal Quays retail outlet which is also well worth a visit.<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Famous residents</span></h2>
