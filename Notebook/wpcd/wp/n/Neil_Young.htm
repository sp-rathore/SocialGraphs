      <p><b>Neil Percival Young</b> <!--del_lnk--> OM (born <!--del_lnk--> November 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1945, <!--del_lnk--> Omemee, Ontario) is a Canadian <!--del_lnk--> singer-songwriter and <!--del_lnk--> guitarist who grew up in <!--del_lnk--> Winnipeg, <!--del_lnk--> Manitoba. His work is characterized by deeply personal lyrics, distinctive guitar work, and an almost instantly recognizable nasal <!--del_lnk--> tenor (and frequently <!--del_lnk--> alto) singing voice. Although he accompanies himself on several different instruments &mdash;including <a href="../../wp/p/Piano.htm" title="Piano">piano</a> and <!--del_lnk--> harmonica&mdash;his style of <!--del_lnk--> hammer-on <!--del_lnk--> acoustic guitar and often idiosyncratic soloing on electric guitar are the lynchpins of a sometimes ragged, sometimes polished, yet consistently evocative sound. In more recent years, Young has started to adopt elements from newer styles of music, such as <!--del_lnk--> industrial and <!--del_lnk--> grunge, the latter of which was profoundly influenced by his own style of playing.<p>

      <p>Although Young has experimented widely with differing music styles, including <!--del_lnk--> swing, <a href="../../wp/j/Jazz.htm" title="Jazz">jazz</a>, <!--del_lnk--> rockabilly, blues and <!--del_lnk--> electronica throughout a varied career, his most accessible and best known work generally falls into either of two distinct styles: acoustic, <!--del_lnk--> country-tinged <!--del_lnk--> folk rock, as heard in songs such as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Heart of Gold&quot;, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Harvest Moon&quot; and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Old Man,&quot; and crunchy, <!--del_lnk--> electric hard rock, in songs like &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Cinnamon Girl&quot;, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Rockin&#39; in the Free World&quot; and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Hey Hey, My My (Into The Black)&quot;.<p>Young first came to prominence as a member of the folk-rock band <!--del_lnk--> Buffalo Springfield in the mid-1960s and then as a solo performer backed by the band <!--del_lnk--> Crazy Horse. He reached his commercial peak during the singer-songwriter boom of the early 1970s with the albums <i><!--del_lnk--> After the Gold Rush</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Harvest</i> as well as with <!--del_lnk--> Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young. He has long been distrustful of commercial management in the music business, and has at times created highly accessible and durable popular music while at other times has indulged in outlandish and uncompromising experiments that have left audiences, critics, and&mdash;in one notable case&mdash;his record label baffled.<p>Young has been inducted into the <!--del_lnk--> Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the <!--del_lnk--> Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2000, the cable music channel <!--del_lnk--> VH1 ranked Young 30th on a list of the Top 100 Artists of Rock and Roll. He was also 39th on VH1&#39;s list of Top 100 Hard Rock Artists.<p>Young has directed or co-directed a number of <a href="../../wp/f/Film.htm" title="Film">films</a> using the <!--del_lnk--> pseudonym Bernard Shakey, including <i>Journey Through the Past</i> (1973), <i>Rust Never Sleeps</i> (1979), <i><!--del_lnk--> Human Highway</i> (1982), and <i><!--del_lnk--> Greendale</i> (2003).<p>He is also an outspoken advocate for environmental issues and small farmers, having co-founded the <!--del_lnk--> benefit concert <!--del_lnk--> Farm Aid, and in 1986 helped found The Bridge School together with his wife Pegi.<p>Young reportedly keeps every car he has ever owned. (Except the original Mort, a hearse that broke down in Blind River, Ontario, and is immortalized in the Young song &quot;Long May You Run&quot;).<p><a id="Biography" name="Biography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Early_years" name="Early_years"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early years</span></h3>
      <p>Neil Young was born in <a href="../../wp/t/Toronto.htm" title="Toronto">Toronto</a> to sportswriter and novelist <!--del_lnk--> Scott Young and Rassy Ragland Young. He spent his early years in Omemee, a small country town which he later memorialized in his song <!--del_lnk--> &quot;Helpless&quot;. A bout of <!--del_lnk--> polio at the age of six left him with a weakened left side, and he still walks with a slight limp. He moved to <!--del_lnk--> New Smyrna Beach, Florida to recover for a year; his mother later moved there permanently. His parents divorced when Young was twelve, and he moved with his mother back to the family home of <!--del_lnk--> Winnipeg, <!--del_lnk--> Manitoba, where his music career began. While attending <!--del_lnk--> Kelvin High School in Winnipeg, he played in instrumental rock bands, one of which, the Squires, had a local hit called &quot;The Sultan.&quot; He later worked folk clubs in Winnipeg, where he befriended <a href="../../wp/g/Guitar.htm" title="Guitar">guitarist</a> <!--del_lnk--> Stephen Stills and <!--del_lnk--> Joni Mitchell, and spent summers in <!--del_lnk--> Thunder Bay, Ontario, playing at local clubs. In the <!--del_lnk--> 2006 film <i>Heart of Gold</i> Young relates how he used to spend time as a teenager at <!--del_lnk--> Falcon Lake, Manitoba where he would endlessly plug coins into the jukebox to hear <!--del_lnk--> Ian Tyson&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Four Strong Winds.&quot;<p>In 1966, after an aborted record deal on the <!--del_lnk--> Motown label with the <!--del_lnk--> Rick James-fronted <!--del_lnk--> Mynah Birds, Young and <!--del_lnk--> bass player <!--del_lnk--> Bruce Palmer relocated to <a href="../../wp/l/Los_Angeles%252C_California.htm" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a>, where they joined Stills, <!--del_lnk--> Richie Furay, and Dewey Martin to form <!--del_lnk--> Buffalo Springfield. A mixture of folk, country, <!--del_lnk--> psychedelia, and rock lent a hard edge by the twin lead guitars of Stills and Young made the Buffalo Springfield a critical success, and their first record <i><!--del_lnk--> Buffalo Springfield</i> (1967) sold well after Stills&#39; topical song &quot;<!--del_lnk--> For What It&#39;s Worth&quot; became a hit.<p>Things did not go smoothly for long, and distrust of their management as well as the arrest and deportation of Palmer exacerbated already strained relations between group members. A second album, <i><!--del_lnk--> Buffalo Springfield Again</i>, was released in late 1967, but two of Young&rsquo;s three contributions were actually solo tracks recorded apart from the rest of the group.<p>In many ways, these three songs on <i>Buffalo Springfield Again</i> are harbingers of much of Young&#39;s later work in that, although they all share deeply personal, almost idiosyncratic lyrics, they also present three very different musical approaches to the arrangement of what is essentially an original folk song. &quot;Mr Soul,&quot; the only Young song of the three that all five members of the group perform together. In contrast, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Broken Arrow&quot; was confessional folk rock of a kind that would characterize much of the music that emerged from the singer-songwriter movement. Young&rsquo;s experimental production intersperses each verse with snippets of sound from other sources, including opening the song with a sound bite of Dewey Martin singing &quot;Mr. Soul&quot; and closing it with the thumping of a heartbeat. &quot;Expecting to Fly&quot; was a lushly produced <!--del_lnk--> ballad featuring a string arrangement that Young&#39;s co-producer for the track, <!--del_lnk--> Jack Nitzsche, would dub &quot;symphonic pop.&quot;<p>In May of 1968 the band split up for good, but in order to fulfill a contractual obligation, a final album, <i><!--del_lnk--> Last Time Around</i>, was compiled primarily from recordings made earlier that year. Young contributed the songs &ldquo;On the Way Home&rdquo; and &ldquo;I Am a Child,&rdquo; although he sang lead only on the latter.<p><a id="Breakthrough_as_a_solo_artist" name="Breakthrough_as_a_solo_artist"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Breakthrough as a solo artist</span></h3>
      <p>After the breakup of Buffalo Springfield, Young signed a solo deal with <!--del_lnk--> Reprise Records, home of his colleague and friend <!--del_lnk--> Joni Mitchell, with whom he shared a manager, Elliot Roberts. Young and Nitzsche immediately began work on Young&#39;s first solo record, <i><!--del_lnk--> Neil Young</i> (November 1968), which received mixed reviews. In a 1970 interview <!--del_lnk--> , Young deprecated the album as being &quot;overdubbed rather than played,&quot; and the quest for music that expresses the spontaneity of the moment has long been a feature of his career. Nevertheless, the album contains some tunes that remain a staple of his live shows, most notably &quot;The Loner.&quot;<p>For his next album, Young recruited three musicians from a band called Danny and The Rockets: <!--del_lnk--> Danny Whitten on guitar, <!--del_lnk--> Billy Talbot on bass guitar, and <!--del_lnk--> Ralph Molina on <!--del_lnk--> drums. These three took the name Crazy Horse (after the historical figure of the <!--del_lnk--> same name), and <i><!--del_lnk--> Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere</i> (May 1969), is credited to &quot;Neil Young with Crazy Horse.&quot; Recorded in just two weeks, the album opens with one of Young&#39;s most familiar songs, &quot;Cinnamon Girl,&quot; and is dominated by two more, &quot;Cowgirl in the Sand&quot; and &quot;Down by the River,&quot; that feature lengthy jams showcasing Young&#39;s idiosyncratic guitar soloing accompanied sympathetically by Crazy Horse. Young reportedly wrote both songs in the same day.<p>Shortly after the release of <i>Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere</i>, Young reunited with Stephen Stills by joining <!--del_lnk--> Crosby, Stills, and Nash, who had already released one album as a trio. Over the next 24 months, <b>Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young</b> would perform at <!--del_lnk--> Woodstock, release the album <i><!--del_lnk--> D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu</i> (1970), release a single of Young&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Ohio,&quot; and record a summer concert tour, which was released the following year under the title <i><!--del_lnk--> Four Way Street</i> (1971).<p>&ldquo;Ohio&rdquo; was written following the <!--del_lnk--> Kent State massacre on <!--del_lnk--> May 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1970, and was a staple of anti-war rallies in the 1970s. Young was still performing it 20 years later, by which time he often dedicated it to the <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">Chinese</a> students who were killed during the <a href="../../wp/t/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989.htm" title="Tiananmen Square protests of 1989">Tiananmen Square protests of 1989</a>.<p>Also that year, Young released his second solo album, <i><!--del_lnk--> After the Gold Rush</i> (1970), which featured, among others, a young <!--del_lnk--> Nils Lofgren, <!--del_lnk--> Stephen Stills, and CSNY bassist Greg Reeves. Aided by his newfound fame with CSNY, the album was a commercial breakthrough for Young and contains some of his best known work. Notable tracks include the title track, with dream-like lyrics that run a gamut of subjects from drugs and interpersonal relationships to environmental concerns, as well as Young&rsquo;s controversial and acerbic condemnation of <!--del_lnk--> racism in &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Southern Man,&quot; which, along with a later song entitled &quot;Alabama,&quot; later prompted <!--del_lnk--> Lynyrd Skynyrd to decry Young by name in the lyrics to &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Sweet Home Alabama.&quot;<p>With CSNY splitting up and Crazy Horse having signed their own record deal, Young began the year 1971 with a solo tour entitled &quot;Journey Through the Past.&quot; Later, he recruited a new group of country-music session musicians, whom he christened The Stray Gators, to record much of the new material that had been premiered on tour for the album <i><!--del_lnk--> Harvest</i> (1972). <i>Harvest</i> was a massive hit (especially with the country-music crowd) and &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; became a US number one single. Another notable song was &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The Needle and the Damage Done,&quot; a lament for, in Young&rsquo;s own words, &quot;all the great art that never got out because of <!--del_lnk--> heroin.&quot; <p>The album&#39;s success, however, caught Young off guard, and his first instinct was to back away from stardom. In the handwritten liner notes to the <i><!--del_lnk--> Decade</i> compilation, Young described &#39;Heart of Gold&#39; as the song that &quot;put me in the middle of the road. Travelling there soon became a bore, so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there.&quot;<p>On 8 September 1972, the Academy Award-nominated actress <!--del_lnk--> Carrie Snodgress, with whom he had been living, gave birth to Neil Young&#39;s first child. The boy, Zeke, would later be diagnosed with cerebral palsy.<p><a id="The_Ditch_Trilogy" name="The_Ditch_Trilogy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Ditch Trilogy</span></h3>
      <p>Although a new tour had been planned to follow up on the success of <i>Harvest</i>, it became apparent during rehearsals that Danny Whitten could not function due to <!--del_lnk--> drug abuse. On <!--del_lnk--> November 18, 1972, shortly after he was fired from the tour preparations, Whitten was found dead of an <!--del_lnk--> overdose. Young described the incident to <i><!--del_lnk--> Rolling Stone</i>&rsquo;s <!--del_lnk--> Cameron Crowe in 1975, &quot;[We] were rehearsing with him and he just couldn&#39;t cut it. He couldn&#39;t remember anything. He was too out of it. Too far gone. I had to tell him to go back to L.A. &#39;It&#39;s not happening, man. You&#39;re not together enough.&#39; He just said, &#39;I&#39;ve got nowhere else to go, man. How am I gonna tell my friends?&#39; And he split. That night the coroner called me from L.A. and told me he&#39;d ODed. That blew my mind. Fucking blew my mind. I loved Danny. I felt responsible. And from there, I had to go right out on this huge tour of huge arenas. I was very nervous and . . . insecure.&rdquo;<p>The album made in the aftermath of this incident has often been described by Young as his &ldquo;least favorite record,&rdquo; and it is, in fact, one of only two of Young&rsquo;s early recordings that has yet to be re-released on CD (The other being the soundtrack album <i><!--del_lnk--> Journey Through the Past</i>). The album was recorded live over a disastrous tour where Neil struggled with his voice and called <!--del_lnk--> David Crosby and <!--del_lnk--> Graham Nash to help perform the music. Nevertheless, <i><!--del_lnk--> Time Fades Away</i> (1973) occupies a unique position in Young&rsquo;s discography as the first of three albums known collectively as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Ditch Trilogy.&quot; (Also called the &quot;Doom Trilogy&quot; by some writers.)<p>In the second half of 1973, Young formed The Santa Monica Flyers, with Crazy Horse&#39;s rhythm section augmented by Nils Lofgren on guitar. Deeply affected by the drug-induced deaths of Whitten and <!--del_lnk--> roadie Bruce Berry, <i><!--del_lnk--> Tonight&#39;s the Night</i> (1975) is a dark, brooding record of unrestrained <!--del_lnk--> blues and out-of-tune ballads that Reprise did not see fit to release until two years later and only after being pressured by Young to do so. The album received mixed reviews at the time, but is now regarded by some as a precursor to <!--del_lnk--> punk rock. In Young&#39;s own opinion, it was the closest he ever came to art,  but the question of whether this is based on musical merits or the biographical significance of Young &quot;exorcising his demons&quot; is open to debate. Nevertheless, <i>Tonight&#39;s the Night</i> is a fan favorite.<p>While his record company delayed the release of <i>Tonight&#39;s the Night,</i> Young recorded <i><!--del_lnk--> On the Beach</i> (1974), which dealt with themes such as the downside of fame and the Californian lifestyle. Like <i>Time Fades Away</i> and <i>Tonight&#39;s the Night</i>, it sold poorly but would eventually become a critical favorite, presenting some of Young&#39;s most original work. In a review of the 2003 re-release on CD of <i>On the Beach</i> Derek Svennungsen described the music as &quot;mesmerizing, harrowing, lucid, and bleary,&quot;  a characterization that many would say is apt of the entire Ditch Trilogy.<p><a id="Zuma_and_beyond" name="Zuma_and_beyond"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Zuma and beyond</span></h3>
      <p>Young reformed Crazy Horse with <!--del_lnk--> Frank Sampedro on guitar as his backup band for <i><!--del_lnk--> Zuma</i> (1975). Many of the songs are overtly concerned with failed relationships, and even the epic &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Cortez the Killer,&quot; outwardly a retelling of the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish conquest of <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> from the viewpoint of the <a href="../../wp/a/Aztec.htm" title="Aztec">Aztecs</a>, can be seen as an allegory of love lost&mdash;something that didn&rsquo;t save it, however, from being banned in <!--del_lnk--> Franco&#39;s <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>.<p>The following year, Young reunited with Stephen Stills for the album <i><!--del_lnk--> Long May You Run</i> (1976), credited to <!--del_lnk--> The Stills-Young Band, the follow-up tour was ended midway through by Young, after having sent Stills a <!--del_lnk--> telegram that read: &quot;Funny how some things that start spontaneously end that way. Eat a peach, Neil.&quot;<p>In 1976, Young performed with <!--del_lnk--> The Band, Joni Mitchell, and other rock musicians in the high profile all-star concert <!--del_lnk--> The Last Waltz. The release of <!--del_lnk--> Martin Scorsese&#39;s movie of the concert was delayed while Scorsese unwillingly re-edited it to deemphasize the lump of cocaine that was clearly visible hanging from Young&#39;s nose during his performance of &quot;Helpless.&quot; Young later said, &quot;I&#39;m not proud of that,&quot; according to one of his biographers.<p><i><!--del_lnk--> American Stars &#39;N Bars</i> (1977) contained two songs originally recorded for the unreleased <!--del_lnk--> <i>Homegrown</i> album, &quot;Homegrown&quot; and &quot;Star of Bethelehem,&quot; as well as newer material. Performers included <!--del_lnk--> Linda Ronstadt, <!--del_lnk--> Emmylou Harris and Young prot&eacute;g&eacute; <!--del_lnk--> Nicolette Larson along with Crazy Horse. Also in 1977, Young released <i><!--del_lnk--> Decade</i>: a personally selected career summary of material spanning every aspect of his various interests and affiliations, including a handful of unreleased songs. <i><!--del_lnk--> Comes a Time</i> (1978) also featured Nicolette Larson and Crazy Horse and became Young&#39;s most commercially accessible album in quite some time, marked by a return to his folk roots.<p>Young next set out on the lengthy &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot; tour, in which each concert was divided into a solo acoustic set and an electric set with Crazy Horse. Much of the electric set was later seen as a response to punk rock&#39;s burgeoning popularity. &quot;Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)&quot; compared the changing public perception of <!--del_lnk--> Johnny Rotten with that of the recently deceased <a href="../../wp/e/Elvis_Presley.htm" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a>, who himself had once been disparaged as a dangerous influence only to later become an <!--del_lnk--> icon. Rotten, meanwhile, returned the favour by playing one of Young&#39;s records on a <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> radio show. The accompanying albums <i><!--del_lnk--> Rust Never Sleeps</i> (new material, culled from live recordings, but featuring studio overdubs) and <i><!--del_lnk--> Live Rust</i> (a mixture of old and new, and a genuine concert recording) captured the two sides of the concerts, with solo acoustic songs on side A, and fierce, uptempo, electric songs on side B. A movie version of the concerts, also called <i>Rust Never Sleeps</i> (1979), was directed by Young under the pseudonym Bernard Shakey.<p>Young was suddenly hip again, and the readers and critics of <!--del_lnk--> Rolling Stone voted him Artist Of The Year for 1979 (along with The Who), selected <!--del_lnk--> Rust Never Sleeps as Album Of The Year, and voted him Male Vocalist Of The Year as well.<p><a id="Experimental_years" name="Experimental_years"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Experimental years</span></h3>
      <p>The 1980s were a lean time for Young both critically and commercially. After providing the incidental music to a <!--del_lnk--> biopic of <!--del_lnk--> Hunter S. Thompson entitled <i><!--del_lnk--> Where the Buffalo Roam</i>, he recorded <i><!--del_lnk--> Hawks &amp; Doves</i> (1980), a folk/country record. <i><!--del_lnk--> Re-ac-tor</i> (1981), once again with Crazy Horse, was a fa&ccedil;ade of distortion and feedback obscuring a relatively weak selection of songs, but his strangest record of the decade came with <i><!--del_lnk--> Trans</i> (1982). Recorded almost entirely with <!--del_lnk--> vocoders, <a href="../../wp/s/Synthesizer.htm" title="Synthesizer">synthesizers</a>, and other devices that modify instruments and vocals with electronic effects, it is sometimes considered an experiment to find technology that would become a means to communicate for Young&rsquo;s son (with his wife Pegi), Ben, who has severe <!--del_lnk--> cerebral palsy and cannot speak. Many fans were baffled by the radical forms of this album and <!--del_lnk--> rockabilly-styled <i><!--del_lnk--> Everybody&#39;s Rockin&#39;</i> (1983), and record company head <!--del_lnk--> David Geffen even sued Young for making &quot;unrepresentative&quot; music - i.e. music that did not sound like Neil Young. Young later stated that he would have preferred to release the songs featuring the <!--del_lnk--> synclavier and <!--del_lnk--> vocoder as an EP, and that their inclusion with the Hawaiian-themed rockabilly was a mistake.<p>in 1983, Young worked with zany Brit video director Tim Pope, making two videos - &quot;Wonderin&#39;&quot; and &quot;Cry, Cry, Cry.&quot;<p>In 1985, he reunited with Crosby, Stills and Nash at <!--del_lnk--> Live Aid at Philadelphia&#39;s JFK Stadium. The two songs that they played, &quot;Only Love Can Break Your Heart&quot; and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Daylight Again/Find The Cost of Freedom,&quot; were the first songs they had played as a quartet in front of a paying audience since 1974.<p><i><!--del_lnk--> Old Ways</i> (1985) saw a return to country music, recorded with a group of friends and session musicians. <i><!--del_lnk--> Landing on Water</i> (1986) is entertaining for the blending of synthesizers and other instruments related to the 80&#39;s into Young&rsquo;s own style, with lyrics that take pot shots at some favourite targets, including CSN in &quot;Hippie Dream,&quot; with a chorus that goes: &quot;But the wooden ships/Were just a hippie dream,&quot; and David Geffen in &ldquo;Drifter,&rdquo; with the line: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to tell me what I gotta do to fit.&rdquo; The resumption of his partnership with Crazy Horse on <i><!--del_lnk--> Life</i> (1987) fulfilled his contract with Geffen, and Young was finally able to switch labels.<p>Signing with <!--del_lnk--> Warner Brothers and returning to Reprise Records, Young produced <i><!--del_lnk--> This Note&#39;s For You</i> (1988) with a new band, The Bluenotes, whose name rights were owned by musician <!--del_lnk--> Harold Melvin. The addition of a <!--del_lnk--> brass section provided a new <a href="../../wp/j/Jazz.htm" title="Jazz">jazzier</a> sound and the title track became his first hit single of the decade. Accompanied by a witty video which parodied corporate rock, the pretensions of advertising and <!--del_lnk--> Michael Jackson in particular, the song was initially banned by <!--del_lnk--> MTV (although the Canadian music channel, <!--del_lnk--> MuchMusic ran it immediately) before being put into heavy rotation and finally given the <!--del_lnk--> MTV Video Music Award for Best Video of the Year for 1989. After Melvin sued over the use of the Bluenotes name, Young renamed his back-up group &quot;Ten Men Workin&#39;&quot; for the balance of the concert tour.<p>Young also contributed to that year&#39;s CSNY reunion <i>American Dream</i> (1988) and CSNY played a few benefit concerts. Young, however, refused to book a full tour with CSN and the foursome would not embark upon a nationwide tour until 2000.<p><a id="The_90s_and_the_return_to_country-rock_roots" name="The_90s_and_the_return_to_country-rock_roots"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The 90s and the return to country-rock roots</span></h3>
      <p><i><!--del_lnk--> Freedom</i> completed the return to form, a mixture of acoustic and electric rock dealing with the state of the US and the world in 1989, alongside a set of love songs and a version of the standard &quot;On Broadway.&quot; <i><!--del_lnk--> Rockin&#39; in the Free World</i>, two versions of which bookended the album, again caught the mood. Some say it became a <i>de facto</i> anthem during the fall of the <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin_Wall.htm" title="Berlin Wall">Berlin Wall</a>, a few months after the record&#39;s release. However, most Germans don&#39;t remember the song being related to the reunification, understandably so, since the lyrics are not about political repression. Like <a href="../../wp/b/Bruce_Springsteen.htm" title="Bruce Springsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a>&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Born in the U.S.A.&quot;, the anthemic use of this song was based on largely ignoring the verses, which evoke social problems and implicitly criticize American government policies. By 1990, <!--del_lnk--> grunge music was beginning to make its first inroads in the charts and many of its prime movers, including <a href="../../wp/n/Nirvana_%2528band%2529.htm" title="Nirvana (band)">Nirvana</a>&#39;s <a href="../../wp/k/Kurt_Cobain.htm" title="Kurt Cobain">Kurt Cobain</a>, cited Young as a major influence.<p>Using a barn on his <!--del_lnk--> Northern California ranch as a studio, he rapidly recorded the aptly titled <i><!--del_lnk--> Ragged Glory</i> with Crazy Horse, whose guitar riffs and feedback driven sound showed his new admirers that he could still cut it. Young then headed back out on the road with LA punk band <!--del_lnk--> Social Distortion and <a href="../../wp/a/Alternative_rock.htm" title="Alternative rock">alternative rock</a> elder statesmen <!--del_lnk--> Sonic Youth as support, much to the consternation of many of his old fans<!--del_lnk--> <!--del_lnk--> . Yet the influence of Sonic Youth could be clearly heard on the accompanying home video and live album, <i><!--del_lnk--> Weld</i>, which also included a bonus CD entitled <i><!--del_lnk--> Arc</i>, a single 35-minute-long collage of <!--del_lnk--> feedback and guitar noise that Neil included, evidently at the suggestion of Sonic Youth&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Thurston Moore]<!--del_lnk--> . <i>Arc</i> was later sold separately.<p>Young&#39;s next move was another return to country music. <i><!--del_lnk--> Harvest Moon</i> (1992) was the long awaited sequel to <i>Harvest</i> and reunited him with some of the musicians from that session, as well as singers <!--del_lnk--> Linda Ronstadt and <!--del_lnk--> James Taylor. The title track was a minor hit and the record was reviewed and sold equally well, containing songs such as &quot;From <!--del_lnk--> Hank to <!--del_lnk--> Hendrix&quot; and &quot;Unknown Legend&quot;, a tribute to his wife. His resurgent popularity saw him booked on <i><!--del_lnk--> MTV Unplugged</i> in 1993. In 1992 he accompanied fellow <!--del_lnk--> Winnipegger <!--del_lnk--> Randy Bachman on &quot;Prairie Town,&quot; a song that recounts their days in the Winnipeg music scene of the 1960s. That year, he contributed music to the <!--del_lnk--> soundtrack of the <!--del_lnk--> Jonathan Demme movie <i><!--del_lnk--> Philadelphia</i>, and his song &quot;Philadelphia&quot; was nominated for the <!--del_lnk--> Academy Award for Best Song, losing out to Bruce Springsteen&#39;s contribution to the same film. A summer tour covering both Europe and North America with <!--del_lnk--> Booker T. and the MGs (with whom he played two songs at a 1992 <a href="../../wp/b/Bob_Dylan.htm" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> tribute concert at <!--del_lnk--> Madison Square Garden) was widely praised as a triumph. On a few of these dates, the show ended with a rendition of &quot;Rockin&#39; in the Free World&quot; played with <!--del_lnk--> Pearl Jam.<p>Young was back with Crazy Horse for 1994&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Sleeps with Angels</i>, a much darker record. The title track told the story of Kurt Cobain&#39;s death after Young had allegedly tried to contact the singer prior to this event<sup>[<i><!--del_lnk--> citations needed</i>]</sup>. Cobain had quoted Young&#39;s &quot;It&#39;s better to burn out than fade away&quot; (a line from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)&quot;) in his alleged <!--del_lnk--> suicide note, causing Young to emphasise the line &quot;&#39;cause once you&#39;re gone you can&#39;t come back&quot; in live performances at the time. Other songs dealt with drive-by shootings (&quot;Driveby&quot;), <!--del_lnk--> environmentalism (&quot;Piece of Crap&quot;) and Young&#39;s own vision of America (the archetypal car metaphor of &quot;Trans Am&quot;). Young was inspired to make the record after viewing Cobain&#39;s performance on <!--del_lnk--> MTV Unplugged. Still admired by the prime movers of grunge, Young eventually performed with Pearl Jam at the MTV Music Awards during what was described as the highlight of a lackluster show<!--del_lnk--> . Their collaboration led to a joint tour, with the band and producer <!--del_lnk--> Brendan O&#39;Brien backing Young. The accompanying album, <i><!--del_lnk--> Mirror Ball</i> (1995), recorded as live in the studio captured their loose rock sound, and featured the standout track &quot;I&#39;m the Ocean.&quot;<p>After composing an abstract, distorted feedback-led guitar instrumental soundtrack to the <!--del_lnk--> Jim Jarmusch film <i><!--del_lnk--> Dead Man</i> Young recorded a series of loose jams with Crazy Horse that eventually appeared as the critically denigrated <i><!--del_lnk--> Broken Arrow</i>. The return to Crazy Horse was prompted by the death of mentor, friend, and longtime <!--del_lnk--> producer <!--del_lnk--> David Briggs in late 1995. The subsequent tours of Europe and North America in 1996 resulted in both a live album and a tour documentary directed by <!--del_lnk--> Jim Jarmusch. Both releases took the name <i><!--del_lnk--> Year of the Horse</i>.<p>In 1997, Young participated in the <!--del_lnk--> H.O.R.D.E. Festival&#39;s sixth annual tour.<p>In 1998, Young shared the stage with the rock band <!--del_lnk--> Phish at the annual <!--del_lnk--> Farm Aid concert, and later offered them an opportunity to headline both nights of the Bridge School Benefit concert. <!--del_lnk--> Phish passed on Young&#39;s offer and also declined Young&#39;s later invitation to be his backing band on a 1999 tour<!--del_lnk--> .<p>The decade ended with <i><!--del_lnk--> Looking Forward</i>, another reunion with Crosby, Stills and Nash. The subsequent tour of the United States and Canada with the reformed super quartet was a huge success and brought in earnings of $42.1 million, making it the eighth largest grossing tour of 2000.<p>Young&#39;s next album, <i><!--del_lnk--> Silver &amp; Gold</i> (2000), contained a number of understated songs with personal lyrics, which was promoted through a mini-tour of solo acoustic shows. This style was continued in <i>Are You Passionate?</i> (2002), an album of love songs dedicated to his wife, Pegi.<p><a id="In_the_aftermath_of_9.2F11" name="In_the_aftermath_of_9.2F11"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">In the aftermath of 9/11</span></h3>
      <p>Young&#39;s 2001 single &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Let&#39;s Roll&quot;, was a tribute to the victims of the <a href="../../wp/s/September_11%252C_2001_attacks.htm" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11 terrorist attacks</a>, and the passengers and crew on <!--del_lnk--> Flight 93 in particular. At the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> America: A Tribute to Heroes&quot; concert he performed a <!--del_lnk--> cover version of <!--del_lnk--> John Lennon&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Imagine&quot;. In 2002, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Q</i> magazine named Neil Young in their list of the &quot;50 Bands To See Before You Die.&quot;<p>Young hauled out his concept album <i><!--del_lnk--> Greendale</i> in 2003 -- about an extended family in a small town called Greendale, and how they&#39;re torn apart by a murder. <i>Greendale</i> the album version was recorded with Crazy Horse members Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina. This tale of the Green family also resulted in a movie called <i>Greendale</i>, written and directed by Young (again using his &quot;Bernard Shakey&quot; pseudonym) and starring a few of his friends that act out and <!--del_lnk--> lip sync the songs from the album. The film was indeed thoroughly experimental, from Young&#39;s rambling on-stage between-song narratives, to his reading apparent transcriptions of these ramblings in the liner notes. &quot;When I was writing this I had no idea what I was doing, so I was just as surprised as you are,&quot; Young said later. Young toured extensively with the <i>Greendale</i> material throughout 2003 and 2004, first with a solo, acoustic version in Europe, then with a full-cast stage show in North America, <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>, and <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>. While audience reaction was sometimes mixed (drunken requests for &quot;Southern Man&quot; being an aesthetic impediment at most Young performances), the live stage version of Greendale was for many critics the most satisfying incarnation of the material, and bootlegs of the shows have been widely traded. The second half of each concert consisted of high-decibel renditions of Young classics such as &quot;Hey Hey, My My,&quot; &quot;Cinnamon Girl,&quot; &quot;Powderfinger,&quot; and <!--del_lnk--> Rockin&#39; in the Free World, as well as rarities such as &quot;The Losing End,&quot; &quot;The Old Country Waltz,&quot; and &quot;Danger Bird.&quot;<p>Young spent the latter portion of 2004 giving a series of intimate acoustic concerts in various cities with his wife, Pegi, who is a trained vocalist.<p><a id="Health_scare.2C_recovery.2C_and_most_recent_works" name="Health_scare.2C_recovery.2C_and_most_recent_works"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Health scare, recovery, and most recent works</span></h3>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> March 31, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, Young was admitted to a hospital in New York for treatment for a brain <!--del_lnk--> aneurysm. He was treated successfully by a minimally invasive <!--del_lnk--> neuroradiology procedure. Prior to undergoing the procedure, he wrote the first eight songs of a new album, <i><!--del_lnk--> Prairie Wind</i>, in <a href="../../wp/n/Nashville%252C_Tennessee.htm" title="Nashville, Tennessee">Nashville</a>, with session musicians that included regular Young sideman <!--del_lnk--> Ben Keith on lap and <!--del_lnk--> pedal steel guitars. The last two songs on the album were written after his aneurysm procedure. Many of the songs, such as &quot;Fallin&#39; Off the Face of the Earth,&quot; seem to be inspired by Young&#39;s brush with <!--del_lnk--> mortality, the recent death of his father (who suffered <!--del_lnk--> senile dementia), as well as a connection with his <!--del_lnk--> Manitoba roots. Two days after the procedure, Young was forced to cancel a scheduled appearance on the <!--del_lnk--> Juno Awards telecast in Winnipeg when the area where the surgeons did his procedure (via the <!--del_lnk--> femoral artery) suddenly began to bleed.<p>He next performed on <!--del_lnk--> July 2, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, at the close of the <!--del_lnk--> Live 8 concert in <!--del_lnk--> Barrie, Ontario. He presented a new song, a soft hymn called &quot;When God Made Me,&quot; and ended with &quot;Rockin&#39; In The Free World.&quot; He began his set with a cover of the Canadian folk classic &quot;Four Strong Winds&quot; by <!--del_lnk--> Ian &amp; <!--del_lnk--> Sylvia Tyson.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> September 28, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, <i>Prairie Wind</i> was released as a regular CD, a special limited-edition CD and DVD package, and on vinyl. In an interview given to <!--del_lnk--> <i>Time</i> magazine, Young revealed that he had planned to keep the news of his aneurysm private until he had the bleeding scare, in which case he decided to make news of his condition public.<p>In 2006, <i><!--del_lnk--> Neil Young: Heart of Gold</i>, a film made by <!--del_lnk--> Jonathan Demme, premiered at the <!--del_lnk--> Sundance Film Festival. Filmed over two nights at the <!--del_lnk--> Ryman Auditorium in <a href="../../wp/n/Nashville%252C_Tennessee.htm" title="Nashville, Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a> during the premiere of <i>Prairie Wind</i>, it includes both new and old songs as well as behind-the scenes-commentary by Young, his wife Pegi and others.<p>In April 2006, Young confirmed on his website that he was going to release an album full of protest songs, titled <i><!--del_lnk--> Living With War</i>, one of whose songs is titled &quot;Let&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Impeach the President.&quot; Recorded using his famous <!--del_lnk--> Les Paul electric guitar, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Old Black&quot;, along with Chad Cromwell (drums), Rick Rosas (bass) and Tommy Brea (trumpet), it was intended to be a stinging rebuke of <!--del_lnk--> President George W. Bush and the <!--del_lnk--> War in Iraq. The album was recorded in a two week period in April, and was then made available over the internet from 28 April 2006 before being released as a CD on 5 May. <i><!--del_lnk--> Living With War</i> was Young&#39;s most talked about release for years, creating heated political debate and a return to form with perhaps his most critically-acclaimed album since the early 1990s &#39;Godfather of Grunge&#39; era when he was hailed as major influences on grunge pioneers <!--del_lnk--> Pearl Jam and seminal indie band <!--del_lnk--> Sonic Youth among others.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>In April 2006, it was announced that Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young would embark on their &quot;Freedom Of Speech Tour &#39;06&quot; with Chad Cromwell and Rick Rosas making up the rhythm section. The tour will see them play dates all across North America. The entire <i><!--del_lnk--> Living With War</i> album is being performed on the tour, in addition to other CSN and Neil Young classics such as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Ohio&quot; and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Rockin&#39; in the Free World.&quot;<p>In September 2006, the first release from his long awaited <i><!--del_lnk--> Archives</i> project was announced. <i><!--del_lnk--> Live at the Fillmore East</i> features a live set with <!--del_lnk--> Crazy Horse including <!--del_lnk--> Danny Whitten from 1970. Young has stated in interviews that the release will be followed by a much larger box set of recordings from his early career.<p>In October 2006, it was announced that a remastered version of <!--del_lnk--> Living With War, titled <i>Living With War-Raw</i>, would be made available for digital download on November 7th. It was also announced CD/DVD set of the remastered album will be released on December 19th. The DVD will include videos directed by Young of every song on the album, and contain footage of the <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq_War.htm" title="Iraq War">Iraq War</a>, demonstrations in the US, and <!--del_lnk--> Al Gore&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> An Inconvenient Truth</i>.<p>Young currently lives on a 1500-acre ranch in <!--del_lnk--> Woodside, California, called Broken Arrow.

      <p>Young was inducted into the <!--del_lnk--> Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1982. He has been inducted into the <!--del_lnk--> Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice: first in 1995 for his solo work by Eddie Vedder and again in 1997 as a member of Buffalo Springfield.<p>He has also directed three movies under his pseudonym Bernard Shakey, and released them through his own Shakey Pictures imprint: <i>Journey Through the Past</i> (1973), <i><!--del_lnk--> Human Highway</i> (1982) (starring new wave band <!--del_lnk--> Devo), and <i>Greendale</i> (2003). The bonus <a href="../../wp/d/DVD.htm" title="DVD">DVDs</a> included in both versions of <i>Greendale</i> and in <i>Prairie Wind</i> are also directed by Young under the Bernard Shakey alias, and all of Young&#39;s home video and DVD releases have been co-released under the Shakey Pictures imprint.<p>As one of the founders of Farm Aid, he remains on their board of directors. For one weekend each October, in <!--del_lnk--> Mountain View, California, he and his wife host the <!--del_lnk--> Bridge School Concerts, which have been drawing international talent and sell-out crowds for nearly two decades with some of the biggest names in rock having performed at the event including <a href="../../wp/b/Bruce_Springsteen.htm" title="Bruce Springsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a>, <!--del_lnk--> David Bowie, <!--del_lnk--> The Who, <!--del_lnk--> Pearl Jam, <!--del_lnk--> Sonic Youth and <!--del_lnk--> Sir Paul McCartney. The concerts are a benefit for the <!--del_lnk--> Bridge School, which develops and uses advanced technologies to aid in the instruction of children with disabilities. Young&#39;s involvement stems at least partially from the fact that both of his sons have <!--del_lnk--> cerebral palsy and his daughter, like Young himself, has <!--del_lnk--> epilepsy.<p>Young was nominated for an <!--del_lnk--> Oscar in 1994 for his song &quot;Philadelphia&quot; from the film <i><!--del_lnk--> Philadelphia</i> (Bruce Springsteen ended up winning the award for his song &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Streets of Philadelphia&quot; from the same film). In his acceptance speech, Springsteen said that &quot;the award really deserved to be shared by the other nominee&#39;s song.&quot; That same night, <!--del_lnk--> Tom Hanks accepted the Oscar for Best Actor and gave credit for his inspiration to the song &quot;Philadelphia&quot;.<p>Young owns <!--del_lnk--> Vapor Records, who have signed such artists as <!--del_lnk--> Jonathan Richman, <!--del_lnk--> Tegan and Sara and <!--del_lnk--> Catatonia.

      <p>Neil Young is a collector of second-hand guitars, but in recording and performing, he frequently uses just a few instruments. As explained by his longtime guitar technician Larry Cragg in the film <i><!--del_lnk--> Neil Young: Heart of Gold</i>, they include:<ul>
       <li>1953 <!--del_lnk--> Gibson R6 Les Paul Goldtop &ndash; Nicknamed &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Old Black&quot;, this is Young&#39;s primary <!--del_lnk--> electric guitar and is featured on <i><!--del_lnk--> Rust Never Sleeps</i> and most other albums. Old Black got its name from a purely amateur paintjob applied to the originally-gold body of the instrument, sometime before Neil acquired the guitar in the late 1960s. In 1972, a mini-<!--del_lnk--> humbucker pickup from a <!--del_lnk--> Gibson <!--del_lnk--> Firebird guitar was installed into the lead/treble position, replacing a <!--del_lnk--> P-90 as standard on Les Paul guitars from that era. This pickup, severely <!--del_lnk--> microphonic, is considered a crucial component of Neil&#39;s sound. A <!--del_lnk--> Bigsby tremelo unit was installed as early as 1969 on the guitar, and can be heard clearly during the opening of &quot;Cowgirl in the Sand&quot; from <!--del_lnk--> Everybody Knows This is Nowhere.<li><!--del_lnk--> Martin D-45 &ndash; His primary <!--del_lnk--> steel-string acoustic guitar; used to write &quot;Old Man&quot; and many other hit songs.<li>Martin D-28 &ndash; Nicknamed &quot;Hank&quot; after its previous owner, <!--del_lnk--> Hank Williams. The guitar came into Young&#39;s possession after <!--del_lnk--> Hank Williams, Jr. had traded it to another owner for some shotguns and it went through a succession of other owners until it was located by Young&#39;s longtime friend Grant Boatwright. It is Young&#39;s primary guitar for the album, <i><!--del_lnk--> Prairie Wind</i> and is used on <i>Neil Young: Heart of Gold</i>.<li>1927 <!--del_lnk--> Gibson Mastertone &ndash; A six-string <!--del_lnk--> banjo, tuned like a guitar. It has been used on many recordings and was played by <!--del_lnk--> James Taylor on &quot;Old Man&quot;.<li>Various vintage <!--del_lnk--> Fender Deluxe amplifiers &ndash; Neil&#39;s preferred amplifier for electric guitar is the dimunitive Fender Deluxe, specifically a Tweed-era model from 1959. Neil purchased his first vintage Deluxe in 1967 for $50 and has since acquired nearly 450 different examples, all from the same era, but he maintains that it&#39;s the original model that sounds superior, and is a crucial component to his trademark sound. A notable and unique accessory to Young&#39;s Deluxe is the Whizzer, a device created specifically for Young, which physically changes the amplifier&#39;s settings to pre-set combinations. It has gone through many incarnations, and now includes effects pedals hardwired into its circuitry.<li><!--del_lnk--> Gretsch 6120 (Chet Atkins) &ndash; Before Neil bought Old Black, this was his primary electric guitar used during his <!--del_lnk--> Buffalo Springfield days.<li><!--del_lnk--> Gretsch White Falcon &ndash; Late &#39;50s hollow body that Neil purchased near the end of the <!--del_lnk--> Buffalo Springfield era; in 1969 Neil acquired a stereo version from Stills (same vintage--see photo, top right), and this guitar is featured prominently during Neil&#39;s early &#39;70s period, and can be heard on tracks like &quot;Ohio,&quot; &quot;Southern Man,&quot; &quot;Alabama,&quot; &quot;L.A.,&quot; others.</ul>
