      <p><b>Norfolk</b> (pronounced <!--del_lnk--> IPA: <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[&#x2C8;n&#x252;&#x2D0;f&#x259;k]</span>) is a low-lying <!--del_lnk--> county in <!--del_lnk--> East Anglia in the east of southern <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>. It has borders with <!--del_lnk--> Lincolnshire to the west, <!--del_lnk--> Cambridgeshire to the west and southwest and with <!--del_lnk--> Suffolk to the south. Its northern and eastern boundaries are the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea.htm" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> coast, including <!--del_lnk--> The Wash. The <!--del_lnk--> county town is <a href="../../wp/n/Norwich.htm" title="Norwich">Norwich</a>, located at <span class="plainlinksneverexpand"><!--del_lnk--> <span style="white-space:nowrap">52&deg;37&prime;59&Prime;N,</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap">1&deg;17&prime;38&Prime;E</span></span>. Norfolk is the fifth largest ceremonial county in England, with an area of 5,371 <!--del_lnk--> sq km (2,074 <!--del_lnk--> sq mi).<p>Of the 34 non-metropolitan English counties, Norfolk is the seventh most populous, with a population of 816,500. However, as a largely <!--del_lnk--> rural county it has a low population density, 152 people per <!--del_lnk--> square kilometre, making it 25th highest by population density. This is reflected in Norfolk&#39;s economy which is dominated by agriculture and tourism. <a href="../../wp/t/The_Broads.htm" title="The Broads">The Broads</a> lie partly within the county. A recent bid to have them declared a National Park failed, because it would have meant conservation being more important than navigation. Historical sites, such as the centre of Norwich, also contribute to tourism.<p>In a contest held by <!--del_lnk--> Plantlife, Norfolk&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> county flower was voted to be the <!--del_lnk--> Common Poppy  after complaints that the first choice <!--del_lnk--> Alexanders was not representative.<p>

      <p>Norfolk was settled in pre-Roman times, with <!--del_lnk--> neolithic camps along the higher land in the west where <!--del_lnk--> flints could be quarried. A <!--del_lnk--> Brythonic tribe, the <!--del_lnk--> Iceni, inhabited the county from the first century <!--del_lnk--> BCE, to the end of the first century CE. The Iceni revolted against the <!--del_lnk--> Roman invasion in 47 CE, and again in 60CE led by <a href="../../wp/b/Boudica.htm" title="Boudica">Boudica</a>. The crushing of the second rebellion opened the county to the Romans. During the Roman era roads and ports were constructed throughout the county and farming took place.<p>Situated on the east coast, Norfolk was vulnerable to invasions from <!--del_lnk--> Scandinavia and northern Europe, and forts were built to defend against the <!--del_lnk--> Angles and <!--del_lnk--> Saxons. By the <a href="../../wp/5/5th_century.htm" title="5th century">5th century</a> the <!--del_lnk--> Angles, for whom <!--del_lnk--> East Anglia and <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> itself are named, had established control of the region and later became the &quot;north folk&quot; and the &quot;south folk&quot;, hence, &quot;Norfolk&quot; and &quot;Suffolk&quot;. Norfolk, and several adjacent areas, became the kingdom of East Anglia, later merging with <a href="../../wp/m/Mercia.htm" title="Mercia">Mercia</a> and then <a href="../../wp/w/Wessex.htm" title="Wessex">Wessex</a>. The influence of the Early English settlers can be seen in the many &quot;thorpes&quot;, &quot;tons&quot; and &quot;hams&quot; of placenames. In the <a href="../../wp/9/9th_century.htm" title="9th century">9th century</a> the region again came under attack, this time from <a href="../../wp/v/Viking.htm" title="Viking">Vikings</a> who killed the king, <!--del_lnk--> Edmund the Martyr. In the centuries before the <!--del_lnk--> Norman Conquest the wetlands of the east of the county began to be converted to farmland, and settlements grew in these areas. Migration into East Anglia must have been high, as by the time of the Conquest and <a href="../../wp/d/Domesday_Book.htm" title="Domesday Book">Domesday Book</a> survey, it was one of the most densely populated parts of the British Isles.<p>During the high and late <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> the county developed arable agriculture and woolen industries. The economy was in decline by the time of the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Death.htm" title="Black Death">Black Death</a>, which dramatically reduced the population in <!--del_lnk--> 1349. By the 16th century <a href="../../wp/n/Norwich.htm" title="Norwich">Norwich</a> had grown to become the second largest city in England, but in <!--del_lnk--> 1665 the <!--del_lnk--> Great Plague of London again killed around one third of the population. During the <!--del_lnk--> English Civil War Norfolk was largely Parliamentarian. The economy and agriculture of the region declined somewhat, and during the <!--del_lnk--> industrial revolution Norfolk developed little industry and was a late addition to the <!--del_lnk--> railway network.<p>In the 20th century the county developed a role in aviation. The first development in airfields came with the <!--del_lnk--> First World War; there was then a massive expansion during the Second World War with the growth of the <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Air_Force.htm" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a> and the influx of the American USAAF <!--del_lnk--> 8th Air Force which operated from many <!--del_lnk--> Norfolk airfields. During the <!--del_lnk--> Second World War agriculture rapidly intensified, and has remained very intensive since with the establishment of large fields for <a href="../../wp/c/Cereal.htm" title="Cereal">cereal</a> and <!--del_lnk--> oil seed rape growing. Norfolk&#39;s low-lying land and easily eroded cliffs, many of which are chalk and clay, make it vulnerable to the sea, the most recent major event being the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea_flood_of_1953.htm" title="North Sea flood of 1953">North Sea flood of 1953</a>.<p><a id="Physical_geography" name="Physical_geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Physical geography</span></h2>
      <p>Geologically Norfolk can be divided into three regions. In the east the county lies on weak <a href="../../wp/p/Pliocene.htm" title="Pliocene">pliocene</a> (1.8-5.3mya) rocks which form low, flat land easily eroded by the sea. <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil.htm" title="Fossil">Fossils</a> in these rocks document over a million years of <a href="../../wp/c/Climate.htm" title="Climate">climate</a> fluctuations. To the west is a stronger band of <!--del_lnk--> Chalk (70-100mya) which dips to the north and in places has a unique red colour. The chalk is part of the <!--del_lnk--> Southern England Chalk Formation which is also found in <!--del_lnk--> Salisbury Plain, the <!--del_lnk--> South Downs and <a href="../../wp/i/Isle_of_Wight.htm" title="Isle of Wight">Isle of Wight</a>, though in Norfolk it doesn&#39;t form as high hills as to the south. In the far west of county the landscape is again low, flat and wet, around <!--del_lnk--> The Wash, a large inlet eroded into the weak rock. The transition between the eastern and western geology can be seen clearly at <!--del_lnk--> Weybourne, where the coastline suddenly changes.<p>Much of Norfolk, like surrounding East Anglian counties, is low lying and close to sea level. The <!--del_lnk--> Norfolk Broads are an important <!--del_lnk--> wetland <!--del_lnk--> habitat and tourist attraction, part of <a href="../../wp/t/The_Broads.htm" title="The Broads">The Broads</a> statutory area which has similar status to a <!--del_lnk--> National Park. Another important habitat is <!--del_lnk--> Thetford Forest Park, a <!--del_lnk--> coniferous forest and <!--del_lnk--> heathland park. Some of the county, like neighbouring <!--del_lnk--> Cambridgeshire, is used for <!--del_lnk--> intensive <!--del_lnk--> arable agriculture and is crossed by artificial drainage canals.<p>The highest point of the county is <!--del_lnk--> Beacon Hill at 105m. It is the highest point of the <!--del_lnk--> Cromer Ridge, a ridge of old glacial <!--del_lnk--> moraines that stands next to the coast above <!--del_lnk--> Cromer.<p>Being in the east, sheltered from most of the extreme weather of the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic</a>, Norfolk has amongst the lowest rainfall in the UK, at 466-641<!--del_lnk--> mm (18-25<!--del_lnk--> in). The area has <!--del_lnk--> mean temperatures of between 9.4 and 10.1 degrees <!--del_lnk--> celsius (approx 50 degrees <!--del_lnk--> fahrenheit), second only to <!--del_lnk--> South West and <!--del_lnk--> South East England. With between 1471 and 1885 hours of sunshine annually, it is behind only the south-coast counties and Suffolk<p><a id="Economy_and_industry" name="Economy_and_industry"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy and industry</span></h2>

      <p>In 1998 Norfolk had a <!--del_lnk--> Gross Domestic Product of <!--del_lnk--> &pound;9,319 million, making it 1.5% of England&#39;s economy and 1.25% of the United Kingdom&#39;s economy. The GDP per head was &pound;11,825, compared to &pound;13,635 for East Anglia, &pound;12,845 for England and &pound;12,438 for the United Kingdom. In 1999-2000 the county has an unemployment rate of 5.6%, compared to 5.8% for England and 6.0% for the UK.<p>Much of Norfolk&#39;s flat and fertile land has been drained and converted to <a href="../../wp/a/Arable_land.htm" title="Arable land">arable land</a>. Over 20% of employment in the county is in the agriculture and food industries. <!--del_lnk--> Agribusiness has been successful in the county, and farming is very intensive with large fields, and many formerly family-run farms have been agglomerated into large farms which are highly efficient but criticised for reducing <a href="../../wp/b/Biodiversity.htm" title="Biodiversity">biodiversity</a> and employment.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>
      <p>Norfolk County Council is <!--del_lnk--> Conservative-controlled, with 46 Conservative councillors, 22 <!--del_lnk--> Labour councillors, 14 <a href="../../wp/l/Liberal_Democrats.htm" title="Liberal Democrats">Liberal Democrat</a> councillors and two <!--del_lnk--> Green councillors. There was 63% turnout at the most recent local election.<p>In the <a href="../../wp/b/British_House_of_Commons.htm" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a>, Norfolk is represented by four Conservative <!--del_lnk--> Members of Parliament, three Labour MPs and one Liberal Democrat.

      <p>Norfolk&#39;s county town and only <a href="../../wp/c/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="City status in the United Kingdom">city</a> is <a href="../../wp/n/Norwich.htm" title="Norwich">Norwich</a>, one of the largest settlements in England during the <!--del_lnk--> Norman era. Norwich is home to Norfolk&#39;s only university, the <!--del_lnk--> University of East Anglia, and is the county&#39;s main business and culture centre. Other principal towns include the port-town of <!--del_lnk--> King&#39;s Lynn and the seaside resort and Broads gateway town of <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Yarmouth.htm" title="Great Yarmouth">Great Yarmouth</a>. There are also several <!--del_lnk--> market towns: <!--del_lnk--> Aylsham, <!--del_lnk--> Downham Market, <!--del_lnk--> Fakenham, <!--del_lnk--> Holt, <!--del_lnk--> Swaffham, <!--del_lnk--> Thetford and <!--del_lnk--> Wymondham.<p>Norfolk is one of only four non-metropolitan counties in England that does not have a <!--del_lnk--> motorway. The <!--del_lnk--> A11 connects Norfolk to <a href="../../wp/c/Cambridge.htm" title="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> and <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> A47 runs west to the <!--del_lnk--> East Midlands. The <!--del_lnk--> Great Eastern Main Line is a major <!--del_lnk--> railway from London <!--del_lnk--> Liverpool Street Station to Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk. The only major <!--del_lnk--> airport in the county is <!--del_lnk--> Norwich International Airport, which offers flights within <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>, including a link to <a href="../../wp/a/Amsterdam.htm" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> which offers onward flights throughout the world.<p><a id="Dialect.2C_accent_and_nickname" name="Dialect.2C_accent_and_nickname"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Dialect, accent and nickname</span></h2>

      <p>The Norfolk Dialect also known as &quot;Broad Norfolk&quot; is the accent/dialect of people living in Norfolk, although over the modern age, a lot of the vocabulary and phrases have died out due to a number of factors such as radio, TV and people from other parts of the country coming to Norfolk. As a result the speech of Norfolk is more of an <!--del_lnk--> accent than <!--del_lnk--> dialect though one part retained from the Norfolk dialect is the distinctive grammar of the region.<p>Most English counties have nicknames for people from that county, such as a <!--del_lnk--> Tyke from <!--del_lnk--> Yorkshire and a <!--del_lnk--> Yellowbelly from <!--del_lnk--> Lincolnshire; the traditional <!--del_lnk--> nickname for people from Norfolk is &#39;Norfolk Dumpling&#39; or &#39;Norfolk Pudden&#39; (&quot;pudding&quot;): two of the county&#39;s two culinary dishes.<p>More cutting, perhaps, is the medical slang term <!--del_lnk--> Normal for Norfolk.<p><a id="Tourist_highlights" name="Tourist_highlights"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Tourist highlights</span></h2>
