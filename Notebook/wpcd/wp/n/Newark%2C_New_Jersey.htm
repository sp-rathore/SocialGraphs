      <p><b>Newark</b>, nicknamed <i>The Brick City</i>, is the largest <!--del_lnk--> city in <!--del_lnk--> New Jersey, <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, and the county seat of urban <!--del_lnk--> Essex County. As of the <!--del_lnk--> United States 2000 Census, the city had a total population of 273,546, making it <!--del_lnk--> the largest municipality in New Jersey. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city&#39;s 2004 population estimate is 280,451, an increase of 2.5% from 2000.<p>It is located approximately five miles (8 km) west of <!--del_lnk--> Manhattan and two miles north of <!--del_lnk--> Staten Island (both parts of <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a>). Its location near the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> on <!--del_lnk--> Newark Bay has helped make its port facility, <!--del_lnk--> Port Newark, the major <!--del_lnk--> container shipping port for <!--del_lnk--> New York Harbour. Together with <!--del_lnk--> Elizabeth, it is the home of <!--del_lnk--> Newark Liberty International Airport, which was the first major airport to serve the <!--del_lnk--> New York metropolitan area.<p>

      <p>Newark was founded in 1666 by <!--del_lnk--> Connecticut <!--del_lnk--> Puritans led by <!--del_lnk--> Robert Treat, making it the third-oldest major city in the United States, after <a href="../../wp/b/Boston%252C_Massachusetts.htm" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York</a>, though it is not the third-oldest settlement. Newark is the city&#39;s second name; previously, it was called Milford, named for <!--del_lnk--> Milford, Connecticut, from which many settlers had migrated. The name comes from <!--del_lnk--> Newark-on-Trent, a town in <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> from where some of the original settlers arrived.<p><a id="Colonial_era" name="Colonial_era"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Colonial era</span></h3>
      <p>Newark was a relatively large town in the colonial era, known for its good <a href="../../wp/b/Beer.htm" title="Beer">beer</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Cider.htm" title="Cider">ciders</a>, and tanned <!--del_lnk--> leather goods. In religion, it stayed loyal to old Puritan ways longer than the communities of <!--del_lnk--> New England, and was very receptive to the <!--del_lnk--> Great Awakening. When the seminaries at <!--del_lnk--> Yale and <!--del_lnk--> Harvard showed disdain for Great Awakening evangelicalism, several Newark ministers led by <!--del_lnk--> Aaron Burr (father of Vice President <!--del_lnk--> Aaron Burr) founded the College of New Jersey, later to be known as <a href="../../wp/p/Princeton_University.htm" title="Princeton University">Princeton</a>, in neighboring <!--del_lnk--> Elizabeth.<p><a id="Industrial_era_to_World_War_II" name="Industrial_era_to_World_War_II"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Industrial era to World War II</span></h3>

      <p>Newark&#39;s rapid growth began in the early 1800s, much of it due to a <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts transplant named <!--del_lnk--> Seth Boyden. Boyden came to Newark in 1815, and immediately began a torrent of improvements to leather manufacture, culminating in the process for making <!--del_lnk--> patent leather. Boyden&#39;s genius would eventually allow Newark to manufacture almost 90% of the nation&#39;s leather by 1870, bringing in $8.6 million to the city in that year alone. In 1824, Boyden, bored with leather, found a way to produce malleable <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a>. Newark also prospered by the construction of the <!--del_lnk--> Morris Canal in 1831. The canal connected Newark with the New Jersey hinterland, at that time a major iron and farm area. Railroads also arrived in 1834 and 1835. A flourishing shipping business resulted, and Newark became the area&#39;s industrial centre. By 1826, Newark&#39;s population stood at 8,017, ten times the 1776 number.<p>The middle 19th century saw continued growth and diversification of Newark&#39;s industrial base. The first commercially successful <!--del_lnk--> plastic &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> Celluloid &mdash; was produced in a factory on Mechanic Street by <!--del_lnk--> John Wesley Hyatt. Hyatt&#39;s Celluloid found its way into Newark-made carriages, <!--del_lnk--> billiard balls, and <!--del_lnk--> dentures. <!--del_lnk--> Edward Weston perfected in Newark a process for <a href="../../wp/z/Zinc.htm" title="Zinc">zinc</a> <!--del_lnk--> electroplating, as well as a superior <!--del_lnk--> arc lamp. Newark&#39;s Military Park had the first public electric lamps anywhere in the United States. Before moving to <!--del_lnk--> Menlo Park, <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Edison.htm" title="Thomas Edison">Thomas Edison</a> himself made Newark home in the early 1870s. He invented the <!--del_lnk--> stock ticker in the Brick City. In the late 19th century, its industry was further developed, especially through the efforts of such men as Seth Boyden and J. W. Hyatt. <a href="../../wp/i/Irish_people.htm" title="Irish people">Irish</a> and <!--del_lnk--> German migrants moved to the city; the Germans established their own newspapers, which other ethnic groups have emulated. However, tensions existed between the &quot;native stock&quot; and the newer groups.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>In the middle 19th century, Newark added <!--del_lnk--> insurance to its repertoire of businesses; <!--del_lnk--> Mutual Benefit was founded in the city in 1845 and <!--del_lnk--> Prudential in 1873. Prudential, or &quot;the Pru&quot; as generations of Newarkers knew it, was founded by another transplanted New Englander, John Fairfield Dryden, who found a niche catering to the middle and lower classes. Today, Newark sells more insurance than any city except <!--del_lnk--> Hartford, Connecticut.<p>In 1880, Newark&#39;s population stood at 136,508; in 1890 at 181,830; in 1900 at 246,070; and in 1910 at 347,000, a jump of 200,000 in three decades. As Newark&#39;s population approached a half million in the 1920s, the city&#39;s potential seemed limitless. It was said in 1927: &quot;Great is Newark&#39;s vitality. It is the red blood in its veins &ndash; this basic strength that is going to carry it over whatever hurdles it may encounter, enable it to recover from whatever losses it may suffer and battle its way to still higher achievement industrially and financially, making it eventually perhaps the greatest industrial centre in the world&quot;.<p>Newark was bustling in the early to mid-20th century. Market and Broad Streets served as a centre of retail commerce for the region anchored by four flourishing department stores like Hahne &amp; Company, <!--del_lnk--> L. Bamberger and Company, L.S. Plaut and Company, and Kresge&#39;s (later known as <!--del_lnk--> Kmart). &quot;Broad Street today is the Mecca of visitors as it has been through all its long history,&quot; Newark merchants boasted, &quot;they come in hundreds of thousands now when once they came in hundreds.&quot;<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In 1922, Newark had 63 live theaters, 46 movie theaters, and an active nightlife. <!--del_lnk--> Dutch Schultz was killed in 1935 at the local Palace Bar. <a href="../../wp/b/Billie_Holiday.htm" title="Billie Holiday">Billie Holiday</a> frequently stayed at the Coleman Hotel. By some measures, the intersection of Market and Broad Streets &mdash; known as the &quot;Four Corners&quot; &mdash; was the busiest intersection in the United States, in terms of cars using it. In 1915, Public Service counted over 280,000 pedestrian crossings in one thirteen-hour period. Eleven years later, on <!--del_lnk--> October 26, <!--del_lnk--> 1926, a State Motor Vehicle Department check at the Four Corners counted 2,644 trolleys, 4,098 buses, 2657 taxis, 3474 commercial vehicles, and 23,571 automobiles. Traffic in Newark was so heavy that the city converted the old bed of the <!--del_lnk--> Morris Canal into the <!--del_lnk--> Newark City Subway, making Newark one of the few cities in the country to have an underground system. New skyscrapers were being built every year, the two tallest being the 40-story <!--del_lnk--> Art Deco National Newark Building and the Lefcourt-Newark Building. In 1948, just after <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Newark hit its peak population of just under 450,000. The population also grew as immigrants from South and Eastern Europe settled here. Newark witnessed distinctive neighborhoods including a large Jewish community concentrated along Prince Street.<p>According to legend, the Texas-born artist <!--del_lnk--> Robert Rauschenberg accidentally left his bus in Newark and spent a week there before he realized it wasn&#39;t New York City.<p><a id="Post-World_War_II_era" name="Post-World_War_II_era"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Post-World War II era</span></h3>
      <p>Problems existed underneath the industrial hum. In 1930, a city commissioner had told a local booster club, the Optimists:<dl>
       <dd><i>Newark is not like the city of old. The old, quiet residential community is a thing of the past, and in its place has come a city teeming with activity. With the change has come something unfortunate&mdash;the large number of outstanding citizens who used to live within the community&#39;s boundaries has dwindled. Many of them have moved to the suburbs and their home interests are there.</i></dl>
      <p>Most New Jerseyans attributed Newark&#39;s demise to post-<a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> phenomena&mdash;the <!--del_lnk--> 1967 riots; the construction of the <!--del_lnk--> New Jersey Turnpike, <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 280 and <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 78; decentralization of manufacturing; the <!--del_lnk--> G.I. Bill; and the general pro-suburban fiscal order&mdash;but Newark&#39;s relative decline actually began long before that. The city budget fell from $58 million in 1938 to only $45 million in 1944, despite the wartime boom and an increase in the tax rate from $4.61 to $5.30. Even in 1944, before anyone predicted the rise of the <!--del_lnk--> Sun Belt or the G.I. Bill, planners saw problems on Newark&#39;s horizon.<p>Some attribute Newark&#39;s downfall to its propensity for building large housing projects. However, Newark&#39;s housing was always a matter of concern. The 1944 city-commissioned study showed that 31% of all Newark dwelling units were below standards of health, and only 17% of Newark&#39;s units were owner-occupied. Vast sections of Newark consisted of wooden tenements, and at least 5,000 units failed to meet any thresholds of being a decent place to live. Bad housing predated government intervention in the housing market.<p>One theory postulated by <!--del_lnk--> Kenneth T. Jackson and others is that Newark, having a situation where a poor center was surrounded by middle-class outlying areas, only did well when it was able to annex middle-class suburbs. When municipal annexation broke down, urban problems developed since the middle-class edge was now divorced from the poor centre. In 1900, Newark&#39;s mayor had confidently thought out loud, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> East Orange, <!--del_lnk--> Vailsburg, <!--del_lnk--> Harrison, <!--del_lnk--> Kearny, and <!--del_lnk--> Belleville would be desirable acquisitions. By an exercise of discretion we can enlarge the city from decade to decade without unnecessarily taxing the property within our limits, which has already paid the cost of public improvements.&quot; Only Vailsburg would ever be added.<p>Although numerous problems predated <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Newark was hamstrung by a number of trends in the post-WWII era. The <!--del_lnk--> Federal Housing Administration <!--del_lnk--> redlined virtually all of Newark, preferring to back up mortgages in the white suburbs. Manufacturers set up in lower wage environments and could receive larger tax deductions for building an entirely new factory in outlying areas than for rehabilitating an old factory in a city. Billed as transportation improvements, <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 280, the <!--del_lnk--> New Jersey Turnpike, and <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 78 harmed Newark as well. They directly hurt the city by tearing the fabric of the neighborhoods they went though, and indirectly hurt the city because the new infrastructure allowed middle-class workers to live in the suburbs and commute into the city.<p>Despite its problems, Newark did try to remain vital in the postwar era. <!--del_lnk--> Prudential and Mutual Benefit were successfully enticed to stay and build new offices. <!--del_lnk--> Rutgers University-Newark and <!--del_lnk--> Seton Hall University expanded their Newark presences, with the former building a brand-new campus on a 23 acre (9 hectare) urban renewal site. The <!--del_lnk--> Port Authority of New York and New Jersey made <!--del_lnk--> Port Newark the first container port in the nation and turned swamps in the south of the city into <!--del_lnk--> Newark Liberty International Airport, one of the ten busiest airports in the United States.<p>Even though it was not the sole cause of Newark&#39;s tragedy, the city made some serious mistakes with <!--del_lnk--> public housing and <!--del_lnk--> urban renewal. Across several administrations, the city leaders of Newark saw the federal government&#39;s offer to pay for 100% of the costs of housing projects as a blessing. While other cities were skeptical about putting so many poor and socially dysfunctional individuals together and thus were cautious in building housing projects, Newark avidly pursued federal dollars. Eventually, Newark would have a higher percentage of its residents in public housing than any other American city.<p>The largely <!--del_lnk--> Italian American <!--del_lnk--> First Ward was one of the hardest hit by urban renewal. A 46-acre (19 hectare) housing tract, labeled a slum because it was so dense, was torn down for multi-story <!--del_lnk--> Le Corbusier-style high rises, to be known as the Christopher Columbus Homes. The tract had contained 8th Avenue, the commercial heart of the neighborhood. Fifteen small-scale blocks were reduced to three &quot;superblocks.&quot; The Columbus Homes, never in harmony with the rest of the neighbourhood, were abandoned in the 1970s, and were eventually torn down in 1994.<p>As pesticides and mechanization reduced the need for cheap labor in the South, five million blacks migrated to northern cities between 1940 and the 1970s. From 1950 to 1960, while Newark saw its overall population drop from 438,000 to 408,000, it gained 65,000 non-whites. By 1966, Newark had a black majority, a faster turnover than most other northern cities had experienced. Evaluating the <!--del_lnk--> riots of 1967, Newark educator Nathan Wright, Jr. said, &quot;No typical American city has as yet experienced such a precipitous change from a white to a black majority.&quot; The misfortune of the <!--del_lnk--> Great Migration and <!--del_lnk--> Puerto Rican immigration was that Southern blacks and Puerto Ricans were moving to Newark to be industrial workers just as the industrial jobs were drying up. Newark blacks left poverty in the South to find poverty in the North.<p>During the 1950s alone, Newark&#39;s white population decreased from 363,000 to 266,000. From 1960 to 1967, its white population fell a further 46,000. Though white flight changed the racial composition of Newark residents, it did not change the racial composition of political and economic power in the city. In 1967, out of a police force of 1,400, only 150 members were black, mostly in subordinate positions. The predominantly white nature of the police force, coupled with its penchant for brutality, led it to be seen as an occupying force rather than a protective entity. Since Newark&#39;s blacks lived in neighborhoods that had been white only two decades earlier, nearly all of their apartments and stores were white-owned as well. Mayor Addonizio offered, without consulting any residents of the neighbourhood to be affected, to condemn and raze for the <!--del_lnk--> University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ) 150 acres (61 hectares) of a densely populated black neighbourhood in the central ward. UMDNJ had wanted to settle in suburban <!--del_lnk--> Madison.<p><a name="1967_riots"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1967 riots</span></h3>

      <p>The poverty and lack of political power contributed to a growing radicalization of Newark&#39;s black population. On <!--del_lnk--> July 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1967, a black taxi driver named <!--del_lnk--> John Smith was arrested and brutally beaten by police for illegally passing a double-parked police car and then resisting arrest. A crowd gathered outside the police station where he was detained. Due to miscommunication, the crowd believed Smith had died in custody while in reality he had been transported to hospital via a back entrance to the station. This sparked scuffles between blacks and police in the Fourth Ward, although the damage toll was only $2,500. Subsequent to television news broadcasts on <!--del_lnk--> July 13 however, new and larger <!--del_lnk--> riots took place. Twenty-six people were killed, 1,500 wounded, 1,600 arrested, and $10 million in property was destroyed. More than a thousand businesses were torched or looted, including 167 groceries (most of which would never reopen). Newark&#39;s reputation suffered dramatically. Tens of thousands of whites and middle class blacks moved out to the growing suburbs of New Jersey. Middle class areas like <!--del_lnk--> Weequahic went from middle class white to poor black seemingly overnight. It was said, &quot;wherever American cities are going, Newark will get there first.&quot;<p><a id="Post-riots" name="Post-riots"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Post-riots</span></h3>

      <p>Newark saw a continued decline in the 1970s and 1980s. Whites continued to move out of the city. Middle class blacks followed suit, and certain pockets of the city developed as domains of poverty and social isolation. Whenever the media of New York needed to find some example of urban despair, they traveled to Newark.<p>In <i><!--del_lnk--> American Pastoral</i>, a novel by Newark-born author <!--del_lnk--> Philip Roth, the protagonist Swede Levov says:<dl>
       <dd><i>[Newark] used to be the city where they manufactured everything, now it&#39;s the car theft capital of the world ... there was a factory where somebody was making something on every side street. Now there&#39;s a liquor store on every street &mdash; a liquor store, a pizza stand, and a seedy storefront church. Everything else is in ruins or boarded up.</i></dl>
      <p>In January 1975, an article in <i><!--del_lnk--> Harper&#39;s Magazine</i> ranked the fifty largest American cities in twenty-four categories, ranging from park space to crime. Newark was one of the five worst in nineteen out of twenty-four categories, and the very worst in nine. According to the article, only 70% of Newarkers owned a telephone. The city ranked second worst, <!--del_lnk--> St. Louis, was much farther from Newark than the cities in the top five were from each other. The article concluded:<dl>
       <dd><i>The city of Newark stands without serious challenge as the worst [city] of all. It ranked among the worst cities in no fewer than nineteen of twenty-four categories, and it was dead last in nine of them... Newark is a city that desperately needs help.</i>. In the 2006 survey, Newark was ranked as the 22nd most dangerous city in the United States overall, out of 371 cities included nationwide in the 13th annual <!--del_lnk--> Morgan Quitno survey.</dl>
      <p>Newark did have several achievements in the two and a half decades after the riots. In 1968, the <!--del_lnk--> New Community Corporation was founded and was one of the most successful community building organizations in the nation. In 1987, the NCC would own and manage 2,265 low-income housing units.<div class="thumb tright">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Newark&#39;s downtown also saw growth in the post-riot decades. Less than two weeks after the riots, Prudential announced plans to underwrite a $24 million office complex near <!--del_lnk--> Penn Station, dubbed &quot;Gateway.&quot; Today, Gateway houses thousands of white-collar workers, though few live in Newark. The buildings themselves were not designed with consideration for pedestrians. In the mid-1980s, plans were developed to build the 121-story <!--del_lnk--> Grant USA Tower, with 100 stories of offices topped by a 21-story hotel and atrium, which would have been the world&#39;s tallest structure, but the developer went bankrupt before it could be built.<p>Before the riots, there had been an issue over whether the <!--del_lnk--> University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey would be built in the suburbs or Newark. The riots and Newark&#39;s undeniable desperation made definite that the medical school would be in Newark. However, instead of being built on 167 acres (676,000&nbsp;m&sup2;), the medical school would be built on just 60, part of which was already city owned.<p>In politics, <!--del_lnk--> Kenneth A. Gibson was elected as one of the first African-American mayors in the nation in 1970. The 1970s were a time of battles between Gibson and the shrinking white population.<p>Gibson admitted that &quot;Newark may be the most decayed and financially crippled city in the nation.&quot; The higher taxes may have been necessary to pay for services like schools and sanitation, but they did nothing for Newark&#39;s economic base; the CEO of Ballantine&#39;s Brewery even asserted that Newark&#39;s $1 million annual tax bill was the cause of the company&#39;s bankruptcy.<p><a id="Newark.27s_.22Renaissance.22" name="Newark.27s_.22Renaissance.22"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Newark&#39;s &quot;Renaissance&quot;</span></h3>

      </div>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> New Jersey Performing Arts Centre, which opened in the downtown area in 1997 at a cost of $180 million, is seen by many as the first step in the city&#39;s road to revival. It has brought some 1.6 million people to Newark who might never have visited. NJPAC is known for its acoustics and has seen, on its stages, a diverse group of artists including <!--del_lnk--> Itzhak Perlman, <!--del_lnk--> Sarah Brightman, <!--del_lnk--> Sting, <!--del_lnk--> &#39;N Sync, <!--del_lnk--> Lauryn Hill, the <!--del_lnk--> Vienna Boys&#39; Choir, the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of <a href="../../wp/a/Amsterdam.htm" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, and the <!--del_lnk--> Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre.<p>Since then, the city has built a baseball stadium for The Newark Bears, the city&#39;s minor league team (the <!--del_lnk--> Riverfront Stadium), a rail connection to its airport (<!--del_lnk--> AirTrain Newark), and numerous commercial developments in the downtown area. The city is currently constructing <!--del_lnk--> Newark Arena for the <!--del_lnk--> New Jersey Devils, which is expected to be completed by August 2007. The Passaic Waterfront downtown is also being fixed up to provide citizens with access to the river. The Newark Public Library is also in the planning stage of a major renovation and expansion.<p>Much of the city&#39;s revitalization efforts have been focused in the downtown area, however adjoining neighborhoods have, in recent years, begun to see some signs of development. Nevertheless, the &quot;Renaissance&quot; has been unevenly felt across the city and some districts continue to have below-average household incomes and higher-than-average rates of poverty.<p>Since 2000, Newark has actually gained population, its first increase since the 1940s. In 2004, its crime rate decreased 56%, though murders remain high for a city of its size.<p><a id="Lincoln_Park.2FThe_Coast" name="Lincoln_Park.2FThe_Coast"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Lincoln Park/The Coast</span></h4>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Lincoln Park/Coast neighbourhood is the second district of Newark that is seeing large-scale development efforts. The area once referred to as <b>The Coast</b> and referred to as <b>Lincoln Park</b> today, was deemed the Lincoln Park/Coast Cultural District by the city and future additions include the development of a Museum of African American Music, an Arts Park, new housing, stores, a restaurant, a nightclub, a music studio and a dance studio. This area is already home to the Theatre Cafe and the City Without Walls gallery and Symphony Hall, as well as other important cultural sites. Symphony Hall is likely to see renovations in the near future. After much of the development in the Downtown/Arts district and the ongoing need for a link between <!--del_lnk--> Newark Penn Station and <!--del_lnk--> Broad Street Station, the first link of the light rail was built. With the development anchored around the museum in the Coast and the need for a second link to <!--del_lnk--> Newark Airport, this neighbourhood has already become a candidate area for a future light rail system with a stop for Lincoln Park/Symphony Hall. .<p><a id="Geography_and_climate" name="Geography_and_climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography and climate</span></h2>

      <p>Located at 40&deg; 44&#39; 14&quot; north and 74&deg; 10&#39; 55&quot; west, Newark is 24.14 square miles (63 km&sup2;) in area. It has the second smallest land area among 100 most populous cities in the U.S, after neighboring Jersey City. The city&#39;s altitude ranges from 0 to 273.4 <!--del_lnk--> feet (83 <!--del_lnk--> m) above sea level, with the average being 55 feet (17 m). Newark is essentially a large basin sloping towards the <!--del_lnk--> Passaic River, with a few valleys formed by meandering streams. Historically, Newark&#39;s high places have been its wealthier neighborhoods. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the wealthy congregated on the ridges of Forest Hill, High Street, and Weequahic.<p>Until the 20th century, the marshes on Newark Bay were difficult to develop. The marshes were essentially wilderness, with a few dumps, warehouses, and cemeteries on their edges. In the 19th century, Newarkers mourned that a fifth of their city could not be used for development. However, in the 20th century, the <!--del_lnk--> Port Authority was able to reclaim much of the marshland for the further expansion of <!--del_lnk--> Newark Airport, as well as the growth of the port lands.<p>Newark is surrounded by residential suburbs to the west (on the slope of the <!--del_lnk--> Watchung Mountains), the Passaic River and Newark Bay to the east, dense urban areas to the south and southwest, and middle-class residential suburbs and industrial areas to the north.<p><a id="Neighborhoods" name="Neighborhoods"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Neighborhoods</span></h3>

      <p>Newark is New Jersey&#39;s largest and second-most diverse city, after neighboring <!--del_lnk--> Jersey City.

In recent years, residents have begun to identify with specific neighbourhood names instead of the larger ward appellations. Nevertheless, the wards remain relatively homogeneous. Industrial uses, coupled with the airport and seaport lands, are concentrated in the East and South Wards, while residential neighborhoods exist primarily in the North, Central, and West Wards.<table cellpadding="1" style="float: right; border: 1px solid #8888aa; background: #f7f8ff; padding: 5px; font-size: 85%; margin: 0 15px 0 15px;">

      <p>The geography of the city is such that only the predominantly poor Central Ward shares an unbroken border with the downtown area (the North Ward is separated from the downtown by <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 280 and the East Ward is separated by railroad tracks; the South and West Wards do not share a border with the downtown area).<p>Newark&#39;s North Ward is the ridge to the east of <!--del_lnk--> Branch Brook Park. The still-affluent <!--del_lnk--> Forest Hill is in the North Ward, as are heavily Latino areas west of Mount Prospect Avenue. The Central Ward is a poor, mostly black, area. In the 19th century it was inhabited by Germans. The German inhabitants were later replaced by Jews, who were then replaced by blacks. Newark built many <!--del_lnk--> public housing projects on <!--del_lnk--> superblocks in the Central Ward in the 19th century; hence, the streets in this ward are no longer arranged in a grid. The West Ward comprises the neighborhoods of <!--del_lnk--> Roseville and <!--del_lnk--> Vailsburg. Vailsburg is largely black, while Roseville is mainly <!--del_lnk--> Latino and <!--del_lnk--> Italian American. The South Ward comprises poor areas and the middle-class <!--del_lnk--> Weequahic district. It was the last part of Newark to be developed. At the southern end of the ward is <!--del_lnk--> Weequahic Park. Finally, the East Ward consists of Newark&#39;s downtown commercial district, as well as the heavily <!--del_lnk--> Portuguese <!--del_lnk--> Ironbound neighbourhood, where much of Newark&#39;s industry was located in the 19th century; the area was then poorer than the rest of the city. Today, due to the enterprise of its immigrant population, the Ironbound is the most commercially successful part of Newark.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>

Newark had a short-lived NFL franchise named the <!--del_lnk--> Newark Tornadoes, which folded in 1930. Newark never had a National Hockey League, but in August of 2007, when <!--del_lnk--> Newark Arena is complete, the <!--del_lnk--> New Jersey Devils will move to the city. An expansion team for the <!--del_lnk--> Major Indoor Soccer League will also play in Newark Arena. Although the <!--del_lnk--> New Jersey Nets have decided against moving to Newark, a professional basketball team in the <!--del_lnk--> American Basketball Association, the <!--del_lnk--> Newark Express were introduced to the city in 2005. The team currently plays their home games at <!--del_lnk--> Essex County College and hope to move to a larger venue in the future. In <!--del_lnk--> Harrison, across from the Ironbound neighbourhood, <!--del_lnk--> Red Bull Park is being built for <!--del_lnk--> Red Bull New York soccer team (formerly the <!--del_lnk--> MetroStars). The stadium should be completed by June 2008, around the same time as the new Devils arena. In the next couple of months, Newark will begin planning a Pedestrian bridge that will link the two cities at Minish Park.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Newark is a hub of air, road, rail, and ship traffic, making it a significant gateway into the <!--del_lnk--> New York metropolitan area and the <!--del_lnk--> Northeastern United States. <!--del_lnk--> Newark Liberty International Airport, the second-busiest airport in the New York region and the fourteenth-busiest in the United States (in terms of passenger traffic), saw nearly 32 million travelers in 2004 and processed nearly 1,000,000 metric tons of freight and mail. Just east of the airport and across the <!--del_lnk--> New Jersey Turnpike&#39;s fifteen lanes of traffic lies <!--del_lnk--> Port Newark, the fifteenth-busiest port in the world and the largest container port on the eastern seaboard. In 2003, the port moved over $100 billion in goods.<p>The city is served by numerous highways including the New Jersey Turnpike (<!--del_lnk--> Interstate 95), <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 280, <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 78, the <!--del_lnk--> Garden State Parkway, <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Routes 1&amp;<!--del_lnk--> 9, <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Route 22, and <!--del_lnk--> Route 21. Newark is connected to the <!--del_lnk--> Holland Tunnel and <!--del_lnk--> Lower Manhattan by the <!--del_lnk--> Pulaski Skyway, spanning both the <!--del_lnk--> Passaic and <!--del_lnk--> Hackensack Rivers.<p>Local streets in Newark conform to a quasi-grid form, with major streets radiating outward (like spokes on a wheel) from the downtown area. Some major roads in the city are named after the towns to which they lead, including South Orange Avenue, Springfield Avenue, and Bloomfield Avenue. These are some of the oldest roads in the city.<p><!--del_lnk--> Newark Penn Station, situated just east of downtown, is a major train station for the city and the region, connecting the interurban <!--del_lnk--> PATH system (which links Newark to Manhattan) with three <!--del_lnk--> New Jersey Transit commuter rail lines and <a href="../../wp/a/Amtrak.htm" title="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> service to <!--del_lnk--> Philadelphia and <a href="../../wp/w/Washington%252C_D.C..htm" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> Only one mile north, the <!--del_lnk--> Newark Broad Street Station is served by two commuter rail lines. The two train stations are linked by the <!--del_lnk--> Newark Light Rail system, which also provides services from Newark Penn Station to the city&#39;s northern communities and into the neighboring towns of <!--del_lnk--> Belleville and <!--del_lnk--> Bloomfield. Built in the bed of the <!--del_lnk--> Morris Canal, the light rail cars runs underground in Newark&#39;s downtown area. The city&#39;s third train station, <!--del_lnk--> Newark Liberty International Airport, connects the <!--del_lnk--> Northeast Corridor to the airport via <!--del_lnk--> AirTrain Newark. Bus service in Newark is provided by New Jersey Transit, though it is notoriously slow and unreliable.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Newark-Elizabeth Rail Link is a proposed light rail project that will link downtown Newark with neighboring <!--del_lnk--> Elizabeth and Newark Liberty International Airport. The first section of the light rail link, connecting Newark Penn Station with Broad Street Station one mile away, began service on July 17, 2006.<p><a id="Hospitals_and_health_services" name="Hospitals_and_health_services"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Hospitals and health services</span></h3>
      <p>Newark is home to seven hospitals, a remarkable number for a city of its size. <i>University Hospital</i> is the principal teaching hospital of the <!--del_lnk--> New Jersey Medical School and is the busiest Level I trauma centre in the state. <i>Newark Beth Israel Medical Centre</i> is the largest hospital in the city and is a part of the Saint Barnabas Health Care System, the state&#39;s largest system of hospital and health care facilities. Beth Israel is also one of the oldest hospitals in the city, dating back to 1901. This 669-bed regional facility is also home to the <i>Children&#39;s Hospital of New Jersey</i>. Other hospitals in Newark include the <i>St. James Hospital</i>, <i>St. Michael&#39;s Medical Centre</i>, <i>Columbus Hospital</i>, <i>Mount Carmel Guild Hospital</i>, and <i>United Hospitals Medical Centre</i>.<p><a id="Noted_Newarkers" name="Noted_Newarkers"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Noted Newarkers</span></h2>
