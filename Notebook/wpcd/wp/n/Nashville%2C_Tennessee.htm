      <p>Nashville was founded by <!--del_lnk--> James Robertson and a party of <!--del_lnk--> Wataugans in 1779, and was originally called <!--del_lnk--> Fort Nashborough, after the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Revolutionary_War.htm" title="American Revolutionary War">American Revolutionary War</a> hero <!--del_lnk--> Francis Nash. Nashville quickly grew due to its prime location, accessibility as a river <!--del_lnk--> port, and its later status as a major <!--del_lnk--> railroad centre. In 1806 Nashville was <!--del_lnk--> incorporated as a city and became the <!--del_lnk--> county seat of <!--del_lnk--> Davidson County, Tennessee. In 1843, the city was named the permanent <a href="../../wp/c/Capital.htm" title="Capital">capital</a> of the state of Tennessee.<p>By 1860, when the first <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">rumblings of secession</a> began to be heard across the South, Nashville was a very prosperous city. Tennessee reluctantly sided with the <!--del_lnk--> Confederacy and became the last state to secede from the <!--del_lnk--> Union. The city&#39;s significance as a shipping port made it a desirable prize as a means of controlling important river and railroad transportation routes. In February 1862, Nashville became the first state capital to fall to Union troops.<p>Though the Civil War left Nashville severely damaged and in dire economic straits, the city quickly rebounded. Within a few years, the city had reclaimed its important shipping and trading position and also developed a solid <a href="../../wp/m/Manufacturing.htm" title="Manufacturing">manufacturing</a> base. The post-Civil War years of the late 19th century brought a newfound prosperity to Nashville. These healthy economic times left the city with a legacy of grand classical-style buildings, which can still be seen around the downtown area.<p>It was the advent of the <!--del_lnk--> Grand Ole Opry in 1925, combined with an already thriving publishing industry, that positioned it to become &quot;<b>Music City USA</b>&quot;. In 1963, Nashville consolidated its government with <!--del_lnk--> Davidson County and thus became the first major city in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> to form a <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan government. Since the 1970s, the city has experienced tremendous growth, particularly during the <!--del_lnk--> economic boom of the 1990s under the leadership of Mayor <!--del_lnk--> Phil Bredesen, who made urban renewal a priority, and fostered the construction or renovation of a number of the city&#39;s landmarks, including the <!--del_lnk--> Country Music Hall of Fame, the <!--del_lnk--> Nashville Public Library downtown, the <!--del_lnk--> Gaylord Entertainment Centre and <!--del_lnk--> LP Field.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Gaylord Entertainment Centre (formerly the Nashville Arena) was built as both a large concert facility and as an enticement to lure either a National Basketball Association or <a href="../../wp/n/National_Hockey_League.htm" title="National Hockey League">National Hockey League</a> (NHL) sports franchise. This was accomplished in 1997 when Nashville was awarded an NHL expansion team which was subsequently named the <!--del_lnk--> Nashville Predators. <!--del_lnk--> LP Field (formerly Adelphia Coliseum) was built after the <!--del_lnk--> National Football League&#39;s (NFL) <!--del_lnk--> Houston Oilers agreed to move to the city in 1995. The NFL debuted in Nashville in 1998 at Vanderbilt Stadium and LP Field opened in the summer of 1999. The Oilers changed their name to the <!--del_lnk--> Tennessee Titans and saw a season culminate in the <!--del_lnk--> Music City Miracle and a close <!--del_lnk--> Super Bowl loss.<p><a id="Geography_and_climate" name="Geography_and_climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography and climate</span></h2>

      <p>Nashville has a <!--del_lnk--> humid subtropical climate. Summers in Nashville are generally hot and humid, with July afternoons averaging 89 &deg;F (32 &deg;C). Winters are mild and occasionally chilly, with lows in January averaging 28 &deg;F (&minus;2 &deg;C). Average annual rainfall is 1220 mm (48.1 inches), typically with winter and spring being the wettest and fall being the driest. Average annual snowfall is about 23 cm (9.1 inches), falling mostly in January and February. Spring and fall are generally pleasantly warm, but prone to <!--del_lnk--> severe thunderstorms&mdash;which occasionally bring <a href="../../wp/t/Tornado.htm" title="Tornado">tornadoes</a>, with recent major events on <!--del_lnk--> April 16, 1998 and <!--del_lnk--> April 7, 2006.<p>The coldest temperature ever recorded in Nashville was on <!--del_lnk--> January 21, <!--del_lnk--> 1985, when the temperature dipped to -17 &deg;F (-27 &deg;C), and the highest was on <!--del_lnk--> July 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1952 when the mercury reached 107 &deg;F (42 &deg;C).<p>Nashville&#39;s position within the <!--del_lnk--> Nashville Basin can make it very uncomfortable for <!--del_lnk--> allergy sufferers, as pollutants can become trapped in the atmosphere between the area&#39;s highlands.<p><a id="Metropolitan_area" name="Metropolitan_area"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Metropolitan area</span></h3>

      <p>The City of Nashville and <!--del_lnk--> Davidson County merged in 1963 as a way for Nashville to combat the problems of <!--del_lnk--> urban sprawl. The combined entity is officially known as &quot;the <!--del_lnk--> Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County,&quot; and is popularly known as &quot;Metro Nashville&quot; or simply &quot;Metro&quot;. It offers services such as police, fire, electricity, water, and sewage treatment. When the Metro government was formed in 1963, the government was set into two service districts which are the &quot;urban services district&quot; and the &quot;general services district&quot;. The urban services district encompasses the historic boundaries of the former City of Nashville and the general services district includes the remainder of Davidson County.<p>Nashville has a strong-mayor form of government. It is governed by a mayor, vice-mayor and 40-member Metropolitan Council. The current mayor of Nashville is <!--del_lnk--> Bill Purcell. The Metropolitan Council is the legislative body of government for Nashville and Davidson County. There are 5 councilmembers who are elected at large and 35 councilmembers that represent individual districts. The Metro Council has regular meetings that are presided over by the vice-mayor, who is currently <!--del_lnk--> Howard Gentry, Jr. The Metro Council meets on the first and third Tuesday of each month at 7:00 p.m., according to the Metropolitan Charter.<p>Nashville is one of the few major Southern cities that has remained loyal to the <!--del_lnk--> Democratic Party. Most local elections are officially nonpartisan. However, Democratic dominance is so absolute that most local races take place between the populist and &quot;good government&quot; wings of the Democratic Party. The &quot;good government&quot; faction has held the upper hand for some time. Unlike <!--del_lnk--> Indianapolis, the city-county merger did not significantly alter the political landscape. Elected <!--del_lnk--> Republicans are few and far between. At the state level, only two Republicans&mdash;one in the <!--del_lnk--> State House and one in the <!--del_lnk--> State Senate&mdash;represent significant portions of Nashville.<p>Democrats are no less dominant at the federal level. Since the end of <!--del_lnk--> Reconstruction, the Democratic presidential candidate has won Nashville and Davidson County in every election but two. In <!--del_lnk--> 1968, <!--del_lnk--> George Wallace of the <!--del_lnk--> American Independent Party carried the city by a surprisingly large margin, given Wallace&#39;s opposition to <!--del_lnk--> racial integration; Nashville was much more progressive than most Southern cities regarding civil rights for <!--del_lnk--> African-Americans, especially under Mayor <!--del_lnk--> Beverly Briley. In <!--del_lnk--> 1972, <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_Nixon.htm" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> became the only Republican to carry Nashville since Reconstruction, gaining support from many area Democrats. However, since then, Democrats have usually won Nashville by some of the largest, if not the largest, margins in Tennessee. In <!--del_lnk--> 2000, <!--del_lnk--> Al Gore carried Nashville with over 59% of the vote even as he narrowly lost his home state. In <!--del_lnk--> 2004, <!--del_lnk--> John Kerry carried Nashville with 55% of the vote even as <a href="../../wp/g/George_W._Bush.htm" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> won the state by 14 points.<p>Despite its size, all of Nashville has been in one <!--del_lnk--> congressional district for most of the time since Reconstruction. For most of the time, it has been numbered as the <!--del_lnk--> 5th District, currently represented by Democrat <!--del_lnk--> Jim Cooper. A Republican has not represented a significant portion of Nashville since <!--del_lnk--> 1875. While Republicans made a few spirited challenges in the mid-1960s and early 1970s, they have not made a serious bid for the district since 1972, when the Republican candidate gained only 38% of the vote even as Nixon carried the district by a large margin. The district&#39;s best-known congressman was probably <!--del_lnk--> Jo Byrns, who represented the district from 1909 to 1936 and was <a href="../../wp/s/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives.htm" title="Speaker of the United States House of Representatives">Speaker of the House</a> for much of <!--del_lnk--> Franklin Roosevelt&#39;s first term. Another nationally prominent congressman from Nashville was <!--del_lnk--> Percy Priest, who represented the district from 1941 to 1956 and was <!--del_lnk--> House Majority Whip from 1949 to 1953.<p>A tiny portion of southern Davidson County was drawn into the heavily Republican 7th District after the 2000 Census. That district is currently represented by <!--del_lnk--> Marsha Blackburn of neighboring <!--del_lnk--> Williamson County. Despite this, most living Nashvillians have never been represented by a Republican.<p>Because Nashville serves as state capital, many of Tennessee&#39;s state issues are handled there, mostly in the <!--del_lnk--> Tennessee State Capitol.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>Nashville is a colorful, well-known city in several different arenas. As such, it has earned various sobriquets, including:<ul>
       <li><b>Music City, USA</b>: <!--del_lnk--> WSM-AM announcer David Cobb first used this name during a 1950 broadcast and it stuck. It is now the official nickname used by the <!--del_lnk--> Nashville Convention and Visitors Bureau. Nashville is the home of the <!--del_lnk--> Grand Ole Opry, the <!--del_lnk--> Country Music Hall of Fame, and many major <!--del_lnk--> record labels. <!--del_lnk--> <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Athens of the South</b>: Home to seventeen post-secondary educational institutions, Nashville has long been compared to the ancient city of learning, site of <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Academy. Since 1897, a full-scale <!--del_lnk--> replica of the Athenian Parthenon has stood in Nashville, and many examples of classical and neoclassical architecture can be found in the city. <!--del_lnk--> <li><b>The <!--del_lnk--> Protestant <a href="../../wp/v/Vatican_City.htm" title="Vatican City">Vatican</a></b> or <b>The Buckle of the <!--del_lnk--> Bible Belt</b>: Nashville has over 700 churches (more than any other American city per capita), several seminaries, a number of Christian music companies, and is the headquarters for the publishing arms of both the <!--del_lnk--> Southern Baptist Convention and the <!--del_lnk--> United Methodist Church. It is also the seat of the <!--del_lnk--> National Association of Free Will Baptists, the <!--del_lnk--> Gideons International, the <!--del_lnk--> Gospel Music Association and <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Nelson, the world&#39;s largest producer of <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">Bibles</a>. <!--del_lnk--> <li><b>Cashville</b>: Nashville native <!--del_lnk--> Young Buck, a rapper in the <!--del_lnk--> G-Unit clique, released a very successful album called <i><!--del_lnk--> Straight Outta Ca$hville</i> that has popularized the nickname among a new generation. <!--del_lnk--> <li><b>Nashvegas</b>: The rhinestones and neon of Nashville have given rise to a glitzy image that local residents have embraced. Playing off the image of <!--del_lnk--> Las Vegas, this nickname reflects the city&#39;s colorful nightlife and affluence. It is also an ironic play on Nashville&#39;s reputation as the Buckle of the Bible Belt. <!--del_lnk--> Americana music artist <!--del_lnk--> George Hamilton V has popularized the nickname in song.<!--del_lnk--> <li><b>Trashville</b>: Derogatory term used among anti-&quot;corporate country&quot; country music fans and fans of <!--del_lnk--> rockabilly, <!--del_lnk--> psychobilly, <a href="../../wp/s/Ska.htm" title="Ska">ska</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> swing music to describe the city and &quot;radio country&quot; music. Taken from the title of a <!--del_lnk--> Hank III song.<li><b>Titan Town</b>: For its <!--del_lnk--> NFL team, the <!--del_lnk--> Tennessee Titans. <!--del_lnk--> <li><b>Metro</b>: Short for &quot;Metropolitan Nashville and Davidson County,&quot; <i>Metro</i> is used locally to refer to the city, as in &quot;Metro Police&quot; or &quot;Metro Schools&quot;. <!--del_lnk--> </ul>
