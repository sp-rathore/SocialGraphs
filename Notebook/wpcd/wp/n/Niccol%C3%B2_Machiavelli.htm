      <p>Machiavelli was born in May 3,1469 in the city-state of Florence, Italy. He was the second son of Bernardo di Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli and his wife. Education left him with a thorough knowledge of the Latin and Italian classics.<div class="thumb tleft">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Machiavelli was born into a tumultuous era, in which <a href="../../wp/p/Pope.htm" title="Pope">Popes</a> were leading armies and wealthy city-states of <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> were falling one after another into the hands of foreign powers -- <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> and the <a href="../../wp/h/Holy_Roman_Empire.htm" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>. It was a time of constantly shifting alliances, <!--del_lnk--> condottieri who changed sides without warning, and governments rising and falling in the space of a few weeks. Perhaps most significantly during this erratic upheaval, the rise of <!--del_lnk--> Lutheranism culminated in the <!--del_lnk--> sack of Rome in 1527 at the hands of rampaging German soldiers, the first time that had occurred in nearly twelve centuries. Rich cities like Florence and Genoa suffered a similar fate in the same years. Machiavelli did not live to see the sack of Rome and Florence, but steeped as he was in the Byzantine politics of the age, it is no wonder that he turned his intelligence to analyzing the military and political events surrounding him.<p>He entered government service as a clerk in 1494; that same year, Florence expelled the <!--del_lnk--> Medici family, who had ruled the city for nearly sixty years, and restored the <!--del_lnk--> republic. Machiavelli was named as a member of the Council responsible for diplomatic negotiations and military matters. From 1499 to 1512, he was sent on a number of diplomatic missions to the court of <!--del_lnk--> Louis XII in France, <!--del_lnk--> Ferdinand II of Arag&oacute;n, and the Papacy in Rome. From 1502 to 1503, he was a witness to the effective statebuilding methods of the soldier/churchman <!--del_lnk--> Cesare Borgia, an immensely capable general and statesman who was at that time engaged in enlarging his territories in central Italy through a mixture of audacity, prudence, self-reliance, firmness and, not infrequently, cruelty.<p>From 1503 to 1506, Machiavelli was responsible for the Florentine militia including the defense of the city. He distrusted mercenaries (a philosophy expounded at length in the <i>Discorsi</i>) and much preferred a citizen militia.<p>In August 1512, following a tangled series of battles, treaties, and alliances, the Medici with the help of <!--del_lnk--> Pope Julius II regained power in Florence and the republic was dissolved. Machiavelli, having played a significant role in the republic&#39;s anti-Medici government, was removed from office and in 1513 he was accused of conspiracy and arrested. Although tortured on the rack he denied his involvement and was eventually released. He retired to his estate at San Casciano near Florence and began writing the treatises that would ensure his place in the development of political philosophy.<p>In a famous letter to his friend Francesco Vettori, Machiavelli described how he spent his days in exile:<blockquote>
       <p>When evening comes, I return home [from work and from the local tavern] and go to my study. On the threshold I strip naked, taking off my muddy, sweaty workaday clothes, and put on the robes of court and palace, and in this graver dress I enter the courts of the ancients and am welcomed by them, and there I taste the food that alone is mine, and for which I was born. And there I make bold to speak to them and ask the motives of their actions, and they, in their humanity reply to me. And for the space of four hours I forget the world, remember no vexation, fear poverty no more, tremble no more at death; I pass indeed into their world.</blockquote>
      <p>Much has been made of the notion of two Machiavellis: one of <i>The Prince</i>, one of the <i>Discorsi</i>. But Machiavelli himself cut through the alleged confusion when he identified a unifying theme:<blockquote>
       <p>All cities that ever at any time have been ruled by an absolute prince, by aristocrats or by the people, have had for their protection force combined with prudence, because the latter is not enough alone, and the first either does not produce things, or when they are produced, does not maintain them. Force and prudence, then, are the might of all the governments that ever have been or will be in the world.</blockquote>
      <p>Machiavelli died in Florence in 1527. His resting place is unknown; however a <!--del_lnk--> cenotaph in his honour was placed at the <!--del_lnk--> Church of Santa Croce in Florence.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The Prince is different from other books about creating and controlling principalities because it doesn&#39;t tell the reader what an ideal prince or principality is, but Machiavelli explains through examples, which princes are the most successful in obtaining and maintaining power. Machiavelli draws his examples from personal observations made while he was on diplomatic missions for Florence and from his readings in ancient history. His writing has the mark of the Renaissance upon it because he sprinkles his text with Latin phrases and many examples are drawn from Classical sources.<p>Machiavelli&#39;s best known work is <i>The Prince</i>, in which he describes the arts by which a Prince can retain control of his realm. He focuses primarily on what he calls the <i>principe nuovo</i> or &quot;new prince&quot;, under the assumption that a hereditary prince has an easier task since the people are accustomed to him. All a hereditary prince need do is carefully maintain the institutions that the people are used to; a new prince has a much more difficult task since he must stabilize his newfound power and build a structure that will endure. This task requires the Prince to be publicly above reproach but privately may require him to do things of an evil nature in order to achieve the greater good.<p>A careless reading of <i>The Prince</i> could easily lead one to believe that its central argument is &quot;the ends justify the means&quot; - which is a teleological philosophical view (&quot;telos&quot; is greek for ends) - that any evil action can be justified if it is done for a good purpose. This is a limited interpretation, however, because Machiavelli placed a number of restrictions on evil actions. First, he specified that the only acceptable end was the stabilization and health of the state; individual power <i>for its own sake</i> is not an acceptable end and does not justify evil actions. Second, Machiavelli does not dispense entirely with morality nor advocate wholesale selfishness or degeneracy. Instead he clearly lays out his definition of, for example, the criteria for acceptable cruel actions (it must be swift, effective, and short-lived). Notwithstanding the mitigating themes in <i>The Prince</i>, the Catholic church put the work in its <!--del_lnk--> Index Librorum Prohibitorum and it was viewed in a negative light by many Humanists such as <!--del_lnk--> Erasmus.<p>The term &quot;Machiavellian&quot; was adopted by some of Machiavelli&#39;s contemporaries, often used in the introductions of political tracts of the sixteenth century that offered more &#39;just&#39; reasons of state, most notably those of <!--del_lnk--> Jean Bodin and <!--del_lnk--> Giovanni Botero. The pejorative term <b>Machiavellian</b> as it is used today (or <b>anti-Machiavellism</b> as it was used from the sixteenth century) is thus a misnomer, as it describes one who deceives and manipulates others for gain; whether the gain is personal or not is of no relevance, only that any actions taken are only important insofar as they affect the results. It fails to include some of the more moderating themes found in Machiavelli&#39;s works and the name is now associated with the extreme viewpoint.<p><a id="Discorsi" name="Discorsi"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Discorsi</i></span></h3>

      <p>If <i>The Prince</i> was Machiavelli&#39;s textbook on a monarchy, his <i>Discourse on the First Ten Books of Titus Livy</i> (which comprise the early history of Rome) is a paean to the republic. The <i>Discorsi</i> is a series of lessons on how a republic should be started, structured , including the concept of checks and balances, the strength of a tripartite structure, and the superiority of a republic over a principality, are as valid today as they were six centuries ago and clear applications of his practical political philosophy can be found in the governments of many democracies today, including the United States.<p><a id="Other_works" name="Other_works"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other works</span></h3>
