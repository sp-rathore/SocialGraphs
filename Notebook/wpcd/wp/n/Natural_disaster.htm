      <p>A <b>natural disaster</b> is the consequence of the combination of a <b>natural hazard</b> (a physical event e.g. volcanic eruption, earthquake, landslide) and human activities. Human vulnerability, caused by the lack of appropriate <!--del_lnk--> emergency management, leads to financial, structural, and human losses. The resulting loss depend on the capacity of the population to support or resist the disaster, their resilience . This understanding is concentrated in the formulation: &quot;disasters occur when hazards meet <!--del_lnk--> vulnerability&quot; . A natural hazard will hence never result in a natural disaster in areas without vulnerability, e.g. strong earthquakes in uninhabited areas. The term <i>natural</i> has consequently been disputed because the events simply are not hazards or disasters without human involvement . The degree of potential loss can also depend on the nature of the hazard itself, ranging from <!--del_lnk--> wildfires, which threaten individual buildings, to <!--del_lnk--> impact events, which have the potential to <!--del_lnk--> end civilization.<p>

       <dd>An avalanche is a geophysical hazard involving a slide of a large snow (or rock) mass down a mountainside, caused when a buildup of snow is released down a slope, it is one of the major dangers faced in the mountains in winter. An avalanche is an example of a gravity current consisting of granular material. In an avalanche, lots of material or mixtures of different types of material fall or slide rapidly under the force of gravity. Avalanches are often classified by what they are made of. Notable avalanches include: <ul>
         <li>The <!--del_lnk--> 1970 Ancash earthquake<li>The <!--del_lnk--> 1954 Blons avalanches<li>The <!--del_lnk--> 1999 <!--del_lnk--> Galt&uuml;r Avalanche<li>The <!--del_lnk--> 2002 <!--del_lnk--> Kolka-Karmadon rock ice slide<li>The <!--del_lnk--> 1910 <!--del_lnk--> Wellington avalanche</ul>

       <dd>An earthquake is a <!--del_lnk--> phenomenon that results from and is powered by the sudden release of stored energy that radiates <!--del_lnk--> seismic waves. At the <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a>&#39;s surface, earthquakes may manifest themselves by a shaking or displacement of the ground and sometimes <!--del_lnk--> tsunamis. 90% of all earthquakes - and 81% of the largest - occur around the 40,000km long <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Ring of Fire, which roughly bounds the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Plate. Many earthquakes happen each day, vary few of which are large enough to cause significant damage. Some of the most significant earthquakes in recent times include:</dl>

These flows can destroy entire towns in seconds and kill thousands of people. The <!--del_lnk--> Tangiwai disaster is an excellent example, as is the one which killed an estimated 23,000 people in Armero, <a href="../../wp/c/Colombia.htm" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>, during the 1985 eruption of <!--del_lnk--> Nevado del Ruiz.</dl>
      <dl>
       <dt><!--del_lnk--> Landslides and <!--del_lnk--> Mudflows&nbsp;<dd>A landslide is a disaster closely related to an <a href="../../wp/a/Avalanche.htm" title="Avalanche">avalanche</a>, but instead of occurring with <a href="../../wp/s/Snow.htm" title="Snow">snow</a>, it occurs involving actual elements of the ground, including rocks, <a href="../../wp/t/Tree.htm" title="Tree">trees</a>, parts of houses, and anything else which may happen to be swept up. Landslides can be caused by <a href="../../wp/e/Earthquake.htm" title="Earthquake">earthquakes</a>, <a href="../../wp/v/Volcano.htm" title="Volcanic eruption">volcanic eruptions</a>, or general instability in the surrounding land. Mudslides, or mud flows, are a special case of landslides, in which heavy rainfall causes loose soil on steep terrain to collapse and slide downwards (see also <!--del_lnk--> Lahar); these occur with some regularity in parts of <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a> after periods of heavy rain.</dl>

       <dt><!--del_lnk--> Supervolcano&nbsp;<dd>A supervolcano is an <a href="../../wp/v/Volcano.htm" title="Volcanic eruption">eruption</a> which is thousands of times larger than a normal eruption. If a volcano expels at least 1,000 cubic kilometers of material, it is declared a supervolcano. The last eruption of this magnitude occurred over 75,000 years ago at <a href="../../wp/l/Lake_Toba.htm" title="Lake Toba">Lake Toba</a>. If such an eruption were to occur today, a wholesale general die-off of both animals and humans would occur, as well as a significant short-term climate change. The <!--del_lnk--> Yellowstone Caldera has the potential to become a supervolcano within the near geological future.</dl>

Heat waves are rare and require specific combinations of <a href="../../wp/w/Weather.htm" title="Weather">weather</a> events to take place, and may include <!--del_lnk--> temperature inversions, <!--del_lnk--> katabatic winds, or other phenomena. The worst heat wave in recent history was the <!--del_lnk--> European Heat Wave of 2003.</dl>

       <dd><i>Hurricane</i>, <i>tropical cyclone</i>, and <i>typhoon</i> are different names for the same phenomenon: a cyclonic <!--del_lnk--> storm system that forms over the oceans. It is caused by evaporated <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a> that comes off of the <a href="../../wp/o/Ocean.htm" title="Ocean">ocean</a> and becomes a <!--del_lnk--> storm. The <!--del_lnk--> Coriolis Effect causes the storms to spin, and a hurricane is declared when this spinning mass of storms attains a wind speed greater than 74 mph. <i>Hurricane</i> is used for these phenomena in the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, <i>tropical cyclone</i> in the <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Ocean.htm" title="Indian Ocean">Indian</a>, <i>typhoon</i> in the eastern <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</a>.
