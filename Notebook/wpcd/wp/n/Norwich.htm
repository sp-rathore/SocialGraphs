The Parliamentary seats cross over into adjacent local government districts. The population for the Norwich Urban sub-area was <!--del_lnk--> 174,047 in 2001. It is the 27th largest settlement in England using this measure. However, the population for the whole built-up area was 194,839 in 2001 (census figures), up 5.1% from the 1991 figure of 185,421.

      <p>The <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Britain.htm" title="Roman Britain">Romans</a> had their regional capital at <i><!--del_lnk--> Venta Icenorum</i> on the river to the south which is now at modern day <!--del_lnk--> Caistor St Edmund.<p><a id="Early_English.2FNorman_Conquest" name="Early_English.2FNorman_Conquest"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early English/Norman Conquest</span></h3>
      <p>There are two suggested models of development for Norwich. It is possible that three separate early <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon settlements, one on the north of the river and two either side on the south, joined together as they grew or that one Anglo-Saxon settlement, on the north of the river, emerged mid 7th century after the abandonment of the previous three. The ancient city was a thriving centre for trade and commerce in <!--del_lnk--> East Anglia in <!--del_lnk--> 1004 AD when it was raided and burnt by <!--del_lnk--> Swein Forkbeard the Viking. Mersian coins and sherds of pottery from the Rhineland dating to the 8th century suggest that long distance trade was happening long before this. Between 924-939 AD Norwich became fully established as a town due to the fact that it had its own mint. The word <i>Norvic</i> appears on coins across Europe minted during this period, the reign of <!--del_lnk--> King Athelstan. The Vikings were a strong cultural influence in Norwich for 40-50 years at the end of the 9th century, setting up an Anglo-Scandinavian district towards the south end of present day King Street.<p>At the time of the <!--del_lnk--> Norman Conquest the city was one of the largest in <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>. The <a href="../../wp/d/Domesday_Book.htm" title="Domesday Book">Domesday Book</a> states that it had approximately twenty-five churches and a population of around 5-10,000. It also records the site of an Anglo-Saxon church in Tombland, the site of the Anglo-Saxon market place and the later <!--del_lnk--> Norman cathedral. Norwich continued to be a major centre for trade, the <!--del_lnk--> River Wensum being a convenient export route to the sea. Quern stones, and other artifacts, from Scandinavia and the Rhineland have been found during excavations in Norwich city centre which date from the 11th century onwards.<p>The main area of the city south of the Wensum was destroyed by the construction of the Norman castle (see <!--del_lnk--> Norwich Castle) during the <!--del_lnk--> 1070s creation of a &quot;New&quot; or &quot;<a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a>&quot; borough. During the erection of the castle a new town was built up around it including the market place that is still present today.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1096 Bishop Losinga, then Bishop of Thetford, began construction of the cathedral. Limestone was imported from Caen. To get it up to the cathedral site a canal was cut from the river all the way up to the east wall. He then moved his See there to what became the cathedral church for the <!--del_lnk--> Diocese of Norwich. The bishop of Norwich still signs himself <i>Norvic</i>.<p><a id="Middle_Ages" name="Middle_Ages"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Middle Ages</span></h3>
      <p>By the middle of the 14th century the City Walls, about two and a half miles (4 km) long had been completed. These, along with the river, enclosed a large area, larger than that of the City of London. In the early part of the fifteenth century, <!--del_lnk--> Julian of Norwich wrote her famous work.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1144, the Jews of Norwich were falsely accused of <!--del_lnk--> ritual murder after a boy (<!--del_lnk--> William of Norwich) was found dead with stab wounds. This was the first incidence of <!--del_lnk--> blood libel in England. The story was turned into a cult. William acquiring the status of martyr and was subsequently <!--del_lnk--> canonized as a <!--del_lnk--> saint - this attracted crowds of pilgrims, bringing wealth to the local church. On <!--del_lnk--> February 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1190, all the Jews of Norwich were massacred except for a few who found refuge in the castle.<p>The wealth generated by the <!--del_lnk--> wool trade throughout the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> resulted in the construction of many fine churches. Norwich still has one of the highest number of medieval churches in Western Europe. Norwich Market had trading links from Scandinavia to Spain. Around this time, the city was made a <!--del_lnk--> county corporate.<p>The great immigration of <!--del_lnk--> 1567 brought a substantial <!--del_lnk--> Walloon community of weavers to Norwich. Norwich has been the home of various dissident minorities, notably the French <!--del_lnk--> Huguenot and the Belgian Walloon communities in the <a href="../../wp/1/16th_century.htm" title="16th century">sixteenth</a> and <a href="../../wp/1/17th_century.htm" title="17th century">seventeenth</a> centuries. These immigrants were known locally as &#39;strangers&#39; (there being a hall in the city called &#39;Strangers&#39; Hall&#39; for temporary residence, now a museum) and it seems that generally they were accepted as part of the community without animosity. Primarily through trading connections with mainland <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>, ideas of religious reform and radical politics were introduced to Norwich.<p><a id="English_Civil_Wars_to_Victorian_Era" name="English_Civil_Wars_to_Victorian_Era"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">English Civil Wars to Victorian Era</span></h3>
      <p>The eastern counties were profoundly Parliamentarian in nature and Norwich followed suit, at the cost of some discomfit to the Lord Mayor, a Royalist, and the Bishop <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Hall a moderate but targeted because of his position.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Norwich Canary was first introduced into England by <!--del_lnk--> Flemish refugees fleeing from <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spanish</a> persecution in the <!--del_lnk--> 1500s. They brought with them not only advanced working skills in textiles but also their pet canaries, which they began to breed. The canary is the emblem of the city&#39;s football team, <!--del_lnk--> Norwich City F.C., nicknamed &quot;The Canaries&quot;.<p>Until the 19th Century, Norwich remained a major provincial capital and, alongside Bristol, was rated closely after London in terms of importance and wealth.<p>Norwich&#39;s geographical isolation was such that until 1845 when a <!--del_lnk--> railway connection was established, it was often quicker to travel to <a href="../../wp/a/Amsterdam.htm" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> by boat than to <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>. The railway was brought to Norwich by <!--del_lnk--> Morton Peto who also built the line onto <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Yarmouth.htm" title="Great Yarmouth">Great Yarmouth</a>.<p>From 1808 to 1814 Norwich hosted a station in the <!--del_lnk--> shutter telegraph chain which connected the Admiralty in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> to its naval ships in the port of <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Yarmouth.htm" title="Great Yarmouth">Great Yarmouth</a>.<p><a id="Present_day" name="Present_day"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Present day</span></h2>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> University of East Anglia on the outskirts of Norwich was one of the <!--del_lnk--> New Universities founded in <!--del_lnk--> 1963, following the <!--del_lnk--> Robbins Report. UEA adopted the city&#39;s motto of independence <i>Do different</i> and is especially well-known for its creative-writing programme; established by <!--del_lnk--> Malcolm Bradbury and <!--del_lnk--> Angus Wilson, its graduates include <!--del_lnk--> Kazuo Ishiguro and <!--del_lnk--> Ian McEwan. The university campus houses the <!--del_lnk--> Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts. The city also has an art college, the <!--del_lnk--> Norwich School of Art &amp; Design, located in the centre. Additionally, the <!--del_lnk--> Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital on the city&#39;s periphery at <!--del_lnk--> Colney was opened in <!--del_lnk--> 2001.<div class="thumb tright">

Much of the collection was lost in the 1994 fire, but the collection has been restored by contributions from many veterans of the war, both European and American.<p>Recent attempts to shed the backwater image of Norwich and market it as a popular <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">tourist</a> destination, as well as a centre for <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">science</a>, <!--del_lnk--> commerce, <a href="../../wp/c/Culture.htm" title="Culture">culture</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> arts, have included the refurbishment of the <!--del_lnk--> Norwich Castle Museum and the opening of the Forum. The proposed new <!--del_lnk--> slogan for Norwich, <i>England&#39;s Other City</i>, has been the subject of much discussion and controversy - and it remains to be seen whether it will be finally adopted.

      <p>The city&#39;s economy, originally chiefly industrial with shoemaking a large sector, has changed throughout the eighties and nineties to a service-based economy. <!--del_lnk--> Norwich Union, an Aviva company, still dominates these, but has been joined by other insurance and financial services companies.<p>Norwich Market is an ancient market place, established by the Normans between 1071 and 1074, and is today the largest six days a week open air market in England. The market has recently undergone redevelopment and modernising.<p>New developments on the former <!--del_lnk--> Boulton and Paul site include the Riverside entertainment complex with nightclubs and other venues featuring the usual national leisure brands. Nearby, the football stadium is being upgraded with more residential property development alongside the river Wensum.<p>Castle Mall, a <!--del_lnk--> shopping mall designed by local practice Lambert, Scott &amp; Innes and opened in 1993, presents an ingenious solution to the problem of sensitively creating new retail space in a historic city-centre environment - the building is largely buried underground and in the side of a hill.<p>The new <!--del_lnk--> Chapelfield <!--del_lnk--> shopping mall has been built on the site where the Caleys (later <!--del_lnk--> Rowntree Mackintosh and <!--del_lnk--> Nestl&eacute;) chocolate factory once stood. This opened in late September 2005, and is described as &#39;a major new shopping experience&#39;, featuring a new three-floor flagship <!--del_lnk--> House of Fraser department store. The new shopping mall, which was the largest to open in Britain in 2005, has been criticised as unnecessary and damaging to local businesses; its presence has prompted smaller retailers to band together to promote the virtues of independent shops.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> August 2006 it was reported by the Javelin Group that Norwich was one of the top five retail destinations in the UK,  and in <!--del_lnk--> October 2006 the city centre was voted the best in the UK, in a shopping satisfaction survey run by Goldfish <!--del_lnk--> Credit Card. <p><!--del_lnk--> Archant, formerly known as Eastern Counties Newspapers (ECN) is a national publishing group that has grown out of the city&#39;s local newspaper, the <!--del_lnk--> Norwich Evening News and the regional <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Daily Press (EDP).<p>Norwich has long been associated with the manufacture of <!--del_lnk--> mustard. <!--del_lnk--> Colman&#39;s was founded in <!--del_lnk--> 1814 and continues to operate from its factory at <!--del_lnk--> Carrow.<p><a id="Entertainment" name="Entertainment"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Entertainment</span></h3>
      <p>Satirical comedian <!--del_lnk--> Steve Coogan located his fictional, unbearably vain, cheesy broadcaster &#39;<!--del_lnk--> Alan Partridge&#39; in Norfolk, specifically hosting the pre-breakfast show on the fictional independent station &#39;Radio Norwich&#39;, which since then has been created, although not surprisingly &quot;Up With The Partridge&quot; is not broadcast. It exploited the county&#39;s reputation as being somewhat detached from modern trends, past its prime, and rather peripheral to national life.<p>Other comic entertainers who have drawn comedy from that stereotype include Allan Smethurst &#39;<!--del_lnk--> The Singing Postman&#39; and <!--del_lnk--> The Kipper Family lately represented by &#39;son&#39; <!--del_lnk--> Sid Kipper, though these are associated with Norfolk in general and not just the City. These have been joined by <!--del_lnk--> The Nimmo Twins.<p>Independent radio stations include Radio Broadland (formerly <!--del_lnk--> Broadland 102), <!--del_lnk--> Classic Gold Amber and <!--del_lnk--> 99.9 Radio Norwich. <!--del_lnk--> BBC Radio Norfolk and the University of East Anglia&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Livewire 1350 also broadcast to the city.<p>A new independent radio station, Radio Norwich, was launched at the end of June 2006, broadcasting on 99.9 FM. There is also a thriving Community Radio station which is soon to begin its permanent tenure on the Norwich airwaves called Future Radio.<p>Norwich has a thriving music scene based around local venues such as the Norwich Arts Centre and the Marquee.

      <p>Norwich is occasionally portrayed by the media as a city out-of-step with national trends (see <!--del_lnk--> Alan Partridge); This is primarily due to its geographic isolation which has contributed greatly to its &quot;unspoilt&quot; and insular character.<p>Despite this perception, Norwich has a long history of political radicalism and is by no means a conservative city. With 9 seats, Norwich City Council has the largest number of Green Party councillors anywhere in the country. The largest number of seats, however, is held by the Labour Party with 16; the Liberal Democrats are in second place with 12. The Conservative Party is currently in fourth place with only 2 councillors.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> November <!--del_lnk--> 2006 the city was voted the greenest in the UK. <p>According to the 2001 census, 27.8% of respondents in Norwich stated that they were of &quot;no religion&quot;, the highest percentage in England.<p>There has always been a general tolerance of &quot;incomers&quot; by the &quot;native&quot; population of Norwich and Norfolk, though becoming a &quot;local&quot; is still reckoned to take decades. There are good rail links from <!--del_lnk--> Norwich railway station to <!--del_lnk--> Peterborough and <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, and direct services to <a href="../../wp/c/Cambridge.htm" title="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> were added in 2004.<p>A large proportion of the population of Norwich are users of the <a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">Internet</a>. A recent article has suggested that, compared with other UK cities, it is top of the league for the percentage of population who use the popular Internet auction site <!--del_lnk--> eBay. The city has also unveiled the biggest free <!--del_lnk--> Wi-Fi network in the UK, which opened in July 2006. <p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Thomas Fuller in his <i>The Worthies of England</i> described the City in <b><!--del_lnk--> 1662</b> as -<dl>

      <p>He visited the City as a courtier to <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_II_of_England.htm" title="Charles II of England">King Charles II</a> in 1671 and described it thus -<dl>
       <dd><i>The suburbs are large, the prospect sweet, and other amenities, not omitting the flower-garden, which all the Inhabitants excel in of this City, the fabric of stuffs, which affords the Merchants, and brings a vast trade to this populous Town</i>.</dl>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> George Borrow in his semi-autobiographical novel <!--del_lnk--> Lavengro (1851) wrote of Norwich as-<dl>
       <dd><i>A fine old city, perhaps the most curious specimen at present extant of the genuine old English Town. ..Thre it spreads from north to south, with its venerable houses, its numerous gardens, its thrice twelve churches, its mighty mound....There is an old grey castle on top of that mighty mound: and yonder rising three hundred feet above the soil, from amongst those noble forest trees, behold that old Norman master-work, that cloud-enriched cathedral spire ...Now who can wonder that the children of that fine old city are proud, and offer up prayers for her prosperity?</i></dl>

       <dd><i>I arrived here a week ago and find it a place where the arts are very much cultivated....some branches of knowledge, chemistry, botany, etc. are carried to a great length.

      <p><a id="Architecture" name="Architecture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Architecture</span></h2>
      <p>Norwich is considered to have a wealth of historical architecture. The medieval period is represented by the 11th-century <!--del_lnk--> Norwich Cathedral, 12th-century <!--del_lnk--> castle (now a museum) and a large number of <!--del_lnk--> parish churches. During the Middle Ages, 57 churches stood within the city wall; 31 still exist today. This gave rise to the common (in the city) saying that it had a church for every week of the year, and a pub for every day. Most of the medieval building is in the city centre. From the <a href="../../wp/1/18th_century.htm" title="18th century">18th century</a> the pre-eminent local name is <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Ivory, who built the Assembly Rooms (1776), the Octagon Chapel (1756), St Helen&#39;s House (1752) in the grounds of the <!--del_lnk--> Great Hospital, and innovative speculative housing in Surrey Street (c. 1761). Ivory should not be confused with the Irish architect of the same name and similar period.<p>The 19th century saw an explosion in Norwich&#39;s size and much of its housing stock, as well as commercial building in the city centre, dates from this period. The local architect of the <!--del_lnk--> Victorian and <!--del_lnk--> Edwardian periods who has continued to command most critical respect was <!--del_lnk--> George Skipper (1856-1948). Examples of his work include the headquarters of <!--del_lnk--> Norwich Union on Surrey Street; the <!--del_lnk--> Art Nouveau Royal Arcade; and the Hotel de Paris in the nearby seaside town of <!--del_lnk--> Cromer. The <!--del_lnk--> neo-Gothic Roman Catholic <!--del_lnk--> cathedral on <!--del_lnk--> Earlham Road, begun in 1882, is by <!--del_lnk--> George Gilbert Scott Junior and his brother, <!--del_lnk--> John Oldrid Scott.<p>The city continued to grow through the 20th century and much housing, particularly in areas further out from the city centre, dates from that century. The first notable building post-Skipper was the city hall by CH James and SR Pierce, opened in 1938. Bombing during the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">Second World War</a>, while resulting in relatively little loss of life, caused significant damage to housing stock in the city centre. Much of the replacement postwar stock was designed by the local authority architect, <!--del_lnk--> David Percival. However, the major postwar development in Norwich from an architectural point of view was the opening of the <!--del_lnk--> University of East Anglia in 1964. Originally designed by <!--del_lnk--> Denys Lasdun (his design was never completely executed), it has been added to over subsequent decades by major names such as <!--del_lnk--> Norman Foster and <!--del_lnk--> Rick Mather.<p><a id="Twinned_cities" name="Twinned_cities"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Twinned cities</span></h2>
