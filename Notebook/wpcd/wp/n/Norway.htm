      <p>Archaeological finds indicate that there were people in Norway about <!--del_lnk--> 12,000 years ago. They probably came from more southern regions, that is northern <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>, and travelled further north along the Norwegian coastline.<p>In the <a href="../../wp/9/9th_century.htm" title="9th century">9th century</a>, Norway consisted of a number of <!--del_lnk--> petty kingdoms. According to tradition, <!--del_lnk--> Harald Fairhair gathered the small kingdoms into one in 872 with the <!--del_lnk--> battle of Hafrsfjord. He became the first king of a united Norway.<p>The <a href="../../wp/v/Viking.htm" title="Viking">Viking</a> age (<a href="../../wp/8/8th_century.htm" title="8th century">8th</a> to <a href="../../wp/1/11th_century.htm" title="11th century">11th centuries</a>) was one of unification and expansion. The Norwegians established settlements on <a href="../../wp/i/Iceland.htm" title="Iceland">Iceland</a>, the <a href="../../wp/f/Faroe_Islands.htm" title="Faroe Islands">Faroe Islands</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Greenland.htm" title="Greenland">Greenland</a> and parts of Britain and Ireland, and attempted to settle at <!--del_lnk--> L&#39;Anse aux Meadows in <!--del_lnk--> Newfoundland, <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a> (it is the <!--del_lnk--> Vinland of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Saga of Eric the Red</i>). Norwegians founded the modern-day <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Irish</a> cities of <a href="../../wp/l/Limerick.htm" title="Limerick">Limerick</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Waterford and established trading communities near the <!--del_lnk--> Celtic settlements of <!--del_lnk--> Cork and <a href="../../wp/d/Dublin.htm" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> which later became Ireland&#39;s two most important cities. The spread of Christianity in Norway in this period is in large part attributed to the missionary kings <!--del_lnk--> Olav Trygvason (<!--del_lnk--> 995-<!--del_lnk--> 1000) and <!--del_lnk--> Saint Olav (<!--del_lnk--> 1015-<!--del_lnk--> 1028), although <!--del_lnk--> Haakon the Good was Norway&#39;s first Christian king and the norse tradition was replaced slowly over two centuries (<a href="../../wp/9/9th_century.htm" title="9th century">9th</a> and <a href="../../wp/1/10th_century.htm" title="10th century">10th centuries</a>).<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1349, the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Death.htm" title="Black Death">Black Death</a> wiped out between 40% and 50% of the Norwegian population, causing a decline in both society and economics. During this decline, the <!--del_lnk--> Fairhair dynasty died out in <!--del_lnk--> 1387. Royal politics at the time resulted in several personal unions between the Nordic countries, eventually bringing the thrones of Norway, <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, and <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> under the control of Queen <!--del_lnk--> Margrethe when the country entered into the <!--del_lnk--> Kalmar Union with Denmark and Sweden. Sweden declared its independence in <!--del_lnk--> 1523, but Norway remained under the Danish crown until <!--del_lnk--> 1814. During the <!--del_lnk--> national romanticism of the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a>, this period has sometimes been referred to as the &quot;400-Year Night&quot;, since all of the kingdom&#39;s royal, intellectual, and administrative power was centred in <a href="../../wp/c/Copenhagen.htm" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, Denmark. However, it must be said that the common people of Norway had more freedom than the Danish people because the rural communities of Norway were organised differently than those of Denmark. Other factors also contributed to Norway&#39;s decline in this period. With the introduction of <!--del_lnk--> Protestantism in <!--del_lnk--> 1537, Norway lost the steady stream of pilgrims to the relics of <!--del_lnk--> St. Olav at the <!--del_lnk--> Nidaros shrine, and with them, much of the contact with cultural and economic life in the rest of <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>. Additionally, Norway saw its land area decrease in the <a href="../../wp/1/17th_century.htm" title="17th century">17th century</a> with the loss of the provinces <!--del_lnk--> Bohusl&auml;n, <!--del_lnk--> Jemtland, and <!--del_lnk--> Herjedalen to Sweden, as a result of the wars between <!--del_lnk--> Denmark-Norway and Sweden.<p>After Denmark-Norway was attacked by <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, it entered into an alliance with <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleon_I_of_France.htm" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>, and in <!--del_lnk--> 1814 found itself on the losing side in the <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleonic_Wars.htm" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> and in dire economic conditions. The Dano-Norwegian <!--del_lnk--> Oldenburg king was forced to cede Norway to the king of <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>. Norway took this opportunity to declare independence, adopted a constitution based on <!--del_lnk--> American and <!--del_lnk--> French models, and elected the Danish crown prince <!--del_lnk--> Christian Fredrik as king on <!--del_lnk--> May 17, <!--del_lnk--> 1814. However, Sweden militarily forced Norway into a <!--del_lnk--> personal union with Sweden, establishing <!--del_lnk--> Charles XIII of Sweden as king of Norway (as <b>Carl II</b>). Under this arrangement, Norway kept its liberal constitution and independent institutions, except for the foreign service. See also <!--del_lnk--> Norway in 1814.<p>This period also saw the rise of the <!--del_lnk--> Norwegian romantic nationalism cultural movement, as Norwegians sought to define and express a distinct national character. The movement covered all branches of culture, including literature (<!--del_lnk--> Henrik Wergeland, <!--del_lnk--> Maurits Christopher Hansen, <!--del_lnk--> Bj&oslash;rnstjerne Bj&oslash;rnson, <!--del_lnk--> Peter Christen Asbj&oslash;rnsen, <!--del_lnk--> J&oslash;rgen Moe, <a href="../../wp/h/Henrik_Ibsen.htm" title="Henrik Ibsen">Henrik Ibsen</a>), painting (<!--del_lnk--> Hans Gude, <!--del_lnk--> Adolph Tiedemand), music (<!--del_lnk--> Edvard Grieg), and even language policy, where attempts to define a native written language for Norway led to today&#39;s two official written forms for <!--del_lnk--> Norwegian; <!--del_lnk--> Bokm&aring;l and <!--del_lnk--> Nynorsk.<p><!--del_lnk--> Peter Christian Hersleb Kjerschow Michelsen (March 15, 1857 &ndash; June 29, 1925), a Norwegian shipping magnate and statesman, was Prime Minister of Norway from 1905 to 1907. Michelsen is most known for his central role in the peaceful separation of Norway from Sweden on <!--del_lnk--> June 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1905, and was one of Norway&#39;s most influential politicians of his day. Norway&#39;s growing dissatisfaction with the union with Sweden during the late 19th century, combined with National Romanticism and the awakening sense of nationality contributed to the dissolution of the union. After a national referendum confirmed the people&#39;s preference for a monarchy over a republic, the Norwegian government offered the throne of Norway to the Danish Prince Carl. Parliament <!--del_lnk--> Stortinget unanimously elected him king. He took the name of <!--del_lnk--> Haakon VII, after the medieval kings of independent Norway. In <!--del_lnk--> 1913, Norwegian women gained <!--del_lnk--> suffrage.<p>Norway was a neutral country during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>. Norway also attempted to claim neutrality during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, but was invaded by German forces on <!--del_lnk--> April 9, <!--del_lnk--> 1940 (<!--del_lnk--> Operation Weser&uuml;bung). The Allies also had plans to invade Norway, in order to take advantage of her strategically important Atlantic coast, but were thwarted by the German operation. Norway put up a stiff fight against the German occupation and armed resistance in Norway went on for two months. The battle of <!--del_lnk--> Vinjesvingen eventually became the last stronghold of Norwegian resistance in southern Norway in May, while the armed forces in the north surrendered in early June. King Haakon and the Norwegian government continued the fight from exile in <!--del_lnk--> Rotherhithe, <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>. On the day of the invasion, the collaborative leader of the small National-Socialist party <!--del_lnk--> Nasjonal Samling &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> Vidkun Quisling &mdash; tried to seize power, but was forced by the German occupiers to step aside. Real power was wielded by the leader of the German occupation authority, <i>Reichskommissar</i> <!--del_lnk--> Josef Terboven. Quisling, as <i>minister president</i>, later formed a government under German control. During the five years of <!--del_lnk--> Nazi occupation, Norwegians built a strong <!--del_lnk--> resistance movement which fought the German occupation forces with both armed resistance and civil disobedience. Notable was also the effort of the Norwegian Merchant Navy. At the time of the invasion Norway had the third largest, fastest and the most effective Merchant Navy in the world. It was lead by the Norwegian shipping company Nortraship under the allied force throughout the war and took part in every war operation from the evacuation of Dunkirk to the Normandy landings.<p>Following the war the Social Democrats came to power and ruled the country for much of the cold war. Norway joined the NATO and became a close ally of the United States. Two plebicites to join the European Union failed by a narrow margin.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

The reserve powers vested in the Monarch by the <!--del_lnk--> constitution are significant and an important security part of the role of the <a href="../../wp/m/Monarchy.htm" title="Monarchy">Monarchy</a>, and were last used during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. The Council of State consists of a <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister and his council, formally appointed by the King. <!--del_lnk--> Parliamentarism has evolved since <!--del_lnk--> 1884 and entails that the cabinet must not have the parliament against it, and that the appointment by the King is a formality.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The Norwegian <!--del_lnk--> parliament, <!--del_lnk--> Stortinget, currently has 169 members (increased from 165, effective from the <!--del_lnk--> elections of 12 September 2005). The members are elected from the 19 <!--del_lnk--> counties for 4-year terms according to a system of <!--del_lnk--> proportional representation. The Storting divides itself into two chambers, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Odelsting</i> and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Lagting</i> when voting on legislation. Laws are proposed by the government through a Member of the Council of State or by a member of the Odelsting and decided on by the Odelsting and Lagting, in case of repeated disagreement by the joint Storting. However, in modern time the Lagting rarely disagrees and mainly just <!--del_lnk--> rubber-stamps the Odelsting&#39;s decision. Before the present Storting is a proposed constitutional amendment which would repeal the division.<p>Impeachment cases are very rare (the last being held in <!--del_lnk--> 1927 when prime minister <!--del_lnk--> Abraham Berge was acquitted) and may be brought against Members of the Council of State, or of the Supreme Court or of the Storting, for criminal offences which they may have committed in their official capacity. Indictments are raised by the Odelsting and judged by the Lagting and the Supreme Court justices as part of the High Court of the Realm. Apart from this, the Storting functions as a <!--del_lnk--> unicameral parliament.<p>The regular courts include the <!--del_lnk--> Supreme Court or <i>H&oslash;yesterett</i> (18 permanent judges and a <!--del_lnk--> chief justice), courts of appeal, city and district courts, and conciliation councils. Judges attached to regular courts are appointed by the <!--del_lnk--> King in council after nomination by the Ministry of Justice. The special High Court of the Realm, which consists of the Supreme Court plus the Lagting, hears <!--del_lnk--> impeachment cases.<p>In order to form a government, more than half (currently at least 10 out of 19 members) of the Council of State are required to belong to the <!--del_lnk--> Church of Norway.<p><a id="Human_rights_in_Norway" name="Human_rights_in_Norway"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Human rights in Norway</span></h2>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Freedom of expression is enshrined in paragraph 100, <!--del_lnk--> Freedom of religion in paragraph 2 of the <!--del_lnk--> Constitution of Norway, though many consider this compromised in practice by the establishment of a state church. The press is not censored, but most editors adhere to self-imposed commandments of caution (&quot;<!--del_lnk--> V&aelig;r Varsom-plakaten&quot;). Public radio and TV broadcast mostly without interference from the government, although permission to broadcast depends on the programme spectrum.<p>The constitution forbids <!--del_lnk--> retroactive laws, punishment not based on laws and court decisions, and the use of <!--del_lnk--> torture. In 1999 the Human Right conventions of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Council of Europe were constituted as law in Norway, <i>Menneskerettsloven</i>. <!--del_lnk-->  However, Norwegian Lawyers as well as the Council of Europe&#39;s Committee Against Torture have expressed their concern about unwarranted imprisonment of criminal defendants and the use of solitary confinement in Norway, deeming it torture. <!--del_lnk-->  Also the treatment of refugees has been under discussion.<p>In 2005 the international conventions against discrimination of women and race discrimination were incorporated in, but not superior to, Norwegian law. <!--del_lnk--> Amnesty International has recently focused on violence against women in Norway and shortage of public services to victims of violence. <!--del_lnk--> <p>Norway has mandatory military service of 9-12 months for men between the ages of 18 (17 with parental consent) and 44. Conscientious objectors serve 12 months in an alternative civilian national service. If a candidate refuses to attend the assessment of fitness (&quot;sesjon&quot;), where any objections to future military service is to be brought up, they are liable to prosecution. A person who is deemed fit for service and who is not a conscientious objector, but still refuses military service is also liable to prosecution. However, recent changes to the structure of the armed forces has resulted in less demand for soldiers, and hence the number of soldiers actually having to attend military service is decreasing.<p>Homosexuality was officially decriminalized in 1972; homosexual partnerships in 1993. According to Statistisk sentralbyr&aring; (SSB) there were 192 homosexual partnerships recorded in 2004.

      <p>Norway is divided into 19 administrative regions, called <i>fylker</i> (singular <i>fylke</i>) and 431 <i>kommuner</i> (singular <i>kommune</i>). <i>Fylke</i> and <i>kommune</i> are officially translated to <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> as <i><!--del_lnk--> county</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> municipality</i>.

      <p>Norway possesses the second highest GDP per capita in the world, and the highest position in the World on the <!--del_lnk--> Human Development Index (HDI) for the fifth consecutive year. The Norwegian economy is an example of <!--del_lnk--> mixed economy, featuring a combination of <!--del_lnk--> free market activity and government intervention. The government controls key areas, such as the vital <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> sector and the electricity production. The control mechanisms over the petroleum resources is a combination of state ownership in major operators in the Norwegian fields (<!--del_lnk--> Statoil ca 70% in <!--del_lnk--> 2005, <!--del_lnk--> Norsk Hydro 43% in <!--del_lnk--> 2004) while specific taxes on oil-profits for all operators are set to 78%, finally the government controls licensing of exploration and production of fields. The country is richly endowed with natural resources: <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a>, <!--del_lnk--> hydropower, <a href="../../wp/f/Fish.htm" title="Fish">fish</a>, <!--del_lnk--> forests, and <!--del_lnk--> minerals. Norway has obtained one of the highest standards of living in the world, partly from petroleum production but mainly from efficient economic policies, creating a good environment for doing business. Norway has a very high employment ratio.<p>In 2004, oil and gas accounted for 50% of exports. Only <a href="../../wp/s/Saudi_Arabia.htm" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> and <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> export more oil than Norway, which is not a member of <!--del_lnk--> OPEC. The last 30 years, the Norwegian economy has shown various signs of the economic phenomenon called <!--del_lnk--> Dutch disease. In response to Dutch Disease, and to concerns about oil and gas reserve depletions, in 1995 the Norwegian state started to put away the annual surplus in a fund, now called <!--del_lnk--> The Government Pension Fund. The fund is invested in developed financial markets outside Norway. The fiscal strategy is to spend the &quot;normal interest&quot; of the fund each year, set to 4%. By January 2006, the Fund was at USD 200 billion, representing 70% of GDP in Norway.<p>Norway opted to stay out of the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> during a referendum in 1972, and again in November <!--del_lnk--> 1994. However, Norway, together with <a href="../../wp/i/Iceland.htm" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> and <a href="../../wp/l/Liechtenstein.htm" title="Liechtenstein">Liechtenstein</a>, participates in the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a>&#39;s single market via the <!--del_lnk--> European Economic Area (EEA) agreement. The EEA Treaty, between the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> countries and the <!--del_lnk--> EFTA countries, transposed into Norwegian law via &quot;E&Oslash;S-loven&quot; <!--del_lnk--> , states the procedures for implementing European Union rules in Norway and the other EFTA countries. This makes Norway a highly integrated member of most sectors of the EU internal market. However, some sectors (e.g. agriculture, oil and fish) are not covered wholly by the EEA Treaty. Norway has also acceded to the <!--del_lnk--> Schengen Agreement and several other intergovernmental agreements between the EU member states.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 2000 the government sold one-third of the then 100% state-owned oil company <!--del_lnk--> Statoil in an <!--del_lnk--> IPO. The next year, the main telecom supplier, <!--del_lnk--> Telenor, was listed on <!--del_lnk--> Oslo Stock Exchange. The state also owns significant shares of Norway&#39;s biggest bank, <!--del_lnk--> DnB Nor and the airliner <!--del_lnk--> SAS.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> economic growth has been rapid recently, pushing unemployment down to levels not seen since the early 1980s.<p>Recent research shows early evidence of massive amounts of <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a> beneath the oil-reserves on the <!--del_lnk--> continental shelf of Norway. A rough estimate has been given at 3&times;10<small><sup>12</sup></small>&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> tonnes of coal of unknown quality in these reserves. In comparison, the currently known coal reserves for the entire world is estimated at 0.9&times;10<small><sup>12</sup></small>&nbsp;tonnes. The coal is inaccessible today, but there are realistic hopes that it can be accessed in the future.<p><a href="../../wp/a/Animal_rights.htm" title="Animal rights">Animal rights</a> and anti-<!--del_lnk--> whaling groups have commented that given Norway&#39;s economic position it is <!--del_lnk--> paradoxical that this is one of a very small number of countries actively engaged in, and favouring the continuation of, commercial whaling. This is despite the argued negligible contribution that whaling makes to the economy, and despite opposition from around the world (<!--del_lnk--> ). Many supporters of whaling agree that its <!--del_lnk--> macroeconomic importance is negligible, but hold that the livelihood of individuals and small firms depend on it and that <!--del_lnk--> sustainable development depends on human <a href="../../wp/h/Harvest.htm" title="Harvest">harvesting</a> of all non-<!--del_lnk--> endangered species (<!--del_lnk--> ), and that it is an important part of <a href="../../wp/c/Culture.htm" title="Culture">culture</a> in coastal areas.

      <p>The size of the Norwegian population is around 4.6 million and is increasing by 0.4% per year (estimate July 2004). <!--del_lnk--> Ethnically most Norwegians are <!--del_lnk--> Nordic / North <!--del_lnk--> Germanic, while small minorities in the north are <!--del_lnk--> Sami or <!--del_lnk--> Finnish (see also <!--del_lnk--> Kven). The Sami are considered an indigenous people and traditionally live in the central and northern parts of Norway and Sweden, as well as in northern Finland and in Russia on the Kola Peninsula. The largest concentration of Sami people is, however, found in Norway&#39;s capital <a href="../../wp/o/Oslo.htm" title="Oslo">Oslo</a>.<p>In recent years, <!--del_lnk--> immigration has accounted for more than half the population growth, and 7.9% of the population are immigrants as of <!--del_lnk--> 1 January <!--del_lnk--> 2005. The largest immigrant groups are <a href="../../wp/d/Demographics_of_Pakistan.htm" title="Demographics of Pakistan">Pakistanis</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Swedes, <!--del_lnk--> Danes, <!--del_lnk--> Iraqis, <!--del_lnk--> Vietnamese and <a href="../../wp/s/Somalia.htm" title="Somalia">Somalis</a>. (Here, immigrants are defined as persons with two foreign-born parents <!--del_lnk--> .) At the beginning of 2006, there were 387 000 persons in Norway with immigrant background, referring to 8.3 per cent of the total population. The Iraqi immigrant population has showed a large increase over the last years, and now it is the third largest immigrant group in Norway after Pakistanis and Swedes. <p>Approximately 86% of Norway&#39;s inhabitants are members of the state church, the <!--del_lnk--> Evangelic Lutheran Church of Norway. However, baptism has a strong tradition in Norway, and since many people never bother to manually withdraw their membership, this number does probably not reflect the actual faith of the inhabitants. Moreover, many Norwegians have found themselves being members even after manually withdrawing their membership, and there are indications that at least previously all newborn Norwegians were automatically registered as members of the state church, not only the baptised ones. Other <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christian</a> denominations total about 4.5% (the <!--del_lnk--> Evangelical Lutheran Free Church, the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Pentecostal congregations, the <!--del_lnk--> Methodist Church, etc). Among other religions, <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> is the largest in Norway with around 1.5%, and other religions comprise less than 1% each, (including <a href="../../wp/j/Judaism.htm" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>; see <!--del_lnk--> Jews in Norway). Around 1.5% adhere to the secular <!--del_lnk--> Human Ethical Union. As of <!--del_lnk--> 1 January <!--del_lnk--> 2003 approximately 5% of the population are unaffiliated (<!--del_lnk--> ).<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Norwegian language has two official written forms, <i><!--del_lnk--> Bokm&aring;l</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Nynorsk</i>. They have officially equal status, i.e. they are both used in public administration, in schools, churches, and on radio and television, but Bokm&aring;l is used by the majority. Around 95% of the population speak Norwegian as their native tongue, although many speak <!--del_lnk--> dialects that differ significantly from the written language. Nevertheless, all of the Norwegian dialects are interintelligible. Several <!--del_lnk--> Sami languages are spoken and written throughout the country, especially in the north, by the <!--del_lnk--> Sami people. The <!--del_lnk--> Germanic Norwegian language and the <!--del_lnk--> Finno-Ugric Sami languages are entirely unrelated. However, the <!--del_lnk--> Finnish language is distantly related to the Sami language.<p><a id="Neighboring_Countries" name="Neighboring_Countries"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Neighboring Countries</span></h2>
