      <p><!--del_lnk--> Joseph Dalton Hooker described <i>N. rajah</i> in 1859, naming it in honour of <!--del_lnk--> Sir James Brooke, the first White Rajah of Sarawak. In the past, the latin name was written as <i><b>Nepenthes Rajah</b></i>, since it derives from a <!--del_lnk--> proper noun. However, this capitalisation is considered incorrect today. <b>Rajah Brooke&#39;s Pitcher Plant</b> is an accurate, but seldom-used <!--del_lnk--> common name. <i>N. rajah</i> is also sometimes called the <b>Giant Malaysian Pitcher Plant</b> or simply <b>Giant Pitcher Plant</b>, although the <a href="../../wp/b/Binomial_nomenclature.htm" title="Binomial nomenclature">binomial name</a> remains by far the most popular way of referring to this species. The specific <!--del_lnk--> epithet <i><!--del_lnk--> rajah</i> means &quot;King&quot; in <!--del_lnk--> Malay and this, coupled with the impressive size of its pitchers, has meant that <i>N. rajah</i> is often referred to as the &quot;King of <i>Nepenthes</i>&quot;.<p><a id="Plant_characteristics" name="Plant_characteristics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Plant characteristics</span></h2>

      <p><i>Nepenthes rajah</i>, like virtually all species in the genus, is a scrambling vine. The <!--del_lnk--> stem usually grows along the ground, but will attempt to climb whenever it comes into contact with an object that can support it. The stem is relatively thick (&le;30&nbsp;mm) and may reach up to 6 m in length, although it rarely exceeds 3 m. <i>N. rajah</i> does not produce <!--del_lnk--> runners as some other species in the genus, but older plants are known to form <!--del_lnk--> basal offshoots. This is especially common in plants from <!--del_lnk--> tissue culture, where offshoots may form at a young age.<p><a id="Leaves" name="Leaves"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Leaves</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Leaves are produced at regular intervals along the stem. They are connected to the stem by sheathed structures known as <!--del_lnk--> petioles. A long, narrow <!--del_lnk--> tendril emanates from the end of each leaf. At the tip of the tendril is a small bud which, when <!--del_lnk--> physiologically activated, develops into a functioning trap. Hence, the pitchers are modified leaves and not specialised <!--del_lnk--> flowers as is often believed. The green structure most similar to a normal leaf is specifically known as the <!--del_lnk--> lamina or leaf blade.<div class="thumb tright">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>The leaves of <i>N. rajah</i> are very distinctive and reach a large size. They are leathery in texture with a wavy outer margin. The leaves are characteristically <!--del_lnk--> peltate, whereby the tendril joins the lamina on the underside, before the <!--del_lnk--> apex. Three to five longitudinal veins run along each side of the lamina and <!--del_lnk--> pennate (branching) veins run towards the margin. The lamina is oblong to <!--del_lnk--> lanceolate-shaped, &le;80&nbsp;cm long and &le;15&nbsp;cm wide. The tendrils are inserted &le;5&nbsp;cm below the leaf apex and reach a length of approximately 50&nbsp;cm.<p><a id="Pitchers" name="Pitchers"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Pitchers</span></h3>
      <p>All <i>Nepenthes</i> pitchers share several basic characteristics. Traps consist of the main pitcher cup, which is covered by an <!--del_lnk--> operculum or lid that prevents rainwater from entering the pitcher and displacing or diluting its contents. A reflexed ring of hardened tissue that surrounds the entrance to the pitcher is usually present and is known as the <!--del_lnk--> peristome. A pair of fringed wings runs down the front of every trap and these presumably serve to guide terrestrial insects into the pitcher&#39;s mouth. Accordingly, the wings are greatly reduced or completely lacking in aerial pitchers, for which flying insects constitute the majority of prey items.<div class="thumb tleft">
       <div style="width:137px;"><a class="internal" href="../../images/204/20463.jpg.htm" title="Terrestrial pitcher"><img alt="Terrestrial pitcher" height="203" longdesc="/wiki/Image:Rajahpitcher3.jpg" src="../../images/204/20463.jpg" width="135" /></a><div class="thumbcaption">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p><i>N. rajah</i> produces two distinct types of traps. &quot;Lower&quot; or &quot;terrestrial&quot; pitchers are the most common. These are very large, richly coloured and ovoid in shape. Exceptional specimens may be up to 40&nbsp;cm high and capable of holding 3.5&nbsp;litres of water and in excess of 2.5 litres of <!--del_lnk--> digestive fluid, although most do not exceed 200&nbsp;ml. The lower pitchers of <i>N. rajah</i> are probably the largest in the genus by volume, rivaled only by those of <i><!--del_lnk--> N. merrilliana</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> N. truncata</i> and the giant form of <i><!--del_lnk--> N. rafflesiana</i>. These traps rest on the ground and are often reclined, leaning against surrounding objects for support. They are usually red to purple on the outside, whilst the inside surfaces are lime green to purple. This gives a striking contrast to all other parts of the plant, which are yellow-green. The lower pitchers of <i>N. rajah</i> are unmistakable and for this reason it is easy to distinguish it from all other Bornean <i>Nepenthes</i> species.<p>Mature plants may also produce &quot;upper&quot; or &quot;aerial&quot; pitchers, which are much smaller, <!--del_lnk--> funnel-shaped and usually less colourful than the lowers. True upper pitchers are seldom seen, as the stems of <i>N. rajah</i> rarely attain lengths greater than a few metres before dying off and being replaced by off-shoots from the main rootstock.<p>Upper and lower pitchers differ significantly in <!--del_lnk--> morphology, as they are specialised for attracting and capturing different prey. Pitchers that do not fall directly into either category are simply known as &quot;intermediate&quot; pitchers.<p>The peristome of <i>N. rajah</i> has a highly distinctive scalloped edge and is greatly expanded, forming an attractive red lip around the trap&#39;s mouth. A series of raised protrusions, known as ribs, intersect the peristome, ending in short, sharp teeth that line its inner margin. Two fringed wings run from the tendril attachment to the lower edge of the peristome.<p>The huge, vaulted lid of <i>N. rajah</i>, the largest in the genus, is another distinguishing characteristic of this species. It is ovate to oblong in shape and has a distinct <!--del_lnk--> keel running down the middle. The <!--del_lnk--> spur at the back of the lid is approximately 20&nbsp;mm long and unbranched.<p><i>N. rajah</i> is noted for having very large <!--del_lnk--> nectar-<!--del_lnk--> secreting <!--del_lnk--> glands covering its pitchers. These are quite different from those of any other <i>Nepenthes</i> and are easily recognisable (see <!--del_lnk--> ). The inner surface of the pitcher, in particular, is wholly <!--del_lnk--> glandular, with 300 to 800 glands/cm&sup2;.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p><a id="Flowers" name="Flowers"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Flowers</span></h3>
      <p><i>N. rajah</i> seems to flower at any time of the year. Flowers are produced in large numbers on <!--del_lnk--> inflorescences that arise from the apex of the main stem. <i>N. rajah</i> produces a very large inflorescence that can be 80&nbsp;cm, and sometimes even 120&nbsp;cm tall. The individual flowers of <i>N. rajah</i> are produced on partial <!--del_lnk--> peduncles (twin <!--del_lnk--> stalks) and so the inflorescence is called a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> raceme&quot; (as opposed to a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> panicle&quot; for multi-flowered bunches). The flowers are reported to give off a strong sugary smell and are brownish-yellow in colour. <!--del_lnk--> Sepals are elliptic to oblong and &le;8&nbsp;mm long. Like all <i>Nepenthes</i> species, <i>N. rajah</i> is <!--del_lnk--> dioecious, which means that each plant produces either <!--del_lnk--> male or <!--del_lnk--> female flowers, but never both. Fruits are orange-brown and 10 to 20 mm long (see <!--del_lnk--> ).<p><a id="Other_characteristics" name="Other_characteristics"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other characteristics</span></h3>
      <p>All parts of the plant are covered in long, white hairs when young, but mature plants are virtually <!--del_lnk--> glabrous (lacking hair). This covering of hair is known as the <!--del_lnk--> indumentum.<p>The colour of <!--del_lnk--> herbarium specimens is dark-brown in varying hues (see <!--del_lnk--> ).<p>Little variation has been observed within natural populations of <i>Nepenthes rajah</i> and, consequently, no forms or varieties have been described. Furthermore, <i>N. rajah</i> has no published <!--del_lnk--> synonyms, unlike many other <i>Nepenthes</i> species, which exhibit greater variability.<p><a id="Carnivory" name="Carnivory"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Carnivory</span></h2>

      <p><i>Nepenthes rajah</i> is a <!--del_lnk--> carnivorous plant of the <!--del_lnk--> pitfall trap variety. It is famous for occasionally trapping <a href="../../wp/v/Vertebrate.htm" title="Vertebrate">vertebrates</a> and even small <a href="../../wp/m/Mammal.htm" title="Mammal">mammals</a>. There exist at least two records of drowned <!--del_lnk--> rats found in <i>N. rajah</i> pitchers. The first observation dates from 1862 and was made by <!--del_lnk--> Spencer St. John, who accompanied <!--del_lnk--> Hugh Low on two ascents of Mount Kinabalu. In 1988, <!--del_lnk--> Anthea Phillipps and <!--del_lnk--> Anthony Lamb confirmed the plausability of this record when they managed to observe drowned <!--del_lnk--> rats in a large pitcher of <i>N. rajah</i>. <i>N. rajah</i> is also known to occasionally trap other small <!--del_lnk--> vertebrates, including <a href="../../wp/f/Frog.htm" title="Frog">frogs</a>, <!--del_lnk--> lizards and even <!--del_lnk--> birds, although these cases probably involve sick animals, or those seeking shelter or water in the pitcher, and certainly do not represent the norm. <a href="../../wp/i/Insect.htm" title="Insect">Insects</a>, and particularly <a href="../../wp/a/Ant.htm" title="Ants">ants</a>, comprise the majority of prey in both aerial and terrestrial pitchers. Other <a href="../../wp/a/Arthropod.htm" title="Arthropod">arthropods</a>, such as <!--del_lnk--> centipedes, also fall prey to <i>N. rajah</i>.<p><i><!--del_lnk--> N. rafflesiana</i> is the only other <i>Nepenthes</i> species reliably documented as having caught <a href="../../wp/m/Mammal.htm" title="Mammal">mammalian</a> prey in its natural habitat. In <a href="../../wp/b/Brunei.htm" title="Brunei">Brunei</a>, frogs, <!--del_lnk--> geckos and <!--del_lnk--> skinks have been found in the pitchers of this species. The remains of <!--del_lnk--> mice have also been reported.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> September 29, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, at the <!--del_lnk--> Jardin botanique de Lyon in <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, a cultivated <i><!--del_lnk--> N. truncata</i> was photographed containing the decomposing corpse of a mouse.<p><a id="Interactions_with_animals" name="Interactions_with_animals"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Interactions with animals</span></h2>

      <p>Although <i>Nepenthes</i> are most famous for trapping and digesting animals, their pitchers also play host to a large number of other organisms (known as <!--del_lnk--> infauna). These include <!--del_lnk--> fly and <!--del_lnk--> midge <!--del_lnk--> larvae, <!--del_lnk--> spiders (most notably the <!--del_lnk--> crab spider <i><!--del_lnk--> Misumenops nepenthicola</i>), <!--del_lnk--> mites, <a href="../../wp/a/Ant.htm" title="Ants">ants</a>, and even a species of <!--del_lnk--> crab, <i><!--del_lnk--> Geosesarma malayanum</i>. The most common and conspicuous predators found in pitchers are <!--del_lnk--> mosquito <!--del_lnk--> larvae, which consume large numbers of other larvae during their development. Many of these animals are so specialised that they cannot survive anywhere else, and are referred to as <!--del_lnk--> nepenthebionts.<p>The complex relationships between these various organisms are not yet fully understood. The question of whether infaunal animals &quot;steal&quot; food from their hosts, or whether they are involved in a mutually beneficial (<!--del_lnk--> symbiotic) association has yet to be investigated experimentally and is the source of considerable debate. <!--del_lnk--> Clarke suggests that <!--del_lnk--> mutualism is a &quot;likely situation&quot;, whereby &quot;the infauna receives <!--del_lnk--> domicile, protection and food from the plant, while in return, the infauna helps to break down the prey, increase the rate of digestion and keep bacterial numbers low&quot;.<p><a id="Species_specific" name="Species_specific"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Species specific</span></h3>
      <p>As the size and shape of <i>Nepenthes</i> pitchers vary greatly between species, but little within a given taxon, it is not surprising that many infaunal organisms are specially adapted to life in only the traps of particular species. <i>N. rajah</i> is no exception, and in fact has two mosquito taxa named after it. <i><!--del_lnk--> Culex (Culiciomyia) rajah</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Toxorhynchites (Toxorhynchites) rajah</i> were described by <!--del_lnk--> Masuhisa Tsukamoto in 1989, based on larvae collected in pitchers of <i>N. rajah</i> on Mount Kinabalu three years earlier. The two species were found to live in association with larvae of <i><!--del_lnk--> Culex (Lophoceraomyia) jenseni</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Uranotaenia (Pseudoficalbia) moultoni</i> and an undescribed taxon, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Tripteroides (Rachionotomyia)</i> sp. No. 2. Concerning <i>C. rajah</i>, Tsukamoto noted that the &quot;body surface of most larvae are covered in <i><!--del_lnk--> Vorticella</i>-live <!--del_lnk--> protozoa&quot;. At present, nothing is known of this species with regards to its adult biology, habitat, or medical importance as a vector of diseases. The same is true for <i>T. rajah</i>; nothing is known of its biology except that adults are not <!--del_lnk--> haematophagous.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Another species, <i>Culex shebbearei</i>, has also been recorded as an infaunal organism of <i>N. rajah</i> in the past. The original 1931 record by <!--del_lnk--> F. W. Edwards is based on a collection by <!--del_lnk--> H. M. Pendlebury in 1929 from a plant growing on Mount Kinabalu. However, Tsukamoto notes that in light of new information on these species, &quot;it seems more likely to conclude that the species [<i>C. rajah</i>] is a new species which has been misidentitied as <i>C. shebbearei</i> for a long time, rather than to think that both <i>C. shebbearei</i> and <i>C. rajah</i> n. sp. are living in pitchers of <i>Nepenthes rajah</i> on Mt. Kinabalu&quot;.<p><a id="Pests" name="Pests"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Pests</span></h3>
      <p>Not all interactions between <i>Nepenthes</i> and <!--del_lnk--> fauna are beneficial to the plant. <i>N. rajah</i> is sometimes attacked by insects which feed on its leaves and remove substantial portions of the lamina. Also, <a href="../../wp/m/Monkey.htm" title="Monkeys">monkeys</a> and <!--del_lnk--> tarsiers are known to occasionally rip pitchers open to feed on their contents.<p><a id="Classification" name="Classification"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Classification</span></h2>

      <p><i>Nepenthes rajah</i> is not generally considered to be closely related to any other species, due to its unusual pitcher and leaf morphology. However, several attempts have been made to deduce natural groupings within the <i>Nepenthes</i> genus, in order to show relationships between taxa below those at the genus rank, which have grouped <i>N. rajah</i> with other species thought to share certain traits with it.<p><a id="Nineteenth_century" name="Nineteenth_century"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Nineteenth century</span></h3>
      <p>The <i>Nepenthes</i> were first split up in 1873, when <!--del_lnk--> Hooker published his <!--del_lnk--> monograph on the genus. Hooker distinguished <i><!--del_lnk--> N. pervillei</i> from all other taxa based on the fact that seeds of this species lacked appendages that were found to be present in all other <i>Nepenthes</i> (though greatly reduced in <i><!--del_lnk--> N. madagascariensis</i>) and subsequently placed it in the <!--del_lnk--> monotypic <!--del_lnk--> subgenus <i>Anurosperma</i> (<a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a>: <i>anuro</i>: without nerves, <i>sperma</i>: seeds). All other species were subsumed in the second subgenus, <i>Eunepenthes</i> (Latin: <i>eu</i>: true; &quot;true&quot; <i>Nepenthes</i>).<p>A second attempt to establish a natural subdivision within the genus was made in 1895 by <!--del_lnk--> G&uuml;nther von Mannagetta und L&euml;rchenau Beck in his <i>Monographische Skizze</i> (<a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a>: <i>Monographische</i>: monographic, <i>Skizze</i>: sketch). Beck kept the two subgenera created by Hooker, but divided <i>Eunepenthes</i> into three subgroups: <i>Retiferae</i>, <i>Apruinosae</i> and <i>Pruinosae</i>. <i>N. rajah</i> formed part of the <i>Apruinosae</i> (Latin: pl. of <i>apruinosa</i>: not frosted). Most contemporary <!--del_lnk--> taxonomists agree that Beck&#39;s groupings have little, if any, taxonomical value, as they were based on arbitrary traits not suitable for use as a basis for classification.<p><a id="Twentieth_century" name="Twentieth_century"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Twentieth century</span></h3>
      <p><i>Nepenthes</i> taxonomy was once again revised in 1908 by <!--del_lnk--> John Muirhead Macfarlane in his own monograph. Oddly, Macfarlane did not name the groups he distinguished. His revision is often not considered to be a natural division of the genus.<p>In 1928, <!--del_lnk--> B. H. Danser published his monograph, in which he divided <i>Nepenthes</i> into six <!--del_lnk--> clades, based on observations of herbarium material. The clades were: the <i>Vulgatae</i>, <i>Montanae</i>, <i>Nobiles</i>, <i>Regiae</i>, <i>Insignes</i> and <i>Urceolatae</i>. Danser placed <i>N. rajah</i> in the <i>Regiae</i> (Latin: pl. of <i>r&#x113;gia</i>: royal). The <i>Regiae</i> clade as proposed by Danser is shown in the table to the right.<p>Most of the species in this clade are large plants with <!--del_lnk--> petiolate leaves, an <!--del_lnk--> indumentum of coarse reddish-brown hairs, raceme-like inflorescence, and funnel-shaped (infundibulate) upper pitchers. All bear a characteristic appendage on the lower surface of the lid near the apex. With the exception of <i>N. lowii</i>, the <i>Regiae</i> all have a mostly flattened or expanded peristome. The majority of species comprising <i>Regiae</i> are <!--del_lnk--> endemic to Borneo. Based on current understanding of the genus, <i>Regiae</i> appears to reflect the relationships of its members quite well, although the same cannot be said for the other clades. Despite this, Danser&#39;s classification was undoubtedly a great improvement on previous attempts.<p>The taxonomical work of Danser (1928) was revised by <!--del_lnk--> Hermann Harms in 1936. Harms divided <i>Nepenthes</i> into three subgenera: <i>Anurosperma</i> Hooker.f. (1873), <i>Eunepenthes</i> Hooker.f. (1873) and <i>Mesonepenthes</i> Harms (1936) (Latin: <i>meso</i>: middle; &quot;middle&quot; <i>Nepenthes</i>). The <i>Nepenthes</i> species found in the subgenera <i>Anurosperma</i> and <i>Mesonepenthes</i> differ from those in the <i>Vulgatae</i>, where Danser had placed them. Harms included <i>N. rajah</i> in the subgenus <i>Eunepenthes</i> together with the great majority of other <i>Nepenthes</i>; <i>Anurosperma</i> was a <!--del_lnk--> monotypic subgenus, while <i>Mesonepenthes</i> contained only three species. He also created an additional clade, the <i>Distillatoriae</i> (after <i><!--del_lnk--> N. distillatoria</i>).<p><a id="Glandular_morphology" name="Glandular_morphology"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Glandular morphology</span></h3>
      <p>In 1976, <!--del_lnk--> Shigeo Kurata proposed that glands present in <i>Nepenthes</i> pitchers were unique to individual species and could be used to distinguish between closely-related taxa or even be used as a basis for their classification. Kurata studied two types: the <!--del_lnk--> nectar glands of the lid and the digestive glands of the inside of the pitcher cup. He divided the latter into the &quot;lower&quot;, &quot;upper&quot; and &quot;middle&quot; parts (see <!--del_lnk--> ). Although this novel approach shed additional light on the similarities between certain species, it has since been largely abandoned by <!--del_lnk--> taxonomists and <!--del_lnk--> botanists specialising in the genus, in favour of classical <!--del_lnk--> taxonomical nomenclature based on a description of morphological characters.<table border="1" cellpadding="1" style="float: left; margin: 0em 1em 1em 0em; width: 450px; border: 1px #bbbbbb solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 85%;">

      <p>More recently, <!--del_lnk--> biochemical analysis has been used as a means to determine cladistical relationships between <i>Nepenthes</i> species. In 1975, <!--del_lnk--> David E. Fairbrothers <i>et al.</i> first suggested a link between chemical properties and certain morphological groupings, based on the theory that morphologically similar plants produce chemical constituents with similar therapeutic effects.<p>In 2002, <!--del_lnk--> phytochemical screening and <!--del_lnk--> analytical chromatography were used to study the presence of <!--del_lnk--> phenolic <!--del_lnk--> compounds and <!--del_lnk--> leucoanthocyanins in several naturally-occurring <!--del_lnk--> hybrids and their putative parental species (including <i>N. rajah</i>) from Sabah and Sarawak. The research was based on leaf material from nine dry herbarium specimens. Eight spots containing <!--del_lnk--> phenolic acids, <!--del_lnk--> flavonols, <!--del_lnk--> flavones, <!--del_lnk--> leucoanthocyanins and &#39;unknown <!--del_lnk--> flavonoid&#39; 1 and 3 were identified from chromatographic profiles. The distributions of these in the hybrid <i>N. &times; alisaputrana</i> and its putative parental species <i>N. rajah</i> and <i>N. burbidgeae</i> are shown in the table to the left. A specimen of <i>N. &times; alisaputrana</i> grown from <!--del_lnk--> tissue culture (<i><!--del_lnk--> in vitro</i>) was also tested.<p><!--del_lnk--> Phenolic and <!--del_lnk--> ellagic acids were undetected in <i>N. rajah</i>, while concentrations of <!--del_lnk--> kaempferol were found to be very weak. Chromatographic patterns of the <i>N. &times; alisaputrana</i> samples studied showed complementation of its putative parental species.<p><!--del_lnk--> Myricetin was found to be absent from all studied taxa. This agrees with the findings of previous authors (<!--del_lnk--> Som, 1988; <!--del_lnk--> Jay and <!--del_lnk--> Lebreton, 1972) and suggests that the absence of a widely distributed compound like myricetin among the <i>Nepenthes</i> examined might provide &quot;additional diagnostic information for these six species&quot;.<p><a id="Sequencing" name="Sequencing"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Sequencing</span></h3>

      <p>Due to its size, unusual morphology and striking colouration, <i>N. rajah</i> has always been a very popular and highly sought-after insectivorous plant. However, despite its popularity amongst pitcher plant enthusiasts, it is fair to say that <i>Nepenthes rajah</i> remains a little known species outside the field of carnivorous plants. Due to its specialised growing requirements, it is not a suitable candidate for a <!--del_lnk--> houseplant and, as such, is only cultivated by a relatively small number of hobbyists and professional growers worldwide. This being the case, <i>N. rajah</i> is nonetheless probably the most famous of all pitcher plants. Its reputation for producing some of the most magnificent pitchers in the genus dates back to the late 18th century.<p><a id="Early_history" name="Early_history"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early history</span></h3>
      <p><i>N. rajah</i> was discovered by <!--del_lnk--> Hugh Low on or just before <!--del_lnk--> 7 March 1851, during Low&#39;s first <!--del_lnk--> ascent of Mount Kinabalu. It was described eight years later by <!--del_lnk--> Hooker, who named it after <!--del_lnk--> James Brooke, the first White Rajah of Sarawak. The species was first collected for the <!--del_lnk--> Veitch Nurseries by <!--del_lnk--> Frederick William Burbidge in 1878, during his second trip to Borneo. Shortly after being introduced into cultivation in 1881, <i>N. rajah</i> proved very popular among wealthy <!--del_lnk--> Victorian <!--del_lnk--> horticulturalists and it was a much sought-after species. A year later, young <i>N. rajah</i> plants were displayed at the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Horticultural Society&#39;s annual show for the first time. During this time, interest in <i>Nepenthes</i> had reached its peak. <i><!--del_lnk--> The Garden</i> reported that <i>Nepenthes</i> were being <!--del_lnk--> propagated by the thousands to keep up with the <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European</a> demand.<p>However, dwindling interest in <i>Nepenthes</i> at the turn of the century saw the demise of the Veitch Nurseries and consequently the loss of several species and hybrids in cultivation, including <i><!--del_lnk--> N. northiana</i> and <i>N. rajah</i>. By 1905, the final <i>N. rajah</i> specimens from the Veitch nurseries were gone, as the cultural requirements of the plants proved too difficult to reproduce. The last surviving <i>N. rajah</i> in cultivation at this time was located at the <!--del_lnk--> National Botanic Gardens at <!--del_lnk--> Glasnevin in <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, however this soon perished also. It would be many years until <i>N. rajah</i> was reintroduced into cultivation.<p><a id="Recent_popularity" name="Recent_popularity"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Recent popularity</span></h3>
      <p>In recent years there has been renewed interest in <i>Nepenthes</i> worldwide. Much of the plants&#39; current popularity can probably be attributed to <!--del_lnk--> Shigeo Kurata, whose book <i>Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu</i> (1976), which featured the best colour photography of <i>Nepenthes</i> to date, did much to bring attention to these unusual plants.<p>Not surprisingly, <i>N. rajah</i> is a relatively well known plant in Malaysia, especially its native Sabah. The species is often used to promote Sabah, and specifically Kinabalu National Park, as a <!--del_lnk--> tourist destination, and features prominently on <!--del_lnk--> postcards from the region. <i>N. rajah</i> has appeared on the covers of several popular <i>Nepenthes</i> publications, including <i>Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Kurata, 1976) and <i>Nepenthes of Borneo</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Clarke, 1997), both published in <!--del_lnk--> Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia. On April 6, 1996, Malaysia issued a series of four <!--del_lnk--> postage stamps depicting some of its more famous <i>Nepenthes</i> species. Two 30<!--del_lnk--> &cent; stamps, featuring <i><!--del_lnk--> N. macfarlanei</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> N. sanguinea</i>, as well as two 50&cent; stamps, depicting <i><!--del_lnk--> N. lowii</i> and <i>N. rajah</i>, were released. The <i>N. rajah</i> stamp has been assigned a unique identification number in two popular <!--del_lnk--> stamp numbering systems. These are <!--del_lnk--> Scott #580 and <!--del_lnk--> Yvert #600. Curiously, the peltate leaf attachment that is so characteristic of this species is not shown.<p><a id="Ecology" name="Ecology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Ecology</span></h2>

      <p><i>Nepenthes rajah</i> has a very localised distribution, being restricted to <!--del_lnk--> Mount Kinabalu and neighbouring <!--del_lnk--> Mount Tambuyukon, both located in <!--del_lnk--> Kinabalu National Park, <!--del_lnk--> Sabah, <!--del_lnk--> Malaysian Borneo. Mount Kinabalu is a massive <a href="../../wp/g/Granite.htm" title="Granite">granitic</a> dome structure that is <a href="../../wp/g/Geology.htm" title="Geology">geologically</a> young and formed from the intrusion and uplift of a granitic <a href="../../wp/b/Batholith.htm" title="Batholith">batholith</a>. At 4095.2&nbsp;m, it is by far the tallest mountain on the island of Borneo and one of the highest peaks in <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asia. The lower slopes of the mountain are mainly composed of <!--del_lnk--> sandstone and <!--del_lnk--> shale, transformed from marine sand and mud about 35 million years ago. Intrusive <!--del_lnk--> ultramafic (<!--del_lnk--> serpentine) rock was uplifted with the core of the batholith and forms a collar around the mountain. It is on these ultramafic soils that the <!--del_lnk--> flora of Mount Kinabalu exhibits the greatest levels of <!--del_lnk--> endemicity and many of the area&#39;s rarest species can be found here.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p><i>N. rajah</i> seems to grow exclusively on serpentine soils containing high concentrations of <a href="../../wp/n/Nickel.htm" title="Nickel">nickel</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Chromium.htm" title="Chromium">chromium</a>, which are toxic to many plant species. Its tolerance of these, therefore, means that it can grow in an <a href="../../wp/e/Ecology.htm" title="Ecology">ecological</a> niche where it does not face much competition for space or nutrients. These soils are also rich in <a href="../../wp/m/Magnesium.htm" title="Magnesium">magnesium</a> and are slightly <!--del_lnk--> alkaline as a result. They often form a relatively thin layer over a base of ultramafic rock and are thus known as ultramafic soils. Ultramafic soils are thought to cover approximately 16% of <!--del_lnk--> Kinabalu National Park. These soils have high levels of <!--del_lnk--> endemicity in many taxonomic groups, not least the <i>Nepenthes</i>. Four species in the genus, including <i>N. rajah</i>, can only be found within the boundaries of the park.<p><i>N. rajah</i> usually grows in open, grassy clearings on old land slips and flat ridge tops, particularly in areas of <!--del_lnk--> seeping <!--del_lnk--> ground water, where the soil is loose and permanently moist. Although these sites can receive very high rainfall, excess water drains away quickly, preventing the soil from becoming <!--del_lnk--> waterlogged. <i>N. rajah</i> can often be found growing in grassy undergrowth, especially among sedges.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p><i>N. rajah</i> has an <!--del_lnk--> altitudinal <!--del_lnk--> distribution of 1500&ndash;2650&nbsp;m <!--del_lnk--> a.s.l. and is thus considered an (ultra) <!--del_lnk--> highland or <!--del_lnk--> Upper Montane plant. In the upper limit of its range, night-time temperatures may approach freezing and day-time maximums rarely exceed 25&nbsp;&#x2103;. Due to the night-time temperature drop, <!--del_lnk--> relative air humidity increases significantly, rising from 65-75% to over 95%. Vegetation at this height is very stunted and slow-growing due to the extreme environmental conditions that prevail. Plants are often subjected to fierce winds and driving rain, as well as exposure to intense direct <a href="../../wp/s/Sunlight.htm" title="Sunlight">sunlight</a>. The relatively open vegetation of the Upper Montane forest also experiences greater fluctuations in temperature and humidity compared with lower altitudes. These changes are largely governed by the extent of <!--del_lnk--> cloud cover. In the absence of clouds, temperatures rise rapidly, humidity drops, and light levels may be very high. When cloud cover returns, temperatures and light levels fall, while humidity levels increase. Average annual <!--del_lnk--> precipitation in this region is around 3000&nbsp;mm.<p><a id="Conservation_status" name="Conservation_status"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Conservation status</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Endangered_species" name="Endangered_species"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Endangered species</span></h3>
      <p><i>Nepenthes rajah</i> is classified as <!--del_lnk--> Endangered (EN &ndash; B1+2e) on the <!--del_lnk--> IUCN <!--del_lnk--> Red List of Threatened Species . It is also listed on Schedule I, Part II of the <!--del_lnk--> Wildlife Conservation Enactment (WCE) 1997 and, perhaps more notably, <a href="../../wp/c/Convention_on_the_International_Trade_in_Endangered_Species_of_Wild_Flora_and_Fauna.htm" title="Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna">CITES Appendix I</a>, which prohibits international trade in plants collected from the wild. However, due to its popularity among collectors, many plants have been removed from the wild illegally, even though the species&#39; distribution lies entirely within the bounds of Kinabalu Park. This led to some populations being severely depleted by over-collection in the 1970s and eventually resulted in the species&#39; inclusion in CITES Appendix I in 1981. Along with <i><!--del_lnk--> N. khasiana</i>, it is one of only two species in the genus to feature on this list.<p>This being the case, however, the short-term future of <i>N. rajah</i> seems to be relatively secure and it would perhaps be more accurately classified as <!--del_lnk--> Vulnerable (VU) or, taking into account protected populations in <!--del_lnk--> National Parks, Lower Risk conservation dependent (LR (cd)). This agrees with the conservation status of <i>N. rajah</i> according to the <!--del_lnk--> World Conservation Monitoring Centre (WCMC), under which it is also considered Vulnerable. Furthermore, the species was originally treated as Vulnerable (V) by the IUCN prior to the introduction of the 1994 threat categories.<p>Although <i>N. rajah</i> has a restricted distribution and is often quoted as a plant in peril, it is not rare in the areas where it does grow and most populations are now off-limits to visitors and lie in remote parts of <!--del_lnk--> Kinabalu National Park. Furthermore, <i>N. rajah</i> has a distinctive leaf shape making it difficult to illegally ship abroad even if the pitchers are removed, as an informed <!--del_lnk--> customs official should be able to identify it.<p>The recent advent of artificial <!--del_lnk--> tissue culture, or more specifically <i>in vitro</i>, technology in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> has meant that plants can be produced in large numbers and sold at relatively low prices (~US$20-$30 in the case of <i>N. rajah</i>). <i>In vitro</i> <!--del_lnk--> propagation refers to production of whole plants from cell cultures derived from explants (generally seeds). This technology has, to a large extent, removed the incentive for collectors to travel to <!--del_lnk--> Sabah to collect the plant illegally, and demand for wild-collected plants has fallen considerably in recent years.<p><!--del_lnk--> Rob Cantley, a prominent <!--del_lnk--> conservationist and artificial propagator of <i>Nepenthes</i> plants, assesses the current status of plants in the wild as follows:<p>&quot;<i>This species grows in at least 2 distinct sub-populations, both of which are well protected by Sabah National Parks Authority. One of the populations grows in an area public access to which is strictly prohibited without permit. However, there has been a decline in population of mature individuals in the better known and less patrolled site. This is largely due to damage to habitat and plants by careless visitors rather than organised collection of plants. Nepenthes rajah has become common in cultivation in recent years as a result of the availability of inexpensive clones from tissue culture. I believe that these days commercial collection of this species from the wild is negligible.</i>&quot;<p>This being the case, however, it appears that the genetic variability of cultivated <i>N. rajah</i> plants is very small, as all commercially available tissue-cultured plants are thought to belong to just four <!--del_lnk--> clones originating from the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>.<p>However, illegal collection is not the only threat facing plants in the wild. The <a href="../../wp/e/El_Ni%25C3%25B1o-Southern_Oscillation.htm" title="El Ni&ntilde;o">El Ni&ntilde;o</a> <a href="../../wp/c/Climate.htm" title="Climate">climatic</a> <!--del_lnk--> phenomenon of 1997/98 had a catastrophic effect on the <i>Nepenthes</i> species on Mount Kinabalu. The dry period that followed severely depleted some natural populations. <!--del_lnk--> Forest fires broke out in 9 locations in Kinabalu Park, covering a total area of 25 square kilometres and generating large amounts of <a href="../../wp/s/Smog.htm" title="Smog">smog</a>. During the El Ni&ntilde;o period, many plants were temporarily transferred to the park nursery to save at least some individuals. These were later replanted in the &quot;<i>Nepenthes</i> Garden&quot; in <!--del_lnk--> Mesilau (see below). In spite of this, <i>N. rajah</i> was one of the less affected species and relatively few plants perished as a result. Since then, Ansow Gunsalam has established a nursery close to the Mesilau Lodge at the base of Kinabalu Park to protect the endangered species of that area, including <i>N. rajah</i>.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p><i>Nepenthes rajah</i> is known to <!--del_lnk--> hybridise with several other species with which it is <!--del_lnk--> sympatric. It seems to flower at any time of year and for this reason it hybridises relatively easily. <!--del_lnk--> Charles Clarke also notes that &quot;<i>N. rajah</i>, more than any other species, appears to have been successful in having its pollen transported over considerable distances. Consequently, a number of putative <i>N. rajah</i> hybrids exist without the parent plant growing nearby&quot;. However, it appears that the limit as to how far pollen can be transported is approximately 10&nbsp;km. Hybrids between <i>N. rajah</i> and all other <i>Nepenthes</i> species on Mount Kinabalu (with the exception of <i><!--del_lnk--> N. lowii</i>) have been recorded. Due to the slow-growing nature of <i>N. rajah</i>, no hybrids involving it have been artificially produced as of yet.<p>At present, the following natural hybrids are known:<ul>
       <li><i><!--del_lnk--> N. &times; alisaputrana</i> <!--del_lnk--> Adam &amp; <!--del_lnk--> Wilcock (1992) [=<i><!--del_lnk--> N. burbidgeae</i> &times; <i>N. rajah</i>]<li><i><!--del_lnk--> N. edwardsiana</i> &times; <i>N. rajah</i><li><i><!--del_lnk--> N. fusca</i> &times; <i>N. rajah</i><li><i><!--del_lnk--> N. &times; kinabaluensis</i> <!--del_lnk--> S.

      <p>The &quot;Mountain Garden&quot; of Kinabalu National Park contains a number of well-grown <i>Nepenthes</i>, including the rare hybrid <i>N. stenophylla &times; N. rajah</i>. This plant has leaves resembling those of <i>N. stenophylla</i>, but the lid and wings are typical of <i>N. rajah</i>. The peristome is strongly influenced by <i>N. stenophylla</i> and bristles are present at the border of the lid, a unique characteristic of this hybrid. It occurs at an altitude of 1500-2600 m.<p>Two hybrids of <i>N. rajah</i> have been formally described and given specific names: <i>N. &times; alisaputrana</i> and <i>N. &times; kinabaluensis</i>. Both are listed on CITES Appendix II and the latter is also considered Endangered (EN (D)) under current IUCN criteria.<p><a id="Nepenthes_.C3.97_alisaputrana" name="Nepenthes_.C3.97_alisaputrana"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Nepenthes &times; alisaputrana</i></span></h3>
      <p><i>N. &times; alisaputrana</i> (originally published as &quot;<i>Nepenthes &times; alisaputraiana</i>&quot;) is named in honour of <!--del_lnk--> Datuk Lamri Ali, Director of <!--del_lnk--> Sabah Parks. It is only known from a few remote localities within <!--del_lnk--> Kinabalu National Park where is grows in stunted, open vegetation over serpentine soils at around 2000 m above sea level, often amongst populations of <i>N. burbidgeae</i>. This plant is notable for combining the best characters of both parent species, not least the size of its pitchers, which rival those of <i>N. rajah</i> in volume (&le;35&nbsp;cm high, &le;20&nbsp;cm wide). The other hybrids involving <i>N. rajah</i> do not exhibit such impressive proportions. The pitchers of <i>N. &times; alisaputrana</i> can be distinguished from those of <i>N. burbidgeae</i> by a broader peristome, larger lid and simply by their sheer size. The hyrbid differs from its other parent, <i>N. rajah</i>, by its lid structure, indumentum of short, brown hairs, narrower and more cylindrical peristome, and pitcher colour, which is usually yellow-green with red or brown flecking. For this reason, Phillipps and Lamb (1996) gave it the common name <i>Leopard pitcher-plant</i>, though this is rarely used. The peristome is green to dark red and striped with purple bands. Leaves are often slightly peltate. The plant climbs well and aerial pitchers are frequently produced. <i>N. &times; alisaputrana</i> more closely resembles <i>N. rajah</i> than <i>N. burbidgeae</i>, but it is difficult to confuse this plant with either. However, this mistake has previously been made on at least one occasion; a pitcher illustrated in <i>Insect Eating Plants &amp; How To Grow Them</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Slack, 1986) as being <i>N. rajah</i> was in fact <i>N. burbidgeae &times; N. rajah</i>.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p><i>N. &times; kinabaluensis</i> is another impressive plant. The pitchers get large also, but do not compare to those of <i>N. rajah</i> or <i>N. &times; alisaputrana</i>. It is a well-known natural hybrid of what many consider to be the two most spectacular <i>Nepenthes</i> species of Borneo: <i>N. rajah</i> and <i>N. villosa</i>. <i>N. &times; kinabaluensis</i> can only be found on Mount Kinabalu (hence the name) and nearby Mount Tambuyukon, where the two parent species are occur <!--del_lnk--> sympatrically. More specifically, plants are known from a footpath near Paka Cave and several places along an unestablished route on a south-east ridge, which lies on the west side of the Upper Kolopis River. The only accessible location from which this species is known is the Kinabalu summit trail, between <!--del_lnk--> Layang-Layang and the <!--del_lnk--> helipad, where it grows at about 2900 m in a clearing dominated by <i><!--del_lnk--> Dacrydium gibbsiae</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Leptospermum recurvum</i> trees. <i>N. &times; kinabaluensis</i> has an altitudinal distribution of 2420 to 3030 m. It grows in open areas in cloud forest. This species can be distinguished from <i>N. rajah</i> by the presence of raised ribs that line the inner edge of the peristome and end with elongated teeth. These are more prominent than those found in <i>N. rajah</i> and are clue as to the hybrid&#39;s parentage (<i>N. villosa</i> has very developed peristome ribs). The peristome is coarse and expanded at the margin (but not scalloped like that of <i>N. rajah</i>), the lid orbiculate or reniformed and almost flat. In general, pitchers are larger than those of <i>N. villosa</i> and the tendril joins the apex about 1-2&nbsp;cm below the leaf tip, a feature which is characteristic of <i>N. rajah</i>. In older plants, the tendril can be almost woody. <i>N. &times; kinabaluensis</i> is an indumentum of villous hairs covering the pitchers and leaf margins, which is approximately intermediate between the parents. Lower pitchers have two fringed wings, whereas the upper pitchers usually lack these. The colour of the pitcher varies from yellow to scarlet. <i>N. &times; kinabaluensis</i> seems to produce upper pitchers more readily than either of its parents. In all respects <i>N. &times; kinabaluensis</i> is intermediate between the two parent species and it is easy to distinguish from all other <i>Nepenthes</i> of Borneo. However, it has been confused once before, when the hybrid was labelled as <i>N. rajah</i> in <i>Letts Guide to Carnivorous Plants of the World</i> (Cheers, 1992).<p><i>N. &times; kinabaluensis</i> was first collected near <!--del_lnk--> Kambarangoh by <!--del_lnk--> Gibbs in 1910 and later mentioned by <!--del_lnk--> Macfarlane as &quot;<i>Nepenthes</i> sp.&quot; in 1914. Although Macfarlane did not formally name the plant, he noted that &quot;[a]ll available morphological details suggest that this is a hybrid between <i>N. villosa</i> and <i>N. rajah</i>&quot;. It was finally described in 1976 by <!--del_lnk--> Kurata as <i>N. &times; kinabaluensis</i>. The name was published in <i>Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu</i>, though the specific epithet &quot;<i>kinabaluensis</i>&quot; is a <i><!--del_lnk--> nomen nudum</i>, as it was published with an inadequate description and lacked information on the <!--del_lnk--> type specimen. The name was subsequently republished by Kurata in 1984 and by Adam and Wilcock in 1996.<p><a id="Hybrid_or_species.3F" name="Hybrid_or_species.3F"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Hybrid or species?</span></h3>
      <p>It is worth noting that <i>N. &times; alisaputrana</i> and <i>N. &times; kinabaluensis</i> are often <!--del_lnk--> fertile and thus may <!--del_lnk--> breed among themselves. <!--del_lnk--> Clive A. Stace (1980) writes that we may speak of &quot;stabilised hybrids when they have developed a distributional, morphological or genetic set of characters which is no longer strictly related to that of its parents, ... if the hybrid has become an independent, recognisable, self-producing unit, it is <i>de facto</i> a separate species&quot;. <i><!--del_lnk--> N. hurrelliana</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> N. murudensis</i> are two examples of species that have a putative hybrid origin. <i>N. &times; alisaputrana</i> and <i>N. &times; kinabaluensis</i> are sufficiently stabilised that a species status has been discussed. Indeed, <i>N. kinabaluensis</i> was described as a species by <!--del_lnk--> Adam &amp; <!--del_lnk--> Wilcock in 1996. However, this interpretation does not have much support in the scientific community and the name has not been published in any other work since.<p>Due to their <!--del_lnk--> dioecious nature, a hybrid involving a pair of <i>Nepenthes</i> species can represent one of two possible crosses, depending on which species was the female and which was the male. When the cross is known, the female (or pod) parent is usually referred to first, followed by the male (or <!--del_lnk--> pollen) parent. This is an important distinction, as the hybrid will usually display different morphological features according to the type of cross; the pod parent is thought to be dominant in most cases and hybrid offspring usually resemble it more than the pollen parent. Most wild plants of <i>N. &times; kinabaluensis</i>, for example, show a greater affinity to <i>N. rajah</i> than <i>N. villosa</i> and are thus thought to represent the cross <i>N. rajah</i> &times; <i>N. villosa</i>. However, specimens have been found that seem to be more similar to <i>N. villosa</i>, suggesting that they might be the reverse cross (see <!--del_lnk--> ). The same is true for other hybrids involving <i>N. rajah</i>. It is unknown whether these crosses are <!--del_lnk--> fertile or not and this element of uncertainty only adds to the confusion over the distinction between a stable hybrid and a species.<p><a id="Cultivation" name="Cultivation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Cultivation</span></h2>
      <p><i>Nepenthes rajah</i> has always been considered to be one of the more difficult <i>Nepenthes</i> species to <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">cultivate</a>. However, in recent years, it has become apparent that the plant may not be deserving of its reputation.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p><i>N. rajah</i> is a <!--del_lnk--> montane species or &quot;highlander&quot;, growing at altitudes ranging from 1500 to 2650&nbsp;m. As such, it requires warm days, with temperatures ranging (ideally) from approximately 25 to 30&nbsp;&#x2103;, and cool nights, with temperatures of about 10 to 15&nbsp;&#x2103;. Here, it is important to note that the temperatures themselves are not vital (when kept within reasonable limits), but rather the temperature drop itself; <i>N. rajah</i> needs considerably cooler nights, with a drop of 10&nbsp;&#x2103; or more being preferable. Failure to observe this requirement will almost certainly doom the plant in the long term or, at best, limit it to being a small, unimpressive specimen.<p>In addition, like all <i>Nepenthes</i>, this plant needs a fairly <!--del_lnk--> humid environment to grow well. Values in the region of 75% <!--del_lnk--> R.H. are generally considered optimal, with increased humidity at night (~90% R.H.). However, <i>N. rajah</i> does tolerate fluctuations in humidity, especially when young, provided that the air does not become too dry (below 50% R.H.). Humidity can be easily controlled using an <!--del_lnk--> ultrasonic <!--del_lnk--> humidifier in conjunction with a <!--del_lnk--> humidistat.<div class="thumb tright">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>In its natural habitat, <i>N. rajah</i> grows in open areas, where it is exposed to direct sunlight - it therefore needs to be provided with a significant amount of light in cultivation as well. To meet this need, many growers have used <!--del_lnk--> metal halide lamps in the 500&ndash;1000&nbsp;watt range, with considerable success. The plant should be situated a fair distance from the light source, 1 to 2 m is recommended. Depending on location, growers can utilise natural sunlight as a source of illumination. However, this is only recommended for those living in <!--del_lnk--> equatorial regions, where light intensity is sufficient to satisfy the needs of the plant. A <!--del_lnk--> photoperiod of 12&nbsp;hours is comparable to that experienced in nature.<p><a id="Potting_and_watering" name="Potting_and_watering"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Potting and watering</span></h3>
      <p>Pure long-fibre <i><!--del_lnk--> Sphagnum</i> <a href="../../wp/m/Moss.htm" title="Moss">moss</a> is an excellent potting medium, though combinations involving any of the following - <!--del_lnk--> peat, <!--del_lnk--> perlite, <!--del_lnk--> vermiculite, <a href="../../wp/s/Sand.htm" title="Sand">sand</a>, <!--del_lnk--> lava rock, <!--del_lnk--> pumice, <i><!--del_lnk--> Osmunda</i> fibre, <!--del_lnk--> orchid bark and horticultural <!--del_lnk--> charcoal - may be used with equal success. The potting medium should be well-drained and not too compacted. Moss is useful for moisture retention near the roots. The mix should be thoroughly soaked in water prior to potting the plant.<p>It has been noted that <i>N. rajah</i> produces a very extensive root system (for a <i>Nepenthes</i>) and, for this reason, it is recommended that a wide pot be used to allow for proper development of the root system. This also eliminates the need for frequent re-potting, which can lead to <!--del_lnk--> transplant shock and the eventual death of the plant.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Purified water should be used for watering purposes, although &#39;<!--del_lnk--> hard water&#39; is tolerated.

Water purity greater than 100&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> p.p.m. of <!--del_lnk--> total dissolved solids is often quoted as ideal. A <!--del_lnk--> reverse osmosis unit can be used to filter the water or, alternatively, bottled <!--del_lnk--> distilled water can be purchased. Watering should be done regularly. However, plants should not be allowed to sit in water, as this may lead to root rot.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p><i>N. rajah</i> is a carnivorous plant and, as such, supplements nutrients gained from the soil with captured prey (espescially insects) to alleviate deficiencies in important elements such as <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen.htm" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Phosphorus.htm" title="Phosphorus">phosphorus</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Potassium.htm" title="Potassium">potassium</a>. Just as in nature, a cultivated plant&#39;s &#39;diet&#39; may include insects and other prey items, although this is not necessary for successful cultivation. <!--del_lnk--> Crickets are recommended for their size and low cost. These can be purchased online or at specialist pet stores. They can simply be dropped into the pitchers by hand or placed inside using metal <!--del_lnk--> tongs or similar, whether dead or alive.<p>From trials carried out by a commercial <i>Nepenthes</i> nursery, it appears that <!--del_lnk--> micronutrient solutions have &quot;a beneficial effect on plants of improved leaf colouration, with no deleterious affects&quot; as far as can be seen. However, more research is required to verify these results. Actual <a href="../../wp/f/Fertilizer.htm" title="Fertilizer">fertilisers</a> (containing <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen.htm" title="Nitrogen">N</a><a href="../../wp/p/Phosphorus.htm" title="Phosphorus">P</a><a href="../../wp/p/Potassium.htm" title="Potassium">K</a>) were, on the other hand, found to &quot;cause damage to plants, promote <!--del_lnk--> pathogens and have no observable benefits&quot;. Hence, the use of chemical fertilisers is usually not advised.<p>Above all, it should be remembered that the primary goal of any growing setup is to try to mirror the conditions the plants experience in their natural habitat as much as possible.<p>It is important to note that <i>N. rajah</i> is a very slow growing <i>Nepenthes</i>. Under optimal conditions, <i>N. rajah</i> can reach flowering size within 10&nbsp;years of seed <!--del_lnk--> germination, although it is thought that it may take 100 years to reach full size. Theoretically, given climatic conditions do not change, <i>N. rajah</i> has an indefinite lifespan.<p><a id="Common_misconceptions" name="Common_misconceptions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Common misconceptions</span></h2>

      </div>
      <p><i>Nepenthes rajah</i> has been a well known and highly sought after species for over a century and, as a result, there are many stories woven around this plant. One such example is the famous legend that <i>N. rajah</i> grows exclusively in the spray zones of <!--del_lnk--> waterfalls, on <!--del_lnk--> ultramafic soils. Although the latter is true, <i>N. rajah</i> is certainly not found solely in the spray zones of waterfalls and this statement seems to have little basis in fact.<p>It is likely this misconception was popularised by <!--del_lnk--> S. Kurata&#39;s 1976 book <i>Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu</i>, in which he erroneously states that &quot;<i>N. rajah</i> is rather fond of wet places like swamps or the surroundings of a waterfall&quot;. With the exception of <i><!--del_lnk--> N. mirabilis</i>, no <i>Nepenthes</i> species have been reliably recorded from swamps. Such claims were presumably originally the result of attempts to further increase the legendary status of the plant.<p>This being the case, it does appear, however, that certain <i>N. rajah</i> plants do in fact grow in the <i>vicinity</i> of waterfalls (as noted by <!--del_lnk--> H. Steiner, 2002) &quot;providing quite a humid microclimate&quot;, which may indeed be the source of this particular misconception.<p>Another myth surrounding this species is that it occasionally catches small <a href="../../wp/m/Monkey.htm" title="Monkey">monkeys</a> and other large animals in its pitchers. Such tales have persisted for a very long time, but can probably be explained as rodents being mistaken for other species. It is interesting to note that one common name for <i>Nepenthes</i> plants is &#39;<!--del_lnk--> Monkey Cups&#39;. The name refers to the fact that monkeys have been observed drinking rainwater from these plants. Thus, in a sense, this mythology may have some basis in fact.<p><a id="Gallery" name="Gallery"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Gallery</span></h2>
