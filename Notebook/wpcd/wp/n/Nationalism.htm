      <p><b>Nationalism</b> is an ideology  that holds that a <!--del_lnk--> nation is the fundamental unit for <a href="../../wp/h/Human.htm" title="Human">human</a> <!--del_lnk--> social life, and takes precedence over any other social and political principles. Nationalism typically makes certain <a href="../../wp/p/Politics.htm" title="Politics">political</a> claims based upon this belief: above all, the claim that the nation is the only fully legitimate basis for a <!--del_lnk--> state, that each nation is entitled to its own state, and that the borders of the state should be congruent with the borders of the nation. Nationalism refers to both a political doctrine and any collective action by political and <!--del_lnk--> social movements on behalf of specific nations. Nationalism has had an enormous influence upon <a href="../../wp/h/History_of_the_world.htm" title="History of the world">world history</a>, since the <!--del_lnk--> nation-state has become the dominant form of state organization. Most of the world&#39;s population now lives in states which are, at least nominally, nation-states. Historians also use the term &quot;nationalism&quot; to refer to this historical transition, and to the emergence of nationalist ideology and movements.<p>

      <p>This section sets out the components of nationalist ideology as seen by nationalists themselves. (Academic theories of nationalism are skeptical of some of these beliefs and principles, see below).<p>Nationalism is a form of <!--del_lnk--> universalism when it makes universal claims about how the world should be organised, but it is particularistic with regard to individual nations. The combination of both is characteristic for the ideology, for instance in these assertions:<ul>
       <li>&quot;in a nation-state, the language of the nation should be the official language, and all citizens should speak it, and not a foreign language.&quot;<li>&quot;the official language of <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> should be <!--del_lnk--> Danish, and all Danish citizens should speak it.&quot;</ul>
      <p>The universalistic principles bring nationalism into conflict with competing forms of universalism, the particularistic principles bring specific nationalist movements into conflict with rival nationalisms - for instance, the <!--del_lnk--> Danish-German tensions over their <!--del_lnk--> reciprocal linguistic minorities.<p>The starting point of nationalism is the existence of <!--del_lnk--> nations, which it takes as a given. Nations are typically seen as entities with a long history: most nationalists do not believe a nation can be created artificially. Nationalist movements see themselves as the representative of an existing, centuries-old nation. However, some theories of nationalism imply the reverse order - that the nationalist movements created the sense of national identity, and then a political unit corresponding to it, or that an existing <!--del_lnk--> state promoted a &#39;national&#39; identity for itself.<p>Nationalists see nations as an <b>inclusive categorisation</b> of human beings - assigning every individual to one specific nation. In fact, nationalism sees most human activity as national in character. Nations have <!--del_lnk--> national symbols, a <a href="../../wp/c/Culture.htm" title="Culture">national culture</a>, a national <a href="../../wp/m/Music.htm" title="Music">music</a> and national <a href="../../wp/l/Literature.htm" title="Literature">literature</a>; national <a href="../../wp/f/Folklore.htm" title="Folklore">folklore</a>, a national <a href="../../wp/m/Mythology.htm" title="Mythology">mythology</a> and - in some cases - even a national <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religion</a>. Individuals share <!--del_lnk--> national values and a <a href="../../wp/c/Cultural_identity.htm" title="Cultural identity">national identity</a>, admire the <!--del_lnk--> national hero, eat the <!--del_lnk--> national dish and play the <!--del_lnk--> national sport.<p>Nationalists define individual nations on the basis of certain criteria, which distinguish one nation from another; and determine who is a member of each nation. These criteria typically include a shared <a href="../../wp/l/Language.htm" title="Language">language</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Culture.htm" title="Culture">culture</a>, and/or shared <!--del_lnk--> values which are predominantly represented within a specific <a href="../../wp/e/Ethnic_group.htm" title="Ethnic group">ethnic group</a>. <b>National identity</b> refers both to these defining criteria, and to the shared heritage of each group. Membership in a nation is usually involuntary and determined by birth. Individual nationalisms vary in their degree of internal uniformity: some are monolithic, and tolerate little variance from the national norms. Academic nationalism theory emphasises that national identity is contested, reflecting differences in region, <!--del_lnk--> class, <a href="../../wp/g/Gender.htm" title="Gender">gender</a>, and language or <!--del_lnk--> dialect. A recent development is the idea of a national core culture, in Germany the <!--del_lnk--> Leitkultur, which emphasises a minimal set of non-negotiable values: this is primarily a strategy of <!--del_lnk--> cultural assimilation in response to <!--del_lnk--> immigration.<p>Nationalism has a strong territorial component, with an inclusive categorisation of territory corresponding to the categorisation of individuals. For each nation, there is a territory which is uniquely associated with it, the national homeland, and together they account for most habitable land. This is reflected in the <!--del_lnk--> geopolitical claims of nationalism, which seeks to order the world as a series of <!--del_lnk--> nation-states, each based on the national homeland of its respective nation. <b>Territorial claims</b> characterise the politics of nationalist movements. Established nation-states also make an implicit territorial claim, to secure their own continued existence: sometimes it is specified in the national <!--del_lnk--> constitution. In the nationalist view, each nation has a moral entitlement to a sovereign state: this is usually taken as a given.<p>The nation-state is intended to guarantee the existence of a nation, to preserve its distinct identity, and to provide a territory where the national culture and <!--del_lnk--> ethos are dominant - nationalism is also a philosophy of the <!--del_lnk--> state. It sees a nation-state as a <i>necessity</i> for each nation: secessionist national movements often complain about their second-class status as a minority within another nation. This specific view of the duties of the state influenced the introduction of national <a href="../../wp/e/Education.htm" title="Education">education</a> systems, often teaching a standard <!--del_lnk--> curriculum, national cultural policy, and national <!--del_lnk--> language policy. In turn, nation-states appeal to a national cultural-historical <!--del_lnk--> mythos to justify their existence, and to confer <!--del_lnk--> political legitimacy - acquiescence of the population in the authority of the government.<p>Nationalists recognise that &#39;non-national&#39; states exist and existed, but do not see them as a legitimate form of state. The struggles of early nationalist movements were often directed against such non-national states, specifically multi-ethnic <!--del_lnk--> empires such as <!--del_lnk--> Austria-Hungary and the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. Most multi-ethnic empires have disappeared, but some <!--del_lnk--> secessionist movements see <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> as comparable non-national, imperial states. At least one modern state is clearly not a nation-state: the <a href="../../wp/v/Vatican_City.htm" title="Vatican City">Vatican City</a> exists solely to provide a sovereign territorial unit for the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>.<p>Nationalism as ideology includes <a href="../../wp/e/Ethics.htm" title="Ethics">ethical principles</a>: that the moral duties of individuals to fellow members of the nation override those to non-members. Nationalism claims that national <!--del_lnk--> loyalty, in case of conflict, overrides local loyalties, and all other loyalties to family, friends, profession, religion, or class.<p><a id="Theory_of_nationalism" name="Theory_of_nationalism"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Theory of nationalism</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Background_and_problems" name="Background_and_problems"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Background and problems</span></h3>
      <p>Specific examples of nationalism are extremely diverse, the issues are emotional, and the conflicts often bloody. The theory of nationalism has always been complicated by this background, and by the intrusion of nationalist ideology into the theory. There are also national differences in the theory of nationalism, since people define nationalism on the basis of their local experience. Theory (and media coverage) may overemphasise conflicting nationalist movements, <!--del_lnk--> ethnic tension, and <a href="../../wp/w/War.htm" title="War">war</a> - diverting attention from general theoretical issues; for instance, the characteristics of nation-states.<p>Nationalist movements are surrounded by other nationalist movements and nations, and this may colour their version of nationalism. It may focus purely on <!--del_lnk--> self-determination, and ignore other nations. When conflicts arise, however, ideological attacks upon the identity and legitimacy of the &#39;enemy&#39; nationalism may become the focus. In the <!--del_lnk--> Israeli-Palestinian conflict, for instance, both sides have claimed that the other is not a &#39;real&#39; nation, and therefore has no right to a state. <!--del_lnk--> Jingoism and <!--del_lnk--> chauvinism make exaggerated claims about the superiority of one nation over another. National <!--del_lnk--> stereotypes are also common, and are usually insulting. This kind of negative nationalism, directed at other nations, is certainly a nationalist phenomenon, but not a sufficient basis for a general theory of nationalism.<p><a id="Issues_in_nationalism_theory" name="Issues_in_nationalism_theory"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Issues in nationalism theory</span></h3>
      <p>The first studies of nationalism were generally historical accounts of nationalist movements. At the end of the 19th century, <a href="../../wp/m/Marxism.htm" title="Marxism">Marxists</a> and other <a href="../../wp/s/Socialism.htm" title="Socialism">socialists</a> produced political analyses that were critical of the nationalist movements then active in central and eastern Europe. Most <a href="../../wp/s/Sociology.htm" title="Sociology">sociological</a> theories of nationalism date from after the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">Second World War</a>. Some nationalism theory is about issues which concern nationalists themselves, such as who belongs to the nation and who does not, as well as the precise meaning of &#39;belonging&#39;.<p><a id="Origin_of_nations_and_nationalism" name="Origin_of_nations_and_nationalism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Origin of nations and nationalism</span></h3>
      <p>Recent general theory has looked at underlying issues, and above all the question of which came first, nations or nationalism. Nationalist activists see themselves as representing a pre-existing nation, and the <!--del_lnk--> primordialist theory of nationalism agrees. It sees nations, or at least ethnic groups, as a social reality dating back twenty thousand years.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> modernist theories imply that until around 1800, almost no-one had more than local loyalties. National identity and unity were originally imposed from above, by European states, because they were necessary to <!--del_lnk--> modernise economy and society. In this theory, nationalist conflicts are an unintended side-effect. For example, <!--del_lnk--> Ernest Gellner argued that nations are a by-product of industrialization, which required a large literate and culturally homogeneous population. According to <!--del_lnk--> Charles Tilly, states promoted nationalism in order to assure the popular consent with <!--del_lnk--> conscription into large modern armies and taxation, which was necessary to maintain such armies. According to the modernist view, the first true nation state was created by the <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>, though the tendencies have existed since the beginning of the <!--del_lnk--> Modern Era. In addition to the top-down nationalism, there were also cases of the bottom-up nationalism, such as the German Romantic nationalism, materialized in the resistance against <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleon_I_of_France.htm" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>.<p>More recent theorists of nationalism emphasise that nations are a socially constructed phenomenon. <!--del_lnk--> Benedict Anderson, for example, described nations as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> imagined communities&quot;. Gellner comments: &quot;Nationalism is not the awakening of nations to self-consciousness: it invents nations where they do not exist.&quot; (Anderson and Gellner deploy terms such as &#39;imagined&#39; and &#39;invent&#39; in a neutral, descriptive manner. The use of these terms in this context is not intended to imply that nations are fictional or fantastic.) Modernisation theorists see such things as the <!--del_lnk--> printing press and <a href="../../wp/c/Capitalism.htm" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> as necessary conditions for nationalism.<p><!--del_lnk--> Anthony D. Smith proposed a synthesis of primordialist and modernist views. According to Smith, the preconditions for the formation of a nation are as follows:<ul>
       <li>A fixed homeland (current or historical)<li>High autonomy<li>Hostile surroundings<li>Memories of battles<li>Sacred centres<li>Languages and scripts<li>Special customs<li>Historical records and thinking</ul>
      <p>Those preconditions may create powerful common <a href="../../wp/m/Mythology.htm" title="Mythology">mythology</a>. Therefore, the mythic homeland is in reality more important for the national identity than the actual territory occupied by the nation. Smith also posits that nations are formed through the inclusion of the whole populace (not just elites), constitution of legal and political institutions, nationalist ideology, international recognition and drawing up of borders.<p><a id="Theoretical_literature_on_nationalism" name="Theoretical_literature_on_nationalism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Theoretical literature on nationalism</span></h3>
      <p>There is a large amount of theoretical and empirical literature on nationalism. The following is a minimal selection, and a series of capsule summaries that do not do justice to the range of views expressed.<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Anderson, Benedict. 1991. <i>Imagined Communities</i>. 2nd ed. London: Verso. Anderson argues that nations are imagined political communities, and are imagined to be limited and sovereign. Their development is due to the decline of other types of imagined community, especially in the face of capitalist production of print media.<li><!--del_lnk--> Armstrong, John. 1982. <i>Nations Before Nationalism</i>. Armstrong traces the development of national identities from origins in antiquity and the medieval world.<li><!--del_lnk--> Breuilly, John. 1992. <i>Nationalism and the State</i>. 2nd ed. Manchester: Manchester University Press. This approach focuses on the politics of nationalism, in particular on nationalism as a response to the imperatives of the modern state. It employs the mode of comparative history to study a large number of different cases of nationalism.<li><!--del_lnk--> Gellner, Ernest. 1983. <i>Nations and Nationalism</i>. Oxford: Blackwell. This work links nationalism to the homogenising imperatives of industrial society and the reactions of minority cultures to those imperatives.<li><!--del_lnk--> Greenfeld, Liah. 1992. <i>Nationalism: Five Roads to Modernity</i>. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. Greenfeld argues that nationalism existed at an earlier age than previously thought: as early as the sixteenth century in the case of England.<li><!--del_lnk--> Hechter, Michael. 1975. <i>Internal Colonialism</i>. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul. Hechter attributes nationalism in the &quot;Celtic fringe&quot; of Britain and Ireland to the reinforcing divisions of culture and the division of labour.<li><!--del_lnk--> Hobsbawm, Eric, and <!--del_lnk--> Ranger, Terence, eds. 1983. <i>The Invention of Tradition</i>. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. This collection of essays, especially Hobsbawm&#39;s introduction and chapter on turn-of-the-century Europe, argues that the nation is a prominent type of invented tradition.<li><!--del_lnk--> Kedourie, Elie. 1960. <i>Nationalism</i>. London: Hutchinson. Kedourie focuses on the role of disaffected German intellectuals in developing the doctrine of nationalism at the beginning of the nineteenth century from Kant&#39;s idea of the autonomy of the will and Herder&#39;s belief in the primacy of linguistic communities in establishing modes of thought.<li><!--del_lnk--> Kedourie, Elie, ed. 1971. <i>Nationalism in Asia and Africa</i>. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson. Kedourie&#39;s introduction to this volume of nationalist texts extends his analysis in his earlier work to the efforts of intellectuals in colonial states.<li><!--del_lnk--> Nairn, Tom. 1977. <i>The Break-up of Britain</i>. London: New Left Books. Marxist historian Nairn traces nationalism to the confrontation of colonialism, which leaves indigenous elites without recourse to any resources but their own population.<li><!--del_lnk--> Smith, Anthony D. 1986. <i>The Ethnic Origins of Nations</i>. Oxford: Blackwell. Smith traces modern nations and nationalism to pre-modern ethnic sources, arguing for the existence of an &quot;ethnic core&quot; in modern nations.</ul>

      <p>Most theories of nationalism assume a European origin of the <!--del_lnk--> nation-state. The modern <!--del_lnk--> state is often seen as emerging with the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Westphalia in <!--del_lnk--> 1648, though this view is disputed. This treaty created the &#39;Westphalian system&#39; of states, which recognised each other&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> sovereignty and territory. Some of the signatories, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Dutch Republic, qualify as a nation-state, but in 1648 most states in Europe were still non-national.<p>Many, but not all, see the major transition to nation-states as originating in the late 18th and 19th centuries. Beginning with <!--del_lnk--> romantic nationalism, nationalist movements arose throughout Europe, a process accelerated by the <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a> and the conquests of <!--del_lnk--> Napoleon Bonaparte. Some of these movements were <!--del_lnk--> separatist, directed against large empires: an early example is the <!--del_lnk--> Greek Revolution (1821-1829). Others sought to unify a divided or fragmented territory, as in the <!--del_lnk--> Italian unification under the rule of <!--del_lnk--> Piedmont-<!--del_lnk--> Sardinia. These movements promoted a national identity and culture: in the <!--del_lnk--> 1848 Revolutions in Europe they were often associated with <a href="../../wp/l/Liberalism.htm" title="Liberalism">liberal</a> demands. By the end of the 19th century most people accepted that Europe was divided into nations, and personally identified with one of these nations. The collapse of the <!--del_lnk--> Austro-Hungarian Empire and the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> after the <!--del_lnk--> First World War accelerated the formation of nation-states.<p>According to the standard view, before the 19th century people had local, regional, or religious loyalties, but no idea of nationhood. The typical state in Europe was a <!--del_lnk--> dynastic state, ruled by a royal house: if there were any loyalties above regional level, they were owed to the <!--del_lnk--> king and the ruling house. Dynastic states could acquire territory by royal marriage, and lose it by division of inheritance - which is now seen as absurd. Nationalism introduced the idea that each nation has a specific territory, and that beyond this point the claims of other nations apply. Nation-states, in principle, do not seek to conquer territory. However, nationalist movements rarely agreed on where the border should be. As the nationalist movements grew, they introduced new territorial disputes in Europe.<p>Nationalism also determined the political life of 19th century Europe. Where the nation was part of an empire, the national liberation struggle was also a struggle against older autocratic regimes, and nationalism was allied with liberal anti-monarchical movements. Where the nation-state was a consolidation of an older monarchy, as in <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>, nationalism was itself conservative and monarchical. Most nationalist movements began in opposition to the existing order, but by the 20th century, there were <!--del_lnk--> regimes which primarily identified themselves as nationalist.<p>The standard theory of the 19th-century origin of nation-states is disputed. One problem with it is that the <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South American</a> <!--del_lnk--> independence struggles and the American Revolution (<!--del_lnk--> American War of Independence) predate most European nationalist movements. Some countries, such as the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, seem to have had a clear national identity well before the 19th century.<p><a name="20th_Century_nationalism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">20th Century nationalism</span></h3>
      <p>By the end of the 19th century, nationalist ideas had begun to spread to <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a>. In <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, nationalism began to encourage calls for the end of British rule. The 20th century nationalist movement in India is generally associated with <a href="../../wp/m/Mahatma_Gandhi.htm" title="Mahatma Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a>, although many other leaders were involved as well. In <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, nationalism influenced the <!--del_lnk--> 1911 Revolution. In <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>, nationalism and Japanese &quot;<!--del_lnk--> exceptionalism&quot; influenced Japanese <!--del_lnk--> imperialism.<p><a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> led to to the creation of new nation-states in Europe. This was encouraged by the United States, which rejected the legitimacy of the former multi-ethnic empires, see <!--del_lnk--> Wilsonianism. France, which sought to to isolate Germany and Austria, also encouraged the creation of potential client states. The <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Austro-Hungarian Empire disintegrated. The <!--del_lnk--> Versailles Treaty, based upon US <a href="../../wp/w/Woodrow_Wilson.htm" title="Woodrow Wilson">President Wilson</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Fourteen Points, partially conformed the division into new nation-states. In the Middle East, the <!--del_lnk--> Arab Revolt did not lead to new independent states: the victorious western powers secured a <!--del_lnk--> League of Nations mandate for <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq.htm" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Lebanon.htm" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Palestine including <!--del_lnk--> Transjordan, and <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Turkish War of Independence (1919-1923) created a new nation state from the core of the Ottoman Empire. In the east of Europe, the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Empire had collapsed, as a result of the <a href="../../wp/r/Russian_Revolution_of_1917.htm" title="Russian Revolution of 1917">Russian Revolution of 1917</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Irish War led to the partition of <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> into the <!--del_lnk--> Irish Free State and <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>.<p>However, multi-nation and multi-ethnic states survived in Europe; and two new ones emerged, <!--del_lnk--> Czechoslovakia (where the more prosperous Czech half dominated), and the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Yugoslavia, (dominated by Serbia). In the interwar period, the extreme nationalist movements of <a href="../../wp/f/Fascism.htm" title="Fascism">fascism</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">Nazism</a> came to power in <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> respectively, and similar groups took over several other European countries during the late <!--del_lnk--> 1930s. This new wave of nationalism had powerful <!--del_lnk--> racist undertones, and it culminated in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/The_Holocaust.htm" title="The Holocaust">the Holocaust</a>.<p>The horrors of World War II discredited militant nationalism as an ideology, but scarcely altered the division of Europe into nation-states. Outside Europe, the war initiated a new wave of nation-state formation, through the independence of African and Asian nations from European <!--del_lnk--> colonial empires. The most dramatic <!--del_lnk--> decolonisation began in the late 1950&#39;s in <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>, which was transformed from a collection of European colonies into a continent of nation-states. Few of them corresponded to the ideal nation-state (one nation, one language, one culture), but most still exist. Ironically, the one that best met those criteria, <a href="../../wp/s/Somalia.htm" title="Somalia">Somalia</a>, disintegrated. The <!--del_lnk--> Algerian War of Independence was the most bloody of the decolonisation wars in Africa: some decolonisations were peaceful. <!--del_lnk--> Rhodesia and the <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> colonies of <a href="../../wp/m/Mozambique.htm" title="Mozambique">Mozambique</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Angola.htm" title="Angola">Angola</a> delayed decolonisation for a time.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> collapse of the Soviet Union led to an unexpected revival of national movements in Europe around 1990. Its constituent states became independent: <a href="../../wp/b/Belarus.htm" title="Belarus">Belarus</a>, <a href="../../wp/u/Ukraine.htm" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Moldova.htm" title="Moldova">Moldova</a>, <a href="../../wp/k/Kazakhstan.htm" title="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Turkmenistan.htm" title="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a>, <a href="../../wp/u/Uzbekistan.htm" title="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Tajikistan.htm" title="Tajikistan">Tajikistan</a>, <a href="../../wp/k/Kyrgyzstan.htm" title="Kyrgyzstan">Kyrgyzstan</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Armenia.htm" title="Armenia">Armenia</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Azerbaijan.htm" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>, and <a href="../../wp/g/Georgia_%2528country%2529.htm" title="Georgia (country)">Georgia</a>. The three <!--del_lnk--> Baltic states, <a href="../../wp/l/Latvia.htm" title="Latvia">Latvia</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Estonia.htm" title="Estonia">Estonia</a> and <a href="../../wp/l/Lithuania.htm" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a>, regained indpendence, (they had already become independent from Russia after the <!--del_lnk--> First World War). The second <a href="../../wp/y/Yugoslavia.htm" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> broke up into nation states, some with predecessor states such as the Nazi-oriented <!--del_lnk--> Independent State of Croatia, some as new sovereign states. Within established nation-states, there are many <!--del_lnk--> secessionist movements, some of them seeking the creation of a new sovereign state, for instance in <!--del_lnk--> Quebec. The unresolved status of in <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> led to protracted violence known as <!--del_lnk--> The Troubles, but without changes in the border.<p>In the second half of the 20th century, some trends emerged which might indicate a weakening of the nation-state and nationalism. The <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> is widely seen transferring power from the national level, to both sub-national and supra-national levels. Critics of <a href="../../wp/g/Globalization.htm" title="Globalization">globalization</a> often appeal to feelings of national identity, culture, and <!--del_lnk--> sovereignty. Free trade agreements, such as <!--del_lnk--> NAFTA and the <!--del_lnk--> GATT, and the increasing internationalisation of trade markets, are seen as damaging to the national economy, and have led to a revival of <!--del_lnk--> economic nationalism. Protest movements vehemently oppose these negative aspects of globalization, (see <!--del_lnk--> Anti-globalisation).<p>Not all anti-globalists are nationalists, but nationalism continues to assert itself in response to those trends. Nationalist parties continue to do well in elections, and most people continue to have a strong sense of attachment to their nationality. Moreover, globalism and European <!--del_lnk--> federalism are not always opposed to nationalism. For example, theorists of <!--del_lnk--> Chinese nationalism within the <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">People&#39;s Republic of China</a> have articulated the idea that China&#39;s national power is substantially enhanced, rather than being reduced, by engaging in international trade and multinational organizations. For a time sub-national groups such as <!--del_lnk--> Catalan autonomists and <!--del_lnk--> Welsh nationalists supported a stronger <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> in the hope that a <!--del_lnk--> Europe of the regions would limit the power of the present nation-states. However, with <!--del_lnk--> Euroscepticism now widespread in the EU, this transformation is no longer on its political agenda.<p><a id="Language_and_Nationalism" name="Language_and_Nationalism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Language and Nationalism</span></h3>
      <p>A common language has been a defining characteristic of the nation, and an ideal for nationalists. For example, in France before the <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>, <!--del_lnk--> regional languages such as <!--del_lnk--> Breton and <!--del_lnk--> Occitan were spoken, which were mutually incomprehensible. Standard French was also spoken in large parts of the country and had also been the language of administration, but after the Revolution it was imposed as the <!--del_lnk--> national language in non-French-speaking regions. For instance, in <!--del_lnk--> Brittany, Celtic names were forbidden. The formation of nation-states, and their consolidation after independence, is generally accompanied by policies to restrict, replace, or abandon <!--del_lnk--> minority languages. This accelerates the tendency noted in <!--del_lnk--> sociolinguistic research that high-status languages displace low-status languages. See also: <!--del_lnk--> Language policy in France.<p>Some theorists believe that nationalism became pronounced in the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a> simply because language became a more important unifier due to increased <a href="../../wp/l/Literacy.htm" title="Literacy">literacy</a>. With more people reading <a href="../../wp/n/Newspaper.htm" title="Newspaper">newspapers</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Book.htm" title="Book">books</a>, <!--del_lnk--> pamphlets and so on, which were increasingly widely available to read since the spread of the printing press, it became possible for the first time to develop a broader cultural attachment beyond the local community. At the same time, differences in language solidified, breaking down old <!--del_lnk--> dialects, and excluding those from completely different language groups.<p>Nationalist movements from <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> to <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> promote the teaching, revival preservation, and use of traditional languages, such as <!--del_lnk--> Celtic languages, <a href="../../wp/h/Hebrew_language.htm" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Hindi. (See also: <!--del_lnk--> Language revival.)<p>The <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, a country which historically welcomed immigrants of varying nationality, has what can be seen as a pattern of discrimination against languages other than English. Prominent examples are the <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German language</a>, which was nearly eradicated during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, and <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Italian, which have nearly disappeared from everyday life. Today <!--del_lnk--> Spanish is a second language across large portion of the country. Some politicians, such as <!--del_lnk--> Pat Buchanan have consciously opposed the rise of Spanish as a second American language, for fear that it would undermine unity in the American national character.<p>In the <!--del_lnk--> Arab World during the colonial period, the <!--del_lnk--> Turkish language, <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French language</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_language.htm" title="Spanish language">Spanish language</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English language</a> were often imposed, although the intensity of imposition varied widely. When the colonial period ended (mostly after World War Two), a process of &quot;Arabisation&quot; began; reviving <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> to unify their states and to facilitate a broader <!--del_lnk--> Arab identity, motivated by <!--del_lnk--> Pan-Arabism. Countries such as <a href="../../wp/a/Algeria.htm" title="Algeria">Algeria</a> and <a href="../../wp/w/Western_Sahara.htm" title="Western Sahara">Western Sahara</a> underwent large scale Arabisations, changing from French and Spanish to Arabic respectively.<p>However, within the Arab World, some nationalistic attempts were made to emancipate a domestic <!--del_lnk--> vernacular and treat <!--del_lnk--> classical Arabic as a formal <!--del_lnk--> foreign language, which was often incomprehensible to the non-literate population of nominally Arab countries, which were politically - but not necessarily linguistically, culturally or ethnically, Arabized. These policies were first promoted in Egypt in the early 20th century by the Egyptian scholar and nationalist <!--del_lnk--> Ahmad Lutfi al-Sayyid, who called for the formalization of the <!--del_lnk--> Egyptian Vernacular as the native language of the Egyptian people.<p>Similar attempts to emphasise <!--del_lnk--> minority languages completely independent of Arabic were made by the <!--del_lnk--> Nubians, speakers of <a href="../../wp/n/Nobiin_language.htm" title="Nobiin language">Nobiinm</a> who are split between <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Sudan.htm" title="Sudan">Sudan</a>, and relatively more successfully by the Imazighen (commonly known as <!--del_lnk--> Berber) in <a href="../../wp/m/Morocco.htm" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>.<p><a id="Types_of_nationalism" name="Types_of_nationalism"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Types of nationalism</span></h2>
      <p>Nationalism may manifest itself as part of official state ideology or as a popular (non-state) movement and may be expressed along <a href="../../wp/c/Civil_society.htm" title="Civil society">civic</a>, <!--del_lnk--> ethnic, <!--del_lnk--> cultural, <!--del_lnk--> religious or <!--del_lnk--> ideological lines. These self-definitions of the nation are used to classify types of nationalism. However, such categories are not mutually exclusive and many nationalist movements combine some or all of these elements to varying degrees. Nationalist movements can also be classified by other criteria, such as scale and location.<p>Some political theorists make the case that any distinction between forms of nationalism is false. In all forms of nationalism, the populations believe that they share some kind of common culture, and culture can never be wholly separated from <!--del_lnk--> ethnicity. The United States, for example, has &quot;God&quot; on its coinage and in its <!--del_lnk--> Pledge of Allegiance, and designates official holidays which are seen by some to promote cultural biases. The United States has an ethnic theory of being American (<!--del_lnk--> nativism), and, for a short period in the 20th Century, had a committee to investigate <!--del_lnk--> Un-American Activities.<p><a id="Civic_nationalism" name="Civic_nationalism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Civic nationalism</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Civic nationalism (or civil nationalism) is the form of nationalism in which the <!--del_lnk--> state derives <!--del_lnk--> political legitimacy from the active participation of its <a href="../../wp/c/Citizenship.htm" title="Citizenship">citizenry</a>, from the degree to which it represents the &quot;will of the people&quot;. It is often seen as originating with <a href="../../wp/j/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau.htm" title="Jean-Jacques Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a> and especially the <!--del_lnk--> social contract theories which take their name from his <!--del_lnk--> 1762 book <i>The Social Contract</i>. Civic nationalism lies within the <!--del_lnk--> traditions of <!--del_lnk--> rationalism and <a href="../../wp/l/Liberalism.htm" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a>, but as a form of nationalism it is contrasted with ethnic nationalism. Membership of the civic nation is considered voluntary. Civic-national ideals influenced the development of <!--del_lnk--> representative democracy in countries such as the United States and France.<p><a id="Ethnic_nationalism" name="Ethnic_nationalism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Ethnic nationalism</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Ethnic nationalism, or ethnonationalism, defines the nation in terms of <!--del_lnk--> ethnicity, which always includes some element of <!--del_lnk--> descent from previous generations. It also includes ideas of a culture shared between members of the group and with their <!--del_lnk--> ancestors, and usually a shared language. Membership in the nation is <!--del_lnk--> hereditary. The state derives political legitimacy from its status as <!--del_lnk--> homeland of the ethnic group, and from its function to protect the national group and facilitate its cultural and social life, as a group. Ideas of ethnicity are very old, but modern ethnic nationalism was heavily influenced by <!--del_lnk--> Johann Gottfried von Herder, who promoted the concept of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Volk</i>, and <!--del_lnk--> Johann Gottlieb Fichte. Ethnic nationalism is now the dominant form, and is often simply referred to as &quot;nationalism&quot;. Note that the theorist Anthony Smith uses the term &#39;ethnic nationalism&#39; for non-Western concepts of nationalism, as opposed to Western views of a nation defined by its geographical territory. (The term &quot;<!--del_lnk--> ethnonationalism&quot; is generally used only in reference to nationalists who espouse an explicit ideology along these lines; &quot;<!--del_lnk--> ethnic nationalism&quot; is the more generic term, and used for nationalists who hold these beliefs in an informal, instinctive, or unsystematic way. The pejorative form of both is &quot;ethnocentric nationalism&quot; or &quot;tribal nationalism,&quot; though &quot;tribal nationalism&quot; can have a non-pejorative meaning when discussing African, Native American, or other nationalisms that openly assert a tribal identity.)<p><a id="Romantic_nationalism" name="Romantic_nationalism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Romantic nationalism</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Romantic nationalism (also <i>organic nationalism</i>, <i>identity nationalism</i>) is the form of <!--del_lnk--> ethnic nationalism in which the state derives political legitimacy as a natural (&quot;organic&quot;) consequence and <!--del_lnk--> expression of the nation, or <a href="../../wp/r/Race.htm" title="Race">race</a>. It reflected the ideals of <a href="../../wp/r/Romanticism.htm" title="Romanticism">Romanticism</a> and was opposed to Enlightenment <!--del_lnk--> rationalism. Romantic nationalism emphasised a historical ethnic culture which meets the Romantic Ideal; <a href="../../wp/f/Folklore.htm" title="Folklore">folklore</a> developed as a Romantic nationalist concept. The <a href="../../wp/b/Brothers_Grimm.htm" title="Brothers Grimm">Brothers Grimm</a> were inspired by Herder&#39;s writings to create an idealised collection of tales which they labeled as ethnically German. Historian <!--del_lnk--> Jules Michelet exemplifies French romantic-nationalist history.<p><a id="Cultural_nationalism" name="Cultural_nationalism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cultural nationalism</span></h3>
      <p>Cultural nationalism defines the nation by shared <a href="../../wp/c/Culture.htm" title="Culture">culture</a>. Membership in the nation is neither entirely voluntary (you cannot instantly acquire a culture), nor hereditary (children of members may be considered foreigners if they grew up in another culture). Chinese nationalism is one example of cultural nationalism, partly because of the many national minorities in China. (The &#39;Chinese nationalists&#39; include those on <a href="../../wp/t/Taiwan.htm" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> who reject the mainland Chinese government but claim the mainland Chinese state).<p><a id="Liberal_nationalism" name="Liberal_nationalism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Liberal nationalism</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Liberal nationalism is a kind of nationalism defended recently by political philosophers who believe that there can be a non-xenophobic form of nationalism compatible with liberal values of freedom, tolerance, equality, and individual rights (Tamir 1993; Kymlicka 1995; Miller 1995). <!--del_lnk--> Ernest Renan (1882) and <!--del_lnk--> John Stuart Mill (1861) are often thought to be early liberal nationalists. Liberal nationalists often defend the value of national identity by saying that individuals need a national identity in order to lead meaningful, autonomous lives (Kymlicka 1995; for criticism see Patten 1999) and that liberal democratic polities need national identity in order to function properly (Miller 1995; for criticism see Abizadeh 2002, 2004).<p><a id="State_nationalism" name="State_nationalism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">State nationalism</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> State nationalism is a variant on civic nationalism, very often combined with <!--del_lnk--> ethnic nationalism. It implies that the nation is a community of those who contribute to the maintenance and strength of the state, and that the individual exists to contribute to this goal. Italian <a href="../../wp/f/Fascism.htm" title="Fascism">fascism</a> is the best example, epitomised in this slogan of <!--del_lnk--> Mussolini: &quot;Tutto nello Stato, niente al di fuori dello Stato, nulla contro lo Stato.&quot; (&quot;Everything in the State, nothing outside the State, nothing against the State&quot;). It is no surprise that this conflicts with <a href="../../wp/l/Liberalism.htm" title="Liberalism">liberal ideals</a> of individual liberty, and with liberal-democratic principles. The revolutionary (liberal) <!--del_lnk--> Jacobin creation of a unitary and centralist French state is often seen as the original version of state nationalism. <!--del_lnk--> Franquist Spain, and contemporary <!--del_lnk--> Turkish nationalism are later examples of state nationalism.<p>However, the term &quot;state nationalism&quot; is often used in conflicts between nationalisms, and especially where a <!--del_lnk--> secessionist movement confronts an established nation state. The secessionists speak of state nationalism to discredit the legitimacy of the larger state, since state nationalism is perceived as less authentic and less democratic. <!--del_lnk--> Flemish separatists speak of <!--del_lnk--> Belgian nationalism as a state nationalism. <!--del_lnk--> Basque separatists and <!--del_lnk--> Corsican separatists refer to Spain and France, respectively, in this way. There are no undisputed external criteria to assess which side is right, and the result is usually that the population is divided by conflicting appeals to its loyalty and patriotism.<p><a id="Religious_nationalism" name="Religious_nationalism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Religious nationalism</span></h3>
      <p>Religious nationalism defines the nation in terms of shared <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religion</a>, usually along with other factors such as culture, ethnicity, and language. If the state derives political legitimacy from adherence to religious doctrines, then it is more of a <!--del_lnk--> theocracy than a nation-state. Many ethnic and cultural nationalisms include religious aspects, but as a marker of group identity, rather than the intrinsic motivation for nationalist claims. <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Irish</a> nationalism is associated with <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholicism, and most <!--del_lnk--> Irish nationalist leaders of the last 100 years were Catholic, although many of the early (<a href="../../wp/1/18th_century.htm" title="18th century">18th century</a>) nationalists were <!--del_lnk--> Protestant. Irish nationalism does not itself derive from <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic <!--del_lnk--> theological doctrines, although some Protestants in <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> do fear that these doctrines will be forced on them, in a united Ireland. Similarly, although <!--del_lnk--> Religious Zionism exists and influences many, the mainstream of Zionism is more secular in nature, and based on culture and Jewish ethnicity. Since the partition of British India, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">Indian</a> nationalism has often been associated with <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, although there is also a secular and anti-<!--del_lnk--> communalist version. In modern India, a contemporary form of Hindu nationalism, or <!--del_lnk--> Hindutva has been prominent among many followers of the <!--del_lnk--> Bharatiya Janata Party and <!--del_lnk--> Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Religious nationalism characterized by communal adherence to <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Orthodoxy and national Orthodox Churches is still prevalent in many states of <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Europe and in the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Federation.<p><a id="Pan-nationalism" name="Pan-nationalism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Pan-nationalism</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Pan-nationalism is usually an ethnic and cultural nationalism, but the &#39;nation&#39; is itself a cluster of related ethnic groups and cultures, such as <!--del_lnk--> Turkic peoples. Occasionally pan-nationalism is applied to mono-ethnic nationalism, when the national group is dispersed over a wide area and several states - as in <!--del_lnk--> Pan-Germanism.<p><a id="Diaspora_nationalism" name="Diaspora_nationalism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Diaspora nationalism</span></h3>
      <p>Diaspora nationalism (or, as <!--del_lnk--> Benedict Anderson terms it, &quot;long-distance nationalism&quot;) generally refers to nationalist feeling among a <!--del_lnk--> diaspora such as the Irish in the United States, or the Lebanese in the Americas and Africa, and the Armenians in Europe and the United States. <!--del_lnk-->  Anderson states that this sort of nationalism acts as a &quot;phantom bedrock&quot; for people who want to experience a national connection, but who do not actually want to leave their diaspora community. The essential difference between pan-nationalism and diaspora nationalism is that members of a <!--del_lnk--> diaspora, by definition, are no longer resident in their national or ethnic homeland. In the specific case of <a href="../../wp/z/Zionism.htm" title="Zionism">Zionism</a>, the national movement advocates migration to the claimed national homeland, which would - if 100% effected - end the diaspora.<p><a id="Nationalism_within_a_nation" name="Nationalism_within_a_nation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Nationalism within a nation</span></h2>
      <p>With the establishment of a nation-state, the primary goal of any nationalist movement has been achieved. However, nationalism does not disappear but remains a political force within the nation, and inspires political parties and movements. The terms nationalist and &#39;nationalist politician&rsquo; are often used to describe these movements; <b>nationalistic</b> would be more accurate. Nationalists in this sense typically campaign for:<ul>
       <li>strengthening national unity, including campaigns for national salvation in times of crisis.<li>emphasising the <!--del_lnk--> national identity and rejecting foreign influences, influenced by <!--del_lnk--> cultural conservatism and in extreme cases, <!--del_lnk--> xenophobia.<li>limiting non-national populations on the national territory, especially by limiting <!--del_lnk--> immigration and, in extreme cases, by <!--del_lnk--> ethnic cleansing.<li>annexing territory which is considered part of the national homeland. This is called <!--del_lnk--> irredentism, from the Italian movement <i><!--del_lnk--> Italia irredenta</i>.<li><!--del_lnk--> economic nationalism, which is the promotion of the national interest in economic policy, especially through <!--del_lnk--> protectionism and in opposition to <!--del_lnk--> free trade policies.</ul>
      <p>Nationalist parties and nationalist politicians, in this sense, usually place great emphasis on <!--del_lnk--> national symbols, such as the national <!--del_lnk--> flag.<p>The term &#39;nationalism&#39; is also used by extension, or as a <!--del_lnk--> metaphor, to describe movements which promote a group identity of some kind. This use is especially common in the United States, and includes <!--del_lnk--> black nationalism and <!--del_lnk--> white nationalism in a cultural sense. They may overlap with nationalism in the classic sense, including black <!--del_lnk--> secessionist movements and <!--del_lnk--> pan-Africanism.<p>Nationalists obviously have a positive attitude toward their own nation, although this is not a definition of nationalism. The emotional appeal of nationalism is visible even in established and stable nation-states. The <!--del_lnk--> social psychology of nations includes national identity (the individual&rsquo;s sense of belonging to a group), and national pride (self-association with the success of the group). National pride is related to the cultural influence of the nation, and its economic and political strength - although they may be exaggerated. However, the most important factor is that the emotions are shared: <!--del_lnk--> nationalism in sport includes the shared disappointment if the national team loses.<p>The emotions can be purely negative: a shared sense of threat can unify the nation. However, dramatic events, such as defeat in war, can qualitatively affect national identity and attitudes to non-national groups. The defeat of Germany in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, and the perceived humiliation by the <a href="../../wp/t/Treaty_of_Versailles.htm" title="Treaty of Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, economic crisis and hyperinflation, created a climate for xenophobia, <!--del_lnk--> revanchism, and the rise of Nazism. The solid bourgeois patriotism of the pre-<!--del_lnk--> 1914 years, with the <!--del_lnk--> Kaiser as national father-figure, was no longer relevant.<p><a id="Nationalism_and_extremism" name="Nationalism_and_extremism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Nationalism and extremism</span></h3>
      <p>Although nationalism influences many aspects of life in stable nation-states, its presence is often invisible, since the nation-state is taken for granted. <!--del_lnk--> Michael Billig speaks of <i>banal nationalism</i>, the everyday, less visible forms of nationalism, which shape the minds of a nation&#39;s inhabitants on a day-to-day basis. Attention concentrates on extreme aspects, and on nationalism in unstable regions. Nationalism may be used as a derogatory label for political parties, or they may use it themselves as a <!--del_lnk--> euphemism for <!--del_lnk--> xenophobia, even if their policies are no more specifically nationalist, than other political parties in the same country. In Europe, some &#39;nationalist&#39; anti-immigrant parties have a large electorate, and are represented in parliament. Smaller but highly visible groups, such as <!--del_lnk--> far right skinheads, also self-identify as &#39;nationalist&#39;, although it may be a euphemism for <!--del_lnk--> neo-Nazis or <!--del_lnk--> white supremacists. Activists in <i>other</i> countries are often referred to as <b>ultra-nationalists</b>, with a clearly pejorative meaning.

      <p>Nationalism is a component of other political ideologies, and in its extreme form, <a href="../../wp/f/Fascism.htm" title="Fascism">fascism</a>. However, it is not accurate to simply describe fascism as a more extreme form of nationalism, although non-extreme nationalism can be seen as a lesser form of fascism. Fascism in the general sense, and the Italian original, were marked by a strong combination of ethnic nationalism and <!--del_lnk--> state nationalism, often combined with a form of economic and ethical <a href="../../wp/s/Socialism.htm" title="Socialism">socialism</a>. That was certainly evident in <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">Nazism</a>. However, the geopolitical aspirations of <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> are probably better described as <!--del_lnk--> imperialist, and <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> ultimately ruled over vast areas where there was no historic German presence.

      <p>Nationalism does not necessarily imply a belief in the superiority of one nation over others, but in practice some (but not all) nationalists do think that way about their own nation. Occasionally they believe another nation can serve as an example for their own nation, see <!--del_lnk--> Anglophilia. There is a specific <b>racial nationalism</b> which can be considered an ethnic nationalism, but some form of <!--del_lnk--> racism can be found within almost all nationalist movements. It is usually directed at neighbouring nations and ethnic groups.<p>Racism was also a feature of <!--del_lnk--> colonialist ideologies, which were especially strong at the end of the 19th century. Strictly speaking, overseas colonies conflict with the principles of the nation-state, since they are not part of the historic homeland of the nation, and their inhabitants clearly do not belong to the same ethnic group, speak its language, or share its culture. In practice, nationalists sometimes combined a belief in <!--del_lnk--> self-determination in Europe, with <!--del_lnk--> colonisation in Africa or Asia.<p>Explicit biological <!--del_lnk--> race theory was influential from the end of the 19th century. Nationalist and fascist movements in the first half of the 20th century often appealed to these theories. The <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">Nazi</a> ideology was probably the most comprehensively racial ideology in history, and <a href="../../wp/r/Race.htm" title="Race">race</a> influenced all aspects of policy in <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>.<p>Nevertheless racism continues to be an influence on nationalism. <!--del_lnk--> Ethnic cleansing is often seen as both a nationalist and racist phenomenon. It is part of nationalist logic that the state is reserved for one nation, but not all nation-states expel their minorities. The best known recent examples of ethnic cleansing are those during the <!--del_lnk--> Yugoslav secession war in the <!--del_lnk--> 1990s, although larger numbers may have been displaced in the African <!--del_lnk--> Great Lakes refugee crisis. Major ethnic cleansing took place during and after the <!--del_lnk--> Second World War, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Generalplan Ost and the removal of Germans from the <!--del_lnk--> Volga Republic during the <!--del_lnk--> 1950s. The disputed <!--del_lnk--> Armenian Genocide in the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1915 is also seen as an ethnic cleansing.<p><a id="Opposition_and_critique" name="Opposition_and_critique"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Opposition and critique</span></h2>
      <p>Nationalism is an extremely assertive ideology, which makes far-reaching demands, including the disappearance of entire states. It is not surprising that it has attracted vehement opposition. Much of the early opposition to nationalism was related to its geopolitical ideal of a separate state for every nation. The classic nationalist movements of the 19th century rejected the very existence of the multi-ethnic empires in Europe. This resulted in severe repression by the (generally autocratic) governments of those empires. That tradition of secessionism, repression, and violence continues, although by now a large nation typically confronts a smaller nation. Even in that early stage, however, there was an ideological critique of nationalism. That has developed into several forms of <!--del_lnk--> anti-nationalism in the western world. The Islamic revival of the 20th century also produced an Islamic critique of the nation-state.<p>In the <a href="../../wp/l/Liberalism.htm" title="Liberalism">liberal political tradition</a> there is widespread criticism of &lsquo;nationalism&rsquo; as a dangerous force and a cause of conflict and <a href="../../wp/w/War.htm" title="War">war</a> between nation-states. Liberals do not generally dispute the existence of the nation-states. The liberal critique also emphasises individual freedom as opposed to national identity, which is by definition collective (see <!--del_lnk--> collectivism).<p>The <!--del_lnk--> pacifist critique of nationalism also concentrates on the violence of nationalist movements, the associated <!--del_lnk--> militarism, and on conflicts between nations inspired by <!--del_lnk--> jingoism or <!--del_lnk--> chauvinism. National symbols and patriotic assertiveness are in some countries discredited by their historical link with past wars, especially in <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> anti-racist critique of nationalism concentrates on the attitudes to other nations, and especially on the doctrine that the nation-state exists for one national group, to the exclusion of others. It emphasises the chauvinism and xenophobia of many nationalisms.<p>Political movements of the left have often been suspicious of nationalism, again without necessarily seeking the disappearance of the existing nation-states. <a href="../../wp/m/Marxism.htm" title="Marxism">Marxism</a> has been ambiguous towards the nation-state, and in the late 19th century some Marxist theorists rejected it completely. For some Marxists the <!--del_lnk--> world revolution implied a global state (or global absence of state); for others it meant that each nation-state had its own revolution. A significant event in this context was the failure of the <!--del_lnk--> social-democratic and <!--del_lnk--> socialist movements in Europe to mobilise a cross-border workers&#39; opposition to <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>. At present most, but certainly not all, <!--del_lnk--> left-wing groups accept the nation-state, and see it as the <a href="../../wp/p/Politics.htm" title="Politics">political arena</a> for their activities.<p>In the <!--del_lnk--> Western world the most comprehensive current ideological alternative to nationalism is <!--del_lnk--> cosmopolitanism. Ethical cosmopolitanism rejects one of the basic ethical principles of nationalism: that humans owe more duties to a fellow member of the nation, than to a non-member. It rejects such important nationalist values as national identity and national loyalty. However, there is also a political cosmopolitanism, which has a geopolitical programme to match that of nationalism: it seeks some form of <!--del_lnk--> world state, with a <!--del_lnk--> world government. Very few people openly and explicitly support the establishment of a global state, but political cosmopolitanism has influenced the development of international criminal law, and the erosion of the status of national <!--del_lnk--> sovereignty. In turn, nationalists are deeply suspicious of cosmopolitan attitudes, which they equate with <!--del_lnk--> treason and betrayal.<p>While <!--del_lnk--> internationalism in the <!--del_lnk--> cosmopolitanist context by definition implies cooperation among nations, and therefore the existence of nations, <!--del_lnk--> proletarian internationalism is different, in that it calls for the international <!--del_lnk--> working class to follow its brethren in other countries irrespective of the activities or pressures of the national government of a particular sector of that class. Meanwhile, <a href="../../wp/a/Anarchism.htm" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a> rejects <!--del_lnk--> nation-states on the basis of <!--del_lnk--> self-determination of the majority social class, and thus reject nationalism. Instead of nations, anarchists usually advocate the creation of cooperative societies based on <!--del_lnk--> free association and <!--del_lnk--> mutual aid without regard to <!--del_lnk--> ethnicity or <a href="../../wp/r/Race.htm" title="Race">race</a>.<p><a id="Islamism_and_Nationalism" name="Islamism_and_Nationalism"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Islamism and Nationalism</span></h4>
      <p>Some radical <!--del_lnk--> Islamists reject the existence of any state on any basis, other than the <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islamic</a> <!--del_lnk--> caliphate. For them, the unity of Islam means that there can be only one <a href="../../wp/g/Government.htm" title="Government">government</a> on Earth, in the form usually titled <!--del_lnk--> caliphate (<i>khilafah</i>). It is not a state in the usual Western sense, but all existing states are incompatible with this ideal, including the Islamic nation-states with Islam as the official religion. Only a minority of Islamists take this view, but insofar as <!--del_lnk--> Al-Qaeda has an ideology, it includes the goal of the caliphate. The <!--del_lnk--> Ba&#39;ath Party and related groups have historically offered a secular Arab Nationalist opposition to Islamism in Arab countries.<p>As a universal religion, <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> is nominally opposed to any categorisation of people not based on one&#39;s beliefs. Islam promotes a strong feeling of community among all Muslims, who collectively constitute the <i><!--del_lnk--> Ummah</i>. The word &quot;Ummah&quot; is often incorrectly translated into English as &quot;Islamic nation&quot; but it is not a nation in this sense and not a synonym of &#39;caliphate&#39;, although the idea is associated with the <!--del_lnk--> historic caliphates. The confusion may arise because in other cases it <i>does</i> translate to the English word &quot;nation&quot;, as in the Arabic name of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>,&#x627;&#x644;&#x623;&#x645;&#x645; &#x627;&#x644;&#x645;&#x62A;&#x62D;&#x62F;&#x629;, <i>Al Umam al Mutahidah</i>. Shared observances such as the holy month of <!--del_lnk--> Ramadan and the <!--del_lnk--> Hajj (the pilgrimage to Mecca), contribute to this common Muslim identification. The <!--del_lnk--> Nation of Islam in the United States has been criticised by some Muslims, who find the comparison between Islam and an earthly nation offensive.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism&quot;</div>
