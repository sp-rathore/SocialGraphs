      <p><b>Neptune</b> (<!--del_lnk--> IPA: <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/&#x2C8;n&#x25B;pt(j)u&#x2D0;n/</span>) is the eighth and outermost <a href="../../wp/p/Planet.htm" title="Planet">planet</a> in our <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_System.htm" title="Solar system">solar system</a>. It is the fourth-largest planet by diameter and the third-largest by mass; Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth and is slightly more massive than its near twin <a href="../../wp/u/Uranus.htm" title="Uranus">Uranus</a> which is 14 Earth Masses, but slightly smaller due to its higher density. The planet is named after the <!--del_lnk--> Roman god of the sea. Its <!--del_lnk--> astronomical symbol (&#x2646;, <!--del_lnk--> Unicode U+2646) is a stylized version of the god&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> trident.<p>Neptune&#39;s atmosphere is primarily composed of <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and <a href="../../wp/h/Helium.htm" title="Helium">helium</a>, with traces of <!--del_lnk--> methane that account for the planet&#39;s blue appearance. Neptune&#39;s blue colour is much more vivid than that of Uranus, which has a similar amount of methane, so an unknown component is presumed to cause Neptune&#39;s intense colour.  Neptune also has the strongest winds of any planet in the solar system, with estimates as high as 2,500 km/h or 1,500 mph. At the time of the 1989 <i><!--del_lnk--> Voyager 2</i> flyby, it had in its southern hemisphere a <!--del_lnk--> Great Dark Spot comparable to the <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Red_Spot.htm" title="Great Red Spot">Great Red Spot</a> on <a href="../../wp/j/Jupiter.htm" title="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>. Neptune&#39;s temperature at its cloud tops is usually close to &minus;210&#x2103; (&minus;346&deg;F), one of the coldest in the solar system, due to its long distance from the sun. Neptune&#39;s center is about 7,000&#x2103; (13,000&deg;F), however, hotter than the sun&#39;s surface. This is due to extremely hot gases and rock in the centre.<p>Faint dark colored rings have been detected around the blue planet, but are much less substantial than those of <a href="../../wp/s/Saturn.htm" title="Saturn">Saturn</a>. When these rings were discovered by a team led by <!--del_lnk--> Edward Guinan, it was thought that they might not be complete but this was disproved by <i>Voyager 2</i>. Neptune possesses thirteen confirmed moons. Neptune&#39;s largest moon, <!--del_lnk--> Triton, is notable for its <!--del_lnk--> retrograde orbit, extreme cold (38<!--del_lnk--> K), and extremely tenuous (14 <!--del_lnk--> microbar) nitrogen/methane atmosphere.<p>Discovered on <!--del_lnk--> September 23, <!--del_lnk--> 1846, Neptune is notable for being the first planet discovered based on mathematical prediction rather than regular observations. Perturbations in the orbit of <a href="../../wp/u/Uranus.htm" title="Uranus">Uranus</a> led astronomers to deduce Neptune&#39;s existence. It has been visited by only one spacecraft, <i>Voyager 2</i>, which flew by the planet on <!--del_lnk--> August 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1989. In 2003, there was a proposal to <!--del_lnk--> NASA&#39;s &quot;Vision Missions Studies&quot; to implement a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Neptune Orbiter with Probes&quot; mission that does <i><a href="../../wp/c/Cassini-Huygens.htm" title="Cassini-Huygens">Cassini</a></i>-level science without fission-based electric power or propulsion. The work is being done in conjunction with <!--del_lnk--> JPL and the <!--del_lnk--> California Institute of Technology.<p>

      <p><a href="../../wp/g/Galileo_Galilei.htm" title="Galileo Galilei">Galileo</a>&#39;s astronomical drawings show that he had first observed Neptune on <!--del_lnk--> December 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1612, and again on <!--del_lnk--> January 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1613; on both occasions Galileo had mistaken Neptune for a <!--del_lnk--> fixed star when it appeared very close (in <!--del_lnk--> conjunction) to Jupiter in the <!--del_lnk--> night sky. Believing it to be a fixed star, he cannot be credited with its discovery. At the time Galileo first observed Neptune on <!--del_lnk--> December 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1612, it was stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that very day; because it was stationary in the sky and only beginning the planet&#39;s yearly retrograde cycle, its motion was far too slight to be detected with Galileo&#39;s small <a href="../../wp/t/Telescope.htm" title="Telescope">telescope</a>.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>In 1821, <!--del_lnk--> Alexis Bouvard published astronomical tables of the <!--del_lnk--> orbit of Uranus. Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables, leading Bouvard to hypothesize some perturbing body. In 1843, <!--del_lnk--> John Couch Adams calculated the orbit of an eighth planet that would account for Uranus&#39; motion. He sent his calculations to Sir <!--del_lnk--> George Airy, the <!--del_lnk--> Astronomer Royal, who asked Adams for a clarification. Adams began to draft a reply but never sent it.<p>In 1846, <!--del_lnk--> Urbain Le Verrier, independently of Adams, produced his own calculations but also experienced difficulties in encouraging any enthusiasm in his compatriots. However, in the same year, <!--del_lnk--> John Herschel started to champion the mathematical approach and persuaded <!--del_lnk--> James Challis to search for the planet.<p>After much procrastination, Challis began his reluctant search in July 1846. However, in the meantime, <!--del_lnk--> Le Verrier had convinced <!--del_lnk--> Johann Gottfried Galle to search for the planet. Though still a student at the <!--del_lnk--> Berlin Observatory, <!--del_lnk--> Heinrich d&#39;Arrest suggested that a recently drawn chart of the sky, in the region of Le Verrier&#39;s predicted location, could be compared with the current sky to seek the displacement characteristic of a <a href="../../wp/p/Planet.htm" title="Planet">planet</a>, as opposed to a fixed star. Neptune was discovered that very night, <!--del_lnk--> September 23, <!--del_lnk--> 1846, within 1&deg; of where Le Verrier had predicted it to be, and about 10&deg; from Adams&#39; prediction. Challis later realized that he had observed the planet twice in August, failing to identify it owing to his casual approach to the work.<p>In the aftermath of the discovery, there was much nationalistic rivalry between the French and the British over who had priority and deserved credit for the discovery. Eventually an international consensus emerged that both Le Verrier and Adams jointly deserved credit. However, the issue is now being re-evaluated by historians with the rediscovery in 1998 of the &quot;Neptune papers&quot; (historical documents from the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Greenwich Observatory), which had apparently been misappropriated by astronomer <!--del_lnk--> Olin Eggen for nearly three decades and were only rediscovered (in his possession) immediately after his death. After reviewing the documents, some historians now suggest that Adams does not deserve equal credit with Le Verrier.<p><a id="Naming" name="Naming"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Naming</span></h2>

      <p>Shortly after its discovery, Neptune was referred to simply as &quot;the planet exterior to Uranus&quot; or as &quot;Le Verrier&#39;s planet.&quot; The first suggestion for a name came from Galle. He proposed the name <i><!--del_lnk--> Janus</i>. In England, Challis put forth the name <i><!--del_lnk--> Oceanus</i>, particularly appropriate for a seafaring people. In France, <!--del_lnk--> Arago suggested that the new planet be called <i>Leverrier</i>, a suggestion which was met with stiff resistance outside <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>. French almanacs promptly reintroduced the name <i>Herschel</i> for <i>Uranus</i> and <i>Leverrier</i> for the new planet.<p>Meanwhile, on separate and independent occasions, Adams suggested altering the name <i>Georgian</i> to <i>Uranus</i>, while Leverrier (through the Board of Longitude) suggested <i>Neptune</i> for the new planet. <!--del_lnk--> Struve came out in favour of that name on <!--del_lnk--> December 29, <!--del_lnk--> 1846, to the <a href="../../wp/s/Saint_Petersburg.htm" title="Saint Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> Academy of Sciences. Soon <i>Neptune</i> became the internationally accepted nomenclature. In <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_mythology.htm" title="Roman mythology">Roman mythology</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Neptune was the god of the sea, identified with the Greek <!--del_lnk--> Poseidon. The demand for a mythological name seemed to be in keeping with the nomenclature of the other planets, all of which, except for Uranus, were named in antiquity.<p>The planet&#39;s name is translated literally as the <i>sea king star</i> in the <a href="../../wp/c/Chinese_language.htm" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Korean, <!--del_lnk--> Japanese, and <!--del_lnk--> Vietnamese languages (&#x6D77;&#x738B;&#x661F; in Chinese characters, &#xD574;&#xC655;&#xC131; in Korean).<p><a id="Physical_characteristics" name="Physical_characteristics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Physical characteristics</span></h2>

In the search for <!--del_lnk--> extra-solar planets Neptune has been used as a <!--del_lnk--> metonym: discovered bodies of similar mass are often referred to as &quot;Neptunes&quot; just as astronomers refer to various extra-solar &quot;Jupiters.&quot;<p><a id="Composition" name="Composition"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Composition</span></h3>
      <p>Orbiting so far from the sun, Neptune receives very little heat with the uppermost regions of the atmosphere at &minus;218&nbsp;&deg;C (55 K). Deeper inside the layers of gas, however, the temperature rises steadily. It is thought that this may be leftover heat generated by <!--del_lnk--> infalling matter during the planet&#39;s birth, now slowly radiating away into space.<p>The internal structure resembles that of Uranus. There is likely to be a <!--del_lnk--> core consisting of molten rock and metal, surrounded by a mixture of rock, water, ammonia, and methane. There is no solid surface and the atmosphere, extending perhaps 10 to 20 percent of the way towards the center, is mostly hydrogen and helium at high altitudes (80% and 19%, respectively). Increasing concentrations of methane, ammonia, and water are found as the dark, hotter and lower regions atmosphere approaches and finally blends into the superheated liquid interior. The pressure at the centre of Neptune is millions of times more than that on the surface of <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a>. Comparing its rotational speed to its degree of <!--del_lnk--> oblateness indicates that it has its mass less concentrated towards the centre than does Uranus.<p><a id="Magnetic_field" name="Magnetic_field"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Magnetic field</span></h3>
      <p>Neptune also resembles Uranus in its <!--del_lnk--> magnetosphere, with a <!--del_lnk--> magnetic field strongly tilted relative to its <!--del_lnk--> rotational axis at 47&deg; and offset at least 0.55 radii (about 13,500 kilometres) from the planet&#39;s physical centre. Comparing the magnetic fields of the two planets, scientists think the extreme orientation may be characteristic of flows in the interior of the planet and not the result of Uranus&#39; sideways orientation.<p><a id="Weather" name="Weather"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Weather</span></h3>

      <p>One difference between Neptune and Uranus is the level of meteorological activity. Uranus is visually quite bland, while Neptune&#39;s high winds come with notable weather phenomena. Neptune&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> atmosphere has the highest wind speeds in the solar system, thought to be powered by the flow of internal heat, and its weather is characterized by extremely violent <a href="../../wp/t/Tropical_cyclone.htm" title="Hurricane">hurricanes</a>, with winds reaching up to 2000 km/h.<p>In 1989, the <!--del_lnk--> Great Dark Spot, a cyclonic storm system the size of <!--del_lnk--> Eurasia, was discovered by <!--del_lnk--> NASA&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Voyager 2</i> spacecraft. The storm resembled the <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Red_Spot.htm" title="Great Red Spot">Great Red Spot</a> of Jupiter. However, on <!--del_lnk--> November 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1994 the <a href="../../wp/h/Hubble_Space_Telescope.htm" title="Hubble Space Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> did not see the Great Dark Spot on the planet. Instead, a new storm similar to the Great Dark Spot was found in the planet&#39;s northern hemisphere. The reason for the Great Dark Spot&#39;s disappearance is unknown. Many scientists believe heat transfer from the planet&#39;s core disrupted the atmospheric equilibrium and disrupted existing circulation patterns. The <b>Scooter</b> is another storm described as a white cloud south of the Great Dark Spot. The <!--del_lnk--> Wizard&#39;s eye (Great Dark Spot 2) is a southern hurricane, the second most intensive hurricane on the planet.<p>Unique among the gas giants is the presence of high clouds casting shadows on the opaque cloud deck below. Though Neptune&#39;s atmosphere is much more dynamic than that of Uranus, both planets are made of the same gases and ices. Uranus and Neptune are not strictly gas giants similar to Jupiter and Saturn, but are rather ice giants, meaning they have a larger solid core and are also made of ices. Neptune is very cold, with temperatures as low as -224&deg;C (-372&deg;F) recorded at the cloud tops in 1989.<p><a id="Exploration_of_Neptune" name="Exploration_of_Neptune"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Exploration of Neptune</span></h2>

      <p>The closest approach of <i>Voyager 2</i> to Neptune occurred on <!--del_lnk--> August 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1989. Since this was the last major planet the spacecraft could visit, it was decided to make a close flyby of the moon <!--del_lnk--> Triton, regardless of the consequences to the trajectory, similarly to what was done for <i><!--del_lnk--> Voyager 1&#39;</i>s encounter with <!--del_lnk--> Saturn and its moon <!--del_lnk--> Titan.<p>The probe also discovered the <!--del_lnk--> Great Dark Spot, which has since disappeared, according to <a href="../../wp/h/Hubble_Space_Telescope.htm" title="Hubble Space Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> observations. Originally thought to be a large cloud itself, it was later postulated to be a hole in the visible cloud deck.<p>Neptune turned out to have the strongest winds of all the solar system&#39;s gas giants. In the outer regions of the solar system, where the Sun shines over 1000 times fainter than on Earth (still very bright with a magnitude of -21), the last of the four giants defied all expectations of the scientists.<p>One might expect that the farther one gets from The Sun, the less energy there would be to drive the winds around. The winds on Jupiter were already hundreds of kilometres per hour. Rather than seeing slower winds, the scientists found faster winds (over 1600 km/h) on more distant Neptune.<p>Scientists now know why this is the case &mdash;if enough energy is produced, <!--del_lnk--> turbulence is created, which slows the winds down (like those of Jupiter). At Neptune however, there is so little energy, that once winds are started, they meet very little resistance, and are able to maintain extremely high velocities.<p><a id="Planetary_rings" name="Planetary_rings"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Planetary rings</span></h2>

      <p>Neptune has a faint <!--del_lnk--> planetary ring system of unknown composition. The rings have a peculiar &quot;clumpy&quot; structure, the cause of which is not currently understood but which may be due to the gravitational interaction with small moons in orbit near them.<div class="thumb tright">
       <div style="width:152px;"><a class="internal" href="../../images/95/9566.jpg.htm" title="Neptune&#39;s rings"><img alt="Neptune&#39;s rings" height="256" longdesc="/wiki/Image:Neptune_rings_PIA02224.jpg" src="../../images/95/9566.jpg" width="150" /></a><div class="thumbcaption">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Evidence that the rings are incomplete first arose in the mid-<!--del_lnk--> 1980s, when <!--del_lnk--> stellar occultation experiments were found to occasionally show an extra &quot;blink&quot; just before or after the planet occulted the star. Images by <i>Voyager 2</i> in 1989 settled the issue, when the ring system was found to contain several faint rings. The outermost ring, Adams, contains three prominent arcs now named <i>Libert&eacute;</i>, <i>Egalit&eacute;</i>, and <i>Fraternit&eacute;</i> (Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity). The existence of arcs is very difficult to understand because the laws of motion would predict that arcs spread out into a uniform ring over very short timescales. The gravitational effects of <!--del_lnk--> Galatea, a moon just inward from the ring, are now believed to confine the arcs.<p>Several other rings were detected by the <i>Voyager</i> cameras. In addition to the narrow <!--del_lnk--> Adams Ring 63,000 km from the centre of Neptune, the <!--del_lnk--> Leverrier Ring is at 53,000 km and the broader, fainter <!--del_lnk--> Galle Ring is at 42,000 km. A faint outward extension to the Leverrier Ring has been named <!--del_lnk--> Lassell; it is bounded at its outer edge by the <!--del_lnk--> Arago Ring at 57,000 km.<p>New Earth-based observations announced in 2005 appeared to show that Neptune&#39;s rings are much more unstable than previously thought. In particular, it seems that the <i>Libert&eacute;</i> ring might disappear in as little as one century. The new observations appear to throw our understanding of Neptune&#39;s rings into considerable confusion.<center>

      <p>Neptune has 13 known <!--del_lnk--> moons. The largest by far, and the only one massive enough to be <!--del_lnk--> spheroidal, is <!--del_lnk--> Triton, discovered by <!--del_lnk--> William Lassell just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself. Unlike all other large planetary moons, Triton has a <!--del_lnk--> retrograde orbit, indicating that it was captured, and probably represents a large example of a <!--del_lnk--> Kuiper Belt object (although clearly no longer in the Kuiper Belt). It is close enough to Neptune to be locked into a <!--del_lnk--> synchronous orbit, and is slowly spiraling inward and eventually will be torn apart when it reaches the <a href="../../wp/r/Roche_limit.htm" title="Roche limit">Roche limit</a>. Triton is the coldest object that has been measured in the solar system, with temperatures of 38.15K (-235&deg;C, -392&deg;F).<center>

      <p>Neptune&#39;s second known satellite, the irregular moon <!--del_lnk--> Nereid, has one of the most eccentric orbits of any satellite in the solar system.<p>From July to September 1989, <i>Voyager 2</i> discovered six new Neptunian moons. Of these, the irregularly shaped <!--del_lnk--> Proteus is notable for being as large as a body of its density can be without being pulled into a spherical shape by its own gravity. Although the second most massive Neptunian moon, it is only one quarter of one percent of the mass of Triton. Neptune&#39;s innermost four moons, <!--del_lnk--> Naiad, <!--del_lnk--> Thalassa, <!--del_lnk--> Despina, and <!--del_lnk--> Galatea, orbit close enough to be within Neptune&#39;s rings. The next farthest out, <!--del_lnk--> Larissa was originally discovered in 1981 when it had occulted a star. This was attributed to ring arcs, but when <i>Voyager 2</i> observed Neptune in 1989, it was found to have been caused by the moon. Five new irregular moons discovered between 2002 and 2003 were announced in 2004.  As Neptune was the Roman god of the sea, the planet&#39;s moons have been named after lesser sea gods.<p><a id="Appearance_and_visibility_from_Earth" name="Appearance_and_visibility_from_Earth"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Appearance and visibility from Earth</span></h2>
      <p>Neptune is never visible with the <!--del_lnk--> naked eye. The brightness of Neptune is between <!--del_lnk--> magnitudes +7.7 and +8.0, so a telescope or binoculars are required to observe it. With the use of a telescope it appears as a small blue-green disk, similar in appearance to Uranus; the blue-green colour comes from the <!--del_lnk--> methane in its atmosphere. Its small apparent size has made it almost impossible to study visually; even observatory data was fairly poor until the advent of <!--del_lnk--> adaptive optics.<p>With an orbital period of 165 years, Neptune will soon return to the approximate position in the sky where <!--del_lnk--> Galle discovered it. This will happen three different times. These are <!--del_lnk--> April 11, <!--del_lnk--> 2009, when it will be in <!--del_lnk--> prograde motion; <!--del_lnk--> July 17, <!--del_lnk--> 2009, when it will be in <!--del_lnk--> retrograde motion; and finally for the last time for the next 165 years, on <!--del_lnk--> February 7, <!--del_lnk--> 2010. This is explained by the concept of <!--del_lnk--> retrogradation. Like all planets in the solar system beyond Earth, Neptune undergoes <!--del_lnk--> retrogradation at certain points during its <!--del_lnk--> synodic period. In addition to the start of retrogradation, other events within the synodic period include <!--del_lnk--> astronomical opposition, the return to <!--del_lnk--> prograde motion, and <!--del_lnk--> conjunction to the Sun.<p>In its orbit around the Sun, Neptune will return to its original point of discovery in August 2011.<p><a id="Voyager_flyby" name="Voyager_flyby"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Voyager flyby</span></h2>
