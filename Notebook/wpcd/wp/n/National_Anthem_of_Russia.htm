The lyrics were revised for the anthem of the Russian Federation by <!--del_lnk--> Sergey Mikhalkov, who had supplied lyrics for versions of the Soviet anthem in 1943 and 1977.

Before and after the adoption of the new anthem, <!--del_lnk--> liberal groups raised concerns that the re-adoption of the Soviet anthem was returning Russia to the Soviet era.<p>

      <p>Before <i><!--del_lnk--> Molitva russkikh</i> (The Prayer of the Russians) was chosen to be the national anthem of <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Russia, various church hymns and military marches were used to honour the country and the Tsar. <i>Molitva russkikh</i> was adopted around 1815, and used lyrics by <!--del_lnk--> Vasily Zhukovsky set to the music of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> anthem, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> God Save the King&quot;.<p>In 1833, Zhukovsky was asked again to write lyrics to a musical composition by <!--del_lnk--> Alexei Fyodorovich Lvov called <i>The Russian People&#39;s Prayer</i>. It was well received by <!--del_lnk--> Nicholas I who chose the song, known more commonly as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> God Save the Tsar&quot;, to be the next anthem. The song sounded very much like a religious hymn, and its musical style was similar to that of the other anthems used by European monarchs. &quot;God Save the Tsar&quot; was used until the <!--del_lnk--> February Revolution, when the Russian monarchy was overthrown. The tune is in several English-language hymnals with words beginning &quot;God the Omnipotent! King who ordainest/Thunder thy clarion, lightning thy throne!&quot; (or variants).<p>Upon the removal of the Tsar and his family in March <!--del_lnk--> 1917, the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Worker&rsquo;s Marseillaise</i>, a modification of the <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> anthem <!--del_lnk--> La Marseillaise by Pyotr Lavrov, was used as an unofficial anthem by the provisional government. Written in 1875, its use as anthem was short-lived. After the provisional government had been overthrown by the Bolsheviks in the <!--del_lnk--> 1917 October Revolution, the anthem of international revolutionary socialism, <i><!--del_lnk--> L&#39;Internationale</i> (normally called in English &quot;The Internationale&quot;), was adopted as the new anthem. Eug&egrave;ne Pottier, another French national, wrote the lyrics to this song, and the music was furnished by Pierre Degeyter, a <a href="../../wp/b/Belgium.htm" title="Belgium">Belgian</a> composer. Translated into Russian by Arkadiy Yakovlevich Kots in 1902, The Internationale was used as the anthem of <!--del_lnk--> Bolshevik Russia from 1918, and adopted by the newly-created <!--del_lnk--> Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1922, to be used until 1944.<p><a id="Music" name="Music"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Music</span></h2>
      <p>The music of the national anthem, created by Alexandrov, had been used in several hymns and compositions before its use in the Russian anthem. The first time the music was used was in the Hymn of the <!--del_lnk--> Bolshevik Party, created in 1938. When the <!--del_lnk--> Comintern was dissolved in 1943 it was felt that the Internationale, which was historically intimately associated with the Comintern, should be replaced as the <!--del_lnk--> National Anthem of the Soviet Union. Alexandrov&#39;s music was chosen for that purpose in 1944 by the Soviet leader <a href="../../wp/j/Joseph_Stalin.htm" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>. Before Alexandrov created the Bolshevik hymn, he first used pieces of the music in the song <!--del_lnk--> Zhit&#39; stalo luchshe (Life has become better).<p>During the 2000 anthem debate, it was discussed in the newspaper <!--del_lnk--> Lenta.ru that the music Alexandrov created for the Soviet hymn was similar to <!--del_lnk--> Vasily Kalinnikov&#39;s 1892 overture <!--del_lnk--> Bylina. The supporters of the Soviet anthem used this fact in the various debates that took place in the <!--del_lnk--> Duma about the anthem change. There is no evidence that Alexandrov deliberately borrowed or used parts of <i>Bylina</i> in his composition.<p><a id="Lyrics" name="Lyrics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Lyrics</span></h2>

       <div style="width:152px;"><a class="internal" href="../../images/267/26716.jpg.htm" title="Sergey Mikhalkov, who wrote the anthem lyrics"><img alt="Sergey Mikhalkov, who wrote the anthem lyrics" height="210" longdesc="/wiki/Image:Sergey_Mikhalkov_May_2005.jpg" src="../../images/267/26716.jpg" width="150" /></a><div class="thumbcaption"><!--del_lnk--> Sergey Mikhalkov, who wrote the anthem lyrics</div>
       </div>
      </div>
      <p>In 1943, Mikhalkov and <!--del_lnk--> G. El-Registan completed the task of writing the lyrics, which were approved a year later by <a href="../../wp/j/Joseph_Stalin.htm" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>, the Soviet leader. It was stated that Stalin himself edited parts of the lyrics before approving the anthem <!--del_lnk--> . Upon the death of Stalin in 1953, the lyrics composed by Mikhalkov and El-Registan were discarded during the process of <!--del_lnk--> destalinization by the government and continued to be used without any official lyrics. Mikhalkov wrote a set of new lyrics in 1970, but they were not submitted to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet until <!--del_lnk--> 27 May <!--del_lnk--> 1977. The new lyrics, which replaced any mentions of Stalin, were approved on <!--del_lnk--> 1 September and were made official with the printing of the new <!--del_lnk--> Soviet Constitution in October of 1977. These lyrics were used until 1991, when the Soviet Union <!--del_lnk--> separated into fifteen nation-states.<p>From 1991 through 2000, people sent more than 6,000 proposed versions of lyrics to the committee on the national anthem. Although most of the entries used Glinka&#39;s music, some of them were set to Alexandrov&#39;s music and to other tunes. In 2000, the <!--del_lnk--> Kremlin and President Putin first decided that Alexandrov&#39;s music was to be preferred, then picked the lyrics written by Mikhalkov out of the contest entries, and worked closely with Mikhalkov rewriting parts of his lyrics until the final version was produced. Before the official adoption of the anthem, the Kremlin released a section of the anthem, which made a reference to the <!--del_lnk--> flag and <!--del_lnk--> arms:<dl>
       <dd>Its mighty wings spread above us<dd>The Russian eagle is hovering high<dd>The Fatherland&rsquo;s tricolor symbol<dd>Is leading Russia&rsquo;s peoples to victory<i></i></dl>
      <p>When the final changes to the lyrics were being made in December of 2000, the above section was not included. The new lyrics refer to the Russian homeland, spacious and grand, that is being entrusted to all generations by God. This is a complete change from the Soviet anthem lyrics, which speak highly of Lenin, <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">communism</a>, and pledge a &quot;union of freeborn republics&quot; will stand forever, united.<p><a id="Modern_adoption" name="Modern_adoption"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Modern adoption</span></h2>
      <p>Before 2000, there were efforts to refine &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The Patriotic Song&quot;, the Russian anthem adopted in 1991 by then President <!--del_lnk--> Boris Yeltsin after the <!--del_lnk--> collapse of the Soviet Union. The main problem with the anthem, composed by <!--del_lnk--> Mikhail Glinka, was that it did not have any lyrics. Various attempts were made to compose lyrics for the anthem, including the 1990 composition of Viktor Radugin&#39;s <i>Be glorious, Russia</i> (&#x421;&#x43B;&#x430;&#x432;&#x44C;&#x441;&#x44F;, &#x420;&#x43E;&#x441;&#x441;&#x438;&#x44F;! (&quot;Slavsya, Rossiya!), but none were adopted by Yeltsin.<p>The anthem debate picked up momentum in October of 2000 when Yeltsin&#39;s successor <!--del_lnk--> Vladimir Putin commented that Russian athletes were silent when the <i>Patriotic Song</i> was played during the <!--del_lnk--> gold medal ceremonies at the <!--del_lnk--> 2000 Summer Olympic Games. <!--del_lnk--> CNN also reported that players of the <a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Football (soccer)">football</a> club <!--del_lnk--> Spartak Moscow complained that the wordless anthem &quot;affected their morale and performance&quot;. Putin pressed for the former Soviet anthem to be selected as the new Russian anthem, but strongly suggested that new lyrics were to be written. The <!--del_lnk--> Duma voted 371-51-1 on <!--del_lnk--> 8 December <!--del_lnk--> 2000 to adopt the Soviet anthem and the new lyrics, written by Mikhalkov. Being signed into law by President Putin on <!--del_lnk--> 20 December, the new anthem was first used officially on <!--del_lnk--> 30 December during a ceremony at the <!--del_lnk--> Great Kremlin Palace in Moscow.<p>Not everyone agreed with the adoption&mdash;Yeltsin said that Putin should not have changed the anthem merely to &quot;follow blindly the mood of the people&quot;. The liberal political party <!--del_lnk--> Yabloko stated that the re-adoption of the Soviet anthem &quot;deepened the schism in [Russian] society&quot;. The re-adoption of the Soviet anthem was supported by the <!--del_lnk--> Communist Party and by Putin himself. Those who opposed the Alexandrov music attempted to not only keep the Patriotic Song, but also to have the Duma vote on the Tsarist military march, <i><!--del_lnk--> Farewell of Slavianka</i>. One of the most famous Russian dissident writers <!--del_lnk--> Vladimir Voinovich even wrote a <!--del_lnk--> parody of the anthem as a sort of his proposal for the new anthem, showing Voinovich&#39;s disagreement with frequent changing of the state symbols.  <!--del_lnk--> Sergei Yushenkov, a member of Duma, even suggested that this proposal should be considered and voted by the members of the Russian Parliament, but his proposal was refused.<p><a id="Regulations" name="Regulations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Regulations</span></h2>

      <p>While it is the choice of the performer to execute the anthem using only music, only words or a combination of both, it must be performed using the official lyrics and music provided by law. After the performance is recorded, it can be used for any purpose, such as a radio or television broadcast. The anthem can be played during solemn or celebratory occasions, but it is required to be played at the swearing-in of the <!--del_lnk--> President of Russia, opening and closing sessions of the Duma and the <!--del_lnk--> Federation Council, and official state ceremonies. The anthem is also played on television and radio before the start and closing of programming or if the programming is continuous, the anthem is played at 2400 and 0600 <!--del_lnk--> hours. The anthem is also played at sporting events both in Russia and abroad, but according to the protocol of the organization that is hosting the games. When the anthem is played, all men&#39;s and women&#39;s headgear must be removed and people must face the Russian flag, if it is present. Those who are in uniform must give a military salute when the anthem plays.<p>According to the Russian <!--del_lnk--> Law on Copyright and Neighbouring Rights, state symbols are not protected by copyright. Thus, the anthem music and lyrics can be used and modified freely. Although the Russian Anthem Law suggests accountability for performing the anthem in a way that could cause offense and disrespect, no provisions in the other laws have been made yet that would define such acts and set a penalty.<p>On one occasion, Putin chastised the <!--del_lnk--> national soccer team in the summer of 2004 about the team&#39;s behaviour during the playing of the anthem. Before the start of tournament matches in the <!--del_lnk--> 2004 European Football Championship tournament, the team was caught on camera chewing gum during the playing of the Russian anthem. Putin, using Leonid Tyagachyov, the head of the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Olympic Committee as his messenger, told the team to stop chewing gum and sing the anthem. This message was delivered after the Russian team lost to <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> during the tournament.<p><a id="Official_lyrics" name="Official_lyrics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Official lyrics</span></h2>
