      <p>In the aftermath of the <!--del_lnk--> Japanese occupation of Korea which ended with Japan&#39;s defeat in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> in 1945, Korea was <!--del_lnk--> divided in two, with the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> controlling the area north of the <!--del_lnk--> 38th parallel and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> in control south of the 38th parallel. The Korean people were not consulted by either power prior to this division. While virtually all Koreans welcomed liberation from Japanese imperial rule, they objected to the re-imposition of foreign rule over the peninsula. The Soviets and Americans were unable to agree on the implementation of Joint Trusteeship over Korea. This led in 1948 to the establishment of separate governments in the north and south, each claiming to be the legitimate government of all of Korea.<p>Growing tensions between the governments in the north and south and border skirmishes eventually led to a civil war called the <!--del_lnk--> Korean War. On <!--del_lnk--> June 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1950, the <!--del_lnk--> (North) Korean People&#39;s Army attacked across the 38th Parallel in a move to reunify the peninsula under their political system. The war continued until <!--del_lnk--> July 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1953, when the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> Command, the Korean People&#39;s Army, and the <!--del_lnk--> Chinese People&#39;s Volunteers signed the Korean War Armistice Agreement. The <!--del_lnk--> Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) has separated the North and South ever since.<p>North Korea was led by <!--del_lnk--> Kim Il-sung from 1948 until his death on <!--del_lnk--> July 8, <!--del_lnk--> 1994. He delegated most domestic matters to his son, <!--del_lnk--> Kim Jong-il, toward the end of his life. Three years after his father&#39;s death, on <!--del_lnk--> October 8, <!--del_lnk--> 1997, Kim Jong-il was named <!--del_lnk--> General Secretary of the Korean Workers&#39; Party. In 1998, the legislature reconfirmed him as <!--del_lnk--> Chairman of the National Defence Commission and declared that position as the &quot;highest office of state&quot;. International relations generally improved, and there was a historic North-South summit between the two Koreas in June 2000. However, tensions with the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> have increased since that time as North Korea resumed its <!--del_lnk--> nuclear weapons program. Following <!--del_lnk--> a series of missile tests in July 2006 and a <!--del_lnk--> nuclear test in October 2006, the United Nations imposed sanctions on North Korea. On October 31, 2006, however, the country agreed to return to six-party talks.<p>In the aftermath of the Korean War and throughout the 1960s and 70s, the country&#39;s economy grew at a significant rate and, until the late 1970s, was considered to be stronger than that in the South. However, under <!--del_lnk--> Kim Jong-il&#39;s rule in the mid-to-late 1990s, the country&#39;s economy declined significantly, and food shortages developed in many areas. According to aid groups, millions of people in rural areas starved to death due to <a href="../../wp/f/Famine.htm" title="Famine">famine</a>, exacerbated by a collapse in the food distribution system and lack of support from former communist-bloc countries.  Large numbers of North Koreans illegally entered the People&#39;s Republic of China in search of food. The only direct challenge by its people against the North Korean government took place in 1995 in <!--del_lnk--> Hamh&#x16D;ng, a city in the <!--del_lnk--> South Hamgyong province. Famine-starved soldiers attempted to march onto the capital, <a href="../../wp/p/Pyongyang.htm" title="Pyongyang">Pyongyang</a>. The revolt was quelled, though, and the unit shortly thereafter disbanded. <!--del_lnk--> Hwang Jang-yop, International Secretary of the Korean Workers&#39; Party, defected to South Korea in 1997. The food situation has somewhat improved in recent years, due in part to small-scale market reforms and private ownership.<p>In August 2006, the DPRK declared the <!--del_lnk--> armistice that ended the 1950-1953 Korean War &quot;null and void.&quot;<p><a id="Politics_and_government" name="Politics_and_government"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Politics and government</span></h2>
      <p>The Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea (North Korea) is one of the few remaining <!--del_lnk--> Communist states. The government is dominated by the <!--del_lnk--> Korean Workers&#39; Party (KWP), to which 80 percent of government officials belong. The official ideology of the KWP is known as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Juche&quot; (self-reliance), a political philosophy first developed by Kim Il-Sung and then expanded upon by his son, the current leader of the DPRK, Kim Jong-il. Although the KWP replaced mentions of <!--del_lnk--> Marxism-Leninism in the North Korean constitution with Juche in 1977, the constitution retains mentions of <a href="../../wp/s/Socialism.htm" title="Socialism">Socialism</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">Communism</a> and Kim Jong-il and the Korean Workers Party continue to claim to be Marxist-Leninist. Many <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">Communists</a> outside North Korea deny that the KWP is still a communist organisation or that North Korea is still a socialist regime. Minor <!--del_lnk--> political parties also participate in elections, although in practice present no opposition. The exact power structure of the country is debated by outside observers. North Korea has been characterized by a professor at the American <!--del_lnk--> Strategic Studies Institute as &quot;highly repressive, heavily militarized, strongly resistant to reform, and ruled by a <!--del_lnk--> dynastic <!--del_lnk--> dictatorship that adheres to a hybrid ideology. While distinctive, North Korea is an orthodox communist party-state best classified as an eroding <!--del_lnk--> totalitarian regime.&quot;<p>The Premier is the head of government, although many observers consider that effective power lies with <!--del_lnk--> Kim Jong-il, head of the KWP and the military. Kim holds several official titles, the most important being <!--del_lnk--> General Secretary of the Workers&#39; Party of Korea, Chairman of the National Defense Commission, and Supreme Commander of the Korean People&#39;s Army. Kim is not the Head of State or the Head of Government, positions held by <!--del_lnk--> Kim Yong Nam and <!--del_lnk--> Pak Pong-ju respectively. Kim Jong-il is accorded the honorific &quot;Great Leader&quot; as part of a <!--del_lnk--> personality cult and is referred to as such by some of his western supporters. The phrase &quot;Dear Leader&quot; was formerly used for Kim Jong-il.<p>In English-language news sources from North Korea, the term &quot;Great Leader&quot; is very rarely used except when quoting someone referring to him affectionately as such (&quot;<!--del_lnk--> comrade&quot; and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> general secretary&quot; are used more frequently).<!--del_lnk-->  Kim Jong Il&#39;s western supporters in the <!--del_lnk--> Korean Friendship Association however, frequently refer to Kim Jong Il as &quot;Dear Leader&quot; or &quot;Great Leader.&quot;&nbsp;<p>The <!--del_lnk--> 1998 constitution refers to the late <!--del_lnk--> Kim Il-sung as the &quot;Eternal President of the Republic,&quot; as the post of president was abolished after his death. The constitution gives many of the functions normally accorded to a <!--del_lnk--> head of state to the <!--del_lnk--> Supreme People&#39;s Assembly Presidium, whose president, currently Kim Yong Nam (no relation to Kim Jong Il) &quot;represents the State&quot; and receives credentials from foreign ambassadors. The government of the republic is led by the Prime Minister, currently Pak Pong-ju and a <!--del_lnk--> cabinet called the Central People&#39;s Committee (CPC), the government&#39;s top policymaking body. The CPC is headed by the President, a post which was abolished after Kim Il-sung&#39;s death, who also nominates the other committee members. The <!--del_lnk--> CPC makes policy decisions and supervises the Cabinet, or State Administration Council (SAC). The <!--del_lnk--> SAC is headed by a Premier and is the dominant administrative and <!--del_lnk--> executive agency.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> parliament, the Supreme People&#39;s Assembly (<i>Choego Inmin Hoeui</i>), is the highest organ of state power. Its 687 members are elected every five years by popular vote. In every district voters are offered only one candidate. The People&#39;s Assembly usually holds two annual meetings, each lasting a few days, during which it elects a standing committee. The Assembly is viewed by the West as <!--del_lnk--> simply ratifying decisions made by the ruling KWP. A standing committee elected by the Assembly performs <!--del_lnk--> legislative functions when the Assembly is not in session.<p><a id="Foreign_relations" name="Foreign_relations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Foreign relations</span></h2>

      <p>The foreign relations of the DPRK with the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> are often regarded as relatively tense and unpredictable. Since the cease fire of the <!--del_lnk--> Korean War in 1953, the North Korean government has been at odds with the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/South_Korea.htm" title="South Korea">South Korea</a>, with which it is still technically at war. Since 2000 its relations with the US have greatly deteriorated, and it was called a part of the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> axis of evil&quot; and an &quot;<!--del_lnk--> outpost of tyranny&quot; by US President <a href="../../wp/g/George_W._Bush.htm" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> stating &quot;States like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred.

      <p>According to Western estimates&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> , North Korea has the fifth-largest <!--del_lnk--> military in the world, with the largest percentage of citizens enlisted (49.03 active troops per thousand citizens). The North has an estimated 1.08 million armed personnel, compared with about 686,000 <a href="../../wp/s/South_Korea.htm" title="South Korea">South Korean</a> troops (and 3.5 million paramilitary forces) plus 29,000 US troops in South Korea. Annual military spending is about $5 billion <!--del_lnk--> USD. There is a fairly efficient, albeit technologically obsolete, weapons and munitions industry. The North has perhaps the world&#39;s second-largest special operations force (roughly 110,000), designed for insertion and sabotage behind enemy lines in wartime. While the North has an adequate fleet of <!--del_lnk--> submarines and small vessels, its main surface fleet has a very limited capability.<p><a id="Air_force" name="Air_force"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Air force</span></h3>
      <p>As of <!--del_lnk--> 1992, the <!--del_lnk--> North Korean Air Force comprised about 1,620 aircraft and 70,000 personnel, with roughly twice the number of aircraft as the South. Most of its aircraft are obsolete Soviet models and Chinese copies, but it has been modernizing since the 1980s. Aircraft holdings include 190 <!--del_lnk--> MiG-21s, thirty <!--del_lnk--> MiG-29s, sixty <!--del_lnk--> MiG-23s, forty <!--del_lnk--> Q-5 Fantans, plus an additional 250 or so of older <!--del_lnk--> MiG-19s, <!--del_lnk--> MiG-17s and <!--del_lnk--> Su-7s. Since the 1980s, the air force has expanded its inventory of helicopters from 40 to 275. This inventory includes <!--del_lnk--> Mi-24s, <!--del_lnk--> Mi-2s, <!--del_lnk--> Mi-4s, and <!--del_lnk--> Mi-8s. In <!--del_lnk--> 1985, the DPRK circumvented U.S. export controls to buy eighty-seven U.S.-manufactured civilian <!--del_lnk--> Hughes H-6 model helicopters, which are more advanced than the Russian models and have probably been armed with guns and rockets. North Korea does not manufacture its own aircraft, but it does produce spare parts. The air defense is also equipped with old Soviet <!--del_lnk--> SAMs, including many batteries of <!--del_lnk--> SA-2s, <!--del_lnk--> SA-3s and <!--del_lnk--> SA-5s. The overall assessment is that the air force <i>&quot;has a marginal capability for defending North Korean airspace and a limited ability to conduct air operations against South Korea.&quot;</i><p><a id="Missiles" name="Missiles"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Missiles</span></h3>
      <p>It also has a certain quantity of <!--del_lnk--> Rodong-1 and <!--del_lnk--> 2, <!--del_lnk--> Scud, and the long-range <!--del_lnk--> Taepodong-1 and <!--del_lnk--> 2 missiles, the second of which has a range of up to 6,000 kilometers, although it is doubtful that the latter type is in full service yet. It has test-fired each of these missiles more than once, despite the <!--del_lnk--> Six-party talks, initiated in 2003. On <!--del_lnk--> July 5, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, North Korea conducted a series of seven test launches , including short-range <!--del_lnk--> Nodong-2 <!--del_lnk--> missiles and one long-range intercontinental <!--del_lnk--> Taepodong-2 missile. During the <!--del_lnk--> July 5, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, launches, the <!--del_lnk--> Taepodong-2 missile failed within 2 minutes of lift-off and crashed into the ocean.

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> October 9, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, North Korea announced that it had conducted its first nuclear test, which was confirmed by the United States on October 16, 2006.. The blast was less than one kiloton, smaller than expected, and U.S. officials initially suggested that it may have been an unsuccessful test or a partially successful <!--del_lnk--> fizzle (for yield comparisons, see <!--del_lnk--> Nuclear artillery). China was given twenty minutes&#39; notice of the test; it subsequently warned Japan, Russia, and the United States. The seismic strength of the test was reported slightly differently by two agencies; the <!--del_lnk--> United States Geological Survey measured it as 4.2 on the <!--del_lnk--> Richter scale, while South Korean scientists placed it as 3.58.

      <p>The Six-party talks have been the diplomatic route used to resolve the concern brought about by North Korea&#39;s nuclear weapons program. These talks are a series of meetings with six participating states (the People&#39;s Republic of China, South Korea, North Korea, the United States of America, the Russian Federation and Japan) and were a result of North Korea withdrawing from the <!--del_lnk--> Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003. The aim of these talks is to find a peaceful resolution to the security concerns raised by the North Korean nuclear weapons program.<p>According to <!--del_lnk--> Richard Saccone, an expert on Korea, in April 2006: &quot;After decades of hostile exchanges and months of stalled negotiations about its nuclear weapons, North Korea quietly put forward a positive signal that it is prepared to talk.&quot;&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> <p>North Korea is not a signatory of the <!--del_lnk--> Missile Technology Control Regime and states that it has the <!--del_lnk--> sovereign right to test its missiles and pursue its weapons program. The DPRK&#39;s stance on the <!--del_lnk--> 2002 Pyongyang Declaration with Japan is that the agreement is now void due to Japan&#39;s failure to normalize relations with the regime. US sanctions following the six-party talks are also cited by North Korea as a reason to continue missile tests and other aspects of its weapons program.<!--del_lnk--> <p>North Korea announced on <!--del_lnk--> October 3, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, that it was going to test its first nuclear weapon regardless of the world situation, blaming &quot;hostile US policy&quot; as the reason for the need for such a deterrent. However, it pledged a no-first-strike policy and to nuclear disarmament only when there is worldwide elimination of such nuclear weapons. On <!--del_lnk--> October 9, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, the state claimed to have conducted its first underground nuclear test successfully. The response from the international community was for the most part condemnation. The UN and NATO quickly held meetings to decide how to react to this situation, and North Korea has since stated that any sanctions imposed upon them will be viewed as an &#39;act of war&#39;. While many analysts continue to stress the importance of China as a principal actor in resolving the nuclear stand-off with North Korea, some have parted with that analysis and suggested China has consistently failed to exercise influence over the regime.<!--del_lnk--> <p>On <!--del_lnk--> November 3, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, North Korea confirmed it would return to six-nation nuclear disarmament talks after a year-long boycott. The chief US envoy stressed that the world needed to see progress at the next round. North Korea apparently came to this decision on the premise that the issue of lifting financial sanctions will be discussed and settled between North Korea and the United States. World leaders welcomed its decision to rejoin the talks, which it had boycotted since <!--del_lnk--> November 2005 in protest at US financial sanctions, but the breakthrough was also accompanied by some scepticism.<!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Human_rights" name="Human_rights"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Human rights</span></h2>

      <p>North Korea&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> socialist <a href="../../wp/e/Economics.htm" title="Economics">economy</a> has been relatively stagnant since the 1970s. Publicly owned industry produces nearly all manufactured goods. The government focuses on heavy military industry, with an estimated 13% of the nation&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> GDP being spent on the military <!--del_lnk--> as of 2005. <!--del_lnk-->  By comparison, neighbouring South Korea spent 2.5% on its military (in addition to the 30,000 American soldiers stationed there ). The government does not release economic data.<p>In the 1990s, North Korea faced significant economic disruptions, including a series of natural disasters, political mismanagement, serious <a href="../../wp/f/Fertilizer.htm" title="Fertilizer">fertilizer</a> shortages, and the collapse of the <!--del_lnk--> Soviet bloc. These resulted in a shortfall of staple <a href="../../wp/c/Cereal.htm" title="Cereal">grain</a> output of more than 1 million tons from what the country needs to meet internationally-accepted minimum requirements. <!--del_lnk-->  The <!--del_lnk--> resulting famine killed between 600,000 and 3.5 million people in the DPRK during the 1990s. <!--del_lnk-->  By 1999, <!--del_lnk--> foreign aid reduced the number of famine deaths, but <!--del_lnk--> North Korea&#39;s continuing nuclear program led to a decline in international food and development aid. In the spring of 2005, the World Food Program reported that famine conditions were in imminent danger of returning to North Korea, and the government was reported to have mobilized millions of city-dwellers to help rice farmers.<!--del_lnk-->  <!--del_lnk-->  Approximately 92% of 577,000 tons of food aid donated by China in 2005 was to North Korea, making up 49% of the food aid North Korea receives. South Korea was the second biggest donor to North Korea in 2005, contributing 36% on top of China&#39;s 49%. In spite of these donations over 22 percent of the population of North Korea is classified as <!--del_lnk--> malnourished and recent evidence suggests serious food shortages continue.<!--del_lnk--> <p>North Korea has previously received international food and fuel aid from China, South Korea, and the United States in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear program.
