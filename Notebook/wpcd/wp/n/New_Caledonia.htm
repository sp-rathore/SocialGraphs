      <p>The name <i><!--del_lnk--> Caledonia</i> derives from the <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> name of an area corresponding to modern <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>. The name <i>Kanaky</i> is also in common usage in French, English and the indigenous languages. This name is favored by <!--del_lnk--> Melanesian nationalists. The word comes from <i>kanaka</i>, a <!--del_lnk--> Polynesian word meaning <i>human</i> used by Polynesians to call themselves. The word was later used by the French to call all the native inhabitants of the South Pacific Ocean, including the Melanesian (non-Polynesian) native inhabitants of New Caledonia. The word, turned into <i>Canaque</i> in French, became derogative. In the 1960s and 1970s, when the Melanesian native inhabitants started to organize themselves into political parties and ask for independence, this derogative word was turned into a symbol of political emancipation and pride. In 1983, during the period of political turmoil, the terms KANAK and KANAKY became political brand names and Caucasians (<!--del_lnk--> Caldoches) realized the name had changed into a political statement.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>New Caledonia is located around <span class="plainlinksneverexpand"><!--del_lnk--> 21&deg;30&prime;S 165&deg;30&prime;E</span> in the southwest <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>, approximately 1,200 kilometres (746&nbsp;mi) east of <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a> and 1,500 kilometres (932&nbsp;mi) northwest of <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>. The island nation of <a href="../../wp/v/Vanuatu.htm" title="Vanuatu">Vanuatu</a> lies to the northeast.<p>New Caledonia is made up of a main island, the <b>Grande Terre</b>, and several smaller islands, the <!--del_lnk--> Belep archipelago to the north of the Grande Terre, the <!--del_lnk--> Loyalty Islands to the east of the Grande Terre, the <!--del_lnk--> &Icirc;le des Pins to the south of the Grande Terre, the <!--del_lnk--> Chesterfield Islands and <!--del_lnk--> Bellona Reefs further to the west.<p>The Grande Terre is by far the largest of the islands, and the only mountainous island. It has an area of 16,372 square kilometres (6,321&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), and is elongated northwest-southeast, 350 kilometres (217&nbsp;mi) in length and 50 to 70 kilometres (31&ndash;44&nbsp;mi) wide. A mountain range runs the length of the island, with five peaks over 1,500 meters (4,900&nbsp;ft). The highest point is Mont Pani&eacute; at 1,628 meters (5,341&nbsp;ft) elevation . The total area of New Caledonia is 19,060 square kilometres, 18,575 square kilometres of those being land.<p>New Caledonian soils contain a considerable wealth of industrially-significant elements and minerals, including about one-quarter of the world&#39;s <a href="../../wp/n/Nickel.htm" title="Nickel">nickel</a> resources. Mining is therefore a significant industry that greatly benefits the national economy. However, the country is also home to numerous, critically-important ancient ecosystems. Thus, widely-practiced and indiscriminate <!--del_lnk--> open-pit mining across much of New Caledonia, has been (and continues to be) responsible for severe deterioration of the nation&#39;s irreplaceable natural heritage.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>

      <p>New Caledonia lies astride the <!--del_lnk--> Tropic of Capricorn, between 19&deg; and 23&deg; south latitude. The climate of the islands is <!--del_lnk--> tropical, and rainfall is highly seasonal, brought by trade winds that usually come from the east. Rainfall averages about 1,500 millimetres (59&nbsp;in) yearly on the Loyalty Islands, 2,000 millimetres (79&nbsp;in) at low elevations on eastern the Grande Terre, and 2,000-4,000 millimetres (79&ndash;157.5&nbsp;in) at high elevations on the Grande Terre. The western side of the Grande Terre lies in the <!--del_lnk--> rain shadow of the central mountains, and rainfall averages 1,200 millimetres (47&nbsp;in) per year.<p><a id="Ecology" name="Ecology"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Ecology</span></h3>
      <p>New Caledonia is considered one of the world&#39;s most botanically-important, and critically endangered hotspots. Unlike many of the Pacific Islands which are of relatively recent volcanic origin, New Caledonia is an ancient fragment of the <!--del_lnk--> Gondwana super-continent. New Caledonia and New Zealand separated from Australia 85 million years ago, and from one another 55 million years ago. This isolated New Caledonia from the rest of the world&#39;s landmasses, and made it a Noah&#39;s Ark of sorts, preserving a snapshot of what the ancient forests of <!--del_lnk--> Gondwana looked like, millions of years ago. The country still shelters an extraordinary diversity of unique, <!--del_lnk--> endemic, and extremely primitive plants and animals of Gondwanan origin. For more information on the significance of this country&#39;s flora and fauna, as well as the dangers it faces, and its effects on national social, economic, and political life, see <!--del_lnk--> Biodiversity of New Caledonia and <!--del_lnk--> Endemic Birds of New Caledonia.<p>Although the majority of the country&#39;s citizens are unaware of the extraordinary nature of their country&#39;s biological patrimony, a few of the country&#39;s animals and plants have become somewhat emblematic in local culture. Among the best known, is a hen-sized, flightless bird, commonly-known as the Cagou or <!--del_lnk--> Kagu, which has a large crest and an odd cooing call. Its song and image are frequently seen as nationally-recognized icons. Another frequently used cultural emblem is the Columnar or Cook&#39;s Pine <i>(Araucaria columnaris)</i>, an important symbol in <!--del_lnk--> Kanak culture. The <!--del_lnk--> Niaouli tree (also native to <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a> and <!--del_lnk--> New Guinea), is of medicinal interest, locally and abroad. Its sap (which contains Gomenol, a camphor-smelling compound), is used to treat head colds, and as an antiseptic. It also shows potential to treat other medical ailments. Before the Europeans arrived, there was no mammal other than the Roussette (aka flying fox), a large vegetarian <!--del_lnk--> bat, considered a local delicacy. Less well-known by the local population, is the fact their country is home to a species of plant, <i>(<!--del_lnk--> Amborella trichopoda)</i>, believed to be genetically close to the ancestor of all flowering plants, or the fact their nation boasts the largest number and diversity of conifer species in the world, per geographic area (a remarkable fact, given that conifers are usually relatively rare in tropical regions).<p>The islands contain two precipitation zones: Higher-rainfall areas (located on the Loyalty Islands, Isle of Pines (&Icirc;le des Pins), and on the eastern side of Grand Terre) which support <!--del_lnk--> New Caledonia rain forests, and a more arid region, home to the now exceedingly-endangered <!--del_lnk--> New Caledonia dry forests, located in the rain shadow on the western side of Grand Terre. Europeans settled on the dry west coast of Grand Terre, leaving the east (as well as the Loyalty Islands and the Isle of Pines) to the Kanaks, and resulting in an ethno-cultural division which coincides with the natural one. Extensive farming by Europeans in the dry forest areas, has caused these forest ecosystems to virtually disappear.<p>It is a vast oversimplification, however, to merely describe New Caledonia&#39;s extremely important, complex and diverse ecology in terms of precipitation zones. Species and ecological diversity is further complicated by soil type (degree and type of mineralization), altitude, and geographic location (for instance, Loyalty Islands and Isle of Pines have flora that is distinct from Grand Terre).<p>In addition to the remarkable terrestrial environment of New Caledonia, the country is also home to important aquatic ecosystems. Its freshwater ecology also evolved in long isolation, and the <!--del_lnk--> New Caledonia rivers and streams are home to many endemic species. Moreover, the <!--del_lnk--> New Caledonia Barrier Reef, which surrounds Grande Terre and the Isle of Pines (&Icirc;le des Pins), is the second-largest <!--del_lnk--> coral reef in the world after Australia&#39;s <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Barrier_Reef.htm" title="Great Barrier Reef">Great Barrier Reef</a>, reaching a length of 1,500 kilometres (930&nbsp;mi). Like its terrestrial counterpart, the Caledonian reef system has great species diversity, is home to endangered <!--del_lnk--> dugongs <i>(Dugong dugon)</i>, and is an important nesting site for the <!--del_lnk--> Green Sea Turtle <i>(Chelonia mydas)</i>. The <!--del_lnk--> Nautilus is a living-fossil species, once common during the age of the dinosaurs, and survives today in the waters surrounding New Caledonia.<p><a id="Administration" name="Administration"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Administration</span></h2>

It is further subdivided into thirty-three <!--del_lnk--> communes.<p>In addition, a parallel layer of administration exists for Kanak tribal affairs; these are called <i>aires coutumi&egrave;res</i> (&quot;traditional spheres&quot;) and are eight in number (<!--del_lnk--> see map of the &quot;aires coutumi&egrave;res&quot;). Their jurisdiction does not encompass non-Kanaks living within these zones.

      <p>The western <!--del_lnk--> Pacific was first populated about 50,000 years ago. The Austronesians moved into the area later. The diverse group of people that settled over the <!--del_lnk--> Melanesian <!--del_lnk--> archipelagos are known as the <!--del_lnk--> Lapita. They arrived in the <!--del_lnk--> archipelago now commonly known as New Caledonia and the <!--del_lnk--> Loyalty Islands around 1500 BC. The <!--del_lnk--> Lapita were highly skilled navigators and agriculturists with influence over a large area of the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific.<p>From about the 11th century Polynesians also arrived and mixed with the populations of the archipelago.<p>Europeans first sighted New Caledonia and the Loyalty Islands in the late 18th century. The British explorer <a href="../../wp/j/James_Cook.htm" title="James Cook">James Cook</a> sighted <!--del_lnk--> Grande Terre in 1774 and named it <i>New Caledonia</i>. Caledonia being the Latin name for Scotland. During the same voyage he also named the islands to the North of New Caledonia the <!--del_lnk--> New Hebrides.<p>British and North American <!--del_lnk--> whalers and <!--del_lnk--> sandalwood traders became interested in New Caledonia and tensions developed as their approach became increasingly dishonest (an arrogant attitude and cheating became commonplace). Europeans used <!--del_lnk--> alcohol and <a href="../../wp/t/Tobacco.htm" title="Tobacco">tobacco</a> amongst other things to <!--del_lnk--> barter for commodities. Contact with Europeans brought new diseases such as <a href="../../wp/s/Smallpox.htm" title="Smallpox">smallpox</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Measles.htm" title="Measles">measles</a>, <!--del_lnk--> dysentery, <!--del_lnk--> influenza, <!--del_lnk--> syphilis and <!--del_lnk--> leprosy. Many people died as a result of these diseases. Tensions developed into hostilities and in 1849 the crew of the <i>Cutter</i> were killed and eaten by the Pouma clan.<p>As trade in <!--del_lnk--> sandalwood declined it was replaced by a new form of trade. <!--del_lnk--> Blackbirding involved enslaving people from New Caledonia, the <!--del_lnk--> Loyalty Islands, <a href="../../wp/v/Vanuatu.htm" title="Vanuatu">Vanuatu</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Papua_New_Guinea.htm" title="Papua New Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a> and the <a href="../../wp/s/Solomon_Islands.htm" title="Solomon Islands">Solomon Islands</a> to work in sugar cane plantations in <a href="../../wp/f/Fiji.htm" title="Fiji">Fiji</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Queensland. The trade ceased at the start of the 20th century.<p>Catholic and Protestant missionaries first arrived in the nineteenth century. They had a profound effect on indigenous culture. They insisted people should wear clothes to cover themselves. They eradicated many local practices and traditions.<p>The island was made a French possession in 1853 in an attempt by <!--del_lnk--> Napoleon III to rival the British colonies in <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>. Following the example set by the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> in nearby <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>, between 1854 and 1922 France sent a total of 22,000 convicted felons to <!--del_lnk--> penal colonies along the south-west coast of the island; this number includes regular criminals as well as political prisoners such as Parisian socialists and <!--del_lnk--> Kabyle nationalists. Towards the end of the penal colony era, free European <!--del_lnk--> settlers (including former convicts) and Asian contract workers by far out-numbered the population of forced workers. The indigenous Kanak populations declined drastically in that same period due to introduced diseases and an <!--del_lnk--> apartheid-like system called <i>Code de l&#39;Indig&eacute;nat</i> which imposed severe restrictions on their livelihood, freedom of movement and land ownership.<p>New Caledonia has been on a <!--del_lnk--> United Nations list of non-self-governing territories since 1986. This list includes such places as the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Samoa.htm" title="American Samoa">American Samoa</a>, the British <a href="../../wp/f/Falkland_Islands.htm" title="Falkland Islands">Falkland Islands</a> or the New Zealand territory of <a href="../../wp/t/Tokelau.htm" title="Tokelau">Tokelau</a>, but noticeably it does not include places like <a href="../../wp/t/Tibet.htm" title="Tibet">Tibet</a> or <!--del_lnk--> West Papua, which has led to its reputation as a politically biased list. Agitation by the <!--del_lnk--> Front de Lib&eacute;ration Nationale Kanak Socialiste (<!--del_lnk--> FLNKS) for independence began in 1985. The FLNKS (led by the late <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Marie Tjibaou, assassinated in 1989) advocated the creation of an independent state of &#39;Kanaky&#39;. The troubles culminated in 1988 with a bloody <!--del_lnk--> hostage taking in Ouv&eacute;a. The unrest led to agreement on increased autonomy in the <!--del_lnk--> Matignon Accords of 1988 and the <!--del_lnk--> Noum&eacute;a Accord of 1998. This Accord describes the <!--del_lnk--> devolution process as &quot;irreversible&quot; and also provides for a local Caledonian citizenship, separate official symbols of Caledonian identity (such as a &quot;national&quot; <!--del_lnk--> flag), as well as mandating a referendum on the contentious issue of independence from the French Republic sometime after 2014.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>

      <p>The unique status of New Caledonia is in between that of an independent country and a normal <!--del_lnk--> overseas <i>d&eacute;partement</i> of France. On the one hand, a territorial Congress (<i><!--del_lnk--> Congr&egrave;s du territoire</i>) and a government of the territory have been established, and a devolution of powers is organized by the 1998 <!--del_lnk--> Noum&eacute;a Accord. Key areas such as taxation, labour law, health and hygiene and foreign trade are already in the hands of the territorial Congress. Further competence will supposedly be given to the territorial Congress in the near future. Eventually, the French Republic should only remain competent for foreign affairs, justice, defense, public order, and treasury.<p>A New Caledonian &quot;citizenship&quot; has also been introduced: only New Caledonian &quot;citizens&quot; have the right to vote in the local elections. This measure has been criticised, because it creates a second-class status for French citizens living in New Caledonia who do not possess New Caledonian &quot;citizenship&quot; (because they settled in the territory recently). New Caledonia is also allowed to engage in international cooperation with independent countries of the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. Finally, the territorial Congress is allowed to pass statutes that are derogatory to <!--del_lnk--> French law in a certain number of areas.<p>On the other hand, New Caledonia remains a part of the French Republic but not perhaps an integral part. The four departments d&#39;outremer proper of Reunion, Guadeloupe, Martinique and French Guyana all use the euro as their sole official currency but New Caledonia does not. The Inhabitants of New Caledonia are French citizens and carry French passports. They take part in the legislative and presidential French elections. New Caledonia sends two representatives to the <!--del_lnk--> French National Assembly and one senator to the <!--del_lnk--> French Senate. The representative of the French central state in New Caledonia is the <!--del_lnk--> High Commissioner of the Republic (<i><!--del_lnk--> Haut-Commissaire de la R&eacute;publique</i>, locally known as &quot;<i>haussaire</i>&quot;), who is the head of civil services, and who seats in the government of the territory.<p>It was decided in the Noum&eacute;a Accord that the territorial Congress will have the right to call for a <!--del_lnk--> referendum on <!--del_lnk--> independence after 2014, at a time of its choosing.<p>The current president of the government elected by the territorial Congress is <!--del_lnk--> Marie-No&euml;lle Th&eacute;mereau, from the loyalist (i.e. anti-independence) <i><!--del_lnk--> Avenir Ensemble</i> party (&quot;Future Together&quot;), which toppled the long-time ruling RPCR (<!--del_lnk--> Rally for Caledonia inside the Republic) in May 2004. &quot;Future Together&quot; is a party of mostly Caucasian and Polynesian New Caledonians opposed to independence but tired of the hegemonic and allegedly corrupt anti-independence RPCR. Their toppling of the RPCR (that was until then seen as the only voice of New Caledonian whites) was a surprise to many, and a sign that the society of New Caledonia is undergoing changes. &quot;Future Together&quot;, as the name implies, is opposed to a racial vision of New Caledonian society, opposing Melanesian native inhabitants and the descendants of European settlers, and is in favour of a multicultural New Caledonia, better reflecting the existence of large populations of Polynesians, Indonesians, Chinese, and other immigrants. Some members of &quot;Future Together&quot; are even in favour of independence, though not necessarily on the same basis as the Melanesian independence parties.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>Though still the largest group, the indigenous <!--del_lnk--> Melanesian <!--del_lnk--> Kanak community now represents 42.5% of the whole population, their proportion of the population having declined due to immigration and other factors. The rest of the population is made up of ethnic groups that arrived in New Caledonia in the last 150 years: <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="European">Europeans</a> (37.1%) (the majority <!--del_lnk--> French with <!--del_lnk--> German, <!--del_lnk--> British and <!--del_lnk--> Italian minorities), <!--del_lnk--> Polynesians (<a href="../../wp/w/Wallis_and_Futuna.htm" title="Wallis and Futuna">Wallisians</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Tahitians) (11.8%), <!--del_lnk--> Indonesians (2.6%), <!--del_lnk--> Vietnamese (1.4%), <!--del_lnk--> Ni-Vanuatu (1.2%), and various other groups (3.9%), such as <!--del_lnk--> Malabaris and <a href="../../wp/t/Tamil_people.htm" title="Tamil people">Tamils</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Indians (Hindu and Muslim), <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lankans</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Bengalis, <!--del_lnk--> Berbers, <!--del_lnk--> Japanese, <!--del_lnk--> Chinese, <!--del_lnk--> Fijians (Native Fijians and Fiji Indians), <!--del_lnk--> Arabs, <!--del_lnk--> West Indian (mostly from other French territories) and a small number of ethnic <!--del_lnk--> Africans. Some of this immigration was a direct consequence of various conflicts around the world but in particular of the crumbling of the <!--del_lnk--> French colonial empire. The Kanak are known officially as <!--del_lnk--> Melanesians. Similarly, those whose roots are in <a href="../../wp/f/French_Polynesia.htm" title="French Polynesia">French Polynesia</a> are known either as Tahitians (which excludes persons originating in the other archipelagoes of French Polynesia) or simply as Polynesians (which would include both Tahitians and Wallisians, as well as many other minor groups). Whites that have lived in New Caledonia for several generations are locally known as <i><!--del_lnk--> Caldoches</i>, whereas newcomers who have immigrated from metropolitan France are called <i><!--del_lnk--> M&eacute;tros</i> or <i><!--del_lnk--> M&eacute;tropolitains</i>. Within the official statistical category &quot;Europeans&quot; no distinction is made between Caledonian-born whites and French-born whites, however it is estimated that approximately two thirds identify themselves with the Caldoche community while the rest see themselves primarily as <!--del_lnk--> French immigrants. There is a significant contingent of people that arrive from France to work for a year or two and others that have come to retire. The Caldoche usually refer to themselves simply as <i>cal&eacute;doniens</i> and may be either white (mostly French or <!--del_lnk--> German) or white with an admixture of Asian, Melanesian or Polynesian ancestry. Caldoche culture has many similarities with <!--del_lnk--> Australian and <!--del_lnk--> Afrikaner culture. Until very recently the Kanak population held an economically disadvantaged position in New Caledonian society, while wealthy French expatriates formed the top of the socio-economic hierarchy. The Asian and Polynesian inhabitants dominate certain segments of the local economy.<p>There have been frequent accusations by the pro-independence movement that the French government is attempting to skew the demographic balance between the ethnic communities by clandestinely settling thousands of people from mainland France among the white Caledonians. Censuses are extremely critical to the balance of power in New Caledonia, and the organisation of a new census was regularly postponed after 1996. Eventually the census was carried out in August and September 2004, amidst raging controversies over ethnic questions. Due to an intervention by French president <!--del_lnk--> Jacques Chirac, questions asking for the ethnicity of people were deleted from the 2004 census, officially because they were deemed to contravene the <!--del_lnk--> French Constitution, which states that no distinction based on ethnicity or religion should be made among French citizens. The indigenous Melanesian Kanak leaders, who are extremely sensitive to ethnic balance issues, called for New Caledonians of Kanak ethnicity not to return census forms if questions regarding ethnicity were not asked, threatening to derail the census process. Eventually, the stalemate was resolved when the local New Caledonian statistical office (a branch of the national French statistical office <!--del_lnk--> INSEE) agreed to ask questions regarding ethnicity. However, it is not known whether questions regarding ethnicity were asked to all residents of New Caledonia, and at any rate no data have been released, leaving the ethnic tables from the 1996 census as the only information on ethnicity currently available.<p>According to the 2006 census, there were 219 246 inhabitants in New Caledonia as of July 2006. Kanak leaders were fearful of a large influx of white people from <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan France which would alter the ethnic balance in the territory but this has not happened.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Caledonia&quot;</div>
