He took up an agricultural research position in <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, where he developed semi-dwarf high-<!--del_lnk--> yield, <!--del_lnk--> disease-resistant <a href="../../wp/w/Wheat.htm" title="Wheat">wheat</a> <!--del_lnk--> varieties.<p>During the mid-20th century, Borlaug led the introduction of his <a href="../../wp/c/Cereal.htm" title="Cereal">grain</a> and modern agricultural production techniques to Mexico, <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, and <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>. As a result, Mexico became a net exporter of wheat by 1963. Between 1965 and 1970, wheat yields nearly doubled in Pakistan and India, greatly improving the <!--del_lnk--> food security in those nations. These collective increases in yield have been labeled the Green Revolution, and Borlaug is often credited with saving over a billion people from <!--del_lnk--> starvation.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_fn_1"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> He was awarded the <a href="../../wp/n/Nobel_Peace_Prize.htm" title="Nobel Peace Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> in 1970 in recognition of his contributions to <!--del_lnk--> world peace through increasing food supply.<p>More recently, he has helped apply these methods of increasing food production to <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>.

      <p>Borlaug is the great-grandchild of <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norwegian</a> immigrants to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. Ole Olson Dybevig and Solveig Thomasdotter Rinde, from <!--del_lnk--> Leikanger, Norway, emigrated to <!--del_lnk--> Dane, Wisconsin, in 1854. Two of their children, <!--del_lnk--> Ole Olson Borlaug and <!--del_lnk--> Nels Olson Borlaug (Norman&#39;s grandfather), were integral in the establishment of the Immanuel Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Congregation in the small <!--del_lnk--> Norwegian-American community of <!--del_lnk--> Saude, near <!--del_lnk--> Cresco, <!--del_lnk--> Iowa in 1889.<p>The eldest of four children&mdash;his three younger sisters were Palma Lillian (Behrens; 1916-2004), Charlotte (Culbert; b. 1919) and Helen (1921-1921)&mdash;Borlaug was born to Henry Oliver (1889-1971) and Clara (Vaala) Borlaug (1888-1972) on his grandparents&#39; farm in Saude. From age seven to nineteen, he worked on the 106 <!--del_lnk--> acre (429,000 m&sup2;) family farm west of <!--del_lnk--> Protivin, Iowa, fishing, hunting, and raising maize, oats, <!--del_lnk--> timothy hay, cattle, pigs and chickens. He attended the one-teacher, <!--del_lnk--> one-room New Oregon #8 rural school in <!--del_lnk--> Howard County up through eighth grade. Today, the school building, built in 1865, is owned by the Norman Borlaug Heritage Foundation as part of &quot;Project Borlaug Legacy&quot;. At Cresco High School, Borlaug played <a href="../../wp/b/Baseball.htm" title="Baseball">baseball</a> and <!--del_lnk--> wrestled, where his coach continually encouraged him to &quot;give 105%.&quot;<p>He attributes his decision to leave the farm and pursue further education to his grandfather, Nels Olson Borlaug (1859 to 1935), who strongly encouraged Borlaug&#39;s learning, once saying, &quot;You&#39;re wiser to fill your head now if you want to fill your belly later on.&quot; Through a <!--del_lnk--> Depression-era program known as the <!--del_lnk--> National Youth Administration, he was able to enroll at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Minnesota in 1933. Initially, Borlaug failed the entrance exam, but was accepted to the school&#39;s newly created two-year General College. After two quarters, he transferred to the College of Agriculture&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> forestry program. While at the University of Minnesota, he was a member of the varsity wrestling team, reaching the <!--del_lnk--> Big Ten semifinals, and helped introduce the sport to Minnesota high schools by putting on <!--del_lnk--> exhibition matches around the state. &quot;Wrestling taught me some valuable lessons ... I always figured I could hold my own against the best in the world. It made me tough. Many times, I drew on that strength. It&#39;s an inappropriate crutch perhaps, but that&#39;s the way I&#39;m made&quot;. Borlaug was inducted into the <!--del_lnk--> National Wrestling Hall of Fame in <!--del_lnk--> Stillwater, Oklahoma in 1992.<p>To finance his studies, Borlaug periodically had to put his education on hold and take a job. One of these jobs, in 1935, was as a leader in the <!--del_lnk--> Civilian Conservation Corps, working with the unemployed on <!--del_lnk--> US federal projects. Many of the people who worked for him were starving. He later recalled, &quot;I saw how food changed them...All of this left scars on me&quot;. From 1935 to 1938, before and after receiving his <!--del_lnk--> Bachelor of Science forestry degree in 1937, Borlaug worked for the <!--del_lnk--> United States Forestry Service at stations in <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts and <!--del_lnk--> Idaho. He spent one summer in the middle fork of Idaho&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Salmon River&mdash;the most isolated piece of wilderness in the <!--del_lnk--> lower 48 states at the time.<p>At the end of his undergraduate education, Borlaug attended a lecture by <!--del_lnk--> Elvin Charles Stakman, a professor and soon-to-be head of the <!--del_lnk--> plant pathology group at the University of Minnesota. The event was pivotal for Borlaug&#39;s future life. Stakman, in his speech titled &quot;These Shifty Little Enemies that Destroy our Food Crops&quot;, discussed the manifestation of the plant disease <!--del_lnk--> rust, a <!--del_lnk--> parasitic <a href="../../wp/f/Fungus.htm" title="Fungus">fungus</a> that feeds on <!--del_lnk--> phytonutrients, in wheat, oat and barley crops across the US. He had discovered that special <!--del_lnk--> plant breeding methods created plants resistant to rust. His research greatly interested Borlaug, and when Borlaug&#39;s job at the Forest Service was eliminated due to <!--del_lnk--> budget cuts, he asked Stakman if he should go into forest pathology. Stakman advised him to focus on plant pathology instead, and Borlaug subsequently re-enrolled to the University to study plant pathology under Stakman. Borlaug received his <!--del_lnk--> Master of Science degree in 1940 and Ph.D. in plant pathology and <a href="../../wp/g/Genetics.htm" title="Genetics">genetics</a> in 1942.<p>Borlaug met his wife, Margaret Gibson, while in college, as he waited tables at a <!--del_lnk--> Dinkytown coffee shop where they both worked. They would go on to have two children, Norman Jean &quot;Jeanie&quot; (later married &quot;Laube&quot;) and William Borlaug. The Borlaugs currently have five grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Their current residence is in northern <a href="../../wp/d/Dallas%252C_Texas.htm" title="Dallas">Dallas</a>, although Borlaug is only there a few weeks of the year. His wife, Margaret, who is now blind, has assistance from their daughter Jeanie.<p><a id="Career" name="Career"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Career</span></h2>
      <p>From 1942 to 1944, Borlaug was employed as a <!--del_lnk--> microbiologist at <!--del_lnk--> DuPont in <!--del_lnk--> Wilmington, Delaware. It was planned that he would lead research on industrial and agricultural <!--del_lnk--> bacteriocides, <!--del_lnk--> fungicides, and <!--del_lnk--> preservatives. However, following the <!--del_lnk--> December 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1941 <a href="../../wp/a/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor.htm" title="Attack on Pearl Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbour</a>, Borlaug tried to enlist in the military, but was rejected under wartime labor regulations; his lab was converted to do research for the <!--del_lnk--> United States armed forces. One of his first projects was to develop <!--del_lnk--> glue that could withstand the warm <a href="../../wp/s/Seawater.htm" title="Seawater">saltwater</a> of the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">South Pacific</a>. The <a href="../../wp/i/Imperial_Japanese_Navy.htm" title="Imperial Japanese Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> had gained control of the island of <!--del_lnk--> Guadalcanal, and patrolled the sky and sea by day. The only way that US forces could supply the troops stranded on the island was by approaching at night by speedboat, and jettisoning boxes of canned food and other supplies into the surf to wash ashore. The problem was that the glue holding these containers together disintegrated in saltwater. Within weeks, Borlaug and his colleagues had developed an <!--del_lnk--> adhesive that resisted <a href="../../wp/c/Corrosion.htm" title="Corrosion">corrosion</a>, allowing food and supplies to reach the stranded Marines. Other tasks included work with <!--del_lnk--> camouflage, <!--del_lnk--> canteen disinfectants, and insulation for small electronics.<p>In 1940, the Camacho administration took office in Mexico. The administration&#39;s primary goal for Mexican agriculture was augmenting the nation&#39;s industrialization and economic growth. US Vice President <!--del_lnk--> Henry Wallace, who was instrumental in convincing the Rockefeller Foundation to work with the Mexican government in agricultural development, saw Camacho&rsquo;s ambitions as beneficial to US economic and military interests. . The Rockefeller Foundation contacted E.C. Stakman and two other leading agronomists. They developed a proposal for a new organization, the Office of Special Studies, as part of the Mexican Government, but directed by the Rockefeller Foundation. It was to be staffed with both US and Mexican scientists, focusing on soil development, maize and wheat production, and plant pathology.<p>Stakman chose Dr. <!--del_lnk--> J. George &quot;Dutch&quot; Harrar as project leader. Harrar immediately set out to hire Borlaug as head of the newly-established Cooperative Wheat Research and Production Program in <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>; Borlaug declined, choosing to finish his war service at DuPont. In July 1944, after rejecting DuPont&#39;s offer to double his salary, and temporarily leaving behind his <!--del_lnk--> pregnant wife and 14-month old daughter, he flew to <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico_City.htm" title="Mexico City">Mexico City</a> to head the new program as a <!--del_lnk--> geneticist and <!--del_lnk--> plant pathologist.<p>In 1964, he was made the director of the International Wheat Improvement Program at <!--del_lnk--> El Bat&aacute;n, <!--del_lnk--> Texcoco, on the eastern fringes of Mexico City, as part of the newly-established <!--del_lnk--> Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre <i>(Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Ma&iacute;z y Trigo,</i> or CIMMYT), an autonomous international research training institute developed from the Cooperative Wheat Research Production Program, with funding jointly undertaken by the <!--del_lnk--> Ford and Rockefeller <!--del_lnk--> Foundations and the <!--del_lnk--> Mexican government.<p>Borlaug officially retired from the position in 1979. But he remains a senior <!--del_lnk--> consultant at the CIMMYT and has continued to be involved in plant research at CIMMYT with wheat, <!--del_lnk--> triticale, <a href="../../wp/b/Barley.htm" title="Barley">barley</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Maize.htm" title="Maize">maize</a>, and high-altitude <a href="../../wp/s/Sorghum.htm" title="Sorghum">sorghum</a>, in addition to taking up <!--del_lnk--> charitable and educational roles.<p><a id="Wheat_research_in_Mexico" name="Wheat_research_in_Mexico"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Wheat research in Mexico</span></h2>

      <p>The Cooperative Wheat Research Production Program, a joint venture by the <!--del_lnk--> Rockefeller Foundation and the Mexican Ministry of Agriculture, involved research in <a href="../../wp/g/Genetics.htm" title="Genetics">genetics</a>, <!--del_lnk--> plant breeding, plant pathology, <!--del_lnk--> entomology, <!--del_lnk--> agronomy, <a href="../../wp/s/Soil_science.htm" title="Soil science">soil science</a>, and <a href="../../wp/c/Cereal.htm" title="Cereal">cereal</a> technology. The goal of the project was to boost wheat production in Mexico, which at the time was importing a large portion of its grain. George Harrar, a plant pathologist, recruited and assembled the wheat research team in late 1944. The three other members were <!--del_lnk--> Edward Wellhausen, maize breeder, <!--del_lnk--> John Niederhauser, potato breeder, and Norman Borlaug, all from the United States. Borlaug would remain with the project for 16 years. During this time, he bred a remarkably successful high-yield, disease-resistant, semi-dwarf <a href="../../wp/w/Wheat.htm" title="Wheat">wheat</a>.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Borlaug said that his first couple of years in Mexico were difficult. He lacked trained scientists and equipment. Native farmers were hostile toward the wheat program because of serious crop losses from 1939 to 1941 due to <!--del_lnk--> stem rust. &quot;It often appeared to me that I had made a dreadful mistake in accepting the position in Mexico,&quot; he wrote in the epilogue to his book, <i>Norman Borlaug on World Hunger</i>. He spent the first 10 years breeding wheat cultivars resistant to disease, including <!--del_lnk--> rust. In that time, his group made 6,000 individual crossings of wheat.<p><a id="Double_wheat_season" name="Double_wheat_season"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Double wheat season</span></h3>
      <p>Initially, his work had been concentrated in the central highlands, in the village of <!--del_lnk--> Chapingo near <!--del_lnk--> Texcoco, where the problems with rust and poor soil were most prevalent. But he realized that he could speed up breeding by taking advantage of the country&#39;s two growing seasons. In the <a href="../../wp/s/Summer.htm" title="Summer">summer</a> he would breed wheat in the central highlands as usual, then immediately take the seeds north to the <!--del_lnk--> Yaqui Valley research station near <!--del_lnk--> Ciudad Obreg&oacute;n, <!--del_lnk--> Sonora. The difference in altitudes and temperatures would allow more crops to be grown each year.<p>His boss, George Harrar, was against this expansion. Besides the extra costs of doubling the work, Borlaug&#39;s plan went against a then-held principle of agronomy that has since been disproved. It was believed that seeds needed a rest period after harvesting, in order to store energy for germination before being planted. Harrar vetoed his plan, causing Borlaug to resign. Elvin Stakman, who was visiting the project, calmed the situation, talking Borlaug into withdrawing his resignation and Harrar into allowing the double wheat season. As of 1945, wheat would then be bred at locations 700 miles (1000 km) apart, 10 degrees apart in latitude, and 8500 feet (2600 m) apart in altitude. This was called &quot;shuttle breeding&quot;.<div class="thumb tright">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>As an unexpected benefit of the double wheat season, the new breeds did not have problems with <!--del_lnk--> photoperiodism. Normally, wheat varieties cannot adapt to new environments, due to the changing periods of sunlight. Borlaug later recalled, &quot;As it worked out, in the north, we were planting when the days were getting shorter, at low elevation and high temperature. Then we&#39;d take the seed from the best plants south and plant it at high elevation, when days were getting longer and there was lots of rain. Soon we had varieties that fit the whole range of conditions. That wasn&#39;t supposed to happen by the books&quot;. This meant that the project wouldn&#39;t need to start separate breeding programs for each geographic region of the planet.<p><a id="Increasing_disease_resistance_through_multiline_varieties" name="Increasing_disease_resistance_through_multiline_varieties"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Increasing disease resistance through multiline varieties</span></h3>
      <p>Because pureline (<!--del_lnk--> genotypically identical) plant varieties often only have one or a few major <!--del_lnk--> genes for <!--del_lnk--> disease resistance, and plant diseases such as rust are continuously producing new races that can overcome a pureline&#39;s resistance, multiline varieties were developed. Multiline varieties are mixtures of several <!--del_lnk--> phenotypically-similar purelines which each have different genes for disease resistance. By having similar heights, flowering and maturity dates, seed colors, and agronomic characteristics, they remain compatible with each other, and do not reduce yields when grown together on the field.<p>In 1953, Borlaug extended this technique by suggesting that several purelines with different resistance genes should be developed through backcross methods using one recurrent parent. Backcrossing involves crossing a hybrid and subsequent generations with a recurrent parent. As a result, the genotype of the backcrossed progeny becomes increasingly similar to that of the recurrent parent. Borlaug&#39;s method would allow the various different disease-resistant genes from several donor parents to be transferred into a single recurrent parent. To make sure each line has different resistant genes, each donor parent is used in a separate backcross program. Between five and ten of these lines may then be mixed depending upon the races of pathogen present in the region. As this process is repeated, some lines will become susceptible to the <!--del_lnk--> pathogen. These lines can easily be replaced with new resistant lines. As new sources of resistance become available, new lines are developed. In this way, the loss of crops is kept to a minimum, because only one or a few lines become susceptible to a pathogen within a given season, and all other crops are unaffected by the disease. Because the disease would spread more slowly than if the entire population were susceptible, this also reduces the damage to susceptible lines. There is still the possibility that a new race of pathogen will develop to which all lines are susceptible, however.<p><a id="Dwarfing" name="Dwarfing"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Dwarfing</span></h3>
      <p>Dwarfing is an important agronomic quality for wheat; dwarf plants produce thick stems and do not lodge. The <!--del_lnk--> cultivars Borlaug worked with had tall, thin stalks. Taller wheat grasses better compete for sunlight, but tend to collapse under the weight of the extra grain&mdash;a trait called lodging&mdash;and from the rapid growth spurts induced by <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen.htm" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a> <a href="../../wp/f/Fertilizer.htm" title="Fertilizer">fertilizer</a> Borlaug used in the poor soil. To prevent this, he bred wheat to favour shorter, stronger stalks that could better support larger seed heads. In 1953, he acquired a <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japanese</a> dwarf variety of wheat called <!--del_lnk--> Norin 10 developed by <!--del_lnk--> Orville Vogel, that had been crossed with a high-yielding American cultivar called Brevor 14. Norin 10/Brevor is semi-dwarf (one-half to two-thirds the height of standard varieties) and produces more stalks and thus more heads of grain per plant. Also, larger amounts of <!--del_lnk--> assimilate were partitioned into the actual grains, further increasing the yield. Borlaug crossbred the semi-dwarf Norin 10/Brevor cultivar with his disease-resistant cultivars to produce wheat varieties that were adapted to tropical and sub-tropical climates.<p>Borlaug&#39;s new semi-dwarf, disease-resistant varieties, called Pitic 62 and Penjamo 62, changed the potential yield of wheat dramatically. By 1963, 95% of Mexico&#39;s wheat crops used the semi-dwarf varieties developed by Borlaug. That year, the harvest was six times larger than in 1944, the year Borlaug arrived in Mexico. Mexico had become fully self-sufficient in wheat production, and a net exporter of wheat. Four other high yield varieties were also released, in 1964: Lerma Rojo 64, Siete Cerros, Sonora 64, and Super X.<p><a id="Expansion_to_South_Asia:_The_Green_Revolution" name="Expansion_to_South_Asia:_The_Green_Revolution"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Expansion to South Asia: The Green Revolution</span></h2>

      <p>In 1961 to 1962, Borlaug&#39;s dwarf spring wheat strains were sent for multilocation testing in the International Wheat Rust Nursery, organized by the <!--del_lnk--> US Department of Agriculture. In March 1962, a few of these strains were grown in the fields of the <!--del_lnk--> Indian Agricultural Research Institute in Pune, <a href="../../wp/n/New_Delhi.htm" title="New Delhi">New Delhi</a>, India. In May 1962, <!--del_lnk--> M. S. Swaminathan, a member of IARI&#39;s wheat program, requested of Dr. B.P. Pal, Director of IARI, to arrange for the visit of Borlaug to India and to obtain a wide range of dwarf wheat seed possessing the Norin 10 dwarfing genes. The letter was forwarded to the Indian Ministry of Agriculture, which arranged with the Rockefeller Foundation for Borlaug&#39;s visit. In March 1963, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Mexican government sent Borlaug to India to continue his work. He supplied 100 kg (220 lb) of seed from each of the four most promising strains and 630 promising selections in advanced generations to the IARI in October 1963, and test plots were subsequently planted at <a href="../../wp/d/Delhi.htm" title="Delhi">Delhi</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Ludhiana, <!--del_lnk--> Pant Nagar, <!--del_lnk--> Kanpur, <!--del_lnk--> Pune and <!--del_lnk--> Indore.<p>During the mid-1960s, the <!--del_lnk--> Indian subcontinent was at war, and experiencing widespread famine and starvation, even though the US was making emergency shipments of millions of tons of grain, including over one fifth of its total wheat, to the region. The Indian and <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistani</a> bureaucracies and the region&#39;s cultural opposition to new agricultural techniques initially prevented Borlaug from fulfilling his desire to immediately plant the new wheat strains there. By the summer of 1965, the famine became so acute that the governments stepped in and allowed his projects to go forward.<p>In the late 1960s, most experts said that global <a href="../../wp/f/Famine.htm" title="Famine">famines</a> in which billions would die would soon occur. Biologist <!--del_lnk--> Paul R. Ehrlich wrote in his 1968 bestseller <i><!--del_lnk--> The Population Bomb</i>, &quot;The battle to feed all of humanity is over... In the 1970s and 1980s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now.&quot; Ehrlich also said, &quot;I have yet to meet anyone familiar with the situation who thinks India will be self-sufficient in food by 1971,&quot; and &quot;India couldn&#39;t possibly feed two hundred million more people by 1980.&quot;<p>In 1965, after extensive testing, Borlaug&#39;s team began its effort by importing about 450 tons of Lerma Rojo and Sonora 64 semi-dwarf seed varieties: 250 tons went to Pakistan and 200 to India. They encountered many obstacles. Their first shipment of wheat was held up in Mexican customs and so could not be shipped from the port at <!--del_lnk--> Guaymas in time for proper planting. Instead, it was sent via a 30-truck convoy from Mexico to the US port in <!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles (LA), encountering delays at the <!--del_lnk--> US-Mexico border. Once the convoy entered the US, it had to take a detour, as the <!--del_lnk--> US National Guard had closed the freeway due to <!--del_lnk--> Watts riots in LA. When the seeds reached LA, a Mexican bank refused to honour Pakistan treasury&#39;s payment of <!--del_lnk--> US$100,000 because the check contained three misspelled words. Still, the seed was loaded onto a freighter destined for <!--del_lnk--> Bombay, India and <!--del_lnk--> Karachi, Pakistan. Twelve hours into the freighter&#39;s voyage, war broke out between India and Pakistan over the <a href="../../wp/k/Kashmir_region.htm" title="Kashmir">Kashmir</a> region. Borlaug received a <!--del_lnk--> telegraph from the Pakistani minister of agriculture, <!--del_lnk--> Malik Khuda Bakhsh Bucha: &quot;I&#39;m sorry to hear you are having trouble with my check, but I&#39;ve got troubles, too. Bombs are falling on my front lawn. Be patient, the money is in the bank...&quot;<p>These delays prevented Borlaug&#39;s group from conducting the germination tests needed to determine seed quality and proper seeding levels. They started planting immediately, and often worked in sight of <!--del_lnk--> artillery flashes. A week later, Borlaug discovered that his seeds were germinating at less than half the normal rate. It later turned out that the seeds had been damaged in a Mexican warehouse by over-fumigation with a pesticide. He immediately ordered all locations to double their seeding rates.<p>The initial yields of Borlaug&#39;s crops were higher than any ever harvested in <!--del_lnk--> South Asia. The countries subsequently committed to importing large quantities of both the Lerma Rojo 64 and Sonora 64 varieties. In 1966, India imported 18,000 tons &mdash;the largest purchase and import of any seed in the world at that time. In 1967, Pakistan imported 42,000 tons, and Turkey 21,000 tons. Pakistan&#39;s import, planted on 1.5 million acres (6,100 km&sup2;), produced enough wheat to seed the entire nation&#39;s wheatland the following year. By 1968, when Ehrlich&#39;s book was released, William Gaud of the <!--del_lnk--> United States Agency for International Development was calling Borlaug&#39;s work a &quot;Green Revolution&quot;. High yields led to a shortage of various utilities: labor to harvest the crops, bullock carts to haul it to the threshing floor, <!--del_lnk--> jute bags, trucks, rail cars, and grain storage facilities. Some local governments were forced to close school buildings temporarily to use them for grain storage.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In Pakistan, wheat yields nearly doubled, from 4.6 million <!--del_lnk--> tons in 1965 to 7.3 million tons in 1970; Pakistan was self-sufficient in wheat production by 1968. Yields were over 21 million tons by 2000. In India, yields increased from 12.3 million tons in 1965 to 20.1 million tons in 1970. By 1974, India was self-sufficient in the production of all cereals. By 2000, India was harvesting a record 76.4 million tons of wheat. Since the 1960s, food production in both nations has increased faster than the rate of population growth. Paul Waggoner, of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, calculates that India&#39;s use of high-yield farming has prevented 100 million acres (400,000 km&sup2;) of virgin land from being converted into farmland&mdash;an area about the size of <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a>, or 13.6% of the total area of India. The use of these wheat varieties has also had a substantial effect on production in six <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin American</a> countries, six countries in the <!--del_lnk--> Near and <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, and several others in <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>.<p>Borlaug&#39;s work with wheat led to the development of high-yield semi-dwarf <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> <a href="../../wp/r/Rice.htm" title="Rice">rice</a> cultivars at the <!--del_lnk--> International Rice Research Institute, started by the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations, and at <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Hunan Rice Research Institute. Borlaug&#39;s colleagues at the <!--del_lnk--> Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research also developed and introduced a high-yield variety of rice throughout most of <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a>. Land devoted to the semi-dwarf wheat and rice varieties in Asia expanded from 200 acres (0.8 km&sup2;) in 1965 to over 40 million acres (160,000 km&sup2;) in 1970. In 1970, this land accounted for over 10% of the more productive cereal land in <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a>.<p><a id="Nobel_Peace_Prize" name="Nobel_Peace_Prize"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Nobel Peace Prize</span></h3>
      <p>For his contributions to the world food supply, Borlaug was awarded the <a href="../../wp/n/Nobel_Peace_Prize.htm" title="Nobel Peace Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> in 1970. Norwegian officials notified his wife in Mexico City at 4:00<small>AM</small>, but Borlaug had already left for the test fields in the <!--del_lnk--> Toluca valley, about 40 miles (65 km) west of Mexico City. A chauffeur took her to the fields to inform her husband. According to his daughter, Jeanie Laube, &quot;My mom said, &#39;You won the Nobel Peace Prize,&#39; and he said, &#39;No, I haven&#39;t&#39;,... It took some convincing... He thought the whole thing was a hoax&quot;. He was awarded the prize on <!--del_lnk--> December 10. In his Nobel Lecture the following day, he speculated on his award: &quot;When the Nobel Peace Prize Committee designated me the recipient of the 1970 award for my contribution to the &#39;green revolution&#39;, they were in effect, I believe, selecting an individual to symbolize the vital role of agriculture and food production in a world that is hungry, both for bread and for peace&quot;. It was the only Nobel Peace Prize awarded for agriculture or food production.<p><a id="Borlaug_hypothesis" name="Borlaug_hypothesis"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Borlaug hypothesis</span></h3>
      <p>Borlaug has continually advocated increasing crop yields as a means to curb deforestation. The large role he has played in both increasing crop yields and promoting this view has led to it being called by agricultural economists the &quot;Borlaug hypothesis&quot;, namely that <i>increasing the productivity of agriculture on the best farmland can help control deforestation by reducing the demand for new farmland</i>. According to this view, assuming that global food demand is on the rise, restricting crop usage to traditional low-yield methods such as <!--del_lnk--> organic farming would also require at least one of the following: the world population to decrease, either voluntarily or as a result of mass starvations; or the conversion of forest land into crop land. It is thus argued that high-yield techniques are ultimately saving <!--del_lnk--> ecosystems from destruction. On a global scale, this view holds strictly true <!--del_lnk--> ceteris paribus, if all land either consists of forests or is used for agriculture. But other land uses exist, such as urban areas, pasture, or fallow, so further research is necessary to ascertain what land has been converted for what purposes, in order to determine how true this view remains. Increased profits from high-yield production may also induce cropland expansion in any case, although as world food needs decrease, this expansion may decrease as well.<p><a id="Criticisms_and_his_view_of_critics" name="Criticisms_and_his_view_of_critics"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Criticisms and his view of critics</span></h3>
      <p>Throughout his years of research, Borlaug&#39;s programs often faced opposition by people who consider genetic crossbreeding to be unnatural or to have negative effects. Borlaug&#39;s work has been criticized for bringing large-scale <!--del_lnk--> monoculture, <!--del_lnk--> input-intensive farming techniques to countries that had previously relied on <!--del_lnk--> subsistence farming, and for widening social inequality owing to uneven food distribution. There are also concerns about the long-term sustainability of farming practices encouraged by the Green Revolution in both the developed and developing world.<p>Other concerns of his critics and critics of <a href="../../wp/b/Biotechnology.htm" title="Biotechnology">biotechnology</a> in general include: that the construction of roads in populated third-world areas could lead to the destruction of wilderness; the crossing of genetic barriers; the inability of crops to fulfill all nutritional requirements; the decreased biodiversity from planting a small number of varieties; the environmental and economic effects of inorganic fertilizer and pesticides; the amount of herbicide sprayed on fields of herbicide-resistant crops.<p>Borlaug has dismissed most claims of critics, but does take certain concerns seriously. He states that his work has been &quot;a change in the right direction, but it has not transformed the world into a Utopia&quot;. Of environmental lobbyists he has stated, &quot;some of the environmental lobbyists of the <!--del_lnk--> Western nations are the salt of the earth, but many of them are <!--del_lnk--> elitists. They&#39;ve never experienced the physical sensation of hunger. They do their lobbying from comfortable office suites in <a href="../../wp/w/Washington%252C_D.C..htm" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington</a> or <a href="../../wp/b/Brussels.htm" title="Brussels">Brussels</a>. If they lived just one month amid the misery of the developing world, as I have for fifty years, they&#39;d be crying out for tractors and fertilizer and irrigation canals and be outraged that fashionable elitists back home were trying to deny them these things&quot;.<p><a id="Current_roles" name="Current_roles"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Current roles</span></h2>
      <p>Following his retirement, Borlaug has continued to participate actively in teaching, research and activism. He spends much of the year based at CIMMYT in Mexico, conducting research, and four months of the year serving at <!--del_lnk--> Texas A&amp;M University, where he has been a distinguished professor of international agriculture since 1984. In 1999, the university&#39;s Board of Regents named its US$16 million Center for Southern Crop Improvement in honor of Borlaug. He works in the building&#39;s Heep Centre, and teaches one semester each year.<p><a id="Production_in_Africa" name="Production_in_Africa"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Production in Africa</span></h3>
      <p>In the early 1980s, environmental groups that were opposed to Borlaug&#39;s methods campaigned against his planned expansion of efforts into Africa. They prompted the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations and the <!--del_lnk--> World Bank to stop funding most of his African agriculture projects. Western European governments were persuaded to stop supplying fertilizer to Africa. According to David Seckler, former Director General of the <!--del_lnk--> International Water Management Institute, &quot;the environmental community in the 1980s went crazy pressuring the donor countries and the big foundations not to support ideas like inorganic fertilizers for Africa.&quot;<p>In 1984, during the <a href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia.htm" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopian</a> famine, <!--del_lnk--> Ryoichi Sasakawa, the chairman of the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation (now the <!--del_lnk--> Nippon Foundation), contacted the semi-retired Borlaug, wondering why the methods used in Asia were not extended to Africa, and hoping Borlaug could help. He managed to convince Borlaug to help with this new, huge effort, and subsequently founded the <!--del_lnk--> Sasakawa Africa Association (SAA) to coordinate the project.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The SAA is a research and <!--del_lnk--> extension organization that aims to increase food production in African countries that are struggling with food shortages. &quot;I assumed we&#39;d do a few years of research first,&quot; Borlaug later recalled, &quot;but after I saw the terrible circumstances there, I said, &#39;Let&#39;s just start growing&#39;.&quot; Soon, Borlaug and the SAA had projects in seven countries. Yields of maize and <a href="../../wp/s/Sorghum.htm" title="Sorghum">sorghum</a> in developed African countries doubled between 1983 and 1985. Yields of wheat, <!--del_lnk--> cassava, and <!--del_lnk--> cowpeas also increased in these countries. At present, program activities are under way in <a href="../../wp/b/Benin.htm" title="Benin">Benin</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Burkina_Faso.htm" title="Burkina Faso">Burkina Faso</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia.htm" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Ghana.htm" title="Ghana">Ghana</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Guinea.htm" title="Guinea">Guinea</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Mali.htm" title="Mali">Mali</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Malawi.htm" title="Malawi">Malawi</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Mozambique.htm" title="Mozambique">Mozambique</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/Nigeria.htm" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Tanzania.htm" title="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>, and <a href="../../wp/u/Uganda.htm" title="Uganda">Uganda</a>.<p>Since 1986, Borlaug has been the President of the SAA. That year, <a href="../../wp/j/Jimmy_Carter.htm" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> initiated Sasakawa-Global 2000 (SG 2000), a joint venture between the SAA and the <!--del_lnk--> Carter Centre&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Global 2000 program. The program focuses on food, population and agricultural policy. Since then, over 1 million African farm families have been trained in the SAA&#39;s new farming techniques. Those elements that allowed Borlaug&#39;s projects to succeed in India and Pakistan, such as well-organized economies and transportation and irrigation systems, are severely lacking throughout Africa, posing additional obstacles to increasing yields. Because of this, Borlaug&#39;s initial projects were restricted to developed regions of the continent.<p>Despite these setbacks, Borlaug has found encouragement. Visiting <a href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia.htm" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> in 1994, Jimmy Carter won Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> Meles Zenawi&#39;s support for a campaign seeking to aid farmers, using the fertilizer <!--del_lnk--> diammonium phosphate and Borlaug&#39;s methods. The following season, Ethiopia recorded the largest harvests of major crops in history, with a 32% increase in production, and a 15% increase in average yield over the previous season. For Borlaug, the rapid increase in yields suggests that there is still hope for higher food production throughout sub-Saharan Africa.<p><a id="World_Food_Prize" name="World_Food_Prize"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">World Food Prize</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> World Food Prize is an international award recognizing the achievements of individuals who have advanced human development by improving the quality, quantity or availability of food in the world.

The first prize was given to Borlaug&#39;s former colleague, <!--del_lnk--> M. S. Swaminathan, in 1987, for his work in India.

      <p>The limited potential for land expansion for cultivation&mdash;only 17% of cultivable land produces 90% of the world&#39;s food crops &mdash;worries Borlaug, who, in March 2005, stated that, &quot;we will have to double the world food supply by 2050.&quot; With 85% of future growth in food production having to come from lands already in use, he recommends a multidisciplinary research focus to further increase yields, mainly through increased crop immunity to large-scale diseases, such as the rust fungus, which affects all cereals but rice. His dream is to &quot;transfer rice immunity to cereals such as wheat, maize, sorghum and barley, and transfer bread-wheat proteins (<!--del_lnk--> gliadin and <!--del_lnk--> glutenin) to other cereals, especially rice and maize&quot;.<p>According to Borlaug, &quot;Africa, the former Soviet republics, and the <!--del_lnk--> cerrado are the last frontiers. After they are in use, the world will have no additional sizable blocks of arable land left to put into production, unless you are willing to level whole forests, which you should not do. So, future food-production increases will have to come from higher yields. And though I have no doubt yields will keep going up, whether they can go up enough to feed the population monster is another matter. Unless progress with agricultural yields remains very strong, the next century will experience sheer human misery that, on a numerical scale, will exceed the worst of everything that has come before&quot;.<p>Besides increasing the worldwide food supply, Borlaug has repeatedly stated that taking steps to decrease the rate of <!--del_lnk--> population growth will also be necessary to prevent food shortages. In his Nobel Lecture of 1970, Borlaug stated, &quot;Most people still fail to comprehend the magnitude and menace of the &#39;Population Monster&#39;...If it continues to increase at the estimated present rate of two percent a year, the world population will reach 6.5 billion by the year 2000. Currently, with each second, or tick of the clock, about 2.2 additional people are added to the world population. The rhythm of increase will accelerate to 2.7, 3.3, and 4.0 for each tick of the clock by 1980, 1990, and 2000, respectively, unless man becomes more realistic and preoccupied about this impending doom. The tick-tock of the clock will continually grow louder and more menacing each decade. Where will it all end?&quot;<p><a id="Honors_and_recognition" name="Honors_and_recognition"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Honours and recognition</span></h2>

The president of a fictional African country describes the kind of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> miracle&quot; needed to save his country from the ravages of <a href="../../wp/a/AIDS.htm" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> by referencing an American scientist who was able to save the world from hunger through the development of a new type of wheat. The American president replies by providing Borlaug&#39;s name.<p>Borlaug was also featured in an episode of Penn &amp; Teller: <!--del_lnk--> Bullshit!, where he was referred to as the &quot;Greatest Human Being That Ever Lived&quot;. In that episode, <!--del_lnk--> Penn &amp; Teller play a card game where each card depicts a great person in history. Each player picks a card at random, and bets on whether they think their card shows a greater person than the other players&#39; cards. Penn gets Norman Borlaug, and proceeds to bet all his chips, his house, his rings, his watch, and essentially everything he&#39;s ever owned. He wins because, as he says, &quot;Norman is the greatest human being, and you&#39;ve probably never heard of him.&quot; In the episode - the topic of which was genetically altered food - he is credited with saving the lives of over a billion people.<p>In August 2006, Dr. <!--del_lnk--> Leon Hesser published <i>The Man Who Fed the World: Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Norman Borlaug and His Battle to End World Hunger</i>, an account of Borlaug&#39;s life and work. On August 4, the book received the 2006 Print of Peace award, as part of International Read For Peace Week.<p><a id="Books_and_lectures" name="Books_and_lectures"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Books and lectures</span></h2>
