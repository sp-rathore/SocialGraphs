      <p>The <b>Naval Battle of Guadalcanal</b>, sometimes referred to as the <b>Third Battle of Savo Island</b> or, in Japanese sources, as the <b>Third Battle of the Solomon Sea</b> (&#x7B2C;&#x4E09;&#x6B21;&#x30BD;&#x30ED;&#x30E2;&#x30F3;&#x6D77;&#x6226;), took place November 12&ndash;15, 1942, and was the decisive battle in a series of <!--del_lnk--> naval battles that took place between <!--del_lnk--> Allied (primarily <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States of America">U.S.</a>) and <!--del_lnk--> Japanese <!--del_lnk--> forces during the months-long <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Guadalcanal in the <a href="../../wp/s/Solomon_Islands.htm" title="Solomon Islands">Solomon Islands</a>. The battle consisted of a sequence of combined air and sea engagements spread over four days, most of them in the vicinity of <!--del_lnk--> Guadalcanal. All of the engagements were directly related to a single effort by the Japanese to reinforce their land forces on Guadalcanal, and are all therefore considered to be different parts of the same battle.<p>In two extremely destructive nighttime surface warship engagements, both adversaries lost numerous ships. Also, U.S. daytime air attacks over several days sank or damaged a number of Japanese warships and transport ships. The sum of these engagements was that the U.S. was successful in turning back Japan&#39;s last major attempt to dislodge Allied forces from their positions on Guadalcanal and nearby <!--del_lnk--> Tulagi. Thus, the battle resulted in a significant <!--del_lnk--> strategic <!--del_lnk--> victory for the U.S. and its <!--del_lnk--> allies.<p>

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> August 7, 1942, Allied forces (primarily U.S.) landed on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and the <!--del_lnk--> Florida Islands in the <a href="../../wp/s/Solomon_Islands.htm" title="Solomon Islands">Solomon Islands</a>. The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as <!--del_lnk--> bases to <!--del_lnk--> threaten the <!--del_lnk--> supply routes between the U.S. and <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a> and to use them as starting points for a <!--del_lnk--> campaign with the eventual goal of isolating the major Japanese base at <!--del_lnk--> Rabaul while also supporting the Allied <!--del_lnk--> New Guinea and <!--del_lnk--> New Britain campaigns. The landings initiated the six-month-long <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Guadalcanal.<p>Due to the constant threat by Japanese aircraft and warships around the Solomon Islands, Allied forces were unable to frequently resupply their forces on Guadalcanal, who were often under attack from Japanese land and sea forces in the area. In early November, 1942, Allied <!--del_lnk--> intelligence reports indicated that the Japanese were preparing their own offensive to try to retake the islands from the U.S. and its allies. Therefore, the U.S. mounted a major resupply and reinforcement effort by sending Task Force 67, a large reinforcement and resupply convoy commanded by Rear <!--del_lnk--> Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Richmond K. Turner, to support its forces at Guadalcanal on <!--del_lnk--> November 11. The supply ships were protected by <!--del_lnk--> task groups commanded by Rear Admirals <!--del_lnk--> Daniel J. Callaghan and <!--del_lnk--> Norman Scott as well as aircraft from <!--del_lnk--> Henderson Field on Guadalcanal. The Japanese conducted several air <!--del_lnk--> attacks on these supply ships at Guadalcanal on November 11 and 12, using aircraft based at Buin, <!--del_lnk--> Bougainville in the Solomon Islands. However, most of the U.S. supply ships were unloaded without serious <!--del_lnk--> damage and 12 of the Japanese aircraft were shot down by <!--del_lnk--> anti-aircraft fire from the U.S. ships or by <!--del_lnk--> fighter aircraft from Henderson Field.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The last major attempt to retake Guadalcanal and Henderson Field by the Japanese <!--del_lnk--> army had occurred from October 20&ndash;26 in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle for Henderson Field and had been defeated with heavy losses for the Japanese. At the same time, Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Isoroku Yamamoto (the commander of the Japanese <!--del_lnk--> Combined Fleet) had attempted to decisively defeat U.S. naval forces in the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_the_Santa_Cruz_Islands.htm" title="Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands">Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands</a>. In that battle, U.S. naval forces were defeated and driven from the area with the loss of one aircraft carrier and severe damage to another. However, the Japanese carriers themselves were forced to retreat due to crippling losses to their carrier aircraft and aircrews. Thereafter, Yamamoto&#39;s ships returned to their main bases at <!--del_lnk--> Truk in <!--del_lnk--> Micronesia, where he had his <!--del_lnk--> headquarters, and <!--del_lnk--> Rabaul on <!--del_lnk--> New Britain while three of the four Japanese carriers returned to Japan for repairs and refitting.<p>The Japanese army planned another attack on Guadalcanal, but further reinforcements were needed before the operation could proceed. The army requested assistance from Yamamoto to deliver the needed reinforcements to the island and to support their planned offensive on the Allied forces guarding Henderson Field. To support the reinforcement effort, Yamamoto provided 11 large transport ships to carry 7,000 army troops, their <!--del_lnk--> ammunition, food, and heavy equipment to Guadalcanal. He also provided a warship support force that included two battleships. The two battleships, <i><!--del_lnk--> Hiei</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Kirishima</i>, equipped with special <!--del_lnk--> fragmentation <!--del_lnk--> shells, were to bombard Henderson Field and destroy it and/or the aircraft stationed there in order to allow the slow, heavy transports to reach Guadalcanal safely. The warship force was commanded by recently-promoted Vice Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Hiroaki Abe from <i>Hiei</i>.<p><a id="First_Naval_Battle_of_Guadalcanal.2C_November_13" name="First_Naval_Battle_of_Guadalcanal.2C_November_13"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, November 13</span></h2>

      <p>Abe&#39;s warship force and the transports assembled near the <!--del_lnk--> Shortland Islands and proceeded down &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The Slot&quot; towards Guadacanal on <!--del_lnk--> November 12 with an estimated arrival time for the warships of early morning, <!--del_lnk--> November 13, with the slower transport ships travelling some distance behind. In addition to the two battleships, the Japanese force included the <!--del_lnk--> light cruiser <!--del_lnk--> <i>Nagara</i> and 11 <!--del_lnk--> destroyers: <!--del_lnk--> <i>Samidare</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Murasame</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Asagumo</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Teruzuki</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Amatsukaze</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Yukikaze</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Ikazuchi</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Inazuma</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Akatsuki</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Harusame</i>, and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Yudachi</i>. Three destroyers (<!--del_lnk--> <i>Shigure</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Shiratsuyu</i>, and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Yugure</i>) would provide a rear guard in the <!--del_lnk--> Russell Islands during Abe&#39;s foray into &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Ironbottom Sound&quot; off the north coast of Guadalcanal. U.S. <!--del_lnk--> reconnaissance aircraft observed the Japanese ships&#39; approach.<p>The U.S. supply ships at Guadalcanal departed by early evening <!--del_lnk--> November 12 but Turner detached all useable combat ships to protect the troops ashore from the expected Japanese attack and/or reinforcement effort. Callaghan was a few days&#39; <!--del_lnk--> senior to the more <!--del_lnk--> experienced Scott, and therefore was placed in overall command. Callaghan prepared his force to meet the Japanese that night in the sound. His force comprised two <!--del_lnk--> heavy cruisers (<!--del_lnk--> <i>San Francisco</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Portland</i>), three light cruisers (<!--del_lnk--> <i>Helena</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Juneau</i>, and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Atlanta</i>), and eight destroyers: <!--del_lnk--> <i>Cushing</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Laffey</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Sterett</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> O&#39;Bannon</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Aaron Ward</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Barton</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Monssen</i>, and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Fletcher</i>.

      <p>During their approach to Guadalcanal, the Japanese force passed through a large and intense rain <!--del_lnk--> squall which, along with a complex <!--del_lnk--> formation plus some confusing orders from Abe, split the formation into several groups. The U.S. force steamed in a single column around Ironbottom Sound, with destroyers in the lead and rear of the column, and the cruisers in the centre. Five ships had the new, superior SG <a href="../../wp/r/Radar.htm" title="Radar">radar</a>, but Callaghan&#39;s deployment put none of them in the forward part of the column, nor did he choose one for his <!--del_lnk--> flagship. <a id="Action" name="Action"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Action</span></h3>
      <p>At about <!--del_lnk--> 01:25 on <!--del_lnk--> November 13, in almost complete pitch darkness due to the bad weather and <!--del_lnk--> dark moon, the ships of the Japanese force entered the sound between <!--del_lnk--> Savo Island and Guadalcanal and prepared to bombard Henderson Field. Several of the U.S. ships detected the Japanese ships on radar, beginning about 01:24, but had trouble communicating the information to Callaghan due to problems with their ship&#39;s radio equipment and lack of discipline with their <a href="../../wp/c/Communication.htm" title="Communication">communications</a> procedures. Several minutes later, both forces visually sighted each other about the same time but both Abe and Callaghan hesitated ordering their ships into action. Abe apparently was surprised by the proximity of the U.S. ships and couldn&#39;t decide if he should momentarily withdraw to give his ships time to change from bombardment ammunition to anti-ship ammunition or to continue onward. He decided to continue onward. Callaghan, apparently intended to attempt to <!--del_lnk--> cross the T of the Japanese, as Scott had done at <!--del_lnk--> Cape Esperance, but confused by the incomplete information he was receiving, plus the fact that the Japanese formation consisted of several, scattered groups, he gave several confusing orders on ship movements. The U.S. ship formation began to fall apart, apparently further delaying Callaghan&#39;s order to commence firing as he first tried to straighten out his ship&#39;s locations. Meanwhile, both forces continued to head directly for each other.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>At 01:48, the Japanese ships <i>Akatsuki</i> and <i>Hiei</i> turned on large <!--del_lnk--> searchlights and lit up <i>Atlanta</i> only 3,000 yards away&mdash;almost <!--del_lnk--> point-blank range for large <!--del_lnk--> naval artillery. Several of the ships on both sides spontaneously opened fire. Realizing that his force was almost surrounded by Japanese ships, Callaghan ordered, &quot;Odd ships fire to <!--del_lnk--> starboard, even ships fire to <!--del_lnk--> port.&quot; Most of the remaining U.S. ships then opened fire, although several had to quickly change their targets in order to comply with Callaghan&#39;s order. As the ships from the two sides intermingled, they battled each other in an utterly confused and chaotic <!--del_lnk--> mel&eacute;e at close distances. Afterwards, an officer on <i>Monssen</i> likened it to &quot;a <!--del_lnk--> barroom <!--del_lnk--> brawl after the lights had been shot out&quot;.<p>At least six of the U.S. ships, including <i>Laffey</i>, <i>O&#39;Bannon</i>, <i>Atlanta</i>, <i>San Francisco</i>, <i>Portland</i>, and <i>Helena</i>, fired at <!--del_lnk--> <i>Akatsuki</i>, which drew attention to herself with her illuminated searchlight. <i>Akatsuki</i> blew up and sank within a few minutes, but not before hitting <i>Atlanta</i> with shells and a <!--del_lnk--> torpedo. Only eight crewmen (out of a total complement of 197) survived the sinking of <i>Akatsuki</i> and were later <!--del_lnk--> captured by U.S. forces.<p>Perhaps due to being the lead cruiser in the U.S. formation, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Atlanta</i> was the target of fire from several Japanese ships, probably including <i>Nagara</i>, <i>Inazuma</i>, and <i>Ikazuchi</i>, in addition to <i>Akatsuki</i>. The gunfire caused <i>Atlanta</i> heavy damage, and the torpedo hit cut all of her <!--del_lnk--> engineering power. <i>Atlanta</i> now drifted into the line of fire of <i>San Francisco</i>, which accidentally fired on <i>Atlanta</i>, causing even greater damage, and killing Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Scott and much of the bridge crew. <i>Atlanta</i>, without power or able to fire her guns, now drifted out of control and out of the battle as the Japanese ships passed her by. The lead U.S. destroyer, <i>Cushing</i>, was also caught in a <!--del_lnk--> crossfire between several Japanese destroyers and perhaps <i>Nagara</i>. She too was hit heavily and stopped dead in the water.<p><!--del_lnk--> <i>Hiei</i>, with her nine lit searchights, huge size, and course taking her directly through the U.S. formation, now became the focus of gunfire from many of the U.S. ships. <i>Laffey</i> passed so close to <i>Hiei</i> that they missed <!--del_lnk--> colliding by 20&nbsp;feet. <i>Hiei</i> was unable to depress her main or secondary batteries low enough to hit <i>Laffey</i>, but <i>Laffey</i> was able to rake <i>Hiei</i>&rsquo;s superstructure with 5-inch shells and <!--del_lnk--> machinegun fire, causing heavy damage to <i>Hiei</i>&rsquo;s <!--del_lnk--> superstructure and <!--del_lnk--> bridge, <!--del_lnk--> wounding Admiral Abe, and killing his <!--del_lnk--> chief of staff. Admiral Abe was thereafter limited in his ability to direct his ships for the rest of the battle. <i>Sterett</i> and <i>O&#39;Bannon</i> likewise pumped several <!--del_lnk--> salvos into <i>Hiei</i>&rsquo;s superstructure from close range, and perhaps one or two torpedoes into her <!--del_lnk--> hull, causing <i>Hiei</i> further damage, before both destroyers escaped into the darkness.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Unable to fire her main or secondary batteries at the three destroyers causing her so much trouble, <i>Hiei</i> instead concentrated on <!--del_lnk--> <i>San Francisco</i> which was passing by only 2,500 yards away. Along with <i>Kirishima</i>, <i>Inazuma</i>, and <i>Ikazuchi</i>, the four ships made repeated hits on <i>San Francisco</i>, disabling her steering control and killing Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Callaghan, Captain <!--del_lnk--> Cassin Young, and most of the bridge staff. The first few salvos from <i>Hiei</i> and <i>Kirishima</i> consisted of the special fragmentation bombardment shells, which reduced damage to the interior of <i>San Francisco</i>, and may have saved her from being sunk outright. Not expecting a ship-to-ship confrontation, it took the crews of the two Japanese battleships several minutes to switch to <!--del_lnk--> armor-piercing ammunition. Nevertheless, <i>San Francisco</i>, now almost helpless to defend herself, managed to momentarily sail clear of the melee. However, she managed to land at least one shell in the <i>Hiei</i>&rsquo;s steering gear room during the exchange, flooding it with water, shorting out her power steering generators, and severely inhibiting <i>Hiei</i>&rsquo;s steering capability. <i>Helena</i> followed <i>San Francisco</i> to try and protect her from further harm.<p>Two of the U.S. destroyers now met a sudden demise. Either <i>Nagara</i>, or <i>Teruzuki</i>, and <i>Yukikaze</i> came upon the drifting <!--del_lnk--> <i>Cushing</i> and pounded her mercilessly with gunfire, knocking out all of her systems. Unable to fight back, <i>Cushing</i>&rsquo;s crew abandoned ship. <i>Cushing</i>&rsquo;s hulk sank several hours later. <!--del_lnk--> <i>Laffey</i>, having escaped from her engagement with <i>Hiei</i> suddenly encountered <i>Asagumo</i>, <i>Murasame</i>, <i>Samidare</i>, and, perhaps, <i>Teruzuki</i>. The Japanese destroyers pounded the <i>Laffey</i> with gunfire and then hit her with a torpedo which broke her <!--del_lnk--> keel. A few minutes later fires reached her ammunition <!--del_lnk--> magazines and she blew up and sank.<p><!--del_lnk--> <i>Portland</i>, after helping sink <i>Akatsuki</i>, was hit by a torpedo from <i>Inazuma</i> or <i>Ikazuchi</i>, causing heavy damage to her <!--del_lnk--> stern and forcing her to steer in a circle. After completing her first loop, she was able to fire four salvos at <i>Hiei</i>, but otherwise took little further part in the battle.<p><i>Yudachi</i> and <i>Amatsukaze</i> now independently charged the rear five ships of the U.S. formation. Two torpedoes from <i>Amatsukaze</i> hit <!--del_lnk--> <i>Barton</i>, immediately sinking her with heavy loss of life. <i>Yudachi</i> planted a torpedo in <!--del_lnk--> <i>Juneau</i>, stopping <i>Juneau</i> dead in the water, breaking her keel, and knocking out most of her systems. <i>Juneau</i> then turned east and slowly crept out of the battle area.<p><!--del_lnk--> <i>Monssen</i> avoided the wreck of <i>Barton</i> and motored onward looking for targets. She was suddenly accosted by <i>Asagumo</i>, <i>Murasame</i>, and <i>Samidare</i> who had just finished blasting <i>Laffey</i>. They proceeded to smother <i>Monssen</i> with gunfire, damaging her severely and forcing the crew to abandon ship. The hulk sank sometime later.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>After nearly 40 minutes of brutal, close-quarters fighting, the two sides broke contact and ceased fire at 02:26 after Abe and Captain Gilbert Hoover (the captain of <i>Helena</i> and senior surviving U.S. officer at this point) ordered their respective forces to disengage. Admiral Abe appeared to have a decisive victory in his grasp. He had one battleship (<i>Kirishima</i>), one light cruiser (<i>Nagara</i>), and four destroyers (<i>Asagumo</i>, <i>Teruzuki</i>, <i>Yukikaze</i>, and <i>Harusame</i>) with only light damage that could continue fighting (<i>Inazuma</i>, <i>Ikazuchi</i>, <i>Murasame</i>, and <i>Samidare</i> were damaged enough that their fighting ability was somewhat impaired). The U.S. had only one light cruiser (<i>Helena</i>) and one destroyer (<i>Fletcher</i>) that were still capable of effective resistance. The way appeared clear for Abe to bombard Henderson Field, and, perhaps, finish off the U.S. naval forces in the area, clearing the way for the troops and supplies to be landed safely on Guadalcanal.<p>However, at this crucial juncture, Abe chose to abandon the mission and depart the area. Several reasons are conjectured as to why he made this decision. Japanese commanders, from the beginning of the war, were constantly and strongly reminded of the crucial need to conserve fuel, ammunition, and to not risk ships unnecessarily. Thus, the damage to his flagship, <i>Hiei</i> and his other ships plus his expenditures of fuel and ammunition during the battle may have heavily concerned Abe. His own injuries and the deaths of some of his staff from battle action may have affected his thought processes. Perhaps he was also unsure as to how many of his or the U.S. ships were still combat-capable due to communication problems with the damaged <i>Hiei</i>. Furthermore, his own ships were scattered and would have taken some time to reassemble for a coordinated resumption of the mission to attack Henderson Field and the remnants of the U.S. warship force. For whatever reason, Abe now called for a disengagement and general retreat of his warships, although <i>Yukikaze</i> and <i>Teruzuki</i> remained behind to assist <i>Hiei</i>. <i>Samidare</i> picked-up survivors from <i>Yudachi</i> at 03:00 before joining the other Japanese ships in the retreat northwards.<p><a id="Aftermath" name="Aftermath"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Aftermath</span></h3>

      <p>At 03:00 on <!--del_lnk--> November 13, Admiral Yamamoto postponed the planned landings of the transports, which returned to the Shortlands to await further orders. Dawn revealed three crippled Japanese (<i>Hiei</i>, <i>Yudachi</i>, and <i>Amatsukaze</i>), and three crippled U.S. ships (<i>Portland</i>, <i>Atlanta</i>, and <i>Aaron Ward</i>) in the general vicinity of Savo Island. <!--del_lnk--> <i>Amatsukaze</i> was attacked by dive-bombers but managed to escape to Truk and eventually returned to action several months later. The abandoned hulk of <i>Yudachi</i> was sunk by <i>Portland</i>, whose guns still worked in spite of the other damage to the ship. The <!--del_lnk--> tugboat <!--del_lnk--> <i>Bobolink</i> motored around Ironbottom Sound throughout the day of November 13, assisting the crippled U.S. ships, rescuing U.S. survivors from the water, and, reportedly, shooting Japanese survivors floating in the water. <i>Hiei</i> was attacked repeatedly by Marine <!--del_lnk--> TBF Avenger torpedo planes from <!--del_lnk--> Henderson Field, TBFs and <!--del_lnk--> SBD Dauntless dive-bombers from the <a href="../../wp/a/Aircraft_carrier.htm" title="Aircraft carrier">carrier</a> <!--del_lnk--> <i>Enterprise</i>, and <!--del_lnk--> B-17 bombers of the <!--del_lnk--> United States Army Air Forces 11th Heavy Bombardment Group from <!--del_lnk--> Espiritu Santo. Abe transferred himself and his staff to <i>Yukikaze</i> at 08:15. <i>Kirishima</i> was ordered by Abe to take <i>Hiei</i> under tow, escorted by <i>Nagara</i> and its destroyers, but the attempt was cancelled because of the threat of submarine attack and <i>Hiei&#39;</i>s increasing unseaworthiness.<p><i>Portland</i>, <i>San Francisco</i>, <i>Aaron Ward,</i> <i>Sterett</i>, and <i>O&#39;Bannon</i> were eventually able to make it back to rear-area ports for repairs. <i>Atlanta</i>, however, sank near Guadalcanal at 20:00 on <!--del_lnk--> November 13. Departing from the Solomon Islands area with <i>San Francisco</i>, <i>Helena</i>, <i>Sterret</i>, and <i>O&#39;Bannon</i> later that day, <i>Juneau</i> was sunk by Japanese <!--del_lnk--> submarine <!--del_lnk--> <i>I-26</i>. <i>Juneau</i>&rsquo;s 100+ survivors (out of a total complement of 650) were left to fend on their own in the open ocean for eight days before rescue aircraft belatedly arrived. While awaiting rescue, all but 10 of <i>Juneau</i>&rsquo;s crew died from their injuries, the elements, or savage <a href="../../wp/s/Shark.htm" title="Shark">shark</a> attacks. The dead included the five <!--del_lnk--> Sullivan brothers<p>Due to the confused nature of the battle, the U.S. believed that they had sunk as many as seven Japanese ships. This, plus the Japanese retreat, caused the U.S. to believe at the time that they had won a significant victory. It was only after the war that the U.S. learned that they had suffered what most see as a crushing <i>tactical</i> defeat.<p>Nevertheless, most historians appear to agree that Abe&#39;s decision to retreat turned his tactical victory into a strategic defeat. Henderson Field remained operational with attack aircraft ready to deter the slow Japanese transports from approaching Gualdacanal with their precious cargoes. Plus, the Japanese had lost an opportunity to eliminate the U.S. naval forces in the area, a result which would have taken even the comparatively resource-rich U.S. some time to recover from. A reportedly furious Admiral Yamamoto relieved Abe of command and later directed his forced retirement from the military. However, it appears that Yamamoto may have been more angry over the loss of one of his battleships (<i>Hiei</i>) than he was over the abandonment of the supply mission and failure to completely destroy the U.S. force. Shortly before noon, Yamamoto ordered Vice Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Nobutake Kondo, commanding the Second Fleet, to form a new bombardment unit around <i>Kirishima</i> with fresh ships and attack Henderson Field on the night of November 14-15.<p>Including the sinking of <i>Juneau</i>, total U.S. losses in the battle were 1,439 dead. The Japanese suffered between 550 to 800 dead. Analyzing the impact of this engagement, historian <!--del_lnk--> Richard B.

      <p>Although the reinforcement effort to Guadalcanal was delayed, the Japanese didn&#39;t give up trying to complete the original mission, albeit a day later than originally planned. In the afternoon of <!--del_lnk--> November 13, the 11 transports resumed their journey towards Guadalcanal. A Japanese force of cruisers and destroyers, originally assigned to cover the unloading of the transports on the evening of <!--del_lnk--> November 13, was now given the mission that Abe&#39;s force had failed to carry out&mdash;the bombardment of Henderson Field. The battleship <i>Kirishima</i>, after abandonning its rescue effort of <i>Hiei</i> on the morning of the 13th, steamed north between <!--del_lnk--> Santa Isabel and <!--del_lnk--> Malaita Islands to form the new bombardment unit. After sustaining more damage from air attacks, <i>Hiei</i> sank northwest of Savo Island, perhaps after being scuttled by her remaining crew, in the late evening of <!--del_lnk--> November 13.<p>
       <br /> The cruiser force, consisting of Eighth Fleet units under its commander, Vice Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Gunichi Mikawa, included the heavy cruisers <!--del_lnk--> <i>Ch&#x14D;kai</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Kinugasa</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Maya</i>, and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Suzuya</i>, light cruisers <!--del_lnk--> <i>Isuzu</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Tenry&#x16B;</i>, and six destroyers. Mikawa&#39;s force was able to slip into the Guadalcanal area uncontested due to the withdrawal of the battered U.S. naval forces. <i>Suzuya</i> and <i>Maya</i> bombarded Henderson Field while the rest of Mikawa&#39;s force cruised around Savo Island guarding against any U.S. surface attack (which didn&#39;t occur). The 35-minute bombardment caused some damage to various aircraft and facilities at the airfield, but didn&#39;t put it out of operation. The cruiser force ended the bombardment around 02:30 on <!--del_lnk--> November 14 and cleared the area to head towards <!--del_lnk--> Rabaul via the Shortlands.<p>At daybreak, aircraft from Henderson Field, Espiritu Santo, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Enterprise</i> (stationed 200 miles south of Guadalcanal), began their attacks, first on Mikawa&#39;s force that was heading away from Guadalcanal, and then on the transport force heading towards Guadalcanal. The attacks on Mikawa&#39;s force sank the heavy cruiser <i>Kinugasa</i>, killing 511 of her crew, and damaged <i>Maya</i>, forcing her to go to Japan for repairs. Repeated air attacks on the transport force sank six of the transports and forced one more to turn back with heavy damage. Survivors from the transports were rescued by the convoy&#39;s escorting destroyers. A total of 450 army troops were reported to have perished. The remaining four transports and undamaged destroyers continued towards Guadalcanal after nightfall of <!--del_lnk--> November 14 but stopped west of Guadalcanal to await the finish of the warship surface action (below) before continuing.<p>Kondo&#39;s ad hoc force rendezvoused at <!--del_lnk--> Ontong Java on the evening of <!--del_lnk--> November 13, then reversed course and refueled out of range of Henderson Field&#39;s bombers on the morning of <!--del_lnk--> November 14. The U.S. <!--del_lnk--> submarine <i><!--del_lnk--> Trout</i> stalked but was unable to attack the <i>Kirishima</i> during refueling. The bombardment force continued south and came under air attack late in the afternoon of <!--del_lnk--> November 14, during which they were intercepted by the U.S. submarine <i><!--del_lnk--> Flying Fish</i> which launched five torpedos but scored no hits, then reported its contact by radio.<p><a id="Second_Naval_Battle_of_Guadalcanal.2C_November_14.E2.80.9315" name="Second_Naval_Battle_of_Guadalcanal.2C_November_14.E2.80.9315"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, November 14&ndash;15</span></h2>

      <p>To cover the unloading of the transports at Guadalcanal, the Japanese fleet made its third attempt to neutralize Henderson Field, sending the force of warships under Admiral Kondo through <!--del_lnk--> Indispensible Strait to bombard Guadalcanal on the night of <!--del_lnk--> November 14-<!--del_lnk--> 15.

      <p>Low on ships, Admiral <!--del_lnk--> William Halsey, Jr. detached the new battleships <!--del_lnk--> <i>Washington</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>South Dakota</i>, of <!--del_lnk--> <i>Enterprise</i>&#39;s support group, together with four destroyers, as Task Force 64 under Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Willis A. Lee to defend Guadalcanal. It was a scratch force; the battleships had only operated together for a few days, and the destroyers were from four different divisions&mdash;chosen simply because, of the available destroyers, they had the most fuel. The U.S. force arrived in Ironbottom Sound in the early evening of <!--del_lnk--> November 14 and began patrolling around Savo Island. The U.S. warships were in column formation with the four destroyers in the lead, followed by <i>Washington</i>, with <i>South Dakota</i> bringing up the rear. At 22:55 on <!--del_lnk--> November 14, radar on the <i>South Dakota</i> and <i>Washington</i> began to detect the ships of the Japanese force near Savo Island around 18,000&nbsp;m range. <a id="Action_2" name="Action_2"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Action</span></h3>
      <p>Kondo split his force into several groups, with one group, consisting of <i>Sendai</i> and destroyers <!--del_lnk--> <i>Shikinami</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Uranami</i> (&quot;C&quot; on the maps), sweeping along the east side of Savo Island, and destroyer <!--del_lnk--> <i>Ayanami</i> (&quot;B&quot; on the maps) sweeping counterclockwise around the southwest side of Savo Island to check for the presence of Allied ships. The Japanese ships spotted Lee&#39;s force around 23:00, though Kondo misidentified the battleships as cruisers. Kondo ordered the <i>Sendai</i> group of ships, plus <i>Nagara</i> and four destroyers (&quot;D&quot; on the maps) to engage and destroy the U.S. force before he brought the bombardment force of <i>Kirishima</i> and heavy cruisers (&quot;E&quot; on the maps) into Ironbottom Sound. The U.S. ships (&quot;A&quot; on the maps) detected the <i>Sendai</i> force on radar, but didn&#39;t detect the other groups of Japanese ships. Using radar targeting, the two U.S. battleships opened fire on the <i>Sendai</i> group at 23:17. Admiral Lee ordered a cease fire about five minutes later after the radar returns on the northern group appeared to disappear from his ship&#39;s radar scopes. However, <i>Sendai</i>, <i>Uranami</i>, and <i>Shikinami</i> were undamaged and circled out of the danger area.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Meanwhile, the four U.S. destroyers in the vanguard of the U.S. formation began engaging both <i>Ayanami</i> and the <i>Nagara</i> group of ships at 23:22. <i>Nagara</i> and her escorting destroyers responded effectively with accurate gunfire and torpedoes and U.S. destroyers <!--del_lnk--> <i>Walke</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Preston</i> were hit and sunk within 10&nbsp;minutes with heavy loss of life. The U.S. destroyer <!--del_lnk--> <i>Benham</i> had part of her bow blown off by a torpedo and had to retreat (she sank the next day) and U.S. destroyer <!--del_lnk--> <i>Gwin</i> was hit in her engine room and put out of the fight. However, the U.S. destroyers had completed their mission as screens for the battleships, absorbing the initial impact of contact with the enemy, although at great cost. Lee ordered the retirement of <i>Benham</i> and <i>Gwin</i> at 23:48.<p><i>Washington</i> passed through the area still occupied by the damaged and sinking U.S. destroyers and fired on <i>Ayanami</i> with her secondary batteries, setting her afire. Following close behind, <i>South Dakota</i> suddenly suffered a series of electrical failures, reportedly during repairs when her chief engineer locked down a <!--del_lnk--> circuit breaker in violation of safety procedures, causing her circuits repeatedly to go into <!--del_lnk--> series, making her radar and most of her gun batteries inoperable. However, she continued to follow <i>Washington</i> towards the western side of Savo Island. Receiving reports from <i>Ayanami</i> and others of his ships of the destruction of the U.S. destroyers, Kondo now pointed his bombardment force towards Guadalcanal, believing that the U.S. warship force had been defeated. His force and the two U.S. battleships were now heading towards each other.<p>Almost blind and unable to effectively fire her main and secondary armament, <i>South Dakota</i> was targeted by gunfire and torpedoes by most of the ships of the Japanese force, including <i>Kirishima</i>, beginning about 00:00 on <!--del_lnk--> November 15. Although able to score a few hits on <i>Kirishima</i>, <i>South Dakota</i> took between 36 and 42 medium and large caliber hits to her superstructure, some of which did not explode, that completely knocked out her communications and remaining gunfire control operations, set portions of her upper decks on fire, and forced her to try to steer away from the engagement. (The &quot;Gunfire Damage Report&quot; made by the <!--del_lnk--> Bureau of Ships showed 26 damaging hits and can be found at <!--del_lnk--> 6th and succeeding photos) All of the Japanese torpedoes missed. Admiral Lee later described the cumulative effect of the gunfire damage to <i>South Dakota</i> as to, &quot;render one of our new battleships deaf, dumb, blind, and impotent.&quot; <i>South Dakota&#39;</i>s crew casualties were 39 killed and 59 wounded, and she turned away from the battle at 00:17 without informing Admiral Lee, though observed by Kondo&#39;s lookouts.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The Japanese ships had continued to concentrate their fire on <i>South Dakota</i> and none had detected <i>Washington</i> approaching to within 9,000 yards. From this close range, the <i>Washington</i> suddenly hit <i>Kirishima</i> with at least nine main battery shells, causing heavy damage and setting her aflame. <i>Kirishima</i> was hit below the waterline and suffered a jammed rudder, causing her to circle uncontrollably to <!--del_lnk--> port.<p>At 00:25 Kondo ordered all of his ships that were able to converge, to try to destroy any remaining U.S. ships. However, the Japanese ships still didn&#39;t know where <i>Washington</i> was located and the other surviving U.S. ships had already departed the battle area. <i>Washington</i> steered a northwesterly course towards the <!--del_lnk--> Russell Islands to draw the Japanese force away from Guadalcanal and the presumably damaged <i>South Dakota</i>. The Japanese ships finally sighted <i>Washington</i> and launched several torpedo attacks but by adroit maneuvering by her captain, <i>Washington</i> avoided all of them and also grounding his ship in shallow waters. At length, believing that the way was clear for the transport convoy to proceed to Guadalcanal (but apparently disregarding the threat of air attack in the morning), Kondo ordered his remaining ships to break contact and retreat from the area about 01:04, which the Japanese ships complied with by 01:30.<p><a id="Aftermath_2" name="Aftermath_2"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Aftermath</span></h3>
      <p>Both <i>Kirishima</i> and <i>Ayanami</i> were <!--del_lnk--> scuttled and sank by 03:25, November 15. <i>Uranami</i> rescued survivors from <i>Ayanami</i> and destroyers <i>Asagumo</i>, <i>Teruzuki</i>, and <i>Samidare</i> rescued the remaining crew from <i>Kirishima</i>. In the engagement, 242 U.S. and 249 Japanese sailors died. The engagement was one of only two battleship-against-battleship surface battles in the entire Pacific campaign of World War II.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The four Japanese transports beached themselves at Tassafaronga on Guadalcanal by 04:00, November 15. The transports were attacked, beginning at 05:55 by U.S. aircraft from Henderson Field and elsewhere, and field artillery from U.S. ground forces on Guadalcanal. Later, U.S. destroyer <i><!--del_lnk--> Meade</i>, approached and opened fire on the beached transports and surrounding area. These attacks set the transports afire and destroyed any equipment on them that the Japanese hadn&#39;t managed to quickly unload. Only 2,000-3,000 of the troops originally embarked actually made it to Guadalcanal and most of their ammunition and food supplies were lost. These troops and meager supplies weren&#39;t enough to have a significant effect on the Japanese defense of Guadalcanal.<p>Yamamoto&#39;s reaction to Kondo&#39;s failure to accomplish his mission of neutralizing Henderson Field and ensuring the safe landing of troops and supplies was milder than his earlier reaction to Abe&#39;s withdrawal, perhaps due to Imperial Navy culture and politics. Kondo, who also held the position of second in command of the Combined Fleet, was a member of the upper staff and battleship &quot;clique&quot; of the Imperial Navy while Abe was a career destroyer specialist. Admiral Kondo wasn&#39;t reprimanded or reassigned, but instead was left in command of one of the large ship fleets based at Truk.<p><a id="Significance" name="Significance"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Significance</span></h2>
      <p>The Naval Battle of Guadalcanal was the last major attempt by the Japanese to seize control of the seas around Guadalcanal or to retake the island. From then on, Japanese air and naval operations around Guadalcanal were defensive in nature, either to provide subsistence supplies to the Japanese forces on Guadalcanal, or beginning in January, 1943, attempts to evacuate and redeploy them elsewhere. In contrast, the U.S. Navy was thereafter able to resupply the U.S. forces at Guadalcanal at will, including the delivery of two fresh divisions by late December, 1942. The inability to neutralize Henderson Field doomed the Japanese effort to successfully combat the Allied conquest of Guadalcanal. The last resistance in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Guadalcanal ended on <!--del_lnk--> February 9, <!--del_lnk--> 1943 with the successful evacuation of the surviving Japanese troops on the island by the Japanese navy.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The securing of Guadalcanal and surrounding islands by Allied forces was the first step in their eventual conquest of the entire Solomon Islands chain and the isolation and neutralization of the major Japanese base at <!--del_lnk--> Rabaul, <!--del_lnk--> New Britain. Although the Allies and Japan engaged in several more intense and bloody naval battles during the Solomon Islands campaign, including some in which the Japanese emerged victorious, the Allied advance was never halted or even slowed to any appreciable extent. The capture of the Solomon Islands, along with New Guinea and New Britain, eventually led to the <!--del_lnk--> liberation of the Philippines in 1944 and early 1945, and then to invasion of Japan itself, <!--del_lnk--> at Okinawa and <!--del_lnk--> Iwo Jima, and the final defeat of Japan in August, 1945. Many historians believe the Battle of Guadalcanal to be just as key a turning point in the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific War as the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Midway.htm" title="Battle of Midway">Battle of Midway</a> was six months earlier. In fact, the Japanese considered the Battle of Guadalcanal to be more significant than Midway. <!--del_lnk--> Historian <!--del_lnk--> Eric Hammel sums up the significance of the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal this way:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">
