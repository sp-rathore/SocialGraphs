Before his presidency he was a prominent anti-<!--del_lnk--> apartheid activist and leader of the <!--del_lnk--> African National Congress. He was tried and imprisoned for his involvement in <!--del_lnk--> underground armed resistance activities. The armed struggle was a last resort; he had remained steadfastly committed to <!--del_lnk--> non-violence. Through his 27-year imprisonment, much of it spent in a cell on <!--del_lnk--> Robben Island, Mandela became the most widely known figure in the struggle against South African apartheid. Although the apartheid regime and nations sympathetic to it considered him and the <!--del_lnk--> ANC to be communists and terrorists, the armed struggle was an integral part of the overall campaign against apartheid. The switch in policy to that of reconciliation, which Mandela pursued upon his release in 1990, facilitated a peaceful transition to fully-representative democracy in South Africa.<p>Having received <!--del_lnk--> over a hundred awards over four decades, Mandela is currently a celebrated elder <!--del_lnk--> statesman who continues to voice his opinion on topical issues. In South Africa he is often known as <b>Madiba</b>, an honorary title adopted by elders of Mandela&#39;s clan. The title has come to be synonymous with Nelson Mandela. Many South Africans also refer to him reverently as &#39;mkhulu&#39; (grandfather).<p>

</script><a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
      <p>Mandela was born to a <!--del_lnk--> Thembu family in the small village of <!--del_lnk--> Qunu in the <!--del_lnk--> Mthatha district, capital of the <!--del_lnk--> Transkeian Territories of the <!--del_lnk--> Cape Province of <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">the Union of South Africa</a>. Mandela&#39;s father, <!--del_lnk--> Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa, was a member for the royal council of the Thembu people, a position for which he was groomed from birth and which Mandela was also destined to inherit. Mandela&#39;s father was instrumental in the ascension to the Thembu throne of <!--del_lnk--> Jongintaba Dalindyebo, who would later return this favour by informally adopting Mandela upon Gadla&#39;s death. In total, Mandela&#39;s father had four wives, with whom he fathered a total of thirteen children (four boys and nine girls). Mandela was born to Gadla&#39;s third wife (&#39;third&#39; by a complex royal ranking system), <!--del_lnk--> Nosekeni Fanny in whose <i><!--del_lnk--> umzi</i> or <!--del_lnk--> homestead Mandela spent much of his childhood. His name Rolihlahla means one who brings trouble to himself.<p>At seven years of age, Rolihlahla Mandela became the first member of his family to attend a school, where he was given the name &quot;Nelson&quot;, after the British admiral <!--del_lnk--> Horatio Nelson, by a <!--del_lnk--> Methodist teacher. His father died of tuberculosis when Rolihlahla was nine, and the Regent, Jongintaba, became his guardian. Mandela attended a <!--del_lnk--> Wesleyan mission school next door to the palace of the <!--del_lnk--> regent. Following Thembu custom, he was <!--del_lnk--> initiated at age sixteen, and attended <!--del_lnk--> Clarkebury Boarding Institute, learning about <!--del_lnk--> Western culture. He completed his <!--del_lnk--> Junior Certificate in two years, instead of the usual three.<p>At age nineteen, in 1937, Mandela moved to <!--del_lnk--> Healdtown, the Wesleyan college in <!--del_lnk--> Fort Beaufort, which most Thembu <!--del_lnk--> royalty attended, and took an interest in <!--del_lnk--> boxing and <!--del_lnk--> running. After <!--del_lnk--> matriculating, he started to study for a <!--del_lnk--> B.A. at the <!--del_lnk--> Fort Hare University, where he met <!--del_lnk--> Oliver Tambo, and the two became lifelong friends and colleagues.<p>At the end of his first year, he became involved in a boycott of the <!--del_lnk--> Students&#39; Representative Council against the university policies, and was asked to leave <!--del_lnk--> Fort Hare. Shortly after this, Jongintaba announced to Mandela and Justice (the Regent&#39;s own son and heir to the throne) that he had arranged marriages for both of them. Both young men were displeased by this and rather than marry, they elected to flee the comforts of the Regent&#39;s estate to the only place they could: <a href="../../wp/j/Johannesburg.htm" title="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>. Upon his arrival in Johannesburg, Mandela initially found employment as a guard at a mine. However, this was quickly terminated after the employer learned that Mandela was the Regent&#39;s runaway adopted son. He then managed to find work as an articled <!--del_lnk--> clerk at a law firm thanks to connections with his friend and fellow lawyer <!--del_lnk--> Walter Sisulu. While working, he completed his degree at the <!--del_lnk--> University of South Africa (UNISA) via correspondence, after which he started with his law studies at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Witwatersrand. During this time Mandela lived in a township called <!--del_lnk--> Alexandra.<p><a id="Political_activity" name="Political_activity"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Political activity</span></h2>
      <p>After the 1948 election victory of the <!--del_lnk--> Afrikaner-dominated <!--del_lnk--> National Party with its <!--del_lnk--> apartheid policy of <!--del_lnk--> racial segregation, Mandela was prominent in the ANC&#39;s 1952 <!--del_lnk--> Defiance Campaign and the 1955 <!--del_lnk--> Congress of the People, whose adoption of the <!--del_lnk--> Freedom Charter provided the fundamental program of the anti-apartheid cause. During this time, Mandela and fellow lawyer <!--del_lnk--> Oliver Tambo operated the law firm of <!--del_lnk--> Mandela and Tambo, providing free or low-cost legal counsel to many blacks who would otherwise have been without legal representation.<p>Initially committed to <!--del_lnk--> non-violent mass struggle, Mandela was arrested with 150 others on 5 December 1956, and charged with treason. The marathon <!--del_lnk--> Treason Trial of 1956&ndash;61 followed, and all were acquitted. From 1952&ndash;59 the ANC experienced disruption as a new class of Black activists (Africanists) emerged in the townships demanding more drastic steps against the National Party regime. The ANC leadership of <!--del_lnk--> Albert Luthuli, <!--del_lnk--> Oliver Tambo and <!--del_lnk--> Walter Sisulu felt not only that events were moving too fast, but also that their leadership was challenged. They consequently bolstered their position by alliances with small White, Coloured and Indian political parties in an attempt to appear to have a wider appeal than the Africanists. The 1955 <!--del_lnk--> Freedom Charter Kliptown Conference was ridiculed by the Africanists for allowing the 100,000-strong ANC to be relegated to a single vote in a Congress alliance, in which four secretary-generals of the five participating parties were members of the secretly reconstituted <!--del_lnk--> South African Communist Party (SACP), strongly adhering to the Moscow line.<p>In 1959, the ANC lost its most militant support when most of the Africanists, with financial support from <a href="../../wp/g/Ghana.htm" title="Ghana">Ghana</a> and significant political support from the <!--del_lnk--> Transvaal-based <!--del_lnk--> Basotho, broke away to form the <!--del_lnk--> Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) under <!--del_lnk--> Robert Sobukwe and <!--del_lnk--> Potlako Leballo. Following the massacre of PAC supporters at <!--del_lnk--> Sharpeville, in March 1960, and the subsequent banning of PAC and ANC, the ANC/SACP followed the African Resistance Movement (renegade liberals) and PAC into armed resistance. Luthuli, criticised for inertia, was peripheralised, and the ANC/SACP used the <!--del_lnk--> All-In African Conference of 1961, where all parties met to decide a joint strategy, for Mandela to issue a dramatic call to arms, announcing the formation of <!--del_lnk--> Umkhonto we Sizwe, modeled on the <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> <!--del_lnk--> guerrilla movement, <!--del_lnk--> Irgun, and commanded by Mandela with SACP Jewish activists <!--del_lnk--> Denis Goldberg, <!--del_lnk--> Lionel &quot;Rusty&quot; Bernstein, and <!--del_lnk--> Harold Wolpe.<p>Mandela then left the country secretly and met African leaders in <a href="../../wp/a/Algeria.htm" title="Algeria">Algeria</a> and elsewhere. Startled to discover the depth of support for the PAC and the widespread belief that the ANC was a small Xhosa tribal association manipulated by White <!--del_lnk--> communists, Mandela returned to South Africa determined to reassert the African nationalist element in the <!--del_lnk--> Congress Alliance. It is widely suspected that a heated discussion with the communist leaders over this issue led to his subsequent betrayal and arrest near Howick.<sup title="Weasel words">[<!--del_lnk--> <i>weasel&nbsp;words</i>]</sup> Mandela glossed over these events in his autobiography but at least one prominent SACP activist associated with him at that time was cold-shouldered on his return to South Africa.<p><a id="Arrest_and_imprisonment" name="Arrest_and_imprisonment"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Arrest and imprisonment</span></h2>
      <p>In 1961, Mandela became the leader of the <!--del_lnk--> ANC&#39;s armed wing, <!--del_lnk--> Umkhonto we Sizwe (translated as <i>Spear of the Nation</i>, also abbreviated as <i>MK</i>), which he co-founded. He co-ordinated a sabotage campaign against <!--del_lnk--> military and <a href="../../wp/g/Government.htm" title="Government">government</a> targets, and made plans for a possible <!--del_lnk--> guerrilla war if sabotage failed to end <!--del_lnk--> apartheid. A few decades later, MK did indeed wage a guerrilla war against the regime, especially during the 1980s, in which many <!--del_lnk--> civilians were killed. Mandela also raised funds for MK abroad, and arranged for <!--del_lnk--> paramilitary training, visiting various African governments.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 5 August <!--del_lnk--> 1962, he was arrested after living on the run for seventeen months and was imprisoned in the Johannesburg Fort. According to <!--del_lnk--> William Blum, a former <!--del_lnk--> U.S. State Department employee, the <!--del_lnk--> CIA tipped off the police as to Mandela&#39;s whereabouts. Three days later, the charges of leading workers to strike in 1961 and leaving the country illegally were read to him during a court appearance. On <!--del_lnk--> 25 October <!--del_lnk--> 1962, Mandela was sentenced to five years in <!--del_lnk--> prison. Two years later on <!--del_lnk--> 11 June <!--del_lnk--> 1964, a verdict had been reached concerning his previous engagement in the <!--del_lnk--> African National Congress (ANC).<p>While Mandela was in prison, police arrested prominent ANC leaders on <!--del_lnk--> 11 July <!--del_lnk--> 1963, at Liliesleaf Farm, Rivonia, north of Johannesburg. Mandela was brought in, and at the <!--del_lnk--> Rivonia Trial, Mandela, <!--del_lnk--> Ahmed Kathrada, <!--del_lnk--> Walter Sisulu, <!--del_lnk--> Govan Mbeki, <!--del_lnk--> Andrew Mlangeni, <!--del_lnk--> Raymond Mhlaba, <!--del_lnk--> Elias Motsoaledi, <!--del_lnk--> Walter Mkwayi (who escaped during trial), <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Goldreich (who escaped from prison before trial), <!--del_lnk--> Denis Goldberg and <!--del_lnk--> Lionel &quot;Rusty&quot; Bernstein were charged by <!--del_lnk--> Percy Yutar with the capital crimes of sabotage and crimes which were equivalent to <!--del_lnk--> treason, but easier for the government to prove.<p>In his statement from the dock at the opening of the defence case in the trial on <!--del_lnk--> 20 April <!--del_lnk--> 1964 at <a href="../../wp/p/Pretoria.htm" title="Pretoria">Pretoria</a> Supreme Court, Mandela laid out the clarity of reasoning in the ANC&#39;s choice to use violence as a tactic. His statement revealed how the ANC had used peaceful means to resist apartheid for years until the <!--del_lnk--> Sharpeville Massacre. That event coupled with the referendum establishing the Republic of South Africa and the declaration of a state of emergency along with the banning of the ANC made it clear that their only choice was to resist through acts of sabotage. Doing otherwise would have been tantamount to unconditional surrender. Mandela went on to explain how they developed the <!--del_lnk--> Manifesto of Umkhonto on <!--del_lnk--> 16 December <!--del_lnk--> 1961 intent on exposing the failure of the National Party&#39;s policies after the economy would be threatened by foreigners&#39; unwillingness to risk investing in the country. He closed his statement with these words:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

This was widely seen as a major step in the reconciliation of white and black South Africans.<p>It was also during his administration that South Africa entered the space age with the launch of the <!--del_lnk--> SUNSAT <!--del_lnk--> satellite in February 1999. It was was designed by students of <!--del_lnk--> University of Stellenbosch and was used primarily for photographing land in South Africa related to vegetation and forestry concerns.<p>However, his administration attracted some criticism. In what was <!--del_lnk--> South Africa&#39;s first post-apartheid military operation Mandela ordered troops into <a href="../../wp/l/Lesotho.htm" title="Lesotho">Lesotho</a> in September 1998. <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> Pakalitha Mosisili was elected in rigged elections which prompted fierce opposition threatening the unstable government. Lesotho is surrounded and economically dependent on its neighbour and also provides South Africa with jobs and remittances from workers. Troops were brought in to protect the government and secure the <!--del_lnk--> Katse dam project which provides water supplies to South Africa&rsquo;s dry industrial heartland.<p>Certain interest groups were also disappointed with the social achievements of his term of office, particularly the government&#39;s ineffectiveness in stemming the <a href="../../wp/a/AIDS.htm" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> crisis. After his <!--del_lnk--> retirement, Mandela admitted that he may have failed his country by not paying more attention to the <a href="../../wp/a/AIDS.htm" title="AIDS">HIV/AIDS</a> epidemic. He has taken many opportunities since to highlight this South African tragedy.<p><a id="International_diplomacy" name="International_diplomacy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">International diplomacy</span></h2>
      <p>President Mandela took a particular interest in helping to resolve the long-running dispute between Libya on the one hand, and the United States and Britain on the other, over bringing to trial the two Libyans who were accused of sabotaging <a href="../../wp/p/Pan_Am_Flight_103.htm" title="Pan Am Flight 103">Pan Am Flight 103</a> on <!--del_lnk--> 21 December <!--del_lnk--> 1988 with the loss of 270 lives. In November 1994, Mandela offered South Africa as a neutral venue for the <!--del_lnk--> Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial but the offer was rejected by British Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> John Major. A further three years elapsed until Mandela&#39;s offer was repeated to Major&#39;s successor, <a href="../../wp/t/Tony_Blair.htm" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a>, when the president visited London in July 1997. Later the same year, at the <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) at <a href="../../wp/e/Edinburgh.htm" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> in October 1997, Mandela warned: &quot;No one nation should be <!--del_lnk--> complainant, <!--del_lnk--> prosecutor and <!--del_lnk--> judge.&quot; A compromise solution was then agreed for a trial to be held at <!--del_lnk--> Camp Zeist in the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, governed by <!--del_lnk--> Scots law, and President Mandela began negotiations with Colonel <!--del_lnk--> Gaddafi for the handover of the two accused (<!--del_lnk--> Megrahi and <!--del_lnk--> Fhimah) in April 1999.<p>At the end of their nine-month trial, the verdict was announced on <!--del_lnk--> 31 January <!--del_lnk--> 2001. Fhimah was acquitted but Megrahi was convicted and sentenced to 27 years in a Scottish jail. Megrahi&#39;s appeal was turned down in March 2002, and former president Mandela went to visit him in Barlinnie prison on <!--del_lnk--> 10 June <!--del_lnk--> 2002. &quot;Megrahi is all alone&quot;, Mandela told a packed press conference in the prison&#39;s visitors room. &quot;He has nobody he can talk to. It is psychological persecution that a man must stay for the length of his long sentence all alone.&quot; Mandela added: &quot;It would be fair if he were transferred to a Muslim country &mdash; and there are Muslim countries which are trusted by the West. It will make it easier for his family to visit him if he is in a place like the kingdom of Morocco, Tunisia or Egypt.&quot; Megrahi was subsequently moved to Greenock jail and is no longer in solitary confinement. His case is currently being reviewed by the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission, which is expected to rule that Megrahi&#39;s case should be referred back to the Scottish <!--del_lnk--> High Court of Justiciary for a fresh appeal.<p><a id="Marriages" name="Marriages"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Marriages</span></h2>
      <p>Mandela has been married three times. His first marriage was to <!--del_lnk--> Evelyn Ntoko Mase who, like Mandela, was also from what later became the <!--del_lnk--> Transkei area of South Africa, although they actually met in Johannesburg. The couple had two sons, Madiba Thembekile (Thembi) (born 1946) and Makgatho (born 1950), and two daughters, both named Makaziwe (born 1947 and 1953). Their first daughter died aged nine months, and they named their second daughter in her honour. The couple broke up in 1957 after 13 years, divorcing under the multiple strains of his constant absences, devotion to revolutionary agitation, and the fact she was a <!--del_lnk--> Jehovah&#39;s Witness, a religion which professes political neutrality. Thembi was killed in a car crash in 1969 at the age of 25, while Mandela was imprisoned on Robben Island. All their children were educated at the <!--del_lnk--> Waterford Kamhlaba.<p>Mandela&#39;s second wife, <!--del_lnk--> Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, also came from the Transkei area, although they, too, met in Johannesburg, where she was the city&#39;s first black social worker. They had two daughters, Zenani, born 4 February 1958, and Zindziswa (Zindzi), born 1960. Later, Winnie would be deeply torn by family discord which mirrored the country&#39;s political strife; while her husband was serving a life sentence on the Robben Island prison for terrorism and treason, her father became the agriculture minister in the Transkei. The marriage ended in separation (April 1992) and divorce (March 1996), fuelled by political estrangement.<p>On his 80th birthday, he married <!--del_lnk--> Gra&ccedil;a Machel, widow of <!--del_lnk--> Samora Machel, the former <a href="../../wp/m/Mozambique.htm" title="Mozambique">Mozambican</a> president and ANC ally killed in an air crash 12 years earlier.<p><a id="Retirement" name="Retirement"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Retirement</span></h2>
      <p>After his retirement as President in 1999, Mandela went on to become an advocate for a variety of social and human rights organizations. He received many foreign honours, including the <!--del_lnk--> Order of Merit and the <!--del_lnk--> Order of St. John from <a href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Presidential Medal of Freedom from <a href="../../wp/g/George_W._Bush.htm" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>.<p>As an example of his popular acclaim, in his tour of <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a> in 1998, he included a speaking engagement in <!--del_lnk--> SkyDome in the city of <a href="../../wp/t/Toronto.htm" title="Toronto">Toronto</a> where he spoke to 45,000 school children who greeted him with intense adulation. In 2001, he was the first living person to be made an <!--del_lnk--> honorary Canadian citizen (the only previous recipient, <!--del_lnk--> Raoul Wallenberg, was awarded honorary citizenship posthumously). Although the government of Canada had hoped that the vote to make Mandela a citizen would be unanimous, this was not possible due to <!--del_lnk--> Canadian Alliance <!--del_lnk--> MP <!--del_lnk--> Rob Anders who stood up in the <a href="../../wp/c/Canadian_House_of_Commons.htm" title="Canadian House of Commons">Canadian House of Commons</a> and claimed Mandela was a former &quot;communist and a terrorist&quot;. While in Canada, he was also made an honorary Companion of the <a href="../../wp/o/Order_of_Canada.htm" title="Order of Canada">Order of Canada</a>, one of the few foreigners to receive Canada&#39;s highest honour.<p>In summer 2001, Mandela was diagnosed and treated for <a href="../../wp/p/Prostate_cancer.htm" title="Prostate cancer">prostate cancer</a>. He was treated with a seven week course of radiation <!--del_lnk--> .<p>In 2003, Mandela attacked the foreign policy of the <a href="../../wp/g/George_W._Bush.htm" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> <!--del_lnk--> administration in a number of speeches. Criticizing the lack of <!--del_lnk--> UN involvement in the decision to begin the <!--del_lnk--> War in Iraq, he said &quot;It is a tragedy, what is happening, what Bush is doing. But Bush is now undermining the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>,&quot; Mandela stated he would support action against Iraq only if it is ordered by the <!--del_lnk--> UN. Mandela also insinuated that President Bush may have been motivated by <!--del_lnk--> racism in not following the <!--del_lnk--> UN and its secretary-general <a href="../../wp/k/Kofi_Annan.htm" title="Kofi Annan">Kofi Annan</a> on the issue of the <!--del_lnk--> War in Iraq. &quot;Is it because the secretary-general of the United Nations is now a black man? They never did that when secretary-generals were white&quot;, Mandela said.<p>He urged the people of the <!--del_lnk--> US to join massive protests against Mr. Bush and called on world leaders, especially those with vetoes in the <!--del_lnk--> UN Security Council, to oppose him. &quot;What I am condemning is that one power, with a president who has no foresight, who cannot think properly, is now wanting to plunge the world into a <a href="../../wp/t/The_Holocaust.htm" title="Holocaust">holocaust</a>.&quot; He attacked the United States for its record on human rights and for dropping <!--del_lnk--> atomic bombs on <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. &quot;If there is a country that has committed unspeakable atrocities in the world, it is the United States of America. They don&#39;t care.&quot;  The comments caused a rare moment of controversy and criticism for Mandela, even among some supporters.<div class="thumb tleft">
