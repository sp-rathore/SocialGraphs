      <p><b>Neoclassicism</b> (sometimes rendered as <b>Neo-Classicism</b> or <b>Neo-classicism</b>) is the name given to quite distinct <!--del_lnk--> movements in the <!--del_lnk--> decorative and <!--del_lnk--> visual arts, <a href="../../wp/l/Literature.htm" title="Literature">literature</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Theatre.htm" title="Theatre">theatre</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Music.htm" title="Music">music</a>, and <a href="../../wp/a/Architecture.htm" title="Architecture">architecture</a>.

This article addresses what these &quot;neoclassicisms&quot; have in common.<p>What any &quot;neo&quot;-classicism depends on most fundamentally is a consensus about a body of work that has achieved <i><!--del_lnk--> canonic</i> status (<i>illustration, below</i>). These are the &quot;classics.&quot; Ideally&mdash; and neoclassicism is essentially an art of an ideal&mdash; an artist, well-schooled and comfortably familiar with the canon, does not repeat it in lifeless reproductions, but synthesizes the tradition anew in each work. This sets a high standard, clearly; but though a neoclassical artist who fails to achieve it may create works that are inane, vacuous or even mediocre, gaffes of taste and failures of craftsmanship are not commonly neoclassical failings. Novelty, improvisation, self-expression, and blinding inspiration are not neoclassical virtues; neoclassicism exhibits perfect control of an idiom. It does not recreate art forms from the ground up with each new project, as <!--del_lnk--> modernism demanded. &quot;Make it new&quot; was the modernist credo of the poet <a href="../../wp/e/Ezra_Pound.htm" title="Ezra Pound">Ezra Pound</a>.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Speaking and thinking in English, &quot;neoclassicism&quot; in each art implies a particular canon of &quot;classic&quot; models. <a href="../../wp/v/Virgil.htm" title="Virgil">Virgil</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Raphael, <!--del_lnk--> Nicolas Poussin, <a href="../../wp/j/Joseph_Haydn.htm" title="Joseph Haydn">Haydn</a>. Other cultures have other canons of classics, however, and a recurring strain of neoclassicism appears to be a natural expression of a culture at a certain moment in its career, a culture that is highly self-aware, that is also confident of its own high mainstream tradition, but at the same time feels the need to <i>regain</i> something that has slipped away: <!--del_lnk--> Apollonius of Rhodes is a neoclassic writer; <a href="../../wp/m/Ming_Dynasty.htm" title="Ming Dynasty">Ming</a> ceramics pay homage to Sung <!--del_lnk--> celadon <!--del_lnk--> porcelains; Italian 15th century humanists learn to write a &quot;Roman&quot; hand we call <!--del_lnk--> italic (a.k.a. <!--del_lnk--> Carolingian); Neo-Babylonian culture is a neoclassical revival, and in <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Empire.htm" title="Persian Empire">Persia</a> the &quot;classic&quot; religion of <a href="../../wp/z/Zoroaster.htm" title="Zoroaster">Zoroaster</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Zoroastrianism, is revived after centuries, to &quot;re-Persianize&quot; a culture that had fallen away from its own classic Achaemenean past. Within the direct Western tradition, the earliest movement motivated by a neoclassicial inspiration is a Roman style that was first distinguished by the German art historian <!--del_lnk--> Friedrich Hauser (<i>Die Neuattische Reliefs</i> Stuttgart 1889), who identified the style-category he called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Neo-Attic&quot; among sculpture produced in later Hellenistic circles during the last century or so BCE and in Imperial Rome; the corpus that Hauser called &quot;Neo-Attic&quot; consists of bas reliefs molded on decorative vessels and plaques, employing a figural and drapery style that looked for its canon of &quot;classic&quot; models to late 5th and early 4th century Athens and Attica.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p>In the <!--del_lnk--> visual arts the European movement called &quot;neoclassicism&quot; began after <i>ca</i> 1765, as a reaction against both the surviving <a href="../../wp/b/Baroque.htm" title="Baroque">Baroque</a> and <a href="../../wp/r/Rococo.htm" title="Rococo">Rococo</a> styles, and as a desire to return to the perceived &quot;purity&quot; of the arts of <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Rome</a>, the more vague perception (&quot;ideal&quot;) of <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Ancient Greek</a> arts (where almost no western artist had actually been) and, to a lesser extent, 16th century <!--del_lnk--> Renaissance Classicism.<p>Contrasting with the <a href="../../wp/b/Baroque.htm" title="Baroque">Baroque</a> and the <a href="../../wp/r/Rococo.htm" title="Rococo">Rococo</a>, Neo-classical paintings are devoid of pastel colors and haziness; instead, they have sharp colors with <!--del_lnk--> Chiaroscuro. In the case of Neo-classicism in France, a prime example is <!--del_lnk--> Jacques Louis David whose paintings often use Greek elements to extol the <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>&#39;s virtues (state before family).<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Each &quot;neo&quot;- classicism selects some models among the range of possible classics that are available to it, and ignores others. The neoclassical writers and talkers, patrons and collectors, artists and sculptors of 1765 - 1830 paid homage to an <i>idea</i> of the generation of <!--del_lnk--> Pheidias, but the sculpture examples they actually embraced were more likely to be Roman copies of Hellenistic sculptures. They ignored both Archaic Greek art and the works of Late Antiquity. The Rococo art of ancient <!--del_lnk--> Palmyra came as a revelation, through engravings in Wood&#39;s <i>The Ruins of Palmyra</i>. Even in all-but-unvisited Greece, a rough backwater of the Ottoman Empire, dangerous to explore, neoclassicists&#39; appreciation of Greek architecture was mediated through drawings and engravings, which subtly smoothed and regularized, &quot;corrected&#39; and &quot;restored&quot; the monuments of Greece, not always consciously. As for painting, Greek painting was utterly lost: neoclassicist painters imaginatively revived it, partly through bas-relief friezes, mosaics, and pottery painting and partly through the examples of painting and decoration of the High Renaissance of <!--del_lnk--> Raphael&#39;s generation, frescos in Nero&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Domus Aurea</i>, <a href="../../wp/p/Pompeii.htm" title="Pompeii">Pompeii</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Herculaneum and through renewed admiration of <!--del_lnk--> Nicholas Poussin.

      <p>There is an anti-Rococo strain that can be detected in some European <a href="../../wp/a/Architecture.htm" title="Architecture">architecture</a> of the earlier 18th century, most vividly represented in the <a href="../../wp/p/Palladian_architecture.htm" title="Palladian architecture">Palladian architecture</a> of Georgian <!--del_lnk--> Britain and <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, but also recognizable in a classicizing vein of architecture in <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin.htm" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>. It is a robust architecture of self-restraint, academically selective now of &quot;the best&quot; Roman models.<p>Neoclassicism first gained influence in <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> and <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, through a generation of French art students trained in Rome and influenced by the writings of <!--del_lnk--> Johann Joachim Winckelmann, and it was quickly adopted by progressive circles in <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>. At first, classicizing decor was grafted onto familiar European forms, as in the interiors for Catherine II&#39;s lover <!--del_lnk--> Count Orlov, designed by an Italian architect with a team of Italian <i>stuccadori</i>: only the isolated oval medallions like cameos and the <!--del_lnk--> bas-relief overdoors hint of neoclassicism; the furnishings are fully Italian Rococo (<i>illustration, left</i>).<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>But a second neoclassic wave, more severe, more studied (through the medium of engravings) and more consciously archaeological, is associated with the height of the <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleon_I_of_France.htm" title="Napoleon I of France">Napoleonic Empire</a>. In France, the first phase of neoclassicism is expressed in the &quot;Louis XVI style&quot;, the second phase in the styles we call &quot;Directoire&quot; or <!--del_lnk--> Empire. Italy clung to Rococo until the Napoleonic regimes brought the new archaeological classicism, which was embraced as a political statement by young, progressive, urban Italians with republican leanings.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The high tide of neoclassicism in painting is exemplified in early paintings by <a href="../../wp/j/Jacques-Louis_David.htm" title="Jacques-Louis David">Jacques-Louis David</a> (<i>illustration, left</i>) and <!--del_lnk--> Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres&#39; entire career. David&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Oath of the Horatii</i> was painted in Rome and made a splash at the <!--del_lnk--> Paris Salon of 1784. Its central perspective is perpendicular to the picture plane, made more emphatic by the dim arcade behind, against which the heroic figures are disposed as in a <!--del_lnk--> frieze, with a hint of the artificial lighting and staging of <a href="../../wp/o/Opera.htm" title="Opera">opera</a>, and the classical coloring of <!--del_lnk--> Nicholas Poussin. In <a href="../../wp/s/Sculpture.htm" title="Sculpture">sculpture</a>, the most familiar representatives are the Italian <!--del_lnk--> Antonio Canova, the Englishman <!--del_lnk--> John Flaxman and the Dane <!--del_lnk--> Bertel Thorvaldsen. The European neoclassical manner also took hold in the United States, where its prominence peaked somewhat later and is exemplified in the sculptures of <!--del_lnk--> William Henry Rinehart (1825-1874).<p>In the decorative arts, neoclassicism is exemplified in Empire furniture made in Paris, London, New York, Berlin; in <!--del_lnk--> Biedermeier furniture made in Austria; in <!--del_lnk--> Karl Friedrich Schinkel&#39;s museums in Berlin, Sir <!--del_lnk--> John Soane&#39;s Bank of England in London and the newly built &quot;<!--del_lnk--> capitol&quot; in <!--del_lnk--> Washington, DC; and in <!--del_lnk--> Wedgwood&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> bas reliefs and &quot;black basaltes&quot; <!--del_lnk--> vases. The Scots architect <!--del_lnk--> Charles Cameron created palatial Italianate interiors for the German-born <!--del_lnk--> Catherine II the Great in Russian St. Petersburg: the style was international.<p>Indoors, neoclassicism made a discovery of the genuine classic interior, inspired by the rediscoveries at <a href="../../wp/p/Pompeii.htm" title="Pompeii">Pompeii</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Herculaneum, which had started in the late <!--del_lnk--> 1740s, but only achieved a wide audience in the <!--del_lnk--> 1760s, with the first luxurious volumes of tightly controlled distribution of <i>Le Antichit&agrave; di Ercolano.</i> The antiquities of Herculaneum showed that even the most classicizing interiors of the <a href="../../wp/b/Baroque.htm" title="Baroque">Baroque</a>, or the most &quot;Roman&quot; rooms of <!--del_lnk--> William Kent were based on <!--del_lnk--> basilica and <!--del_lnk--> temple <i>exterior</i> architecture, turned outside in: <!--del_lnk--> pedimented window frames turned into <!--del_lnk--> gilded mirrors, fireplaces topped with temple fronts, now all looking quite bombastic and absurd. The new interiors sought to recreate an authentically Roman and genuinely <i>interior</i> vocabulary, employing flatter, lighter motifs, sculpted in low <!--del_lnk--> frieze-like relief or painted in monotones <i><!--del_lnk--> en cama&iuml;eu</i> (&quot;like cameos&quot;), isolated medallions or vases or busts or <i><!--del_lnk--> bucrania</i> or other motifs, suspended on swags of laurel or ribbon, with slender arabesques against backgrounds, perhaps, of &quot;Pompeiian red&quot; or pale tints, or stone colors. The style in France was initially a Parisian style, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Go&ucirc;t grec</i>, not a court style. Only when the plump, young king acceded to the throne in 1771 did his fashion-loving Queen bring the &quot;Louis XVI&quot; style to court.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>From about 1800 a fresh influx of Greek architectural examples, seen through the medium of etchings and engravings, gave a new impetus to neoclassicism that is called the <b><!--del_lnk--> Greek Revival.</b><p>Neoclassicism continued to be a major force in <!--del_lnk--> academic art through the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a> and beyond&mdash;a constant antithesis to <a href="../../wp/r/Romanticism.htm" title="Romanticism">Romanticism</a> or <!--del_lnk--> Gothic revivals&mdash; although from the late <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a> on it had often been considered anti-modern, or even reactionary, in influential critical circles. By the mid-19th century, several European cities&mdash;notably <!--del_lnk--> St Petersburg and <a href="../../wp/m/Munich.htm" title="Munich">Munich</a>&mdash;were transformed into veritable museums of Neoclassical architecture.<p>In American architecture, neoclassicism was one expression of the <!--del_lnk--> American Renaissance movement, <i>ca</i> <!--del_lnk--> 1890-<!--del_lnk--> 1917; its last manifestation was in <!--del_lnk--> Beaux-Arts architecture, and its very last, large public projects were the <!--del_lnk--> Lincoln Memorial (highly criticised at the time), the <!--del_lnk--> National Gallery in Washington, D.C., and the <!--del_lnk--> American Museum of Natural History&#39;s Roosevelt Memorial. These were <!--del_lnk--> white elephants as they were built. In the British Raj, Sir <!--del_lnk--> Edwin Lutyens&#39; monumental city planning for <a href="../../wp/n/New_Delhi.htm" title="New Delhi">New Delhi</a> marks the glorious sunset of neoclassicism. World War II was to shatter most longing for - and imitation of - mythical, heroic times.<p><a id="Covert_neoclassicism_in_Modern_styles" name="Covert_neoclassicism_in_Modern_styles"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Covert neoclassicism in Modern styles</span></h2>
      <p>Meanwhile, conservative modernist architects like <!--del_lnk--> Charles Perret in France kept the rhythms and spacing of columnar architecture even in factory buildings. Where a <!--del_lnk--> colonnade would have been decried as &quot;reactionary,&quot; a building&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> pilaster-like fluted panels under a repeating frieze looked &quot;progressive.&quot; <a href="../../wp/p/Pablo_Picasso.htm" title="Pablo Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a> experimented with classicizing motifs in the years immediately following <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, and the <!--del_lnk--> Art Deco style that peaked in the 1925 Paris <i>Exposition des Arts D&eacute;coratifs</i> often drew on neoclassical motifs without expressing them overtly: severe, blocky commodes by <!--del_lnk--> E. J. Ruhlmann or <!--del_lnk--> Sue et Mare; crisp, extremely low-relief friezes of damsels and gazelles in every medium; fashionable dresses that were draped or cut on the bias to recreate Grecian lines; the art dance of <!--del_lnk--> Isadora Duncan; the <!--del_lnk--> Streamline Moderne styling of US post offices and county court buildings built as late as 1950; and the Roosevelt dime. Neoclassic themes can even be detected in the <!--del_lnk--> Smith Tower, Seattle.<p><a id="Neoclassicism_Part_II:_Between_the_Wars" name="Neoclassicism_Part_II:_Between_the_Wars"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Neoclassicism Part II: Between the Wars</span></h2>
      <p>There was an entire <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a> movement in the Arts which was also called Neo-classicism. It encompassed at least music, philosophy, and literature. It was between the end of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> and the end of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. For information on the musical aspects, see <!--del_lnk--> 20th century classical music#Neoclassicism and <!--del_lnk--> Neoclassicism (music). For information on the philosophical aspects, see <!--del_lnk--> Great Books.<p>This literary neo-classical movement rejected the extreme romanticism of (for example) <a href="../../wp/d/Dada.htm" title="Dada">dada</a>, in favour of restraint, religion (specifically Christianity) and a reactionary political program. Although the foundations for this movement in <!--del_lnk--> English literature were laid by <!--del_lnk--> T.E. Hulme, the most famous neoclassicists were <!--del_lnk--> T.S.
