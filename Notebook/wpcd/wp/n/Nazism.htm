      <p>The term <i><b>Nazi</b></i> is derived from the first two syllables, as <i>pronounced</i> in <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a>, of the official name of the German Nazi Party, the <!--del_lnk--> <i><b>Nati</b>onalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei</i>. The Nazis did not originally refer to themselves as &quot;Nazis,&quot; and instead used the official term, <i>Nationalsozialisten</i> (&quot;National Socialists&quot;). In <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a>, <i>Nazi</i> mirrors the term <i>Sozi</i>, a common and slightly derogatory term for the <!--del_lnk--> Social Democratic Party of Germany (<i>Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands</i>), the Nazis&#39; main opponents before obtaining power.<p><a id="Historical_background" name="Historical_background"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Historical background</span></h2>
      <p>Nazi opinions, an extension of various philosophies, came together at a critical time for Germany; the nation had not only lost <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1918, but had also been forced to sign the <a href="../../wp/t/Treaty_of_Versailles.htm" title="Treaty of Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, an intentionally devastating capitulation, and was in the midst of a period of great <!--del_lnk--> economic depression and instability. The <!--del_lnk--> Dolchstosslegende, or &quot;stab in the back&quot; legend, held that the war effort was sabotaged internally, suggesting a &quot;lack of patriotism&quot; had led to Germany&#39;s defeat (for one, the front line was off of German soil at the time of the armistice). In politics, criticism was directed at the <!--del_lnk--> Social Democrats and also the <a href="../../wp/w/Weimar_Republic.htm" title="Weimar Republic">Weimar government</a> (<i><!--del_lnk--> Deutsches Reich</i> <!--del_lnk--> 1919-<!--del_lnk--> 1933), which had been <!--del_lnk--> accused of selling out the country. The Dolchstosslegende led many to look at &quot;non-Germans&quot; living in Germany for potential extra-national loyalties, like the <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jews">Jews</a>, raising <!--del_lnk--> anti-Semitic sentiments, regarding the <i><!--del_lnk--> Judenfrage</i> (<a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a> for the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Jewish Question&quot;), at a time when the <!--del_lnk--> v&ouml;lkisch movement and a desire to create a <!--del_lnk--> Greater Germany were strong.<p>Although Hitler had joined the worker&#39;s party in September <!--del_lnk--> 1919, and published <i><!--del_lnk--> Mein Kampf</i> in <!--del_lnk--> 1925-<!--del_lnk--> 1926 about the Aryan &quot;<!--del_lnk--> master race&quot; (<i>&quot;<!--del_lnk--> Herrenvolk&quot;</i>), the seminal ideas of Nazism trace back decades to previous groups and individuals, including: <!--del_lnk--> Schopenhauer, <!--del_lnk--> Guido von List, Jorg <!--del_lnk--> Lanz von Liebenfels, the <!--del_lnk--> List Society, the <!--del_lnk--> Germanenorden, and the <!--del_lnk--> Thule Society:<dl>

      <p><i><b>Nazism</b></i> refers to the <!--del_lnk--> ideology held by the <!--del_lnk--> National Socialist German Workers Party and its so-called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Weltanschauung&quot; when in power from 1933 to 1945. Free elections in 1932 under Germany&#39;s <a href="../../wp/w/Weimar_Republic.htm" title="Weimar Republic">Weimar Republic</a> made the NSDAP the largest <!--del_lnk--> parliamentary fraction; no similar party in any country at that time had achieved comparable electoral success. <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> 30 January <!--del_lnk--> 1933 appointment to the <!--del_lnk--> chancellorship and his subsequent consolidation of <!--del_lnk--> dictatorial power, marked the beginning of <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. During its first year in power, the NSDAP announced the <i>Tausendj&auml;hriges Reich</i> (&quot;Thousand Years&#39; Empire&quot;) or <i>Drittes Reich</i> (&quot;Third Reich&quot;, a putative successor to the <a href="../../wp/h/Holy_Roman_Empire.htm" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> German Empire). The Nazi regime ended with <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> (<!--del_lnk--> 1945), when the party was declared a criminal organisation by the victorious <!--del_lnk--> Allied Powers and effectively destroyed.<p>Since 1945, Nazism has been outlawed as a political ideology in Germany, as are forms of iconography and propaganda from the Nazi era. However, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Neo-Nazis&quot; continue to operate in Germany and abroad. Following World War II and <a href="../../wp/t/The_Holocaust.htm" title="The Holocaust">the Holocaust</a>, the term &quot;Nazi&quot; and symbols associated with Nazism (such as the <a href="../../wp/s/Swastika.htm" title="Swastika">swastika</a>) acquired extremely negative connotations in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>. Calling someone a &quot;Nazi&quot; or suggesting ties to Nazism is considered an insult.  Many have compared opponents with Nazis to put their opponents in a negative light: a <!--del_lnk--> fallacy called <i>&quot;<!--del_lnk--> reductio ad Hitlerum.&quot;</i> [<i>See more at: <!--del_lnk--> Godwin&#39;s law and <!--del_lnk--> fascist (epithet).</i>]<p><a id="Ideological_introduction" name="Ideological_introduction"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Ideological introduction</span></h2>
      <p>In terms of <i>ideology</i>, Nazism has come to stand for a belief in the superiority of an <!--del_lnk--> Aryan <!--del_lnk--> master race, an abstraction of the Germanic peoples. During the time of Hitler, the Nazis advocated a strong, centralized government under the <!--del_lnk--> F&uuml;hrer and claimed to be defending <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> German people (including those of German <!--del_lnk--> ethnicity abroad) against <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">communism</a> and so-called <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jew">Jewish</a> subversion. Ultimately, the Nazis sought to create a largely homogenous and self-sufficient ethnic state, absorbing the ideas of <!--del_lnk--> Pan-Germanism and pairing them other abstract concepts, some related to social theory and even Nietzsche&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> &Uuml;bermensch.<p>However, historians often disagree on the principle interests of the Nazi Party and whether Nazism can be considered a coherent ideology. The original National Socialists claimed that there would be no program that would bind them, and that they wanted to reject any established world view. Still, as Hitler played a major role in the development of the Nazi Party from its early stages and rose to become the movement&#39;s indisputable iconographic figurehead, much of what is thought to be &quot;Nazism&quot; is in line with <!--del_lnk--> Hitler&#39;s own political beliefs - the ideology and the man continue to remain largely interchangeable in the public eye. Some dispute whether Hitler&#39;s views relate directly to those surrounding the movement; the problem is furthered by the inability of various self-proclaimed Nazis and Nazi groups to decide on a universal ideology.<p><a id="Nazism_and_Fascism" name="Nazism_and_Fascism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Nazism and Fascism</span></h3>
      <p>In both popular thought and academic scholarship, Nazism is generally considered a form of <a href="../../wp/f/Fascism.htm" title="Fascism">fascism</a> - with &quot;fascism&quot; defined so as to include any of the <!--del_lnk--> authoritarian, <!--del_lnk--> nationalist, <!--del_lnk--> totalitarian movements that developed in Europe around the same time. The debate focuses mainly on comparisons of fascists movements in general with the Italian prototype, including the fascists in Germany. The idea mentioned above to reject all former ideas and ideologies like democracy, liberalism, and especially marxism (as in Nolte) make it difficult to track down a perfect definition of these two terms. However, Italian Fascists tended to believe that all elements in society should be unified through <!--del_lnk--> corporatism to form an &quot;Organic State&quot;; this meant that these Fascists often had no strong opinion on the question of <a href="../../wp/r/Race.htm" title="Race">race</a>, as it was only the State and <!--del_lnk--> nation that mattered. German Nazism, on the other hand, emphasized the <!--del_lnk--> Aryan race or &quot;Volk&quot; principle to the point where the state simply seemed a means through which the Aryan race could realize its &quot;true destiny.&quot; Since a debate among historians (especially <!--del_lnk--> Zeev Sternhell) to see each movement, or at least the German, as unique, the issue has been settled in most parts showing that there is a stronger family resemblance between the Italian and the German fascist movement than there is between democracies in Europe or the communist states of the Cold War; additionally, the crimes of the fascist movement can of course be compared, not only in numbers of casualties but also in common developments: the <!--del_lnk--> March on Rome of Mussolini to Hilter&#39;s response shortly after to attempt a coup d&#39;etat himself in Munich. Also, Aryanism was not an attractive idea for Italians that had neither blond hair nor blue eyes, but still there was a strong racism and also genocide in concentration camps long before either was in place in Germany. The philosophy that had seemed to be separating both fascisms was shown to be a result of happening in two different countries: since the king of Italy never died, unlike the Reichspr&auml;sident, the leader in Italy (Duce) was never able to gain the absolute power the leader in Germany (F&uuml;hrer) did, leading to Mussolini&#39;s fall. The academic challenge to separate all fascist movements has since the 80&#39;s and early 90&#39;s been ground for a new attempt to see even more similarities.<p><a id="Nazi_theory" name="Nazi_theory"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Nazi theory</span></h2>
      <p>There was no &#39;complete&#39;, official theory of Nazism, anywhere. Among comments on the Nazi movement, those of its leader <i>Adolf Hitler</i> are thought to be very influential. He claimed in his book <i><!--del_lnk--> Mein Kampf</i> (<i>My Struggle</i>) that he first began to develop his views through observations he made while living in Vienna. He concluded that there was a racial, religious, and cultural hierarchy, and he placed &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Aryans&quot; at the top as the ultimate superior race, while <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jews">Jews</a> and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Gypsies&quot; were people at the bottom. He vaguely examined and questioned the policies of the <!--del_lnk--> Austro-Hungarian Empire, where as a citizen by birth, Hitler lived during the Empire&#39;s last throes of life. He believed that its <!--del_lnk--> ethnic and <a href="../../wp/l/Linguistics.htm" title="Linguistics">linguistic</a> diversity had weakened the Empire and helped to create dissension. Further, he saw <a href="../../wp/d/Democracy.htm" title="Democracy">democracy</a> as a destabilizing force because it placed power in the hands of <!--del_lnk--> ethnic minorities who, he claimed, &quot;weakened and destabilized&quot; the Empire by dividing it against itself.<p><a id="Nationalism_and_Socialism" name="Nationalism_and_Socialism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Nationalism and Socialism</span></h3>
      <p>The Nazi state was founded upon a racially defined &quot;German people&quot; and principally rejected the idea of being bound by the limits of nationalism; that was only a means for attempting <i>unlimited</i> supremacy. In that sense, its nationalism and hyper-nationalism was tolerated to reach a world-dominating Germanic-Aryan <i>Volksgemeinschaft</i>. This is a central concept of <i><!--del_lnk--> Mein Kampf</i>, symbolized by the motto <i>Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein F&uuml;hrer</i> (one people, one empire, one leader). The Nazi relationship between the Volk and the state was called the <i><!--del_lnk--> Volksgemeinschaft</i> (&quot;people&#39;s community&quot;), a late 19th or early 20th century <!--del_lnk--> neologism that defined a communal duty of citizens in service to the Reich (opposed to a simple &quot;society&quot;). The term &quot;National Socialism&quot;, derives from this citizen-nation relationship, whereby the term <i><a href="../../wp/s/Socialism.htm" title="Socialism">socialism</a></i> is invoked and is meant to be realized through the common duty of the individuals to the German people; all actions are to be in service of the Reich. In practice, the Nazis argued, their goal was to bring forth a <b>nation-state</b> as the locus and embodiment of the people&#39;s collective will, bound by the <i>Volksgemeinschaft</i> as both an ideal and an operating instrument. In comparison, non-national socialist ideologies <i>oppose</i> the idea of nations. For further information on national socialism and socialism, and Nazism and fascism, see <i><!--del_lnk--> Fascism and ideology</i>.<p><a id="Militarism" name="Militarism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Militarism</span></h3>
      <p>Nazi rationale also invested heavily in the <!--del_lnk--> militarist belief that great nations grow from military power and maintained order, which in turn grow &quot;naturally&quot; from &quot;rational, civilized cultures&quot;. The Nazi Party appealed to German nationalists and national pride, capitalizing on <!--del_lnk--> irredentist and <!--del_lnk--> revanchist sentiments as well as aversions to various aspects of <!--del_lnk--> modernist thinking (though at the same time embracing other modernist ideas, e.g. admiration for engine power). Many ethnic Germans were deeply committed to the goal of creating the <!--del_lnk--> Greater Germany (the old dream to include German-speaking Austria) and some felt that the use of military force was necessary to achieve it.<p><a id="Racism" name="Racism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Racism</span></h3>
      <p>The Nazi racial philosophy wholly embraced <!--del_lnk--> Alfred Rosenberg&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Aryan Invasion Theory, which traced Aryan peoples in ancient <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a> invading the <a href="../../wp/i/Indus_Valley_Civilization.htm" title="Indus Valley Civilization">Indus Valley Civilization</a>, and carrying with them great knowledge and science that had been preserved from the <!--del_lnk--> antediluvian world. This &quot;antediluvian world&quot; referred to <!--del_lnk--> Thule, the speculative pre-Flood/Ice Age origin of the Aryan race, and is often tied to ideas of <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantis.htm" title="Atlantis">Atlantis</a>. Most of the leadership and the founders of the Nazi Party were made up of members of the &quot;Thule-Gesellschaft&quot; (the Thule Society), which romanticized the Aryan race through theology and ritual.<p>Hitler also claimed that a <!--del_lnk--> nation was the highest creation of a <a href="../../wp/r/Race.htm" title="Race">race</a>, and great nations (literally <i>large</i> nations) were the creation of homogeneous populations of great races, working together. These nations developed cultures that naturally grew from races with &quot;natural good health, and aggressive, intelligent, courageous traits&quot;. The weakest nations, Hitler said, were those of impure or mongrel races, because they had divided, quarrelling, and therefore weak cultures. Worst of all were seen to be the parasitic <!--del_lnk--> Untermensch (<i>Subhumans</i>), mainly Jews, but also Gypsies, homosexuals, the disabled and so called anti-socials, all of whom were considered <i>lebensunwertes Leben</i> (&quot;Life-unworthy life&quot;) owing to their perceived deficiency and inferiority, as well as their wandering, nationless invasions (&quot;the International Jew&quot;). The <!--del_lnk--> persecution of homosexuals as part of <a href="../../wp/t/The_Holocaust.htm" title="The Holocaust">the Holocaust</a> has seen increasing scholarly attention since the 1990s.<p>According to Nazism, it is an obvious mistake to permit or encourage plurality within a nation. Fundamental to the Nazi goal was the unification of all <!--del_lnk--> German-speaking peoples, &quot;unjustly&quot; divided into different <!--del_lnk--> Nation States. Hitler claimed that nations that could not defend their territory did not deserve it. Slave races like the <!--del_lnk--> Slavic peoples he thought of as less worthy to exist than &quot;leader races&quot;. In particular, if a master race should require room to live (<i><!--del_lnk--> Lebensraum</i>), he thought such a race should have the right to displace the inferior <!--del_lnk--> indigenous races.<p>&quot;Races without homelands&quot;, Hitler proclaimed, were &quot;parasitic races&quot;, and the richer the members of a &quot;parasitic race&quot; were, the more &quot;virulent&quot; the parasitism was thought to be. A &quot;master race&quot; could therefore, according to the Nazi doctrine, easily strengthen itself by eliminating &quot;parasitic races&quot; from its homeland. This was the given rationalization for the Nazis&#39; later oppression and elimination of Jews, <!--del_lnk--> Gypsies, <!--del_lnk--> Czechs, <!--del_lnk--> Poles, the mentally and physically handicapped, homosexuals and others not belonging to these groups or categories that were part of the <a href="../../wp/t/The_Holocaust.htm" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Waffen-SS and other German soldiers (including parts of the <!--del_lnk--> Wehrmacht), as well as civilian paramilitary groups in occupied territories, were responsible for the deaths of an estimated eleven million men, women, and children in concentration camps, prisoner-of-war camps, labor camps, and death camps such as <!--del_lnk--> Auschwitz and <!--del_lnk--> Treblinka.<p>The belief in the need to purify the German race lead them to <!--del_lnk--> eugenics; this culminated in the involuntary <!--del_lnk--> euthanasia of disabled people and the <!--del_lnk--> compulsory sterilization of people with mental deficiencies or illnesses perceived as hereditary.<p><a id="Religion" name="Religion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h3>
      <p>Hitler extended his rationalizations into a <!--del_lnk--> religious doctrine, underpinned by his criticism of traditional <!--del_lnk--> Catholicism. In particular, and closely related to <!--del_lnk--> Positive Christianity, Hitler objected to Catholicism&#39;s ungrounded and international character - that is, it did not pertain to an exclusive race and national culture. At the same time, and somewhat contradictorily, the Nazis combined elements of Germany&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Lutheran community tradition with its Northern European, <!--del_lnk--> organic <!--del_lnk--> pagan past. Elements of militarism found their way into Hitler&#39;s own theology, as he preached that his was a &quot;true&quot; or &quot;master&quot; religion, because it would &quot;create mastery&quot; and avoid comforting lies. Those who preached <a href="../../wp/l/Love.htm" title="Love">love</a> and tolerance, &quot;in contravention to the facts&quot;, were said to be &quot;slave&quot; or &quot;false&quot; religions. The man who recognized these &quot;truths&quot;, Hitler continued, was said to be a &quot;natural leader&quot;, and those who denied it were said to be &quot;natural slaves&quot;. &quot;Slaves&quot; &ndash; especially intelligent ones, he claimed &ndash; were always attempting to hinder their masters by promoting false religious and political doctrines.<p>Anti-clericalism can also be interpreted as part of Nazi ideology, simply because the new Nazi hierarchy was not about to let itself be overode by the power that the Church traditionally held. In Austria, clerics had a powerful role in politics and ultimately responded to the <!--del_lnk--> Vatican. Although a few exceptions exist, <!--del_lnk--> Christian persecution was primarily limited to those who refused to accommodate the new regime and yield to its power. The Nazis often used the church to justify their stance and included many <!--del_lnk--> Christian symbols in the Third Reich (Steigmann&ndash;Gall). A particularly poignant exemplar is the seen in the life of <!--del_lnk--> Dietrich Bonhoeffer.<p><a id="Other_Roots" name="Other_Roots"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other Roots</span></h3>
      <p>The ideological <i><b>roots</b></i> that became German National Socialism were based on numerous sources in European history, drawing especially from <a href="../../wp/r/Romanticism.htm" title="Romanticism">Romantic</a> 19th century <!--del_lnk--> idealism, and from a biological reading of <a href="../../wp/f/Friedrich_Nietzsche.htm" title="Friedrich Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>&#39;s thoughts on &quot;breeding upwards&quot; toward the goal of an <!--del_lnk--> &Uuml;bermensch (<i>Superhuman</i>). Hitler was an avid reader and received ideas that were later to influence Nazism from traceable publications, such as those of the <!--del_lnk--> Germanenorden (<i>Germanic Order</i>) or the <!--del_lnk--> Thule society. He also adopted many <!--del_lnk--> populist ideas such as limiting profits, abolishing rents and generously increasing social benefits - but only for Germans.<p><a id="Variants_of_Nazism_and_Hitlerism_abroad" name="Variants_of_Nazism_and_Hitlerism_abroad"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Variants of Nazism and Hitlerism abroad</span></h3>
      <p>Nazism as a doctrine is far from being <!--del_lnk--> homogeneous and can indeed be divided into various <b>sub-ideologies</b>. During the 20s and 30s, there were two dominant NSDAP factions. There were the followers of <!--del_lnk--> Otto Strasser, the so-called Strasserites and the followers of <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> or what could be termed Hitlerites. The <!--del_lnk--> Strasserite faction eventually fell afoul of Hitler, when Otto Strasser was expelled from the party in 1930, and his attempt to create an oppositional &#39;left-block&#39; in the form of the <!--del_lnk--> Black Front failed. The remainder of the faction, which was to be found mainly in the ranks of the SA, was purged in the <!--del_lnk--> Night of the Long Knives, which also saw the murder of <!--del_lnk--> Gregor Strasser, Otto&#39;s brother. After this point, the Hitlerite faction became dominant. In the post war era, Strasserism has enjoyed something of a revival with many neo-Nazi groups openly proclaiming themselves to be &#39;Strasserite&#39;. Whether they genuinely eschew Hitlerism in favour of Strasserism, or whether they simply think that by distancing Nazism from Hitler they can somehow make the ideology more acceptable is a matter of intense debate however.<p>Hitler&#39;s theories were not only attractive to Germans: people in positions of wealth and power in other nations are said to have seen them as beneficial. Examples are <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_Ford.htm" title="Henry Ford">Henry Ford</a>, founder of the <!--del_lnk--> Ford Motor Company, and <!--del_lnk--> Eugene Schueller, founder of <!--del_lnk--> L&#39;Or&eacute;al. Nevertheless, the support for these theories was highest among the general population of Germany.<p><a id="Homosexuals" name="Homosexuals"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Homosexuals</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> homosexuality of some supporters of Hitler, especially <!--del_lnk--> Ernst R&ouml;hm, was well known at the time and basis for satire and jokes. Although Hitler abhorred homosexuality, the <!--del_lnk--> SA and <!--del_lnk--> SS had not a significant, but still a surprisingly representative, number of homosexual members, which was generally ignored. R&ouml;hm was killed chiefly because he was perceived as a political threat, not for his sexuality.

      <p>According to <a href="../../wp/b/Bertrand_Russell.htm" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>, Nazism would come from a different tradition than that of either Liberalism or Marxism. Thus, to understand values of Nazism, it would be necessary to explore this connection, without trivializing the movement as it was in its peak years in the 1930s and dismissing it as little more than <!--del_lnk--> racism.<p>Anti-Semitism was shown to be a handy tool for Nazis to gain support, mainly due to the popular <!--del_lnk--> Houston Stewart Chamberlain. Personal accounts by <!--del_lnk--> August Kubizek, Hitler&#39;s childhood friend, have varied, offering ambiguous claims that anti-Semitism did and did not date back to Hitler&#39;s youth. One reason is the higher Jewish community in Austria and Germany because Germany had been a haven for many Jews over the years, including influential families such as the <!--del_lnk--> Rothschilds, although World War I and the Dolchstosslegende ended that legacy. Anti-Judaism had already been widely transformed into anti-Semitism before 1914 due to the new Europe-wide post-Darwin theory of <!--del_lnk--> racism. Historians universally accept that Nazism&#39;s mass acceptance depended upon nationalistic appeals and fear against &quot;unnormal people&quot; (which also could include <!--del_lnk--> xenophobia and anti-Semitism) and a patriotic flattery toward the wounded collective pride of defeated World War I veterans. Early support for the Nazis, displayed in various parades, came from the old conservative order that was the military.<p>Many see strong connections to the values of Nazism and the anti-rationalist tradition of the <a href="../../wp/r/Romanticism.htm" title="Romanticism">romantic movement</a> of the early 19th century in response to the <!--del_lnk--> Enlightenment. Strength, passion, frank declarations of feelings, and deep devotion to family and community were valued by the Nazis though first expressed by many Romantic <!--del_lnk--> artists, <!--del_lnk--> musicians, and <!--del_lnk--> writers. <!--del_lnk--> German romanticism in particular expressed these values. For instance, Hitler identified closely with the <a href="../../wp/m/Music.htm" title="Music">music</a> of <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_Wagner.htm" title="Richard Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>, who harbored anti-Semitic views as the author of <i><!--del_lnk--> Das Judenthum in der Musik</i>. Some claim that he was one of Hitler&#39;s role models, a comment of Kubizek&#39;s that is also disputed. Nevertheless, Wagner&#39;s most important <a href="../../wp/o/Opera.htm" title="Opera">operas</a> of the <!--del_lnk--> Ring cycle express Aryanist ideals, and contain what some people interpret as anti-Semitic caricatures.  Hitler admired Wagner&#39;s widow and visited <!--del_lnk--> Bayreuth Festival regularly.<p>The idealization of tradition, folklore, classical thought, leadership (as exemplified by <!--del_lnk--> Frederick the Great), their rejection of the liberalism of the <a href="../../wp/w/Weimar_Republic.htm" title="Weimar Republic">Weimar Republic</a>, and calling the German state the &quot;Third <!--del_lnk--> Reich&quot; (which traces back to the medieval <!--del_lnk--> First Reich and the pre-<a href="../../wp/w/Weimar_Republic.htm" title="Weimar Republic">Weimar</a> <!--del_lnk--> Second Reich) has led many to regard the Nazis as <!--del_lnk--> reactionary.<p><a id="Nazism_and_mysticism" name="Nazism_and_mysticism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Nazism and mysticism</span></h3>

      <p>Nazism and <b><a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">Communism</a></b> emerged as two serious contenders for power in <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> after the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">First World War</a>, particularly as the <a href="../../wp/w/Weimar_Republic.htm" title="Weimar Republic">Weimar Republic</a> became increasingly unstable. What became the Nazi movement arose out of resistance to the <!--del_lnk--> Bolshevik-inspired insurgencies that occurred in Germany in the aftermath of the First World War. The <a href="../../wp/r/Russian_Revolution_of_1917.htm" title="Russian Revolution of 1917">Russian Revolution of 1917</a> caused a great deal of excitement and interest in the <!--del_lnk--> Leninist version of <a href="../../wp/m/Marxism.htm" title="Marxism">Marxism</a> and caused many socialists to adopt <!--del_lnk--> revolutionary principles. The <!--del_lnk--> Spartacist uprising in Berlin and the [[<!--del_lnk--> Munich Soviet Republic in <!--del_lnk--> 1919 were both manifestations of this. The <!--del_lnk--> Freikorps, a loosely organized <!--del_lnk--> paramilitary group (essentially a <!--del_lnk--> militia of former World War I soldiers) was used to crush both these uprisings and many leaders of the Freikorps, including <!--del_lnk--> Ernst R&ouml;hm, later became leaders in the Nazi party. After <!--del_lnk--> Mussolini&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Fascists took power in <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> in 1922, fascism presented itself as a realistic option for opposing &quot;Communism&quot;, particularly given Mussolini&#39;s success in crushing the Communist and <a href="../../wp/a/Anarchism.htm" title="Anarchist">anarchist</a> movements that had destabilized Italy with a wave of strikes and factory occupations after the First World War. Fascist parties formed in numerous European countries.<p>Many historians, such as <!--del_lnk--> Ian Kershaw and <!--del_lnk--> Joachim Fest, argue that Hitler&#39;s Nazis were one of numerous nationalist and increasingly fascistic groups that existed in Germany and contended for leadership of the <!--del_lnk--> anti-Communist movement and, eventually, of the German state. Further, they assert that fascism and its German variant, <i>National Socialism</i>, became the successful challengers to Communism because they were able to both appeal to the establishment as a bulwark against Bolshevism and appeal to the working class base, particularly the growing underclass of unemployed and unemployable and growingly impoverished middle class elements who were becoming declassed (denounced as the <i><!--del_lnk--> lumpenproletariat</i>). The Nazis&#39; use of pro-labor rhetoric appealed to those disaffected with capitalism by promoting the limiting of profits, the abolishing of rents and the increasing of social benefits (only for Germans) while simultaneously presenting a political and economic model that divested &quot;Soviet socialism&quot; of elements that were dangerous to capitalism, such as the concept of <!--del_lnk--> class struggle, &quot;the <!--del_lnk--> dictatorship of the proletariat&quot; or worker control of the <!--del_lnk--> means of production. Thus, Nazism&#39;s populism, <!--del_lnk--> anti-Communism and <!--del_lnk--> anti-capitalism helped it become more powerful and popular than traditional <!--del_lnk--> conservative parties, like the <!--del_lnk--> DNVP. For the above reasons, particularly the fact that Nazis and Communists fought each other (often violently) during most of their existence, Nazism and Communism are commonly seen as opposite extremes on the political spectrum. However, this view is not without its challengers. A number of political theorists and economists, primarily those associated with the <!--del_lnk--> Austrian school, argue that Nazism, Soviet Communism and other totalitarian ideologies share a common underpinning in <!--del_lnk--> collectivism.<p>The simplicity of Nazi rhetoric, campaigns, and ideology also made its conservative allies underestimate its strength, and its ability to govern or even to last as a <!--del_lnk--> political party. <!--del_lnk--> Michael Mann defined fascism as a &quot;transcendent and cleansing nation statism through paramilitarism&quot;, with &quot;transcendent&quot; meaning that the all classes were to be abolished in order for a new, organic and pure people: all classes are abolished by transition, all &quot;others&quot; (an estimated two-thirds of the German population alone).<p><a id="Support_of_anti-Communists_for_Fascism_and_Nazism" name="Support_of_anti-Communists_for_Fascism_and_Nazism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Support of anti-Communists for Fascism and Nazism</span></h3>
      <p>Various far right-wing politicians and political parties in Europe welcomed the rise of fascism and the Nazis out of an intense aversion towards Communism. According to them, Hitler was the savior of <!--del_lnk--> Western civilization and of capitalism against <!--del_lnk--> Bolshevism. During the later 1930s and 1940s, the Nazis were supported by the <!--del_lnk--> Falange movement in Spain, and by political and military figures who would form the government of <!--del_lnk--> Vichy France. A <i><!--del_lnk--> Legion of French Volunteers against Bolshevism</i> (LVF) and other anti-<!--del_lnk--> Soviet fighting formations were formed.<p><a id="Post-1933_development" name="Post-1933_development"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Post-1933 development</span></h2>
      <p>The British Conservative party and the right-wing parties in France <!--del_lnk--> appeased the Nazi regime in the mid- and late-1930s, even though they had begun to criticise its <!--del_lnk--> totalitarianism and in Britain especially, Nazi Germany&#39;s policies towards the Jews. However, Britain (from 1931 onwards under an overwhelmingly Conservative government) had appeased pre-Nazi Germany. Important reasons behind this appeasement included, first, the erroneous assumption that Hitler had no desire to precipitate another world war, and second, when the rebirth of the German military could no longer be ignored, a well-founded concern that neither Britain nor France was yet ready to fight an all-out war against Germany. In addition, some have argued that Nazi Germany was assisted in its development to create a front to counter early Bolshevik ambitions.<p>In 1936, Nazi Germany and <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> entered into the <!--del_lnk--> Anti-Comintern Pact, aimed directly at countering Soviet foreign policy. This later became the basis for the <!--del_lnk--> Tripartite Pact with Italy, the foundation of the <!--del_lnk--> Axis Powers. The three nations were united in their rabid opposition to <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">Communism</a>, as well as their militaristic, racist regimes, but they failed to coordinate their military efforts effectively.<p>In his early years Hitler also greatly admired <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">the United States of America</a>. In <i>Mein Kampf</i>, he praised the United States for its <a href="../../wp/r/Race.htm" title="Race">race</a>-based <!--del_lnk--> anti-immigration laws and for the subordination of the &quot;inferior&quot; black population. According to Hitler, America was a successful nation because it kept itself &quot;pure&quot; of &quot;lesser races&quot;. However, his view of the United States became more negative as time passed. In his later estimations, the United States was becoming a mongrel nation, calling it &quot;half Judaised, half Negrified&quot;.<p><a id="Economic_practice" name="Economic_practice"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economic practice</span></h2>

      <p>Nazi economic practice concerned itself with immediate domestic issues and separately with ideological conceptions of <!--del_lnk--> international economics.<p>Domestic economic policy was narrowly concerned with three major goals to eliminate Germany&#39;s issues:<ul>
       <li>Elimination of unemployment.<li>Rapid and substantial rearmament.<li>Expansion of production of consumer goods to improve middle and lower-class living standards.</ul>
      <p>All of these policy goals were intended to address the perceived shortcomings of the <a href="../../wp/w/Weimar_Republic.htm" title="Weimar Republic">Weimar Republic</a> and to solidify domestic support for the party. In this, the party was very successful. Between 1933 and 1936 the <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">German</a> <!--del_lnk--> GNP increased by an average annual rate of 9.5 percent, and the rate for industry alone rose by 17.2 percent.<p>This expansion propelled the German economy out of a deep <!--del_lnk--> depression and into full employment in less than four years. Public consumption during the same period increased by 18.7%, while private consumption increased by 3.6% annually. However, as this production was primarily consumptive rather than productive (make-work projects, expansion of the war-fighting machine, initiation of conscription to remove working age males from the labor force and thus lower unemployment), inflationary pressures began to rear their head again, although not to the highs of the Weimar Republic. These economic pressures, combined with the war-fighting machine created in the expansion (and concomitant pressures for its use), has led some to conclude that a European war was inevitable. (See <i><!--del_lnk--> Causes of Second World War</i>).<p>Some economists  argue that the expansion of the German economy between 1933 and 1936 was not the result of measures adopted by the Nazi Party, but rather the consequence of economic policies of the prior Weimar Republic, which had begun to have an effect on factors such as <!--del_lnk--> unemployment. However, it was the policies of Nazi Germany that restored national confidence, arguably the key ingredient to any successful economic policy.<p>Internationally, the Nazi Party believed that an <!--del_lnk--> international banking <!--del_lnk--> cabal was behind the global depression of the 1930s. Control of this cabal, which had grown to a position where it controlled both Europe and the United States, was identified with an elite and powerful group of Jews. However, a number of people believed that this was part of an ongoing plot by the Jewish people, as a whole, to achieve <!--del_lnk--> global domination. The <!--del_lnk--> Protocols of the Elders of Zion, which began its circulation in Russia at the beginning of the 20th century, were said to have confirmed this, already showing &quot;evidence&quot; that the Bolshevik takeover in Russia was in accordance with one of the protocols. Broadly speaking, the existence of large international <!--del_lnk--> banking or merchant banking organizations was well known at this time. Many of these banking organizations were able to exert influence upon nation states by extension or withholding of credit. This influence is not limited to the small states that preceded the creation of the <!--del_lnk--> German Empire as a <!--del_lnk--> nation state in the 1870s, but is noted in most major histories of all <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="European">European</a> powers from the 16th century onward. Nevertheless, after the <!--del_lnk--> Great Depression, this libelous and unverified manuscript took on an important role in Nazi Germany, thus providing another link in the Nazis ideological motivation for the destruction of that group in <a href="../../wp/t/The_Holocaust.htm" title="The Holocaust">the Holocaust</a>.<p>Additionally, many companies blindly dealt with the Third Reich. Many know that the <!--del_lnk--> Volkswagen was a Nazi project. <!--del_lnk--> Opel employed Jewish slave labour to run their industrial plants. Additionally, Daimler-Benz used POWs as slaves to run their industrial plants. Other companies that dealt with the Third Reich -- many of which claim not to have known the truth of what the Nazis were doing (some had in fact lost control of their German branches when Hitler was in power) -- were: <!--del_lnk--> BMW, <!--del_lnk--> Krupp (made gas chambers), <!--del_lnk--> Bayer (as a small part of the enormous <!--del_lnk--> IG Farben chemistry monopoly), and <!--del_lnk--> Hugo Boss (designed the SS uniforms, admitted to this in 1997). There has also been some controversy whether <!--del_lnk--> IBM had dealt with the Nazis to create a cataloguing system, which the Nazis were to use to file information on those who they killed.<p><a id="Backlash_and_Societal_Effects" name="Backlash_and_Societal_Effects"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Backlash and Societal Effects</span></h2>
      <p>Perhaps the primary intellectual effect has been that Nazi doctrines discredited the attempt to use <!--del_lnk--> biology to explain or influence social issues, for at least two generations after Nazi Germany&#39;s brief existence. However, in the 21st century there has been a renewed interest in the debate of <!--del_lnk--> nature versus nurture as well as ethnic and racial genetics.<p>The Nazi descendants have been mute in the post-war democracies, with some exceptions, when interviewed by psychologists and historians. In Norway, a group of descendants have taken the official stigmatizing appellation &quot;<!--del_lnk--> War children&quot; in order to break the silence and to protest against the continuous demonization of their families. Some <!--del_lnk--> historical revisionists disseminate <a href="../../wp/p/Propaganda.htm" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> that minimizes the Holocaust and other Nazi acts in order to remove the stigma attached to National Socialism. Often, attempts are also made to put a <!--del_lnk--> positive spin on the policies of the Nazi regime. Under these circumstances, research on the topic can raise high emotions when it fails to be precise in the analysis and to present proof of emotionalized themes.<p><a id="People" name="People"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">People</span></h2>
      <p><b>Adolf Hitler</b>: Hitler was more than just the leader of <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>: in <!--del_lnk--> 1919, <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> joined the workers&#39; party before it was the &quot;Nazi Party&quot;: On <!--del_lnk--> January 5, <!--del_lnk--> 1919, the party had been founded in <a href="../../wp/m/Munich.htm" title="Munich">Munich</a> as the German Workers&#39; Party (<a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a> <i>Deutsche Arbeiterpartei</i>) by <!--del_lnk--> Anton Drexler, a Munich <!--del_lnk--> locksmith.   Working undercover for the German army, Corporal Hitler joined the Party in mid September 1919,  became <!--del_lnk--> propaganda boss (<i>Propagandachef</i>), renaming the party on <!--del_lnk--> April 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1920,  and became party leader on <!--del_lnk--> July 29, <!--del_lnk--> 1921. Adolf Hitler ruled <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> from <!--del_lnk--> January 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1933 until his suicide on <!--del_lnk--> April 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1945, leading the German Reich throughout <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>.<p><b>German Nazis</b>: Though Nazi Party membership was carefully regulated (and even closed off at a certain point), many non-affiliated citizens of the Nazi State described themselves as dedicated Nazis. After the war, the most prominent Nazis were convicted of <!--del_lnk--> war crimes and <!--del_lnk--> crimes against humanity at the <!--del_lnk--> Nuremberg Trials, where 21 were executed. Party members - even those who were ordinary citizens - experienced a post-war &quot;purge&quot; where they were stripped of property, assets and often forced to abandon their positions. As part of Nazi Germany, <a href="../../wp/a/Austria.htm" title="Austria">Austria</a> also experienced <!--del_lnk--> denazification, though this process occurred to a smaller degree only much later.<p><b>Foreign-Born</b>: During and prior to <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, there were a number of people outside of the German Reich who became adherents to the Nazi ideology. Some foreign born ethnic Germans had ventured from their homelands to become citizens of the Nazi State in the pre-war years. This was particularly the case around <!--del_lnk--> Sao Paulo, where people had left in the thousands despite the fact that, at the same time, efforts were being made to draw the Germany-born population into the region.<p><b>Nazi Supporters</b>: Other Nazi supporters, such as <!--del_lnk--> William Joyce and the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Lord Haw Haw&quot; cast, took flight from Britain, especially after the downfall of the <!--del_lnk--> British Union of Fascists. Similarly, parties supportive of the Nazis had failed to influence their own countries. Some people in the <!--del_lnk--> German-American Bund were incarcerated during the war, as were potential Nazi supporters in the U.S.<p><b>Post-war Nazis</b>: <!--del_lnk--> George Lincoln Rockwell, a former U.S. Navy lieutenant commander, became a prominent Nazi in the <!--del_lnk--> 1950s and formed the <!--del_lnk--> American Nazi Party. Some became admirers or sympathized with the plight of Nazi Germany because they saw it as the defender of <!--del_lnk--> Oswald Spengler&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> West&quot;. From this point of view, the Nazi State was brought to its knees trying to solidify a self-sufficient Europe and ward of the influence of the Soviet Union and the United States, political and otherwise. Spenglerians such as <!--del_lnk--> Francis Parker Yockey supported this view, and his magnum opus, <i><!--del_lnk--> Imperium</i>, has sold over twenty thousand copies since 1948. Essentially, Yockey was convinced that Nazi Germany was a step towards Spengler&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Imperium, and during the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>, Yockey dedicated his life to promoting a general European rebellion against the overlordship of both the Soviet Union and the United States.<p><b>Esoteric Nazis</b>: Others were fascinated by National Socialist philosophy in a spiritual or esoteric direction, including: <!--del_lnk--> Savitri Devi of <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Julius Evola of <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Miguel Serrano of <a href="../../wp/c/Chile.htm" title="Chile">Chile</a>.<p><a id="Factors_that_promoted_the_success_of_Nazism" name="Factors_that_promoted_the_success_of_Nazism"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Factors that promoted the success of Nazism</span></h2>
      <p>An important question about Nazism is the factors that promoted its success in Germany. These factors may have included:<ul>
       <li>A widespread acceptance of violence in politics (not only, but most significantly &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Rot Front&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> Communist Party of Germany) versus <!--del_lnk--> SA).<li><!--del_lnk--> Economic devastation all over <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> after <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>.<li>Humiliation of Germany at the <a href="../../wp/t/Treaty_of_Versailles.htm" title="Treaty of Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, and the widespread belief that the German military were not defeated on the battlefield but &quot;<!--del_lnk--> stabbed in the back&quot; by politicians and <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jew">Jews</a>.<li>A perception that there were a disproportionate number of rich <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> <!--del_lnk--> bankers controlling Germany&#39;s finances.<li>Perceived Jewish involvement in <!--del_lnk--> war profiteering during WWI.<li>Appeal of <a href="../../wp/n/Nationalism.htm" title="Nationalism">nationalist</a> rhetoric.<li>Rejection of <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">Communism</a> and the perception that Communism was a Jewish-inspired and Jewish-led movement; hence the Nazi use of the term <i><!--del_lnk--> Judeo-Bolshevik</i>.<li>Fear by the middle and upper classes of the loss of possesions and wealth to Communism.<li>The split in the working class between Social Democrats (SPD) and Communists, exacerbated by the Communists&#39; policy of treating the SPD as <!--del_lnk--> &quot;Social Fascists&quot;<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Great Depression.<li>Hitler&#39;s choice of taking power through legal political means rather than a violent <!--del_lnk--> coup after the failure of the <!--del_lnk--> Beer Hall Putsch.</ul>
      <p><a id="Nazi.2FThird_Reich_terminology_in_popular_culture" name="Nazi.2FThird_Reich_terminology_in_popular_culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Nazi/Third Reich terminology in popular culture</span></h2>
      <p>The multiple atrocities and racist ideology that the Nazis followed have made them notorious in popular discourse as well as history. The term &quot;Nazi&quot; has become a genericised term of abuse. So have other Third Reich terms like &quot;F&uuml;hrer&quot; (often spelled &quot;fuhrer&quot; or less often, but more correctly, &quot;fuehrer&quot; in English-speaking countries), &quot;Fascist&quot;, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Gestapo&quot; (short for <i>Geheime Staatspolizei</i>, or <i>Secret State Police</i> in English) or &quot;Hitler&quot;. The terms are used to describe any people or behaviours that are viewed as thuggish, overly authoritarian, or extremist.<p>The terms are also used to describe anyone or anything seen as strict or doctrinaire. Phrases like &quot;<!--del_lnk--> grammar nazi&quot;, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Feminazi&quot;, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Open Source Nazi&quot;, and &quot;parking [enforcement] nazis&quot;, are examples of those in use in the USA. These uses are offensive to some, as the controversy in the popular press over the <i><a href="../../wp/s/Seinfeld.htm" title="Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></i> &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Soup Nazi&quot; episode indicates, but still the terms are used so frequently as to inspire &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Godwin&#39;s Law&quot;.<p>More innocent terms, like &quot;fashion police&quot;, also bear some resemblance to Nazi terminology (Gestapo, Secret State Police) as well as references to <a href="../../wp/p/Police_state.htm" title="Police state">Police states</a> in general.<p>Another similar effect can be observed in the usage of <!--del_lnk--> typefaces. Some people strongly associate the <!--del_lnk--> blackletter typefaces (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> fraktur or <!--del_lnk--> schwabacher) with Nazi propaganda (although the typeface is much older, and its usage, ironically, was banned by government order in 1941). A less strong association can be observed with the <i><!--del_lnk--> Futura</i> typeface, which today is sometimes described as &quot;germanic&quot; and &quot;muscular&quot;.<p>In popular culture such as films like the <i><!--del_lnk--> Indiana Jones</i> series, Nazis are often considered to be ideal villains whom the heroes can battle without mercy.<p>Dr. Cube from <i><!--del_lnk--> Kaiju Big Battel</i> is depicted as a Nazi plastic surgeon gone mad.<p>Video game website <!--del_lnk--> IGN declared Nazis to be the most memorable <!--del_lnk--> video game villains ever <!--del_lnk--> .<p><a id="Nazi_locations" name="Nazi_locations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Nazi locations</span></h2>
      <p>Nazism, both before and after World War II, was a quasi-religion to its followers, and like many world religions, Nazism had its own venerated locations or sites, as opposed to <a href="../../wp/t/The_Holocaust.htm" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> sites. National socialist <!--del_lnk--> Savitri Devi visited many of the Nazi sites during a <!--del_lnk--> tour of the sites circa <!--del_lnk--> 1953: <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Berchtesgaden, home of the <!--del_lnk--> Berghof;<li><!--del_lnk--> Braunau am Inn, birthplace of Adolf Hitler (in <a href="../../wp/a/Austria.htm" title="Austria">Austria</a>);<li><!--del_lnk--> Feldherrnhalle, site of the failed <!--del_lnk--> Munich Putsch;<li><!--del_lnk--> Leonding, where the parents of Adolf Hitler were buried;<li><!--del_lnk--> Linz, where Hitler went to school;<li><!--del_lnk--> Landsberg am Lech, where Hitler was imprisoned;<li><!--del_lnk--> Nuremberg, site of the enormous Nazi rallies;<li><!--del_lnk--> Wewelsburg, headquarters of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Schutzstaffel</i> (<!--del_lnk--> SS); and<li><!--del_lnk--> Wunsiedel, burial site of <!--del_lnk--> Rudolf Hess.</ul>
      <p>Devi also visited some sites, not directly connected to Nazism, but perceived to be of spiritual or German-national significance: <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Externsteine, pre-Christian mountain-pillar formation; and,<li><!--del_lnk--> Hermannsdenkmal, statue of Germany&#39;s national hero <!--del_lnk--> Arminius the <!--del_lnk--> Cheruscan.</ul>
