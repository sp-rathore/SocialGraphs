      <p><a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h3>
      <p>Portman was born in <a href="../../wp/j/Jerusalem.htm" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israel</a>. Her father, Avner Hershlag, is an Israeli medical doctor specializing in the research and treatment of human fertility and reproduction (<!--del_lnk--> reproductive <!--del_lnk--> endocrinology). Her mother, Shelley Stevens, is a <!--del_lnk--> Jewish American housewife who now works as her agent (she is an artist by hobby and not profession). Portman&#39;s father&#39;s family members are descendants of <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jew">Jewish</a> immigrants from <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Poland</a> and <a href="../../wp/r/Romania.htm" title="Romania">Romania</a>, while her mother&#39;s family members were Jewish immigrants from <a href="../../wp/a/Austria.htm" title="Austria">Austria</a> and <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>; her paternal grandfather&#39;s parents died in <!--del_lnk--> Auschwitz and her Romanian-born great-grandmother was a spy for the British during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. <p>Portman&#39;s parents met at a Jewish student centre at the <!--del_lnk--> Ohio State University, where Portman&#39;s mother was selling tickets. Portman&#39;s father returned to Israel, but the two corresponded and were married when Portman&#39;s mother visited Israel a few years later. When Portman was three years old, her family moved from Israel to her mother&#39;s native <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, where her father pursued his medical training. The family lived in <a href="../../wp/w/Washington%252C_D.C..htm" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> in 1984 (she attended the Charles E. Smith Jewish Day School) and then <!--del_lnk--> Connecticut in 1988, before finally settling down in <!--del_lnk--> Syosset, New York in 1990. Portman has said that although she &quot;really love[s] the States,&quot; her &quot;heart&#39;s in Jerusalem. That&#39;s where I feel at home.&quot; Portman is an only child and very close to her parents, who are often seen with her at her film premieres; her mother always accompanied pre-adult Portman to filming locations.<p><a id="Early_career" name="Early_career"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early career</span></h3>
      <p>Portman started taking dancing lessons at the age of four, performed in local troupes, and dreamed of dancing on Broadway. At the age of twelve Portman was discovered in a <!--del_lnk--> pizza parlor by an agent for <!--del_lnk--> Revlon, who offered her an opportunity to model. She asked to be introduced to <!--del_lnk--> acting talent scouts, and took &quot;Portman&quot;, her grandmother&#39;s maiden name, as her professional stage surname.<p>Starting at age 13, Portman spent her school holidays attending upscale theatre camps <!--del_lnk--> Stagedoor Manor and <!--del_lnk--> Usdan Camp, where she forged her love for acting, playing roles in the camp productions such as the title character in <i><!--del_lnk--> Anne of Green Gables</i>, Dream Laurey in <i><!--del_lnk--> Oklahoma!</i> and Hermia in <i><!--del_lnk--> A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream</i>. In 1993 Portman was handed her first professional role as an understudy for the off-Broadway musical <i>Ruthless!</i>.<p>Her inaugural experience in professional theatre led her to audition for <!--del_lnk--> Luc Besson&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> 1994 film <i><!--del_lnk--> L&eacute;on</i> (aka <i>The Professional</i>). She was initially turned down for the role due to her youth, but further auditioning won her the part. Soon after Portman was given the part, she took Portman as her stage name in the interest of privacy. In the film, Portman plays an orphaned girl who befriends a much older assassin. <i>L&eacute;on</i> opened on November 18, 1994 and marked her feature film debut at age twelve. That same year she appeared in the short film <i><!--del_lnk--> Developing</i> which aired on television.<p><a name="1995.E2.80.931999"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1995&ndash;1999</span></h3>
      <p>She was cast in the high-budget action film <i><!--del_lnk--> Heat</i>. Although she had a small role, she starred alongside some of the industry&#39;s biggest names such as <!--del_lnk--> Robert De Niro, <!--del_lnk--> Al Pacino and <!--del_lnk--> Val Kilmer. Following the success of <i>L&eacute;on</i>, Portman had gained considerable fame for her performance and was approached for the role of Marty in <!--del_lnk--> Ted Demme&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Beautiful Girls</i>. Following an audition, she was cast in <!--del_lnk--> Woody Allen&#39;s comedy-musical <i><!--del_lnk--> Everyone Says I Love You</i>. She was also given a role in <!--del_lnk--> Tim Burton&#39;s famously star-studded <i><!--del_lnk--> Mars Attacks!</i>. She had been considered for the role of Juliet in the 1996 film <i><!--del_lnk--> Romeo + Juliet</i>, but was eventually turned down because of the age difference between her and <!--del_lnk--> Leonardo DiCaprio.<p>In 1996, to Portman&#39;s surprise, casting director for the new <i><a href="../../wp/s/Star_Wars.htm" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a></i> films <!--del_lnk--> Robin Gurland contacted her to see if she was interested in playing the female lead in the new films. Portman, still only 14 years old and having never seen the original three Star Wars films, was speculative at first about the commitment she was making and what impact it would have on her life, as the role would ultimately see her participate in three films over the course of a decade. After meeting with <!--del_lnk--> George Lucas and producer <!--del_lnk--> Rick McCallum she signed on to the prequel trilogy. Portman then auditioned for the role of Anne Frank in the Broadway revival of <i><!--del_lnk--> The Diary of Anne Frank</i>. The decision to participate in this production caused her to pull out of the film <i><!--del_lnk--> The Horse Whisperer</i>. In mid-1997, production began on the first of the three <i>Star Wars</i> prequel films, <i><!--del_lnk--> Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace</i>.<p>She returned to complete her junior year in high school; whilst studying she also performed in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Diary of Anne Frank</i>. She did eight shows a week while attending classes full-time. The play was performed for a month at the <!--del_lnk--> Colonial Theatre in <a href="../../wp/b/Boston%252C_Massachusetts.htm" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston</a> before making its Broadway debut at the <!--del_lnk--> Music Box Theatre in early December. She would receive a <!--del_lnk--> Tony nomination for her role as Anne Frank. She was also offered a role in the film <i><!--del_lnk--> Anywhere But Here</i>, but after reading the script turned down the role as her character was involved in a sex scene. Director <!--del_lnk--> Wayne Wang and actress <!--del_lnk--> Susan Sarandon rushed to her support and demanded a rewrite of the script, allegedly saying they would not continue their involvement in the film unless the young actress&rsquo;s wishes were respected. Portman was shown a new script and she happily joined the project. In early 1999, <i>The Phantom Menace</i> opened and became the highest grossing film of the year and the second highest grossing film out of the <i>Star Wars</i> series. Its massive audience and mainstream appeal saw Portman become an instant star. Portman then signed on to play a persevering teenaged mother in <i><!--del_lnk--> Where the Heart Is</i>. <i>Anywhere But Here</i> opened in late 1999; she received a <!--del_lnk--> Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Ann August.<p><a name="2000.E2.80.932005"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">2000&ndash;2005</span></h3>
      <p>After filming <i><!--del_lnk--> Where the Heart Is</i>, Portman moved into the dorms of <!--del_lnk--> Harvard to pursue her <!--del_lnk--> bachelor&#39;s degree in <a href="../../wp/p/Psychology.htm" title="Psychology">psychology</a>. She graduated in 2003. In July 2001, Portman opened in <!--del_lnk--> New York City&#39;s Public Theatre production of <!--del_lnk--> Chekhov&#39;s <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Seagull.htm" title="The Seagull">The Seagull</a></i>, directed by <!--del_lnk--> Mike Nichols, playing the role of Nina alongside co-stars <!--del_lnk--> Meryl Streep, <!--del_lnk--> Kevin Kline and <!--del_lnk--> Philip Seymour Hoffman. The play opened at the <!--del_lnk--> Delacorte Theatre in <!--del_lnk--> Central Park. That same year she was one of many celebrities who made cameo appearances in the comedy <i><!--del_lnk--> Zoolander</i>. <i><!--del_lnk--> Attack of the Clones</i> was filmed in <a href="../../wp/s/Sydney.htm" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> during this time, including additional production in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>.<p>In 2002, <i>Attack of the Clones</i> opened around the world. Portman was cast in a small role in the film <i><!--del_lnk--> Cold Mountain</i> alongside <!--del_lnk--> Jude Law and <!--del_lnk--> Nicole Kidman. In 2004, Portman had starring roles in the independent movies <i><!--del_lnk--> Garden State</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Closer</i>. <i>Garden State</i> was an official selection of the <!--del_lnk--> Sundance Film Festival and won Best First Feature at the <!--del_lnk--> Independent Spirit Awards. Her role of Alice in <i>Closer</i> saw Portman win a Supporting Actress Golden Globe as well as a <!--del_lnk--> Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination.<p>In 2005 she filmed <i><!--del_lnk--> Free Zone</i>. The year also saw a close to the <i>Star Wars</i> prequel trilogy, with <i><!--del_lnk--> Revenge of the Sith</i> released worldwide on May 19. The film was the highest grossing film of the year and was voted Favorite Motion Picture at the <!--del_lnk--> People&#39;s Choice Awards. Shortly before the film&#39;s opening, Portman shaved her head for her role in the film adaptation of <!--del_lnk--> Alan Moore&#39;s graphic novel, <i><!--del_lnk--> V for Vendetta</i>, released in March 2006. Her shaved head was first seen publicly at the <i>Revenge of the Sith</i> premieres. She kept her hair short for most of 2005, had a <!--del_lnk--> fauxhawk <!--del_lnk--> mohawk, and briefly sported a full mohawk in late August, saying that it was &quot;kind of wonderful to throw vanity away for a bit&quot;. During the latter part of 2005, Portman filmed <i><!--del_lnk--> Goya&#39;s Ghosts</i>.<p><a name="2006.E2.80.93present"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">2006&ndash;present</span></h3>
      <p>Portman made her <i><!--del_lnk--> Saturday Night Live</i> debut on <!--del_lnk--> March 4, <!--del_lnk--> 2006 , hosting the show with musical guest <!--del_lnk--> Fall Out Boy and special guest star <!--del_lnk--> Dennis Haysbert. In a now-famous <i>SNL</i> Digital short, she portrays herself as an angry <!--del_lnk--> gangsta rapper (with <!--del_lnk--> Andy Samberg as her Flava Flav-esque partner in Viking garb) during a faux-interview with <!--del_lnk--> Chris Parnell, saying she cheated at Harvard University while high on pot. (Note: NBC edited out all references to Harvard and smoking pot from the the version of the video available on at NBC.com) In another sketch, she portrays a student named Rebecca Hershlag (her actual surname) attending a Bar Mitzvah, and in an installment of the recurring sketch The Needlers (a.k.a. Sally and Dan, The Couple That Should Be Divorced), plays a fertility specialist (her father is a physician who specializes in fertility and reproduction).<div class="thumb tright">

      <p><i>V for Vendetta</i> opened in early 2006. Portman portrayed <!--del_lnk--> Evey Hammond, a young woman who is saved from the secret police by the main character, <!--del_lnk--> V. Portman worked with a voice coach for the role, learning to speak in an <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a> accent. <!--del_lnk--> <i>Maxim</i> magazine named Portman #33 on its annual <!--del_lnk--> Hot 100 list, citing her <i>V for Vendetta</i> bald head as a huge accomplishment proving &quot;you don&#39;t need hair to be hot.&quot;<p>Portman has commented on <i>V for Vendetta&#39;</i>s political relevance, and mentioned that her character, who joins an underground anti-government group, is &quot;often bad and does things that you don&#39;t like&quot; and that &quot;Being from Israel was a reason I wanted to do this because terrorism and violence are such a daily part of my conversations since I was little,&quot; although the film &quot;doesn&#39;t make clear good or bad statements. It respects the audience enough to take away their own opinion&quot;. Portman&#39;s upcoming films include <i><!--del_lnk--> Goya&#39;s Ghosts</i> and <i>Free Zone</i> (an Israeli film which received a limited U.S. theatrical release in April 2006). She is set to appear in the children&#39;s film <i>Mr. Magorium&#39;s Wonder Emporium</i>, which began filming in April 2006; Portman has said that she was &quot;excited to do a kids movie.&quot;<p>Portman is currently filming <i>The Other Boleyn Girl</i>, a historical drama in which she will play <!--del_lnk--> Anne Boleyn; <!--del_lnk--> Eric Bana and <!--del_lnk--> Scarlett Johansson will co-star in the film.<p>Portman recently landed a small role in the 18th season of the Emmy Award winning series, <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Simpsons.htm" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i>. She will be the voice of Bart Simpson&#39;s love interest from a neighboring town. <p><a id="Personal_life" name="Personal_life"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Personal life</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Beliefs" name="Beliefs"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Beliefs</span></h3>
      <p>Portman has advocated for <!--del_lnk--> environmental causes from a young age, becoming a member of the environmental song and dance troupe <!--del_lnk--> The World Patrol Kids at age 12. She is a self-proclaimed &quot;<!--del_lnk--> animal lover,&quot; and has been a <!--del_lnk--> vegetarian since she was eight years old.<p>Portman has spent some of her free time involved in causes such as the <!--del_lnk--> Democrats&#39; <!--del_lnk--> 2004 U.S. presidential campaign and ending poverty. In 2004 and 2005 she traveled to <a href="../../wp/u/Uganda.htm" title="Uganda">Uganda</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Guatemala.htm" title="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>, and <a href="../../wp/e/Ecuador.htm" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a> as the Ambassador of Hope for <!--del_lnk--> FINCA International, an organization that promotes <!--del_lnk--> micro-lending to help finance women-owned businesses in poor countries. In an interview conducted backstage at the <!--del_lnk--> Live 8 concert in Philadelphia and appearing on the <!--del_lnk--> PBS program <i><!--del_lnk--> Foreign Exchange with Fareed Zakaria</i> she discussed micro-financing.<p>Portman commented in an interview that &quot;I&#39;m much more like the product of a doctor than I am a Jew.&quot; On the concept of the <!--del_lnk--> afterlife, she comments &quot;I don&#39;t believe in that. I believe this is it, and I believe it&#39;s the best way to live.&quot;<p><a id="Controversy" name="Controversy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Controversy</span></h3>
      <p>Portman, who had recently read some of the works by <!--del_lnk--> W.E.B. DuBois, was interviewed for the August 2004 issue of <i><!--del_lnk--> Allure</i> magazine where she was quoted as saying, &quot;Oh my God! I&#39;m not black, but I know what it feels like!&quot; This prompted her to follow up with a letter to their editor, in which she wrote: &quot;The &#39;it&#39; I was referring to when I said, &#39;I know what it feels like,&#39; was not intended to signify that I know &#39;how black people feel,&#39; but rather that I know what DuBois&rsquo;s concept of double-consciousness feels like, in variation. Had my quote included what I actually said preceding that statement, perhaps my meaning would have been clearer.&quot;<p>Portman also made headlines when she was moved away by <!--del_lnk--> Israeli Police on <!--del_lnk--> February 23, <!--del_lnk--> 2005 from <a href="../../wp/j/Jerusalem.htm" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Western Wall after protests by religious Jews who were praying at the holy site. She and Israeli actor <!--del_lnk--> Aki Avni were filming a kissing scene near the Wailing Wall for the movie <i>Free Zone</i>. This was deemed to be immodest and men who were praying heckled the pair until police stepped in and suggested they return later. The site is under the authority of <!--del_lnk--> Orthodox Judaism, and Rabbi <!--del_lnk--> Shmuel Rabinovitch, who is responsible for the site, said the actors&#39; behaviour violated the code of conduct.<p>It was reported that on <!--del_lnk--> July 8, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, Portman was pulled over by the <!--del_lnk--> NYPD while driving in a transit tunnel underneath <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a> for looking unusual and having an expired registration. She had a shaven head from playing a <!--del_lnk--> freedom fighter in <i>V for Vendetta</i>, and had just arrived back in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> from Israel and film shooting in Berlin. The policeman told her not to drive in the tunnel, but to take the bridge instead. &quot;I&#39;ve never had that happen to me before,&quot; Portman said. &quot;It&#39;s supposedly random... I didn&#39;t understand that logic. If you&#39;re a suspect, don&#39;t take the tunnel, take the bridge?&quot;<p><a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h3>
      <p>Portman held a 4.0 <!--del_lnk--> GPA throughout high school. She has said that she was &quot;used to As&quot; but admits to reading about institutional <!--del_lnk--> grade inflation in the <!--del_lnk--> Ivy Leagues in the <i><!--del_lnk--> New York Times</i>. She reported on a talk show, &quot;I&#39;d rather be smart than be a movie star&quot; and that her goal was to graduate from college even if it ruined her acting career. Despite her high profile and the affluence of her parents, at 13 she switched (&quot;because I couldn&#39;t stand it anymore&quot;) to the public <!--del_lnk--> Syosset High School in <!--del_lnk--> Syosset, New York, graduating in June of <!--del_lnk--> 1999. Portman reportedly had to miss the premiere of <i>Star Wars: Episode I</i> so she could study for her high school final exams.<p>After high school, Portman enrolled at Harvard University where she graduated with a bachelor&#39;s degree in <a href="../../wp/p/Psychology.htm" title="Psychology">Psychology</a> on <!--del_lnk--> June 5, <!--del_lnk--> 2003. In <!--del_lnk--> 2005 Portman pursued graduate studies at <!--del_lnk--> Hebrew University in <a href="../../wp/j/Jerusalem.htm" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>.

      <p>Portman keeps her personal life as far away from the media spotlight as possible. She has always had many close male friends and rumored suitors who are frequently named as her boyfriends; the unverified gossip is often repeated as fact in tabloids and biographies. In reality, Portman has dated a couple of her college classmates, and has had alleged romantic links with actors including Liron Levo, <a href="../../wp/j/Jake_Gyllenhaal.htm" title="Jake Gyllenhaal">Jake Gyllenhaal</a>,, <!--del_lnk--> Hayden Christensen,  and <!--del_lnk--> Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal. In the May 2002 issue of <i><!--del_lnk--> Vogue</i> Portman called actor/musician <!--del_lnk--> Lukas Haas and musician <!--del_lnk--> Moby her close friends. She was linked to <!--del_lnk--> Maroon 5 frontman <!--del_lnk--> Adam Levine, but he claims they are friends. Recently, she is reportedly dating Nat <!--del_lnk--> Rothschild, of the famous multi-billionaire, Jewish banking family. But despite the rumors of her and Rothschild, Natalie has been spotted lately with Gael again. The two were seen kissing in London and Natalie has stated she has had an &quot;intimate&quot; realtionship with him before.<p><a id="Trivia" name="Trivia"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Trivia</span></h2>
