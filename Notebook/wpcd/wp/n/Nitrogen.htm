      <p>Nitrogen is a <!--del_lnk--> non-metal, with an <!--del_lnk--> electronegativity of 3.0. It has five <!--del_lnk--> electrons in its outer shell and is therefore <!--del_lnk--> trivalent in most compounds. The triple bond in molecular nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) is one of the strongest in nature. The resulting difficulty of converting (N<sub>2</sub>) into other compounds, and the relative ease (and associated high energy release) of converting nitrogen compounds into elemental N<sub>2</sub>, have dominated the role of nitrogen in both nature and human economic activities.<p>Molecular nitrogen <!--del_lnk--> condenses at 77 <!--del_lnk--> K at <!--del_lnk--> atmospheric pressure and freezes at 63 K. Liquid nitrogen, a fluid resembling water, but with 81% of the density, is a common <!--del_lnk--> cryogen.<p><a id="Occurrence" name="Occurrence"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Occurrence</span></h2>
      <p>Nitrogen is the largest single component of the Earth&#39;s <a href="../../wp/e/Earth%2527s_atmosphere.htm" title="Earth&#39;s atmosphere">atmosphere</a> (78.084% by volume, 75.5% by weight).<p><sup>14</sup>Nitrogen is created as part of the <!--del_lnk--> fusion processes in <a href="../../wp/s/Star.htm" title="Star">stars</a>.<p>Compounds that contain this element have been observed by astronomers, and molecular nitrogen has been detected in <!--del_lnk--> interstellar space by <!--del_lnk--> David Knauth and coworkers using the <!--del_lnk--> Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer. Molecular nitrogen is a major constituent of <!--del_lnk--> Titan&#39;s thick atmosphere, and occurs in trace amounts of other planetary atmospheres.<p>Nitrogen is present in all living tissues as proteins, nucleic acids and other molecules. It is a large component of animal waste (for example, <!--del_lnk--> guano), usually in the form of <!--del_lnk--> urea, <!--del_lnk--> uric acid, and compounds of these nitrogenous products.<p><a id="Isotopes" name="Isotopes"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Isotopes</span></h2>
      <p>See also <!--del_lnk--> Isotopes of nitrogen<p>There are two stable <!--del_lnk--> isotopes of nitrogen: <sup>14</sup>N and <sup>15</sup>N. By far the most common is <sup>14</sup>N (99.634%), which is produced in the <!--del_lnk--> CNO cycle in <a href="../../wp/s/Star.htm" title="Star">stars</a> and the remaining is <sup>15</sup>N. Of the ten isotopes produced synthetically, <sup>13</sup>N has a <!--del_lnk--> half life of nine minutes and the remaining isotopes have half lives on the order of seconds or less. Biologically-mediated reactions (e.g., <!--del_lnk--> assimilation, <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrification.htm" title="Nitrification">nitrification</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> denitrification) strongly control nitrogen dynamics in the soil. These reactions almost always result in <sup>15</sup>N enrichment of the <!--del_lnk--> substrate and depletion of the <!--del_lnk--> product.<p>The molecular nitrogen in Earth&#39;s atmosphere is 0.73% comprised of the <!--del_lnk--> isotopologue <sup>14</sup>N<sup>15</sup>N and almost all the rest is <sup>14</sup>N<sub>2</sub>.<p><a id="Electromagnetic_spectrum" name="Electromagnetic_spectrum"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Electromagnetic spectrum</span></h2>
      <p>Molecular nitrogen (<sup>14</sup>N<sub>2</sub>) is largely transparent to infrared and visible radiation because it is a homonuclear molecule and thus has no <!--del_lnk--> dipole moment to couple to electromagnetic radiation at these wavelengths. Significant absorption occurs at extreme ultraviolet wavelengths, beginning around 100 nanometers. This is associated with electronic transitions in the molecule to states in which charge is not distributed evenly between nitrogen atoms. Nitrogen absorption leads to significant absorption of ultraviolet radiation in the Earth&#39;s upper atmosphere as well as in the atmospheres of other planetary bodies. For similar reasons, pure molecular <!--del_lnk--> nitrogen lasers typically emit light in the far ultraviolet range.<p>Nitrogen also makes a contribution to visible <!--del_lnk--> air glow from the Earth&#39;s upper atmosphere, through electron impact excitation followed by emission. This visible blue air glow (seen in the polar <!--del_lnk--> aurora and in the re-entry glow of returning spacecraft) typically results not from molecular nitrogen, but rather from free nitrogen atoms combining with oxygen to form <!--del_lnk--> nitric oxide (NO).<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p>Nitrogen (<a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>nitrogenium</i>, where <i>nitrum</i> (from <!--del_lnk--> Greek <i>nitron</i>) means &quot;native soda&quot; (see <!--del_lnk--> niter), and <i>genes</i> means &quot;forming&quot;) is formally considered to have been discovered by <!--del_lnk--> Daniel Rutherford in <!--del_lnk--> 1772, who called it <i>noxious air</i> or <i>fixed air</i>. That there was a fraction of air that did not support <!--del_lnk--> combustion was well known to the late 18th century chemist. Nitrogen was also studied at about the same time by <!--del_lnk--> Carl Wilhelm Scheele, <!--del_lnk--> Henry Cavendish, and <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Priestley, who referred to it as <i>burnt air</i> or <i><!--del_lnk--> phlogisticated air</i>. Nitrogen gas was <!--del_lnk--> inert enough that <a href="../../wp/a/Antoine_Lavoisier.htm" title="Antoine Lavoisier">Antoine Lavoisier</a> referred to it as <i>azote</i>, from the <!--del_lnk--> Greek word &alpha;&zeta;&omega;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf; meaning &quot;lifeless&quot;. Animals died in it, and it was the principal component of air in which animals had suffocated and flames had burned to extinction. This term has become the <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a> word for &quot;nitrogen&quot; and later spread out to many other languages.<p>Compounds of nitrogen were known in the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>. The <a href="../../wp/a/Alchemy.htm" title="Alchemy">alchemists</a> knew <!--del_lnk--> nitric acid as <i>aqua fortis</i> (strong water). The mixture of nitric and <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrochloric_acid.htm" title="Hydrochloric acid">hydrochloric acids</a> was known as <i><!--del_lnk--> aqua regia</i> (royal water), celebrated for its ability to dissolve <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a> (the <i>king</i> of metals). The earliest industrial and <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agricultural</a> applications of nitrogen compounds used it in the form of <!--del_lnk--> saltpeter (<!--del_lnk--> sodium- or <a href="../../wp/p/Potassium_nitrate.htm" title="Potassium nitrate">potassium nitrate</a>), notably in <a href="../../wp/g/Gunpowder.htm" title="Gunpowder">gunpowder</a>, and much later, as <a href="../../wp/f/Fertilizer.htm" title="Fertilizer">fertilizer</a>, and later still, as a chemical <!--del_lnk--> feedstock.<p><a id="Biological_role" name="Biological_role"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Biological role</span></h2>
      <p>See also <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen_cycle.htm" title="Nitrogen cycle">nitrogen cycle</a><p>Nitrogen is an essential part of <!--del_lnk--> amino acids and <!--del_lnk--> nucleic acids, both of which are essential to all life.<p>Molecular nitrogen in the atmosphere cannot be used directly by either plants or animals, and needs to be converted to other compounds, or &quot;fixed,&quot; in order to be used by life. <!--del_lnk--> Precipitation often contains substantial quantities of <!--del_lnk--> ammonium and nitrate, both thought to be a result of nitrogen fixation by lightning and other atmospheric electric phenomena. However, because ammonium is preferentially retained by the forest canopy relative to atmospheric nitrate, most of the fixed nitrogen that reaches the soil surface under trees is in the form of nitrate. Soil nitrate is preferentially assimilated by tree roots relative to soil ammonium.<p>Specific bacteria (e.g. Rhizobium <i>trifolium</i>) possess <!--del_lnk--> nitrogenase enzymes which can fix atmospheric nitrogen (see <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen_fixation.htm" title="Nitrogen fixation">nitrogen fixation</a>) into a form (ammonium ion) which is chemically useful to higher organisms. This process requires a large amount of energy and anoxic conditions. Such bacteria may be free in the soil (e.g. azotobacter) but normally exist in a symbiotic relationship in the root nodules of leguminous plants (e.g. clover or the soya bean plant). Nitrogen fixating bacteria can be symbiotic with a number of unrelated plant species. Common examples are legumes, alders, lichens, casuarina, myrica, liverwort, and gunnera.<p>As part of the symbiotic relationship, the plant subsequently converts the ammonium ion to nitrogen oxides and amino acids to form <a href="../../wp/p/Protein.htm" title="Protein">proteins</a> and other biologically useful molecules, such as <!--del_lnk--> alkaloids. In return for the usable (fixed) nitrogen, the plant secretes sugars to the symbiotic bacteria.<p>Some plants are able to assimilate nitrogen directly in the form of nitrates which may be present in soil from natural mineral deposits, artificial fertilizers, animal waste, or organic decay (as the product of bacteria, but not bacteria specifically associated with the plant). Nitrates absorbed in this fashion are converted to nitrites by the enzyme <i>nitrate</i> reductase, and then converted to ammonia by another enzyme called <i>nitrite</i> reductase.<p>Nitrogen compounds are basic building blocks in animal biology. Animals use nitrogen-containing <!--del_lnk--> amino acids from plant sources, as starting materials for all nitrogen-compound animal biochemistry, including the manufacture of <!--del_lnk--> proteins and <!--del_lnk--> nucleic acids. Some plant-feeding insects are so dependent on nitrogen in their diet, that varying the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied to a plant can affect the birth rate of the insects feeding on it (Jahn et al. 2005).<p>Soluble nitrate is an important limiting factor in the growth of certain bacteria in ocean waters. In many places in the world, artificial fertilizers applied to crop-lands to increase yields result in run-off delivery of soluble nitrogen to oceans at river mouths. This process can result in <!--del_lnk--> eutrophication of the water, as nitrogen-driven bacterial growth depletes water oxygen to the point that all higher organisms die. Well-known <!--del_lnk--> &quot;dead zone&quot; areas in the U.S. <!--del_lnk--> Gulf Coast and the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Sea.htm" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a> are due to this important polluting process.<p>Many saltwater fish manufacture large amounts of <!--del_lnk--> trimethylamine oxide to protect them from the high osmotic effects of their environment (conversion of this compound to <!--del_lnk--> dimethylamine is responsible for the early odour in unfresh saltwater fish: <!--del_lnk--> PMID 15186102). In animals, the free radical molecule <!--del_lnk--> nitric oxide (NO), which is derived from an amino acid, serves as an important regulatory molecule for circulation.<p>Animal metabolism of NO results in production of <!--del_lnk--> nitrite. Animal metabolism of nitrogen in proteins generally results in excretion of <!--del_lnk--> urea, while animal metabolism of nucleic acids results in excretion of <!--del_lnk--> urea and <!--del_lnk--> uric acid. The characteristic odour of animal flesh decay is caused by nitrogen-containing long-chain <!--del_lnk--> amines, such as <!--del_lnk--> putrescine and <!--del_lnk--> cadaverine.<p>Decay of organisms and their waste products may produce small amounts of nitrate, but most decay eventually returns nitrogen content to the atmosphere, as molecular nitrogen.<p><a id="Modern_applications" name="Modern_applications"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Modern applications</span></h2>

      <p>Nitrogen gas has a wide variety of applications, including serving as a more <!--del_lnk--> inert replacement for air where <!--del_lnk--> oxidation is undesirable;<ul>
       <li>To preserve the freshness of packaged or bulk foods (by delaying <!--del_lnk--> rancidity and other forms of oxidative damage)<li>on top of liquid explosives for safety<li>The production of <a href="../../wp/e/Electronics.htm" title="Electronics">electronic</a> parts such as <!--del_lnk--> transistors, <!--del_lnk--> diodes, and <a href="../../wp/i/Integrated_circuit.htm" title="Integrated circuit">integrated circuits</a><li>dried and pressurized, as a <!--del_lnk--> dielectric gas for <!--del_lnk--> high voltage equipment<li>The manufacture of <!--del_lnk--> stainless steel<li>Use in military aircraft fuel systems to reduce fire hazard, see <!--del_lnk--> inerting system<li>Filling automotive and aircraft <!--del_lnk--> tires due to its inertness and lack of moisture or oxidative qualities, as opposed to air, though this is not necessary for consumer automobiles.</ul>
      <p>Contrary to some claims that nitrogen will diffuse more rapidly through rubber tires than air (and oxygen), nitrogen molecules are less likely to escape from the inside of a tire compared to the traditional air mixture used. <a href="../../wp/e/Earth%2527s_atmosphere.htm" title="Earth&#39;s atmosphere">Air</a> consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. Nitrogen molecules are larger than oxygen molecules and therefore, all else being equal, larger molecules diffuse through porous substances slower than smaller molecules.<p>A further example of its versatility is its use as a preferred alternative to <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> to pressurize kegs of some <a href="../../wp/b/Beer.htm" title="Beer">beers</a>, particularly thicker <!--del_lnk--> stouts and Scottish and English <!--del_lnk--> ales, due to the smaller bubbles it produces, which make the dispensed beer smoother and headier.

      <p><b>Liquid nitrogen</b> (liquid density at the triple point is 0.807 g/mL)is produced industrially in large quantities by <!--del_lnk--> fractional distillation of <!--del_lnk--> liquid air and is often referred to by the quasi-formula <b>LN<sub>2</sub></b> (but is more accurately written <b>N<sub>2</sub>(<i>l</i>)</b> ).

      <p>The main neutral <!--del_lnk--> hydride of nitrogen is <a href="../../wp/a/Ammonia.htm" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a> (N<a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">H</a><sub>3</sub>), although <!--del_lnk--> hydrazine (N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>) is also commonly used. Ammonia is more <!--del_lnk--> basic than <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a> by 6 orders of magnitude. In <!--del_lnk--> solution ammonia forms the <!--del_lnk--> ammonium <!--del_lnk--> ion (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>). Liquid ammonia (b.p. 240 K) is <!--del_lnk--> amphiprotic (displaying either <!--del_lnk--> Br&oslash;nsted-Lowry acidic or basic character) and forms ammonium and the less common <!--del_lnk--> amide ions (NH<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>); both amides and <!--del_lnk--> nitride (N<sup>3-</sup>) <a href="../../wp/s/Salt.htm" title="Salt">salts</a> are known, but <!--del_lnk--> decompose in water. Singly, doubly, triply and quadruply substituted alkyl compounds of ammonia are called <!--del_lnk--> amines (four substitutions, to form commercially and biologically important quarternary amines, results in a positively charged nitrogen, and thus a water-soluble, or at least <!--del_lnk--> amphiphilic, compound). Larger chains, rings and structures of nitrogen hydrides are also known, but are generally unstable.<p>Other classes of nitrogen <!--del_lnk--> anions (negatively charged ions) are the poisonous <!--del_lnk--> azides (N<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>), which are linear and <!--del_lnk--> isoelectronic to <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, but which bind to important iron-containing enzymes in the body in a manner more resembling <!--del_lnk--> cyanide. Another <!--del_lnk--> molecule of the same structure is the colorless and relatively inert anesthetic gas <!--del_lnk--> dinitrogen monoxide (N<sub>2</sub><a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">O</a>), also known as laughing gas. This is one of a variety of <!--del_lnk--> oxides, the most prominent of which are <!--del_lnk--> nitrogen monoxide (NO) (known more commonly as <!--del_lnk--> nitric oxide in biology), a natural free radical molecule used by the body as a signal for short-term control of smooth muscle in the circulation. Another notable nitrogen oxide compound (a family often abbreviated <b>NOx</b>) is the reddish and poisonous <!--del_lnk--> nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), which also contains an unpaired <a href="../../wp/e/Electron.htm" title="Electron">electron</a> and is an important component of <a href="../../wp/s/Smog.htm" title="Smog">smog</a>. Nitrogen molecules containing unpaired electrons show an understandable tendency to <!--del_lnk--> dimerize (thus pairing the electrons), and are generally highly reactive.<p>The more standard oxides, <!--del_lnk--> dinitrogen trioxide (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and <!--del_lnk--> dinitrogen pentoxide (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), are actually fairly unstable and explosive-- a tendency which is driven by the stability of N<sub>2</sub> as a product. The corresponding acids are <!--del_lnk--> nitrous (HNO<sub>2</sub>) and <!--del_lnk--> nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>), with the corresponding salts called <!--del_lnk--> nitrites and <!--del_lnk--> nitrates. Nitric acid is one of the few acids stronger than <!--del_lnk--> hydronium, and is a fairly strong <!--del_lnk--> oxidizing agent.<p>Nitrogen can also be found in <!--del_lnk--> organic compounds. Common nitrogen <!--del_lnk--> functional groups include: <!--del_lnk--> amines, <!--del_lnk--> amides, <!--del_lnk--> nitro groups, <!--del_lnk--> imines, and <!--del_lnk--> enamines. The amount of nitrogen in a <!--del_lnk--> chemical substance can be determined by the <!--del_lnk--> Kjeldahl method.<p><a id="Nitrogen_compounds_of_notable_economic_importance" name="Nitrogen_compounds_of_notable_economic_importance"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Nitrogen compounds of notable economic importance</span></h3>
      <p>Molecular nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) in the atmosphere is relatively non-reactive due to its strong bond, and N<sub>2</sub> plays an inert role in the human body, being neither produced or destroyed. In nature, nitrogen is slowly converted into biologically (and industrially) useful compounds by some living organisms, notably certain <a href="../../wp/b/Bacteria.htm" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a> (i.e. <!--del_lnk--> nitrogen fixing bacteria - see <i><a href="#Biological_role" title="">Biological role</a></i> above). Molecular nitrogen is also released into the atmosphere in the process of decay, in dead plant and animal tissues. The ability to combine or <b>fix</b> molecular nitrogen is a key feature of modern industrial chemistry, where nitrogen and <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_gas.htm" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a> are converted into <a href="../../wp/a/Ammonia.htm" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a> via the <!--del_lnk--> Haber process. Ammonia, in turn, can be used directly (primarily as a <a href="../../wp/f/Fertilizer.htm" title="Fertilizer">fertilizer</a>, and in the synthesis of nitrated fertilizers), or as a precursor of many other important materials including <!--del_lnk--> explosives, largely via the production of <!--del_lnk--> nitric acid by the <!--del_lnk--> Ostwald process.<p>The organic and inorganic <a href="../../wp/s/Salt.htm" title="Salt">salts</a> of nitric acid have been historically important as stores of chemical energy. They include important compounds such as <a href="../../wp/p/Potassium_nitrate.htm" title="Potassium nitrate">potassium nitrate</a> (or <!--del_lnk--> saltpeter, important historically for its use in <a href="../../wp/g/Gunpowder.htm" title="Gunpowder">gunpowder</a>) and <!--del_lnk--> ammonium nitrate, an important fertilizer and explosive (see <!--del_lnk--> ANFO). Various other nitrated organic compounds, such as <!--del_lnk--> nitroglycerin and <!--del_lnk--> trinitrotoluene, and <!--del_lnk--> nitrocellulose, are used as explosives and propellants for modern firearms. Nitric acid is used as an <!--del_lnk--> oxidizing agent in liquid fueled <!--del_lnk--> rockets. <!--del_lnk--> Hydrazine and hydrazine derivatives find use as rocket <!--del_lnk--> fuels. In most of these compounds, the basic instability and tendency to burn or explode is derived from the fact that nitrogen is present as an oxide, and not as the far more stable nitrogen molecule (N<sub>2</sub>) which is a product of the compounds&#39; thermal decomposition. When nitrates burn or explode, the formation of the powerful triple bond in the N<sub>2</sub> which results, produces most of the energy of the reaction.<p>Nitrogen is a constituent of molecules in every major drug class in pharmacology and medicine. <!--del_lnk--> Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>0) was discovered early in the 19th century to be a partial anesthetic, though it was not used as a surgical anesthetic until later. Called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> laughing gas&quot;, it was found capable of inducing a state of social disinhibition resembling drunkenness. Other notable nitrogen-containing drugs are drugs derived from plant <!--del_lnk--> alkaloids, such as <a href="../../wp/m/Morphine.htm" title="Morphine">morphine</a> (there exist many alkaloids known to have pharmacological effects; in some cases they appear natural chemical defences of plants against predation). Nitrogen containing drugs include all of the major classes of antibiotics, and organic nitrate drugs like <!--del_lnk--> nitroglycerin and <!--del_lnk--> nitroprusside which regulate blood pressure and heart action by mimicing the action of <!--del_lnk--> nitric oxide.<p><a id="Dangers" name="Dangers"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Dangers</span></h2>
      <p>Rapid release of nitrogen gas into an enclosed space can displace oxygen, and therefore represents an <!--del_lnk--> asphyxiation hazard. This may happen with few warning symptoms, since the human <!--del_lnk--> carotid body is a relatively slow and poor low-oxygen (hypoxia) sensing system <!--del_lnk--> . An example occurred shortly before the launch of the first Space Shuttle mission in <!--del_lnk--> 1981, when two technicians lost consciousness and died after they walked into a space located in the Shuttle&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Mobile Launch Platform that was pressurized with pure nitrogen as a precaution against fire. The technicians would have been able to exit the room if they had experienced early symptoms from nitrogen-breathing.<p>When breathed at high <!--del_lnk--> partial pressures (more than about 3 <!--del_lnk--> atmospheres, encountered at depths below about 30 m in <!--del_lnk--> scuba diving) nitrogen begins to act as an anesthetic agent. As such, it can cause <!--del_lnk--> nitrogen narcosis, a temporary semi-anesthetized condition of mental impairment similar to that caused by <!--del_lnk--> nitrous oxide.<p>Nitrogen also dissolves in the <!--del_lnk--> bloodstream, and rapid decompression (particularly in the case of divers ascending too quickly, or astronauts decompressing too quickly from cabin pressure to spacesuit pressure) can lead to a potentially fatal condition called <!--del_lnk--> decompression sickness (formerly known as caisson sickness or more commonly, the &quot;bends&quot;), when nitrogen bubbles form in the bloodstream.<p>Direct skin contact with liquid nitrogen causes severe frostbite (cryogenic burns) within moments to seconds, though not instantly on contact, depending on form of liquid nitrogen (liquid vs. mist) and surface area of the nitrogen-soaked material (soaked clothing or cotton causing more rapid damage than a spill of direct liquid to skin, which for a few seconds is protected by the <!--del_lnk--> Leidenfrost effect).<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen&quot;</div>
