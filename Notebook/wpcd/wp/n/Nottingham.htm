      <p><b>Nottingham</b> is a <a href="../../wp/c/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="City status in the United Kingdom">city</a> (and <!--del_lnk--> county town of <!--del_lnk--> Nottinghamshire) in the <!--del_lnk--> East Midlands of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>. The centre of Nottingham lies on the <!--del_lnk--> River Leen and its southern boundary follows the course of the <!--del_lnk--> River Trent, which flows from <!--del_lnk--> Stoke to the <!--del_lnk--> Humber. According to the <!--del_lnk--> 2001 census, Nottingham has an estimated city <!--del_lnk--> population of 275,100 which increased to an estimated 278,700 in 2005, while the <!--del_lnk--> Nottingham Urban Area <!--del_lnk--> conurbation (which includes surrounding suburbs outside the city boundary, and neighbouring towns) has a population of 666,358 (<!--del_lnk--> ). Nottingham is a member of the <!--del_lnk--> English Core Cities Group.<p>The heart of <!--del_lnk--> Nottingham City Centre is the <!--del_lnk--> Old Market Square, which is undergoing a major redevelopment during <!--del_lnk--> 2006. Most of the main shopping streets surround the square. The Council House, whose disproportionately tall dome can be seen for miles around, is at the top of the square. The inside of the Council House is the Exchange Arcade, a <!--del_lnk--> shopping centre. A <!--del_lnk--> bohemian quarter of the city known as <!--del_lnk--> Hockley has arisen in recent years, situated close to the <!--del_lnk--> Lace Market area. Nottingham receives a lot of tourism, mostly because of the legend of <!--del_lnk--> Robin Hood, visiting <!--del_lnk--> Sherwood forest and <!--del_lnk--> Nottingham Castle.<p>

      <p>The first evidence of settlement dates from pre-Roman times, and it is clear that the Romans also lived in the area.<p>An early name for Nottingham was &quot;Tigguo Cobauc&quot; which means &quot;a place of cavy dwellings.&quot; Founded by <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon invaders after <!--del_lnk--> 600 AD, parts of the settlement have included man-made caves, dug into soft sandstone. The Saxons were led by a chieftain named Snot <!--del_lnk--> . Snot brought together his people in an area where the historic <!--del_lnk--> Lace Market in the City can now be found. The place was called &quot;Snotingaham&quot; &mdash;literally, &quot;the home of Snot&#39;s people&quot; (<i>Inga</i> = the people of; <i>Ham</i> = home). As with many place names throughout England, the word has since been modified, to &quot;Nottingham&quot;.<p>Nottingham was later captured by the <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Danes</a> (<a href="../../wp/v/Viking.htm" title="Viking">Vikings</a>) and in the <a href="../../wp/9/9th_century.htm" title="9th century">9th century</a> became one of the five boroughs (fortified towns) of the <!--del_lnk--> Danelaw.<p>In the <a href="../../wp/1/11th_century.htm" title="11th century">11th century</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Nottingham Castle was constructed on a sandstone outcrop by the <!--del_lnk--> River Trent. The Anglo-Saxon settlement on the hill now occupied by the Lace Market around St. Mary&#39;s Church developed into the English Borough of Nottingham and housed its Town Hall and Courts. A settlement also developed around the castle on the hill opposite and was the French borough supporting the Normans in the Castle. Eventually, the space between was built on as the town grew and the Market Square became the focus of Nottingham several centuries later.<p>The town became a <!--del_lnk--> county corporate in <!--del_lnk--> 1449, giving it effective self-government, in the words of the charter, &quot;for eternity&quot;.<div class="thumb tright">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>The legend of <!--del_lnk--> Robin Hood first arose in the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>. Robin Hood is said to have lived in <!--del_lnk--> Sherwood Forest, to the north of the town, with the <!--del_lnk--> Sheriff of Nottingham as his greatest enemy. The current <!--del_lnk--> Sheriff of Nottingham, Matthew Keyworth, is a largely ceremonious figure with no real jurisdiction. While the legends are almost certainly untrue, particularly in their details, they have had a major impact on Nottingham, with Robin Hood imagery a popular choice for local businesses and many modern tourist attractions exploiting the legend. The Robin Hood Statue in Nottingham is within walking distance from the <!--del_lnk--> Old Market Square.<p>No fewer than three pubs in Nottingham claim the title of <i>England&#39;s Oldest Pub</i>. The contenders for the crown are <!--del_lnk--> Ye Olde Trip To Jerusalem near the castle, <!--del_lnk--> The Bell on the <!--del_lnk--> Old Market Square, and <!--del_lnk--> The Salutation on <!--del_lnk--> Maid Marian Way. Ye Olde Trip To Jerusalem is supposedly named for its role as a major meeting point for those going on the <!--del_lnk--> Crusades in the Middle Ages. However, its claim may be due partly to the questionable date of 1189 painted on the side of the inn. A recent television documentary tested the three claimants and found that, while each has its own evidence, none can claim exclusivity. The Trip, while the oldest building and oldest location, was for most of its early life a brewery and not a public house. The Salutation sits on the oldest recognised public house site, but the current building is comparatively recent. The Bell, although not in such an antiquated location, does boast the oldest public house building. There is also conflicting information available: <!--del_lnk--> dendrochronology dating evidence from roof timbers in the Salutation give a date for the building of c.<!--del_lnk--> 1420 with similar dates for the Bell. Ultimately, the roots of the multiple claims can be traced to various subtleties of definition in terms such as &quot;public house&quot; and &quot;inn&quot;.<p>Nottingham was one of the boroughs reformed by the <!--del_lnk--> Municipal Corporations Act 1835, and at that time consisted of the parishes of Nottingham St Mary, Nottingham St Nicholas and Nottingham St Peter. It was expanded in 1877 by adding the parishes of <!--del_lnk--> Basford, <!--del_lnk--> Brewhouse Yard, <!--del_lnk--> Bulwell, <!--del_lnk--> Radford, <!--del_lnk--> Sneinton, <!--del_lnk--> Standard Hill and parts of the parishes of <!--del_lnk--> West Bridgford, <!--del_lnk--> Carlton, <!--del_lnk--> Wilford (<!--del_lnk--> North Wilford). In 1889 Nottingham became a <!--del_lnk--> county borough under the <!--del_lnk--> Local Government Act 1888. Nottingham was extended in 1933 by adding <!--del_lnk--> Bilborough and <!--del_lnk--> Wollaton, parts of the parishes of <!--del_lnk--> Bestwood Park and <!--del_lnk--> Colwick, and a recently developed part of the <!--del_lnk--> Beeston urban district. A further boundary extension was granted in 1951 when Clifton and Wilford (south of the River Trent) were incorporated into the city. <!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Caves_of_Nottingham" name="Caves_of_Nottingham"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Caves of Nottingham</span></h3>

      </div>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Nottingham cave network was substantially expanded and became home to a large proportion of the poorer populace, particularly those involved in the <!--del_lnk--> tanning industry. The caves were gradually abandoned in the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th</a> and early part of the <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th</a> century, but came into use again as <!--del_lnk--> air raid shelters during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. A section of the cave network under the <!--del_lnk--> Broadmarsh shopping centre is now open as a tourist attraction, and some parts are still used as pub cellars.<p>Another section of the caves, under the castle, is still in regular use as the indoor rifle range of Nottingham Rifle Club. In addition, <!--del_lnk--> Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem Inn, a pub that claims to be the oldest in Britain (see above), is partly built into the cave system below the castle. Although the pub&#39;s building only dates from the <a href="../../wp/1/16th_century.htm" title="16th century">16th</a> or <a href="../../wp/1/17th_century.htm" title="17th century">17th century</a>, the caves themselves may date to the 11th century and could have been the site of the brewhouse for the castle.<p><a id="St._Anne.27s_Well.2C_or_Robin_Hood.27s_Well" name="St._Anne.27s_Well.2C_or_Robin_Hood.27s_Well"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">St. Anne&#39;s Well, or Robin Hood&#39;s Well</span></h3>
      <p>St. Anne&#39;s Well/Robin Hood&#39;s Well is a historic well linked to the legend of Robin Hood which is located around two miles north-east of Nottingham. Public knowledge of this well dates back to at least <!--del_lnk--> 1287. It was originally called the &quot;Owswell&quot;, but by <!--del_lnk--> 1500 it was usually called, &quot;Robin Hood&#39;s Well&quot;, due to a reputed brawl that occurred on the site involving Robin Hood and his men. By <!--del_lnk--> 1800, the water from the well was said to have healing powers:<dl>
       <dd><i>The water is very old. It will kill a toad. It is used by those who are afflicted with rheumatic pains.</i></dl>
      <p>During the <!--del_lnk--> 1800s the area was the site of a rowdy public house (until numerous complaints forced its closure) before becoming a tea room. When part of a railway line was extended over the site in <!--del_lnk--> 1887, all of the buildings occupying the site were demolished. In <!--del_lnk--> 1987, the well was discovered in the car park of a public house in Wells Road. Action is now being undertaken by some in an attempt to restore this historically important site.<p>There is a drawing by local artist Thomas Cooper Moore (1827 - 1901) of St. Anne&#39;s Well and its associated buildings circa 1856.<p><a id="Architectural_.26_Historical_Contexts" name="Architectural_.26_Historical_Contexts"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Architectural &amp; Historical Contexts</span></h3>
      <p>Nottingham is relatively unusual among big manufacturing cities in Britain in having a medieval and pre-industrial past of equal importance to its more recent one. Unfortunately, this is not readily apparent from the city&rsquo;s buildings. <!--del_lnk--> Nottingham Castle, founded by <a href="../../wp/w/William_I_of_England.htm" title="William I of England">William the Conqueror</a>, famed through the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> as one of the country&rsquo;s finest strongholds, and where <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_I_of_England.htm" title="Charles I of England">Charles I</a> raised the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Standard in 1642 no longer exists, and has been replaced by a classical ducal palace. Of the medieval castle only the (restored) gatehouse, and the ruined remains of some walls/foundations, survive. Further to the east, <!--del_lnk--> Old Market Square, focal point of the city, and reputedly <!--del_lnk--> the largest open square of any English city is being redeveloped.<p>The city descends from north to south, and eventually to the River Trent, though the river itself is not a central feature. The western third of the city houses the castle and several new tall buildings along with some harmonious streets around the Playhouse mainly occupied by professional firms, and the unimposing <!--del_lnk--> Nottingham Cathedral (Roman Catholic). The central third leads down from the Nottingham Trent University building past the Theatre Royal to Old Market Square, which has the Council House to the east. This was built in the 1920s to display civic pride, ostentatiously utilising <a href="../../wp/b/Baroque.htm" title="Baroque">Baroque</a> columns and statues of two lions; the Exchange Arcade underneath, containing boutique shops, is a small but pleasant covered area. Streets lead south to the Broad Marsh Shopping Centre, a bus terminus. The Canalside, further south of this, and adjacent to the railway station and several new but sympathetically designed modern offices, is an inviting redevelopment with bars and restaurants. The eastern third of the city contains the Victoria Shopping Centre and the Victoria centre flats (1972), at 75m high, the highest building in the city. Interesting areas of this part of the city are <!--del_lnk--> Hockley Village (see below) and the Lace Market, where the old red-brick warehouses have been utilised for other purposes, creating an attractive aspect to this part of the city. The Parish Church of St Mary the Virgin is in this area: it and the adjacent Shire Hall are two of the more interesting buildings from the city&rsquo;s pre-industrial past.<p>Probably the most interesting and attractive building (though not really within the city centre but within city limits) is <!--del_lnk--> Wollaton Hall, about 4km to the west of the centre, just north of Nottingham University campus.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

Nottingham is also the home of the <!--del_lnk--> Inland Revenue and the <!--del_lnk--> DSA.<p>Although Boots itself is no longer a direct player in the pharmaceutical industry, a combination of former Boots researchers and university spin-off companies have spawned a thriving pharmaceutical/science/biotechnology sector. BioCity, the UK&rsquo;s biggest bioscience innovation and incubation centre, sits in the heart of the city and houses around thirty science-based companies. Other notable companies in the sector include ClinPhone and Pharmaceutical Profiles. The city has recently been made one of the UK&#39;s six Science Cities.<p>Until recently <a href="../../wp/b/Bicycle.htm" title="Bicycle">bicycle</a> manufacturing was a major industry, the city being the birthplace of <!--del_lnk--> Raleigh Cycles in <!--del_lnk--> 1886 and later joined by <!--del_lnk--> Sturmey-Archer, the creator of 3-speed hub gears.

      <p>The City of Nottingham is widely reported to be one of the most crime hit areas of England, and many crimes show statistics that are <!--del_lnk--> several times higher than the English average. A nationwide survey in 2006 said that Nottingham topped the crime rankings for police statistics on murders, burglaries, and vehicle crime, and &quot;had almost five times the level of crime as the safest town in the rankings&quot;. The survey was initially condemned as inaccurate by Nottingham City Council and Nottinghamshire police force <!--del_lnk-->  due largely to the use of out of date (2001) population figures, although a <!--del_lnk--> revised survey based on 2004 population estimates backed up the original rankings. While the crime figures in the city are high, initiatives introduced to tackle the levels of crime appear to be having an effect, with a <!--del_lnk--> 2006 Home Office survey showing that the overall level of crime in the city is down by 12% since 2003.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

Trent Bridge is a major venue for international <!--del_lnk--> Test matches, and also hosts other important cricketing events such as the Twenty20 cup Finals and regular One-Day International games.

As a curiousity <i>Meadow Lane</i> is actually in the <!--del_lnk--> City of Nottingham and the <i>City Ground</i> is in the <!--del_lnk--> County of Nottingham the river forming the boundary. <i>Forest</i> should not be confused with <i><b>The</b> Forest</i> which is an (open) green space where Goose Fair (see above) is held; however, the team take their name from this open space, having been founded there in 1865.
