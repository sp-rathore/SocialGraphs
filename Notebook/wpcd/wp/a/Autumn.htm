      <p><b>Autumn</b> (also known as <b>fall</b> in <!--del_lnk--> North American English) is one of the four temperate <!--del_lnk--> seasons, the transition from <a href="../../wp/s/Summer.htm" title="Summer">summer</a> into <a href="../../wp/w/Winter.htm" title="Winter">winter</a>. In the <!--del_lnk--> temperate zones, autumn is the season during which most crops are <a href="../../wp/h/Harvest.htm" title="Harvest">harvested</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> deciduous trees lose their <!--del_lnk--> leaves. It is also the season where days rapidly get shorter and cooler, the nights rapidly get longer, and of gradually increasing precipitation in some parts of the world.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Astronomically, some Western countries consider autumn to begin with the September <!--del_lnk--> equinox (around <!--del_lnk--> September 23) in the <!--del_lnk--> Northern hemisphere, and the March equinox (<!--del_lnk--> March 21) in the <!--del_lnk--> southern hemisphere, ending with the December <!--del_lnk--> solstice (around <!--del_lnk--> December 21) in the Northern hemisphere and the June solstice (<!--del_lnk--> June 21) in the Southern hemisphere. Such conventions are by no means universal, however. An exception to these definitions is found in the <!--del_lnk--> Irish Calendar which still follows the Celtic cycle, where Autumn is counted as the whole months of <!--del_lnk--> August, <!--del_lnk--> September and <!--del_lnk--> October. In <!--del_lnk--> Chinese astronomy, the autumnal equinox marks the middle of autumn, which is deemed to have begun around the time of <!--del_lnk--> Liqiu (around <!--del_lnk--> August 7).<p>On the other hand, <a href="../../wp/m/Meteorology.htm" title="Meteorology">meteorologists</a> count the entire months of March, April and May in the Southern hemisphere, and September, October and November in the Northern hemisphere as autumn.<p>Albeit the days begin to shorten after the <!--del_lnk--> summer solstice, it is usually in September (Northern Hemisphere) or March (Southern Hemisphere) when twilight becomes noticeably shorter and the change more abrupt in comparison with the more lingering ones of summer.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Autumn is often defined as the start of the school year, since they usually begin in early September or early March. Either definition, as with those of the seasons generally, is somewhat flawed because it assumes that the seasons are all of the same length, and begin and end at the same time throughout the temperate zone of each hemisphere.<p><a id="Historic_usage_and_recognition" name="Historic_usage_and_recognition"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Historic usage and recognition</span></h2>
      <p>Many ancient civilizations computed the years by autumns, while the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxons did so by <a href="../../wp/w/Winter.htm" title="Winter">winters</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Tacitus tells us that the ancient Germans were acquainted with all the other seasons of the year, but had no notion of Autumn - though this is likely to be wrong, especially as a blanket statement (Tacitus wrote about Germanic tribes without firsthand knowledge). <!--del_lnk--> Linwood observed of the beginning of the several seasons of the year, that<dl>

      <p>Autumn&#39;s association with the transition from warm to cold weather, and its related status as the season of the primary <a href="../../wp/h/Harvest.htm" title="Harvest">harvest</a>, has dominated its themes and popular images. In Western cultures, personifications of Autumn are usually pretty, well-fed females adorned with fruits, vegetables and grains that ripen at this time. Most ancient cultures featured autumnal celebrations of the harvest, often the most important on their calendars. Still extant echoes of these celebrations are found in the late-Autumn <!--del_lnk--> Thanksgiving holiday of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, the <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> <!--del_lnk--> Sukkot holiday with its roots as a full moon harvest festival of &quot;tabernacles&quot; (huts wherein the harvest was processed and which later gained religious significance), the many North American Indian festivals tied to harvest of autumnally ripe foods gathered in the wild, the Chinese <!--del_lnk--> Mid-Autumn or Moon festival, and many others. The predominant mood of these autumnal celebrations is a gladness for the fruits of the earth mixed with a certain melancholy linked to the imminence of harsh weather. Remembrance of ancestors is also a common theme.<p>This view is presented in <!--del_lnk--> Keats&#39; poem &#39;<!--del_lnk--> To Autumn&#39; where he describes the season as a time of delightful growth, a seemingly endless time of &#39;fruitfulness&#39;.<p><a id="Associations_with_melancholy" name="Associations_with_melancholy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Associations with melancholy</span></h3>
      <p>Autumn in poetry has often been associated with melancholy. The possibilities of summer are gone, and the chill of winter is on the horizon. Thoughts and skies turn to grey. <!--del_lnk--> Rainer Maria Rilke, a famous german-language poet, has expressed such sentiments in one of his most famous poems, <i>Herbsttag</i> (<i>Autumn Day</i>), which reads in part:<dl>
       <dd><i>Wer jetzt kein Haus hat, baut sich keines mehr.</i><dd><i>Wer jetzt allein ist, wird es lange bleiben,</i><dd><i>wird wachen, lesen, lange Briefe schreiben</i><dd><i>und wird in den Alleen hin und her</i><dd><i>unruhig wandern, wenn die Bl&auml;tter treiben.</i></dl>
      <p>This translates roughly (there is no official translation) to:<dl>
       <dd><i>Who now has no house, will not build one (anymore).</i><dd><i>Who now is alone, will remain so for long,</i><dd><i>will wake, and read, and write long letters</i><dd><i>and back and forth on the boulevards</i><dd><i>will restlessly wander, while the leaves blow.</i></dl>
      <p>We might also think of <a href="../../wp/w/William_Butler_Yeats.htm" title="William Butler Yeats">Yeats</a>&#39; poem &#39;<!--del_lnk--> The Wild Swans at Coole&#39; where the maturing season that the poet observes symbolically represents the poet&#39;s ageing self. Like the natural world that he observes he too has reached his prime and now must look forward to the inevitability of old age and death. <!--del_lnk--> Paul Verlaine&#39;s &quot;<i>Chanson d&#39;automne</i>&quot; (&quot;Autumn Song&quot;) is likewise characterized by strong, painful feelings of sorrow.<p><a id="Other_associations" name="Other_associations"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other associations</span></h3>
      <p>Especially in the US, Autumn is also associated with the <a href="../../wp/h/Halloween.htm" title="Halloween">Halloween</a> season, and with it a widespread marketing campaign that promotes it. The television, film, book, costume, home decoration, and confectionery industries use this time of year to promote products closely associated with such holiday, with promotions going from early <!--del_lnk--> September to <!--del_lnk--> 31 October, since their themes rapidly lose strength once the holiday ends.<p>For the American film industry, the autumn season, which begins on the weekend following <!--del_lnk--> Labor Day and ends in early November, is the shortest and least profitable season of the movies. It follows the season of summer &quot;<!--del_lnk--> blockbusters&quot; and precedes the crowded end-of-year schedule of movies intended for award consideration.<p><a id="Autumn_and_tourism" name="Autumn_and_tourism"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Autumn and tourism</span></h2>

      <p>Although autumn coloration occurs wherever <!--del_lnk--> deciduous trees are found, colored autumn <!--del_lnk--> foliage is particularly noted in three regions of the world: most of <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a> and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>; a small area of central <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a>; and <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Asia, including <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, <a href="../../wp/k/Korea.htm" title="Korea">Korea</a>, and <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>.<p>Eastern Canada and the <!--del_lnk--> New England region of the United States are famous for the brilliance of their &quot;fall foliage,&quot; and a seasonal tourist industry has grown up around the few weeks in autumn when the leaves are at their peak. Some television and web-based weather forecasts even report on the status of the fall foliage throughout the season as a service to tourists. Fall foliage tourists are often referred to as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> leaf peepers&quot;.<p><a id="Autumn_versus_Fall" name="Autumn_versus_Fall"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Autumn versus Fall</span></h2>
      <p><b>Fall</b> is an alternative <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> word for the season of Autumn. In use now only in <!--del_lnk--> North American English, the word traces its origins to old <!--del_lnk--> Germanic languages. The exact derivation is unclear, the <a href="../../wp/o/Old_English_language.htm" title="Old English language">Old English</a> <i>fi&aelig;ll</i> or <i>feallan</i> and the <!--del_lnk--> Old Norse <i>fall</i> all being possible candidates. However, these words all have the meaning &quot;to fall from a height&quot; and are clearly derived either from a common root or from each other. The term only came to denote the season in the <a href="../../wp/1/16th_century.htm" title="16th century">16th century</a>, a contraction of <!--del_lnk--> Middle English expressions like &quot;fall of the leaf&quot; and &quot;fall of the year&quot;.<p><i>Autumn</i> comes from the <!--del_lnk--> Old French <i>automne</i>, and ultimately from the <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>autumnus</i>. There are rare examples of its use as early as the <a href="../../wp/1/14th_century.htm" title="14th century">14th century</a>, but it became common only in the 16th, around the same time as <i>Fall</i>, when the two words appear to have been used interchangebly.<p>During the 17th century immigration to the English colonies in <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a> was at its peak and the new settlers took their language with them. While the term <i>Fall</i> gradually obsolesced in Britain, it became the preferred term in North America, at least in conversation.<p>Before the 16th century <i><a href="../../wp/h/Harvest.htm" title="Harvest">Harvest</a></i> was the term usually used to refer to the season. However as more people gradually moved from working the land to living in towns (especially those who could read and write, the only people whose use of language we now know), the word became to refer to the actual activity of reaping, rather than the time of year, and <i>Fall</i> and <i>Autumn</i> began to replace it.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn&quot;</div>
