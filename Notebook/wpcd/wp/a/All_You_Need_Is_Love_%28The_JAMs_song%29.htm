      <p>&quot;<b>All You Need Is Love</b>&quot; is a song by <!--del_lnk--> The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, <!--del_lnk--> independently released as their debut single on <!--del_lnk--> 9 March <!--del_lnk--> 1987. A politically topical song concerning the UK media&#39;s <a href="../../wp/a/AIDS.htm" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> furore, the track was initially given a <!--del_lnk--> 12&quot; white label release because of its plagiaristic <!--del_lnk--> sampling of other records.<p>The artistic attitude of &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; epitomised that of The JAMs&#39; subsequent recordings: plagiarising popular music by taking extensive samples of other artists&#39; work, and juxtaposing these with each other, adding <!--del_lnk--> beatbox rhythms and <!--del_lnk--> Bill Drummond&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Scottish-accented raps, poems and narrations. The JAMs&#39; promotional tactics were similarly unconventional, including the use of promotional graffiti, a <!--del_lnk--> guerrilla communication method which would be employed regularly by Drummond and Cauty throughout their career.<p>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Bill Drummond and <!--del_lnk--> Jimmy Cauty started working together early in 1987. They assumed alter egos - Kingboy D and Rockman Rock respectively - and adopted the name &quot;The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu&quot; (The JAMs), after the fictional conspiratorial group &quot;The Justified Ancients of Mummu&quot; from <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Illuminatus%2521_Trilogy.htm" title="The Illuminatus! Trilogy">The Illuminatus! Trilogy</a></i>. &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; was their debut single.<p>Initially, the song was released as a limited edition one-sided <!--del_lnk--> white label <!--del_lnk--> promotional <!--del_lnk--> 12&quot;, on <!--del_lnk--> 9 March <!--del_lnk--> 1987, by The JAMs&#39; own label <!--del_lnk--> The Sound Of Mu(sic). This version included a 15-second sample of <a href="../../wp/t/The_Beatles.htm" title="The Beatles">The Beatles&#39;</a> &quot;<!--del_lnk--> All You Need Is Love&quot;, as well as samples of the <!--del_lnk--> MC5&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Kick Out the Jams&quot; and <!--del_lnk--> Samantha Fox&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Touch Me (I Want Your Body)&quot;. The song had been declined by distributors fearful of prosecution, but copies of the white label were sent to <!--del_lnk--> DJs and the <!--del_lnk--> music press. The identities of Drummond and Cauty were not made known to these recipients (<!--del_lnk--> Drummond was actually something of a music business veteran, and <!--del_lnk--> Cauty a former member of the much-hyped but unsuccessful band <!--del_lnk--> Brilliant). <i>Underground</i> Magazine speculated on this in March 1987: &quot;The whole affair is mysterious, a telephone number only and a threat that the group will soon be releasing more material... &#39;No, we&#39;ve not been in bands before, and yes, I suppose we were originally influenced by <!--del_lnk--> The Beastie Boys to actually get up and do something...&#39; Too true, but these colonials seem a touch wiser, world weary a bit, but not angry...&quot;. In the <!--del_lnk--> 28 March <!--del_lnk--> 1987 edition, <i><!--del_lnk--> NME</i> revealed King Boy D&#39;s identity as Bill Drummond.<p>The JAMs re-edited the single in such a way that&mdash;they hoped&mdash;&quot;brought [them] inside the &quot;law&quot; but still got up peoples noses&quot;, removing all but a snatch of The Beatles, replacing or doctoring the MC5 sample, and rerecording the Samantha Fox vocal. This new version&mdash;named &quot;All You Need Is Love (106bpm)&quot;&mdash;was released on <!--del_lnk--> 18 May <!--del_lnk--> 1987 as JAMS 23T, and was included on The JAMs debut album <i><!--del_lnk--> 1987 </i>. Indeed, according to Drummond, the recording of <i>1987</i> was funded by the sales of &quot;All You Need Is Love (106bpm)&quot;.<p><a id="Composition" name="Composition"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Composition</span></h2>
      <p>The central theme of &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; was the media coverage given to the <a href="../../wp/a/AIDS.htm" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> crisis. The original version opens with a 15-second sample of The Beatles&#39; &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;, followed by <!--del_lnk--> Rob Tyner&#39;s cry of &quot;Kick out the Jams, motherfuckers!&quot; from the MC5&#39;s album <i><!--del_lnk--> Kick Out the Jams</i>. A simple beatbox rhythm begins, along with samples of <!--del_lnk--> John Hurt from a British <!--del_lnk--> public information film&mdash;entitled <i>Don&#39;t Die of Ignorance</i>&mdash;about the dangers of AIDS. The samples misquote the film: &quot;sexual intercourse&mdash;no known cure&quot;. Bill Drummond performs a heavily-accented <!--del_lnk--> Clydeside <a href="../../wp/r/Rapping.htm" title="Rapping">rap</a>, beginning &quot;We&#39;re back again, they never kicked us out, twenty thousand years of &#39;shout shout shout&#39;&quot;, a reference to the fictional JAMs of <i>The Illuminatus! Trilogy</i>. Later, he raps: &quot;With this killer virus who needs war? Immanentize the eschaton, I said shag shag shag some more!&quot;. &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Immanentize the eschaton&quot; is a reference to the opening line of <i>Illuminatus!</i>, referring to the end of the material world, and &quot;shag&quot; is a <!--del_lnk--> British slang word meaning <!--del_lnk--> sexual intercourse.<p>Between verses, the rhythm is punctuated by samples of former <!--del_lnk--> glamour model Samantha Fox (&quot;Touch me, touch me, I want to feel your body&quot;), as well as a sample &quot;Ancients of Mu Mu&quot; (by The JAMs&#39; associate rapper Chike) which recurred throughout the next ten years&#39; work of Drummond and Cauty. Also heard is a rendition by children of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Ring a Ring O&#39;Roses&quot;, rhythmic panting, and an original female vocal line concerning infant mortality. <i><!--del_lnk--> Sounds</i> magazine stated that the deliberate placement of Fox&#39;s sexually provocative &quot;Touch Me&quot; alongside &quot;Ring a Ring O&#39;Roses&quot; (&quot;the nursery rhyme about the <!--del_lnk--> Plague&quot;) &quot;highlights explicitly the depth of contradiction embedded in society&#39;s attitude towards death through sex&quot;. More succinctly, <i>NME</i> said: &quot;&#39;All You Need...&#39; is by <i>everyone</i>&quot; (so many samples) &quot;and about <i>everything</i>&quot; (and a variety of thematic nuances).<p>Drummond has said he was inspired by the <a href="../../wp/h/Hip_hop_music.htm" title="Hip hop music">hip-hop</a> and scratch he was hearing regularly on <!--del_lnk--> John Peel&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> BBC Radio 1 show, but looking back in 1991 he said &quot;If you listen to it now, it sounds nothing like a hip hop record, you know, it sounds a lot more like British <!--del_lnk--> punk... [a] punk version of a hip hop record, I suppose.&quot;<p><a id="Reviews" name="Reviews"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Reviews</span></h2>
      <p>The original white label release of &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; was made &quot;single of the week&quot; in <i>Sounds</i> magazine, who announced that The JAMs had &quot;produced the first single to capture realistically the musical and social climate of 1987&quot;. Calling the result &quot;a seething terror ridden pulp&quot;, <i>Sounds</i> elaborated: &quot;How have [The JAMs] produced a record more powerful than <!--del_lnk--> Lydon/Bambaataa&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> World Destruction&quot; without laying a finger on a synthesiser or guitar? THEFT! By stealing all the various beats, noises and sounds they&#39;ve wanted, and building it into their own stunning audio collage, [The JAMs] are making a direct assault on the way records are put together.&quot;<p><i>Underground</i> magazine were also enthusiastic: &quot;This month I&#39;m pleased to say, what&#39;s really moving is entirely British. The best groove so far this year is from <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> and it shows <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> and <!--del_lnk--> New York exactly how it <i>should</i> be done, a one-sided, one-track 12 inch (it doesn&#39;t need any dub or instrumentals). &#39;All You Need Is Love&#39; by The Jamms is more than rife with a bit of The Beatles (with a dash of MC5 and Samantha Fox). It seems to be anti-AIDS, but as I know nothing about the band it could easily be a <!--del_lnk--> piss take. Either way this is a superb jam, if you can find it, buy it (it&#39;s so dodgily constructed in legal terms that no distributor info is given).&quot;<p>In a July 1987 review of <i>1987 </i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Q</i> Magazine recalled that the original release of &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; &quot;seemed an inspired moment of pure wildness. Here were <!--del_lnk--> Red <!--del_lnk--> Clydeside beatbox rappers pointing a finger at society, putting their record together from samples pirated directly from other people&#39;s recordings, while at the same time crossing almost all contemporary music tribal boundaries by including everyone from Samantha Fox to The MC5 among their victims.&quot; This was contrasted with <i>1987</i> which the reviewer felt was a &quot;disappointment&quot; with &quot;too few ideas being spread too thin&quot;.<p>The re-release of &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; rewarded The JAMs with further praise, including <i>NME</i> &quot;single of the week&quot;, in which <!--del_lnk--> Danny Kelly thought that &quot;its maverick requisition of the hip-hop <!--del_lnk--> idiom, its fanatical confrontation of copyright laws overrun by music&#39;s new technologies, its central subject matters and its termination with the year&#39;s most incisively searching question&mdash;&#39;1987: what the f**k&#39;s going on?&#39;&mdash;combine to make &#39;All You Need Is Love&#39; a triumph of nowness over mere newness&quot; [censorship preserved]. Reviewing <i>1987</i> later in the year, the same writer described &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; as &quot;mighty&quot; but he was unable to hide his disappointment in the album as a whole: &quot;is it the runaway juggernaut hyperbrill monster crack that the outriding 45 threatened? No.&quot;<p>A retrospective piece in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Guardian</i> called &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; a &quot;jagged slice of agit-prop&quot; and &quot;shockingly effective&quot;, adding that &quot;[the original] was a club hit (i.e. everybody danced to it though nobody bought it), and after being re-edited to avoid copyright restrictions, it reached number three in the Indie chart&quot;.<p><a id="Promotion_and_themes" name="Promotion_and_themes"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Promotion and themes</span></h2>
      <p>The artistic attitude of &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; epitomised that of The JAMs&#39; subsequent recordings: plagiarising popular music by taking extensive samples of other artists&#39; work, and juxtaposing these with each other, adding <!--del_lnk--> beatbox rhythms and Drummond&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Scottish-accented raps, poems and narrations. The albums <i>1987</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Who Killed The JAMs?</i>, and the singles &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;, &quot;<a href="../../wp/w/Whitney_Joins_The_JAMs.htm" title="Whitney Joins The JAMs">Whitney Joins The JAMs</a>&quot; and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Down Town&quot; all had small-scale production budgets and little mainstream popularity, yet their novel construction and The JAMs&#39; provocative disregard for copyright gained the duo enduring media attention.<p>The JAMs&#39; promotional tactics were similarly unconventional, including the use of promotional graffiti, a <!--del_lnk--> guerrilla communication method employed repeatedly by Drummond and Cauty, beginning around the time of their first releases. Some copies of the re-released single were supplied in a picture sleeve which showed The JAMs&#39; &quot;Shag Shag Shag&quot; <!--del_lnk--> graffiti defacing a <!--del_lnk--> billboard (advertising the <i><!--del_lnk--> Today</i> newspaper) that depicted police chief <!--del_lnk--> James Anderton. Anderton, a self-declared <!--del_lnk--> Christian, had courted controversy when he said &quot;I see increasing evidence of people swirling about in a human cesspit of their own making&hellip; We must ask why <!--del_lnk--> homosexuals freely engage in <!--del_lnk--> sodomy and other obnoxious practices, knowing the dangers involved&quot;. As with much of The JAMs&#39; graffiti, the potency of &quot;Shag Shag Shag&quot; was derived from the context it in which it was placed. Further graffiti followed, &quot;JAMs&quot; and &quot;Shag Shag Shag&quot; slogans defacing billboards and Government-funded AIDS warnings in London. The JAMs also made available &quot;Shag Shag Shag&quot; T-shirts which King Boy D told the <i><!--del_lnk--> NME</i> were &quot;selling like hot cakes&quot;. The JAMs later revisited the word &quot;shag&quot; when they named their early career retrospective compilation album <i><!--del_lnk--> Shag Times</i>.<p><!--del_lnk--> Drummond and Cauty&#39;s output as The JAMs and later <!--del_lnk--> The KLF extensively referenced <i>The Illuminatus! Trilogy</i>, and their debut recordings were no exception. The lyrical references in &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; are complemented by the first of many iconographic and numerical allusions that soon came to characterise the duo&#39;s work. Their &quot;pyramid blaster&quot; logo&mdash;a <a href="../../wp/p/Pyramid.htm" title="Pyramid">pyramid</a> with a <!--del_lnk--> ghetto blaster suspended in front&mdash;appeared for the first time on the re-released &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;. The &quot;pyramid blaster&quot; references the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> All Seeing I&quot; icon&mdash;an eye suspended before a pyramid&mdash;associated with <i>The Illuminatus! Trilogy</i>. The catalogue numbers of the single (JAMS 23, JAMS 23S, JAMS 23T) also reference <i>Illuminatus!</i>, in which the <!--del_lnk--> number 23 is a recurring element. The JAMs actively enshrouded themselves with the mythology of the conspiritorial <i>Illuminatus!</i>, and by adopting the subversive attitude of the fictional JAMs they quickly developed their own mythology.<p><a id="Formats_and_track_listings" name="Formats_and_track_listings"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Formats and track listings</span></h2>
      <p>&quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; was originally released in the UK as a limited edition one-side promotional <!--del_lnk--> 12&quot; on <!--del_lnk--> 9 March 1987. The UK re-release of <!--del_lnk--> 18 May 1987 consisted of a 7&quot; and a 12&quot; that were also limited editions, along with a widely-available 12&quot;. The re-release included the tracks &quot;Ivum Naya (Ibo Version)&quot; (a version of &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; with Chike on lead vocals), and &quot;Rap, Rhyme and Scratch Yourself&quot; (an instrumental version of the song, &quot;a stripped down beatbox track for anybody to feel free to do what they want with&quot; according to King Boy D). The 7&quot; A-side was &quot;All You Need Is Love (Me Ru Con Mix)&quot;, a traditional <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnamese</a> song &quot;Me Ru Con&quot; sung by Duy Khiem, in which The JAMs &quot;[took] remixing as far as we could&quot;. &quot;Me Ru Con&quot; featured on The JAMs&#39; <i>1987 </i>.
