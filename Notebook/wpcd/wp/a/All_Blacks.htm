      <p>The <b>All Blacks</b> are <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>&#39;s national <!--del_lnk--> rugby union team. Rugby union is New Zealand&#39;s national sport, with the All Blacks a formidable power in international rugby, possessing a winning record against all nations.<p>The All Blacks compete annually with <!--del_lnk--> Australia and <!--del_lnk--> South Africa in the <!--del_lnk--> Tri-Nations Series, in which they also contest the <!--del_lnk--> Bledisloe Cup with Australia. They have been Tri-Nations champions seven times in the tournament&#39;s eleven-year history, have twice completed a <!--del_lnk--> Grand Slam (in 1978 and in 2005), and currently hold the <!--del_lnk--> Bledisloe Cup. They are the <!--del_lnk--> top ranked team in the world, and the 2006 <!--del_lnk--> International Rugby Board (IRB) Team of the Year. Twelve former All Blacks have been inducted into the <!--del_lnk--> International Rugby Hall of Fame.<p>The team first competed internationally in 1893 against <!--del_lnk--> New South Wales, and played their first <!--del_lnk--> Test match in 1903, a victory against <!--del_lnk--> Australia. This was soon followed by a tour of the northern hemisphere in 1905, during which the team&#39;s only defeat was against <!--del_lnk--> Wales in <a href="../../wp/c/Cardiff.htm" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>.<p>The All Blacks completed their first series win over arch-rivals South Africa (&quot;The Springboks&quot;) in New Zealand in 1956. A decade later, they achieved their longest winning streak by winning seventeen Tests between 1965 and 1970. The <!--del_lnk--> British and Irish Lions achieved their only series victory over the All Blacks in 1971, but seven years later the All Blacks completed their first Grand Slam (wins over <!--del_lnk--> England, <!--del_lnk--> Ireland, <!--del_lnk--> Scotland, and Wales on the same tour).<p>The <!--del_lnk--> 1981 Springbok tour to New Zealand caused large scale civil unrest due to protests over South Africa&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> apartheid policy. In 1987 New Zealand hosted and won the inaugural <a href="../../wp/r/Rugby_World_Cup.htm" title="Rugby World Cup">Rugby World Cup</a>. New Zealand toured post-apartheid South Africa in 1996, and achieved their first series win on South African soil.<p>Early New Zealand national rugby uniforms consisted of a black jersey with a silver fern and white knickerbockers. By their 1905 tour the All Blacks were wearing all black, except for the silver fern, and their All Black name dates from this time. The All Blacks traditionally perform a <!--del_lnk--> haka (<!--del_lnk--> M&#x101;ori war dance) before each match. Traditionally, the haka performed is <!--del_lnk--> Te Rauparaha&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Ka Mate, though since 2005, a new haka, <!--del_lnk--> Kapa o Pango, has occasionally been performed.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p>Rugby was introduced to New Zealand by Charles Monro in the late 1860s; Monro discovered the sport while completing his studies at <!--del_lnk--> Christ&#39;s College Finchley, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>. The first game in New Zealand took place in May 1870 and the first union, <!--del_lnk--> Canterbury, was formed in 1879. In 1882, New Zealand&#39;s first internationals were played when the Southern Rugby Union (later the <!--del_lnk--> New South Wales Rugby Union) toured the country. The tourists played Auckland provincial clubs twice, Wellington twice and once each against Canterbury, Otago and West Coast, North Island, winning four games and losing three. Two years later the first New Zealand team to go overseas toured New South Wales; New Zealand played and won eight games.<p>The first tour by a British team took place in 1888 when a <!--del_lnk--> British Isles team toured Australia and New Zealand, although no Test matches were played. The players were drawn mainly from England and the Scottish borders, although there were representatives from all four home unions.<p><a id="International_competition_begins" name="International_competition_begins"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">International competition begins</span></h3>

      <p>The year 1892 saw the formation of the <!--del_lnk--> New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU) representing seven unions not including Canterbury, <!--del_lnk--> Otago and <!--del_lnk--> Southland. The first sanctioned New Zealand side toured New South Wales in 1894 and the following year New Zealand played its first home &quot;international&quot; game, losing 8-6 to New South Wales. The team&#39;s first true international match was against Australia on <!--del_lnk--> 15 August, 1903 at the <!--del_lnk--> Sydney Cricket Ground, resulting in a 22-3 win.<p>A representative New Zealand team first toured Britain in 1905 (since referred to as <!--del_lnk--> the Originals). Reference to the team by the name &quot;All Blacks&quot; first appeared during this tour when, according to team member <!--del_lnk--> Billy Wallace, a London newspaper reported that the New Zealanders played as if they were &quot;all <i>backs</i>&quot;. Wallace claimed that due to a typographical error, subsequent references were to &quot;All Blacks&quot;. This is likely myth however, as the name also describes their playing uniform of black shirts, shorts and socks.<p>The Originals&#39; only loss on tour was 3-0 to Wales at <a href="../../wp/c/Cardiff.htm" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>. The match has entered into the folklore of both countries because of controversy over whether All Black Bob Deans scored a disallowed try (which would have earned the team a 3-3 draw). A team representing the British Isles &mdash; known as the Anglo-Welsh since they consisted only of English and Welsh players &mdash; undertook a return tour to New Zealand in 1908 and were defeated in the test series 2-0 by the All Blacks.<p><a id="Development_of_a_legacy" name="Development_of_a_legacy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Development of a legacy</span></h3>
      <p>New Zealand&#39;s rivalry with <!--del_lnk--> South Africa began in 1921, when the Springboks (as the South African team is known) toured New Zealand for a Test series that finished <!--del_lnk--> all square. The All Blacks went on to later tour South Africa for the first time in 1928; this series also ended in a draw.<p>The 1924 All Black tourists to the United Kingdom (UK) were eventually dubbed <i><!--del_lnk--> the Invincibles</i> because they had won every game. However, the team were deprived of the chance to complete a grand slam when Scotland refused to play them because of an argument over expenses. The first truly representative British Isles (now known as British and Irish Lions) side toured New Zealand in 1930. Although the Lions won the first Test, the home side regrouped and went on to win the series 3-1. New Zealand toured the UK again in 1935-36, losing only three games (including two Tests) during a 30-match tour. In one of these losses, <!--del_lnk--> Prince Obolensky famously scored two tries to help England to a 13-0 win, their first over the All Blacks.<p>In 1937, South Africa won a series against the All Blacks when they toured New Zealand, and this <!--del_lnk--> 1937 South African team has subsequently been described as the best team ever to leave New Zealand. It wasn&#39;t until after the end of the Second World War when the All Blacks next played the Springboks when they visited South Africa in 1949. The tour witnessed an infamous All Blacks record &mdash; the loss of two Test matches on the same day. This was made possible because Australia were touring New Zealand at the same time. On the afternoon of <!--del_lnk--> September 3 (New Zealand time), the All Black team captained by J. B. (Johnny) Smith was beaten 11-6 by Australia in Wellington. That same afternoon in South Africa (South Africa time), the All Blacks captained by Ron Elvidge (Allen was injured) lost 9-3 to the Springboks in <!--del_lnk--> Durban. The All Blacks in New Zealand also lost their second Test, 16-9, which gave Australia the Bledisloe Cup for the first time. <!--del_lnk--> Fred Allen was selected as captain for the 1949 tour to South Africa. Although each Test was very close, the All Blacks lost the series 4-0.<p>The two series losses to South Africa made their 1956 tour of New Zealand highly anticipated. The All Blacks were captained by Bob Duff and coached by <!--del_lnk--> Bob Stuart, and their 3-1 series win was their first ever over the Springboks as well as being the the Springboks&#39; first ever series loss against any opponent. During the series, the All Blacks had introduced <!--del_lnk--> Don Clarke and Kevin Skinner in the last two Tests to help secure the win. Skinner was introduced to &quot;sort out&quot; the South African <!--del_lnk--> props whilst Don Clark would subsequently become known as &quot;The Boot&quot; for his goal kicking.<p>The All Blacks&#39; 3-1 series win over the Lions in 1959 proved to be the start of a dominant period in All Blacks rugby. This was followed by 1963-64 tour to the UK, led by Wilson Whineray, which came very close to achieving a Grand Slam but were deprived by a scoreless draw with Scotland. Later, the 1967 side won three Tests, but was unable to play Ireland because of a <!--del_lnk--> foot-and-mouth scare. This tour formed part of The All Blacks longest ever winning streak between 1965 and 1970, during which they recorded 17 Test victories. Although the 1966 Lions were defeated 0-4 in their New Zealand tour, there was a reversal of fortune five years later when the <!--del_lnk--> 1971 Lions, under the captaincy of Welshman <!--del_lnk--> John Dawes, beat the All Blacks in a Test series which remains the Lions&#39; only series victory in New Zealand to date.<p>The 1972-3 tourists narrowly missed a Grand Slam with a draw against Ireland. The tour was also notable for the sending home of prop Keith Murdoch, who was alleged to have been involved in a brawl in a <a href="../../wp/c/Cardiff.htm" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> hotel while celebrating the defeat of Wales.<p>In 1978, <!--del_lnk--> Graham Mourie captained the All Blacks to their first Grand Slam which was completed with a 13-12 victory over Wales. That game generated great controversy after the All Blacks won as the result of a late penalty. Lock <!--del_lnk--> Andy Haden had dived out of a <!--del_lnk--> line-out in an attempt to earn a penalty; however the penalty awarded by referee Roger Quittenton was actually against Welsh lock Geoff Wheel for jumping off the shoulder of <!--del_lnk--> Frank Oliver. The All Blacks&#39; only loss on the tour was the famous 12-0 defeat by Irish province <!--del_lnk--> Munster at <!--del_lnk--> Thomond Park. made famous by the <!--del_lnk--> John Breen play <!--del_lnk--> Alone it Stands.<p><a id="Controversial_tours" name="Controversial_tours"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Controversial tours</span></h3>
      <p>The 1976 All Blacks tour of South Africa generated much controversy and led to the boycott of the <!--del_lnk--> 1976 Summer Olympics in <a href="../../wp/m/Montreal.htm" title="Montreal">Montreal</a> by thirty-three African nations. The All Blacks again failed to win the Test series in South Africa (they would not do so until 1996, after the fall of apartheid). The 1976 Tour contributed to the <!--del_lnk--> Gleneagles Agreement being adopted by the Commonwealth Heads of State in 1977.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> 1981 South African tour to New Zealand is now referred to as &quot;The Tour&quot; in New Zealand and sparked protests against South Africa&#39;s <a href="../../wp/h/History_of_South_Africa_in_the_apartheid_era.htm" title="History of South Africa in the apartheid era">apartheid</a> policy the likes of which had not been seen in New Zealand since the <!--del_lnk--> 1951 waterfront dispute. The NZRU had invited the Springboks to tour as the <!--del_lnk--> Muldoon government refused to involve politics in sport. Although the All Blacks won the Test series, two of the tour&#39;s provincial games were cancelled and the whole tour was marred by violence and protest. During the tour the country experienced unrest, and the tour had a significant impact on New Zealand society.<p>The 1985 All Blacks tour to South Africa was cancelled after legal action argued it would breach the NZRU&#39;s constitution. In 1986, a rebel tour to South Africa took place which had not been authorised by the NZRU and the team, named the <!--del_lnk--> Cavaliers, featured many All Blacks of the time. Those that participated in the tour received a ban from the NZRU when they returned to New Zealand.<p><a id="Early_World_Cups" name="Early_World_Cups"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early World Cups</span></h3>

      <p>The inaugural <!--del_lnk--> World Cup in 1987 was co-hosted and won by New Zealand, who beat <!--del_lnk--> France 29-9 in the final at <!--del_lnk--> Eden Park, <a href="../../wp/a/Auckland.htm" title="Auckland">Auckland</a>. New Zealand conceded only 52 points and scored 43 tries in six games en route to the title, having swept aside the challenges of <!--del_lnk--> Italy, <!--del_lnk--> Fiji, <!--del_lnk--> Argentina, Scotland, Wales and France.<p>By the <!--del_lnk--> 1991 World Cup, the All Blacks were an ageing side, co-coached by <!--del_lnk--> Alex Wyllie and <!--del_lnk--> John Hart. They struggled during pool matches against the <!--del_lnk--> United States and Italy, but won their quarter-final against <!--del_lnk--> Canada. They were then knocked out by eventual winners Australia 16-6 in their semi-final at <!--del_lnk--> Lansdowne Road. In the wake of the tournament, there were many retirements, including coach Wyllie, who had enjoyed an 86% win rate during 29 Tests in charge.<p><!--del_lnk--> Laurie Mains replaced Wyllie in 1992, and was given the job of preparing the side for the <!--del_lnk--> 1995 event in South Africa. The All Blacks were again favourites to take the championship. Their favouritism was confirmed when a young <a href="../../wp/j/Jonah_Lomu.htm" title="Jonah Lomu">Jonah Lomu</a> scored four tries against England in the All Blacks&#39; 45-29 semi-final win. However, the New Zealand team suffered an outbreak of food poisoning before the final. Despite this, they took hosts South Africa to extra time, before losing to <!--del_lnk--> Joel Stransky&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> drop goal.<p><a id="Professional_era" name="Professional_era"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Professional era</span></h3>
      <p>The year 1995 saw the beginning of the professional era in rugby union and this was marked by the formation of the <!--del_lnk--> SANZAR group (a combination of South Africa, New Zealand and Australia) which was formed with the purpose of selling TV rights for two new competitions; the domestic <a href="../../wp/s/Super_14.htm" title="Super 14">Super 12</a> competition and the Tri-Nations. The first Tri-Nations was contested in 1996, with the All Blacks winning all four of their Tests to take the trophy.<p>The 1996 Tri-Nations match in South Africa between the All Blacks and Springboks was also the first in a historic series. Under new coach <!--del_lnk--> John Hart and the captaincy of <!--del_lnk--> Sean Fitzpatrick, the All Blacks won a Test series in South Africa for the first time. Fitzpatrick even rated the series win higher than the 1987 World Cup victory in which he had participated.<p>The next two seasons saw mixed results for the All Blacks, who won the 1997 Tri-Nations before losing it for the first time in 1998. The All Blacks won all their Tri-Nations Tests in 1997. However, in 1998, the All Blacks lost all four of their Tests, the first time they had lost four in succession since 1949. The following year, they suffered their worst ever Test loss, a 28-7 loss to Australia in Sydney.<p>The All Blacks rebounded in the <!--del_lnk--> 1999 World Cup and dominated their pool, handing England a 30-16 defeat at <!--del_lnk--> Twickenham. They advanced past Scotland 30-18 in the quarter-finals to play France at Twickenham. The All Blacks finished the first half ahead 17-10. France then produced a famous half of rugby to which the All Blacks had no answer, eventually winning 43-31. Hart subsequently resigned as coach and was replaced by co-coaches <!--del_lnk--> Wayne Smith and Tony Gilbert.<p>Under Smith and Gilbert, the All Blacks came second in the 2000 and 2001 Tri-Nations. Both coaches were replaced by <!--del_lnk--> John Mitchell on 3rd October 2001 who went on to coach the All Blacks to victory in both the 2002 and 2003 Tri-Nations, as well as regaining the Bledisloe Cup (which had been held by Australia since 1998) in 2003. After winning the 2003 Tri-Nations, they entered the <!--del_lnk--> 2003 World Cup as one of the favourites and dominated their pool, running up wins against Italy, Canada and <!--del_lnk--> Tonga before winning one of the most competitive matches of the tournament against Wales. They defeated South Africa, a team they had never beaten at the World Cup, 29-9, but lost again to Australia 22-10 in the semi-final in Sydney. Afterwards, Mitchell was fired by the NZRU and replaced by <!--del_lnk--> Graham Henry.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Henry&#39;s tenure began with a double victory over reigning World Champions England in 2004. The two games had an aggregate score of 72-15, with the All Blacks keeping England try-less. Despite the winning start to Henry&#39;s tenure, the Tri-Nations was a mixed success with two wins and two losses. The competition was the closest ever, bonus points decided the outcome and the All Blacks finished last. The 2004 season finished on a high however, with the All Blacks winning in Europe, including a record 45-6 victory over France.<p>In 2005, the All Blacks whitewashed the touring British and Irish Lions 3-0 in the Test series, won the Tri-Nations, and achieved a second Grand Slam over the Home Nations. They went on to sweep the major International Rugby Board year-end awards in which the All Blacks were named Team of the Year, Henry was named Coach of the Year, and fly-half (first five) <!--del_lnk--> Daniel Carter was Player of the Year. The All Blacks were nominated for the <!--del_lnk--> Laureus World Sports Award for Team of the Year in 2006 for their 2005 performance.<p>In 2006, they again took the Tri Nations Series by winning their first five matches, (three against Australia and two against South Africa). However, they lost their final match of the series against South Africa. They completed their end of year tour unbeaten, with record away wins over France and England. The All Blacks were named 2006 IRB Team of the Year and were nominated for the Laureus World Sports Award for the second time, while flanker <!--del_lnk--> Richie McCaw was named IRB Player of the Year.<p><a id="Jersey" name="Jersey"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Jersey</span></h2>

      <p>The current All Black jersey is entirely black, with the <!--del_lnk--> Adidas logo and the NZRU silver fern on the front. The 1884 New Zealand tour to Australia was the first overseas New Zealand rugby tour, and featured clothing far different from today&#39;s jersey. Back then, the team donned a dark blue jersey, with gold fern on the left of the jumper. In 1893 the NZRU stipulated at its annual general meeting that the uniform would be black jersey with a silver fern and white knickerbockers. However historic photographs suggest white shorts may have been used instead during these early years. Sometime between 1897 and 1901 there was a change; by 1901 the team met NSW in a black jersey, a canvas top with no collar, and a silver fern.<p>The All Blacks jersey is today considered the most recognisable rugby jersey. Recently it has become traditional for the All Blacks to wear an embroidered poppy on their jersey sleeve when playing France during the end of year tours. The poppy honours the soldiers who died in the battlefields of Europe. Captain Richie McCaw said &quot;We want to honour the overseas service of New Zealanders. It is an important part of our history as a country and a team.&quot;.<p>Adidas currently pays the NZRFU $200 Million over 9 years, expecting the All Blacks to win around 75% of their matches. <!--del_lnk--> Nike also looked at sponsoring the All Blacks in 1996, but went with the then teenage <a href="../../wp/t/Tiger_Woods.htm" title="Tiger Woods">Tiger Woods</a> instead.<p><a id="Haka" name="Haka"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Haka</span></h2>

      <p>The All Blacks perform a <!--del_lnk--> haka (<!--del_lnk--> M&#x101;ori dance) before each international match. The haka has been closely associated with New Zealand ever since the <i>New Zealand Natives</i> tour of 1888. Until 2005, the haka performed by the All Blacks had usually been &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Ka Mat&egrave;&quot; which was written in the 19th century by <!--del_lnk--> Ng&#x101;ti Toa leader <!--del_lnk--> Te Rauparaha. In the August 2005 Tri-Nations Test match between New Zealand and South Africa at <!--del_lnk--> Carisbrook stadium in <!--del_lnk--> Dunedin, New Zealand, the All Blacks first performed the haka &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Kapa o Pango&quot; which was designed to reflect the multi-cultural make-up of contemporary New Zealand &mdash; in particular the influence of <!--del_lnk--> Polynesian cultures. This new haka is to be performed on &quot;special occasions&quot; and is not intended to replace &quot;Ka Mat&egrave;&quot;.<p>The &quot;Kapa o Pango&quot; concludes with a &quot;throat slitting&quot; action that has been a source of <!--del_lnk--> controversy and has led to accusations that &quot;Kapa o Pango&quot; encourages violence, and sends the wrong message to All Blacks fans. However, according to Kapo o Pango composer Derek Lardelli, the gesture represents &quot;drawing vital energy into the heart and lungs.&quot;<p>In November 2006, at the <!--del_lnk--> Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, the All Blacks performed the haka in the dressing rooms prior to the match instead of immediately before kickoff because the <!--del_lnk--> Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) wanted Wales to sing their National Anthem after the All Blacks had performed the haka. The All Blacks disagreed with this request and hence performed the haka in their dressing room instead.<p><a id="Record" name="Record"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Record</span></h2>

      <p>The All Blacks have won the World Cup once in the 1987 inaugural competition held in New Zealand and Australia. In 1991, they lost their semi-final to Australia before winning the playoff for third. In 1995, they improved by reaching the final, before losing in extra time to hosts South Africa, however controversy surrounds the final with many suspecting the All Blacks were poisoned<!--del_lnk--> . Their worst World Cup was their fourth place in 1999, after losing their semi-final and then the third-place playoff game. In 2003 the All Blacks were knocked out by hosts Australia in their semi-final, before finishing third. Despite only one World Cup title they are the only team to have reached the semifinals in every tournament.<p>The All Blacks hold several World Cup records: most points in one match (145 versus <!--del_lnk--> Japan in 1995), most cumulative points over all World Cups (1384), most tries overall (184), and most conversions (137). Several individual players also hold World Cup records; Jonah Lomu for most World Cup tries (15 over two World Cups), most appearances held by Sean Fitzpatrick (17 from 1987 to 1995), <!--del_lnk--> Marc Ellis with most tries in a match (6 versus Japan in 1995), and <!--del_lnk--> Grant Fox with most points in one tournament (126 in 1987).<p><a id="Overall" name="Overall"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Overall</span></h3>
      <p>The All Blacks have a positive win record against every nation they have played. They have won 308 of the 417 matches played, a win percentage of 73.86% (see table). By this measure, the All Blacks are the most successful international rugby union team in history. When <!--del_lnk--> World Rankings were introduced by the IRB in October 2003, the All Blacks were ranked second. In November 2003 they briefly occupied first and then third before moving back into second by December that year. Since June 2004 the All Blacks have been ranked number one in the world.<p>Their Test match record against all nations (listed in order of total matches), updated to <!--del_lnk--> 26 November <!--del_lnk--> 2006, is as follows:<table class="wikitable sortable">

      <p>Twelve former All Blacks have been inducted into the <!--del_lnk--> International Rugby Hall of Fame; <!--del_lnk--> Fred Allen, <!--del_lnk--> Don Clarke, <!--del_lnk--> Sean Fitzpatrick, <!--del_lnk--> Grant Fox, <!--del_lnk--> Dave Gallaher, <!--del_lnk--> Michael Jones, <!--del_lnk--> Ian Kirkpatrick, <!--del_lnk--> John Kirwan, <!--del_lnk--> Sir Brian Lochore, <!--del_lnk--> Colin Meads, <!--del_lnk--> George Nepia and <!--del_lnk--> Wilson Whineray.<p>Dave Gallaher played in the All Blacks&#39; first ever Test match in 1903 and also captained the 1905 Originals. Along with <!--del_lnk--> Billy Stead, Gallaher authored the famous rugby book <i>The Complete Rugby Footballer</i>. At the age of only 19, George Nepia played in all 30 matches on the Invincibles tour of 1924-25. Nepia played 37 All Blacks games; his last was against the British Isles in 1930.<p>Fred Allen captained all of his 21 matches for the All Blacks, including six Tests, between 1946 and 1949. He eventually moved onto coaching the All Blacks between 1966 and 1968. The All Blacks won all 14 of their Test matches with Allen as coach.<p>Five Hall of Fame inductees played during the 1960s. Don Clarke was an All Black between 1956 and 1964 and during this period he broke the record at the time for All Black Test points. Clarke famously scored six penalties in one match &mdash; a record at the time &mdash; to give the All Blacks an 18-17 victory over the British Isles. Sir Wilson Whineray played 32 Tests, captaining the All Blacks in 30 of them. He played prop and also <!--del_lnk--> number 8 between 1957 and 1965. The All Blacks lost only four of their 30 Tests with Whineray as captain. In Colin Meads&#39; New Zealand Rugby Museum profile, he is described as &quot;New Zealand&#39;s equivalent of Australia&#39;s Sir <a href="../../wp/d/Donald_Bradman.htm" title="Donald Bradman">Donald Bradman</a> or the United States of America&#39;s <a href="../../wp/b/Babe_Ruth.htm" title="Babe Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>.&quot; Meads, nicknamed <i>Pinetree</i>, played 133 games for the All Blacks, including 55 Tests. In 1999 the New Zealand Rugby Monthly magazine named Meads the New Zealand player of the century. Ian Kirkpatrick played 39 Tests, including 9 as captain, between 1967 and 1977. He scored 16 tries in his Test career, a record at the time.<p>The 1987 World Cup champions were coached by Sir Brian Lochore who had represented the All Blacks in 25 Tests between 1964 and 1971, including 17 as captain. Lochore was <!--del_lnk--> knighted in 1999 for his lifetime services to rugby. Four of the 1987 World Cup squad that he had coached are also inductees in the Hall of Fame. John Kirwan played a total of 63 Tests between 1984 and 1994, scoring 35 tries, an All Blacks record at the time. In the 1987 World Cup opener against Italy, Kirwan raced 90 meters to score one of the tries of the tournament. An All Black from 1984 to 1993, Grant Fox was one of the All Blacks&#39; greatest point-scorers with 1067 points, including 645 Test points. Fox played 46 Tests, including the 1987 World Cup final against France. Known as The Iceman, Michael Jones was one the greatest open side flankers of all time. Born in Auckland, New Zealand, Jones first played international rugby for <!--del_lnk--> Samoa, then for the All Blacks, playing 55 Tests between 1987 and 1998. Due to his Christian faith Jones never played rugby on Sundays, resulting in him not playing in the 1991 World Cup semi-final against Australia, and also in him not being picked for the 1995 World Cup squad.<p>The most capped Test All Black is Sean Fitzpatrick with 92 appearances. Fitzpatrick played in the 1987 World Cup after an injury to incumbent Andy Dalton and was appointed All Blacks captain in 1992, continuing in the role until his retirement in 1997. He played a total of 346 first class rugby matches, including 92 Tests.<p><a id="Individual_records" name="Individual_records"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Individual records</span></h3>
      <p>The record for most All Black Test points is held by <!--del_lnk--> Andrew Mehrtens with 967 points from 70 Tests. The All Black&#39;s greatest Test try scorer is <!--del_lnk--> Christian Cullen with 46 tries from 58 Tests. The world record for tries in a calender year is held by <!--del_lnk--> Joe Rokocoko, with 17 tries in 2003; he also became the first All Black to score ten tries in his first five Tests. In Test matches, the most capped All Black is Sean Fitzpatrick with 92 appearances, with a record 51 of which were as captain. The youngest All Black in a Test match was Jonah Lomu, capped at age 19 years, 45 days, whilst the oldest Test player was <!--del_lnk--> Ned Hughes at 40 years, 123 days.<p><a id="Coaches" name="Coaches"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Coaches</span></h2>

      <p>Unlike many other major rugby nations, New Zealand does not have an official stadium for its national team. Instead, the All Blacks play their Test matches at a variety of venues throughout New Zealand. In 2005 and 2006 the All Blacks played matches at: <!--del_lnk--> Eden Park, <a href="../../wp/a/Auckland.htm" title="Auckland">Auckland</a>; <!--del_lnk--> North Harbour Stadium, <!--del_lnk--> Albany; <!--del_lnk--> Westpac Stadium, <a href="../../wp/w/Wellington.htm" title="Wellington">Wellington</a>; <!--del_lnk--> Jade Stadium (formerly called Lancaster Park), <!--del_lnk--> Christchurch; <!--del_lnk--> Waikato Stadium, <!--del_lnk--> Hamilton; and <!--del_lnk--> Carisbrook, <!--del_lnk--> Dunedin.<p>Prior to the construction of Westpac Stadium in 1999, Wellington&#39;s Test venue was <!--del_lnk--> Athletic Park. Athletic Park was the venue for the first All Blacks Test match in New Zealand against Great Britain in 1904. The first home Test match played outside the main centres of Auckland, Christchurch, Dunedin or Wellington was in 1996 at <!--del_lnk--> McLean Park in <!--del_lnk--> Napier. The 1987 Rugby World Cup final was played at Eden Park.<p>Eden Park and Jade Stadium are being upgraded in preparation for the 2011 Rugby World Cup. In 2006, the <!--del_lnk--> New Zealand Government proposed the construction of a waterfront <!--del_lnk--> National Stadium in Auckland as an alternative to Eden Park&#39;s upgrade; this proposal was rejected by the <!--del_lnk--> Auckland Regional Council. The NZRU no longer considers Carisbrook as a suitable Test venue; a covered sports stadium has been proposed as a replacement.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Blacks&quot;</div>
