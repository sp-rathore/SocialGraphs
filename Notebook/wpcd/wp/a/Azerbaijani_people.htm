Commonly referred to as <b>Azeris</b> (<!--del_lnk--> Azeri: <b>&#x622;&#x630;&#x631;&#x6CC;&#x644;&#x631;</b>/<b>Az&#x4D9;ril&#x4D9;r</b>) or <b>&#x100;zar&#x12B;s</b> (<!--del_lnk--> Persian: <b>&#x622;&#x630;&#x631;&#x6CC;</b>), they also live in a wider area from the <!--del_lnk--> Caucasus to the <!--del_lnk--> Iranian plateau. The Azeris are typically <!--del_lnk--> Muslim and have a mixed cultural heritage of <!--del_lnk--> Turkic, <a href="../../wp/i/Iranian_peoples.htm" title="Iranian peoples">Iranian</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Caucasian elements.<p>Despite living on both sides of an international border, the Azeris form a single group. However, northerners and southerners differ due to nearly two centuries of separate social evolution in <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russian</a>/<a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a>-influenced Azerbaijan and <!--del_lnk--> Iranian Azarbaijan. The <!--del_lnk--> Azerbaijani language unifies Azeris and is mutually intelligible with <!--del_lnk--> Turkmen and <!--del_lnk--> Turkish (including the dialects spoken by the <!--del_lnk--> Turkomans of Iraq and by the <!--del_lnk--> Qashqai). All of these languages are traced to the Turkic <!--del_lnk--> Oghuz, who moved into the Caucasus from <!--del_lnk--> Central Asia in the 11th century. Following the <!--del_lnk--> Russian-Persian Wars of the 18th and 19th centuries, <!--del_lnk--> Persian territories in the Caucasus (some merely under nominal control) were ceded to the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Empire. This included parts of the current Republic of Azerbaijan. The treaties of <!--del_lnk--> Golestan in 1813 and <!--del_lnk--> Turkmanchai in 1828 finalized the border between Russia and <!--del_lnk--> Persia (Iran).<p>As a result of this separate existence, the Azeris are mainly secularists in Azerbaijan and religious Muslims in Iranian Azarbaijan. Since Azerbaijan&#39;s independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, there has been renewed interest in religion and cross-border ethnic ties.<p>

      <p>Azerbaijan is believed to be named after <i><!--del_lnk--> Atropates</i>, a <!--del_lnk--> Median <!--del_lnk--> satrap (governor) who ruled in <i><!--del_lnk--> Atropatene</i> (modern <!--del_lnk--> Iranian Azarbaijan). Atropates is derived from <!--del_lnk--> Old Persian roots meaning &quot;protected by fire.&quot; <!--del_lnk--> Azerbaijan has seen a host of inhabitants and invaders, including <!--del_lnk--> Caucasians, <!--del_lnk--> Medes, <!--del_lnk--> Scythians, <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Empire.htm" title="Persian Empire">Persians</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Armenians, <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Greeks</a>, <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Romans</a>, <a href="../../wp/k/Khazars.htm" title="Khazars">Khazars</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Arabs, <!--del_lnk--> Oghuz, <!--del_lnk--> Seljuks, <a href="../../wp/m/Mongol_Empire.htm" title="Mongol Empire">Mongols</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Russians.<p><a id="Ancient_period" name="Ancient_period"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Ancient period</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Caucasian Albanians are believed to be the earliest inhabitants of Azerbaijan. Early invaders included the <!--del_lnk--> Scythians in the ninth century BCE. Following the Scythians, the Medes came to dominate the area to the south of the <!--del_lnk--> Aras. The Medes forged a vast empire between 900-700 BCE, which was overthrown by the <!--del_lnk--> Achaemenids around 550 BCE. During this period, <!--del_lnk--> Zoroastrianism spread in Azerbaijan. The Achaemenids in turn were defeated by <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a> in 330 BCE, but the Median satrap Atropates was allowed to remain in power. Following the decline of the <!--del_lnk--> Seleucids in Persia in 247 BCE, an <!--del_lnk--> Armenian Kingdom exercised control over parts of Azerbaijan between 190 BCE to 428 CE. Caucasian Albanians established a kingdom in the 1st century BCE and largely remained independent until the <!--del_lnk--> Sassanids made the kingdom a <!--del_lnk--> vassal state in 252 CE. Caucasian Albania&#39;s ruler, King Urnayr, officially adopted <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> as the state religion in the 4th century CE, and Albania would remain a Christian state until the 8th century. Sassanid control ended with their defeat by Muslim <a href="../../wp/a/Abbasid.htm" title="Abbasid">Arabs</a> in 642 CE.<p><a id="Medieval_period" name="Medieval_period"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Medieval period</span></h3>

      <p>Muslim Arabs defeated the Sassanids and <a href="../../wp/b/Byzantine_Empire.htm" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantines</a> as they marched into the Caucasus region. The Arabs made Caucasian Albania a vassal state after the Christian resistance, led by Prince <!--del_lnk--> Javanshir, surrendered in 667. Between the 9th and 10th centuries, Arab authors began to refer to the region between the <!--del_lnk--> Kura and Aras rivers as <i><!--del_lnk--> Arran</i>. During this time, Arabs from <!--del_lnk--> Basra and <!--del_lnk--> Kufa came to Azerbaijan and seized lands that indigenous peoples had abandoned; the Arabs became a land-owning elite. Conversion to Islam was slow as local resistance persisted for centuries and resentment grew as small groups of Arabs began migrating to cities such as <!--del_lnk--> Tabriz and <!--del_lnk--> Maraghah. This influx sparked a major rebellion in <!--del_lnk--> Iranian Azarbaijan from 816&ndash;837, led by a local commoner named <!--del_lnk--> B&#x101;bak. However, despite pockets of continued resistance, the majority of the inhabitants of Azerbaijan converted to Islam. Later on, in the 10th and 11th centuries, <!--del_lnk--> Kurdish dynasties of <!--del_lnk--> Shaddadid and <!--del_lnk--> Rawadid ruled parts of Azerbaijan.<p>In the middle of the 11th century, the <!--del_lnk--> Seljuq dynasty overthrew Arab rule and established an empire that encompassed most of <!--del_lnk--> Southwest Asia. The Seljuk period marked the influx of <!--del_lnk--> Oghuz nomads into the region and, thus, the beginning of the <!--del_lnk--> turkification of Azerbaijan as the West Oghuz Turkic language supplanted earlier Caucasian and Iranian ones.<p>However, Iranian cultural influence survived, as evidenced by the works of then contemporary writers such as <!--del_lnk--> Persian poet <!--del_lnk--> Nez&#x101;m&#x12B; Ganjav&#x12B;. The emerging Turkic identity was chronicled in epic poems or <i>dastans</i>, the oldest being the <i><!--del_lnk--> Book of Dede Korkut</i>, which relate <!--del_lnk--> allegorical tales about the early Turks in the Caucasus and <!--del_lnk--> Asia Minor. Turkic dominion was interrupted by the <a href="../../wp/m/Mongol_Empire.htm" title="Mongol Empire">Mongols</a> in 1227 and later the Mongols and <!--del_lnk--> Tamerlane ruled the region until 1405. Turkic rule returned with the <!--del_lnk--> Sunni <!--del_lnk--> Qara Qoyunl&#x16B; (Black Sheep Turkmen) and <!--del_lnk--> Aq Qoyunl&#x16B; (White Sheep Turkmen), who dominated Azerbaijan until the <!--del_lnk--> Shi&#39;a <!--del_lnk--> Safavids took power in 1501.<p><a id="Modern_period" name="Modern_period"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Modern period</span></h3>

      <p>The Safavids, who rose from Iranian Azerbaijan, established a the modern multi-ethnic Iranian state, which lasted until 1722. Noted for achievements in state building, architecture, and the sciences, the Safavid state crumbled due to internal decay and external pressures from the Russians and <!--del_lnk--> Afghans. The Safavids encouraged and spread Shi&#39;a Islam which is an important part of the national identity of Iranian Azerbaijani people as well as many Azerbaijanis from the Republic of Azerbaijan. The Safavids encouraged the arts and culture and Shah <!--del_lnk--> Abbas the Great created an intellectual atmosphere which according to some scholars was a new <i>Golden Age of Persia</i>. He reformed the government and the military, and responded to the needs of the common people.<p>After the Safavid state came brief <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman</a> rule followed by the conquest of <!--del_lnk--> Nadir Shah Afshar, a chieftain from <!--del_lnk--> Khorasan who reduced the power of the Shi&#39;a. The brief reign of <!--del_lnk--> Karim Khan came next, followed by the <!--del_lnk--> Qajars, who ruled Azerbaijan and Iran starting in 1779. Russia loomed as a threat to Persian holdings in the Caucasus in this period. The <!--del_lnk--> Russo-Persian Wars began in the 18th century and ended in the early 19th century with the <!--del_lnk--> Gulistan Treaty of 1813 and the <!--del_lnk--> Turkmanchai Treaty in 1828, which officially gave the Caucasian portion of Qajar Iran to the Russian Empire..<p>Iranian Azerbaijan&#39;s role in the Iranian constitutional revolution cannot be underestimated. The greatest figures of the democracy seeking revolution <!--del_lnk--> Sattar Khan and <!--del_lnk--> Bagher Khan were both from Iranian Azerbaijan. The Constitutional Revolution of 1906-11 shook the Qajar dynasty, whose kings had virtually sold the country to the tobacco and oil interests of the British Empire and has lost territory to the Russian empire. A parliament (Majlis) came into existence by the efforts of the constitutionalists. It was accompanied in some regions by a peasant revolt against tax collectors and landlords, the only indigenous mainstay of the monarchy. Pro-democracy newspapers appeared, and Iranian intellectuals began to relish the modernist breezes blowing from Paris and Petrograd. The Qajar Shah and his British advisers crushed the Constitutional Revolution, but the demise of the dynasty could not be long postponed. The last Shah of the Qajar dynasty was soon removed by a military coup led by <!--del_lnk--> Reza Khan, an officer of an old Cossack regiment, which had been created by Czarist Russia and officered by Russians to protect the Qajar ruler and Russian interests. In the quest of imposing national homogeneity on the country where half of the population consisted of ethnic minorities, Reza Shah issued in quick succession bans on the use of Azerbaijani language on the premises of schools, in theatrical performances, religious ceremonies, and, finally, in the publication of books.<p>With the dethronment of Reza Shah in September 1941, Russian troops captured Tabriz and northwestern Persia for military and strategic reasons. <!--del_lnk--> Azerbaijan People&#39;s Government, a client state set up by the order of Stalin himself, under leadership of <!--del_lnk--> Sayyid Jafar Pishevari was proclaimed in Tabriz However, under pressure by the Western countries, the Soviet army was soon withdrawn, and the Iranian government regained control over Iranian Azerbaijan by the end of 1946.<p>According to Professor.

      <p>While the Azeris in Iran largely integrated into modern Iranian society, the northern Azeris lived through the transition from the Russian Empire to brief <!--del_lnk--> independence from 1918-1920 and then incorporation into the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> despite pleas by <a href="../../wp/w/Woodrow_Wilson.htm" title="Woodrow Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> for their independence at the <a href="../../wp/t/Treaty_of_Versailles.htm" title="Treaty of Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a> conference.

      <p>In many references, Azerbaijanis are designated as a <!--del_lnk--> Turkic people, due to their <!--del_lnk--> Turkic language and partial descent from the <!--del_lnk--> Oghuz. However, there is a debate regarding the ethnic origins of the Azeris. The debate has to do with modern <a href="../../wp/n/Nationalism.htm" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a> and historic claims over Azeri territory. The debate involves three viewpoints: whether the Azeris are of a Turkic background from <!--del_lnk--> Central Asia, are an <a href="../../wp/i/Iranian_peoples.htm" title="Iranian peoples">Iranian people</a> who simply changed their language following Turkic invasions, or are indigenous to the <!--del_lnk--> Caucasus and have adopted the Azerbaijani language, Persian culture, and Islam. Thus, determining whether a Turkic, Iranian, or Caucasian background defines the Azeris has much to do with the historical views of Azeribaijan&#39;s neighbors.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The Turkic origin theory is based upon the <!--del_lnk--> Azerbaijani language and favored by those who believe that centuries of heavy Turkic settlement shaped Azerbaijan&#39;s Turkic identity. The Turkic theory does not alter the general view of the Azeris as a <!--del_lnk--> Turkic people, but discusses to what extent Turkic groups changed the demographics of the Eastern Caucasus and Iranian Azarbaijan.<p>Although, &quot;Turkic penetration probably began in the <!--del_lnk--> Hunnic era and its aftermath,&quot; there is little evidence to indicate, &quot;permanent settlements&quot;. The earliest major Turkic incursion began with <!--del_lnk--> Mahmud of Ghazni (971-1040) and accelerated during the <!--del_lnk--> Seljuk period. The migration of Oghuz Turks from present day <a href="../../wp/t/Turkmenistan.htm" title="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a>, which is attested by linguistic similarity, remained high through the Mongol period, as many troops under the <!--del_lnk--> Ilkhans were Turkic. By the <!--del_lnk--> Safavid period, the <i>turkification</i> of Azerbaijan continued with the influence of the <!--del_lnk--> Kizilbash. The very name Azerbaijan is derived from the pre-Turkic name of the province, Azarbayjan or Adarbayjan, and illustrates a gradual language shift that took place as local place names survived turkification, albeit in altered form.<p>The <i><!--del_lnk--> Book of Dede Korkut</i> could be a document that supports a substantial Oghuz migration into Azerbaijan. <!--del_lnk--> UNESCO recently celebrated the 1300th anniversary of this epic work. Despite its purported age, most academics believe that the <i>Book of Dede Korkut</i> originated after the Oghuz entered the Caucasus, with its written text having been compiled in the 15th century. Most academics view this migration as the most likely source of a Turkic background, but one that most likely involved the <i>turkification</i> of predominantly indigenous peoples.<p><a id="Iranian_theory" name="Iranian_theory"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Iranian theory</span></h3>

      <p>The Iranian origin theory, favoured by some notable scholars and sources, is based upon the ancient presence of <a href="../../wp/i/Iranian_peoples.htm" title="Iranian peoples">Iranic tribes</a>, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Medes, in <!--del_lnk--> Iranian Azarbaijan, and <!--del_lnk--> Scythian invasions during the eighth century BCE. It is believed that the Medes mixed with an indigenous population, the Caucasian <!--del_lnk--> Mannai, a <!--del_lnk--> Northeast Caucasian group related to the <!--del_lnk--> Urartians.<p>Scholars see cultural similarities between modern Persians and Azeris as evidence of an ancient Iranian influence. Archaeological evidence indicates that the Iranian religion of <!--del_lnk--> Zoroastrianism was prominent throughout the Caucasus before Christianity and Islam and that the influence of various <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Empire.htm" title="Persian Empire">Persian Empires</a> added to the Iranian character of the area. It has also been hypothesized that the population of Iranian Azarbaijan was predominantly Persian-speaking before the Oghuz arrived. This claim is supported by the many Azerbaijani literary figures, such as <!--del_lnk--> Qatran Tabrizi, <!--del_lnk--> Shams Tabrizi, <!--del_lnk--> Nezami, and <!--del_lnk--> Khaghani, who wrote in Persian prior to and during the Oghuz migration, as well as by <!--del_lnk--> Strabo, Al-Istakhri, and Al-Masudi, who all describe the language of the region as <!--del_lnk--> Persian. The claim is mentioned by other medieval historians, such as <!--del_lnk--> Al-Muqaddasi. Other common Perso-Azeribaijani features include Iranian place names such as <!--del_lnk--> Tabriz and <!--del_lnk--> Baku.<p>The modern presence of the Iranian <!--del_lnk--> Talysh and <!--del_lnk--> Tats in Azerbaijan is further evidence of the former Iranian character of the region. As a precursor to these modern groups, the <!--del_lnk--> ancient Azaris are hypothesized as the main ancestors of the modern Azerbaijanis. However, ancient historians, including <a href="../../wp/h/Herodotus.htm" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Polybius and <!--del_lnk--> Strabo, mention the region as a mixed one, with Iranian and non-Iranian groups, such as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Utii</i>, a Caucasian group that still exists in Azerbaijan.<p><a id="Caucasian_theory" name="Caucasian_theory"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Caucasian theory</span></h3>

      <p>There is evidence that, despite repeated invasions and migrations, aboriginal <!--del_lnk--> Caucasians may have been culturally assimilated, first by <!--del_lnk--> Iranians and later by the Oghuz. Audrey Alstadt notes in <i>The Azerbaijani Turks</i> that many Azeris in the Republic of Azerbaijan regard both the Oghuz and the Caucasian Albanians as their ancestors. Considerable information has been learned about the Caucasian Albanians including their language, history, early conversion to <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, and close ties to the <!--del_lnk--> Armenians. Many academics believe that the <!--del_lnk--> Udi language, still spoken in Azerbaijan, is a remnant of the Albanians&#39; language.<p>This Caucasian influence extended further south into <!--del_lnk--> Iranian Azarbaijan. During the 1st millennium BCE, another Caucasian people, the <!--del_lnk--> Mannaeans (<i>Mannai</i>) populated much of Iranian Azarbaijan. Weakened by conflicts with the <!--del_lnk--> Assyrians, the Mannaeans are believed to have been conquered and assimilated by the Medes by 590 BCE.<p>The extent to which cultural assimilation took place is unclear. By examining the historical record, archaeological finds, and, in recent years, <!--del_lnk--> genealogical DNA testing, a team of researchers has put forth the view that indigenous peoples were often assimilated rather than being killed or driven out. In the case of the Azeris, this would mean that the majority today are descendents of the earliest settlers of the Caucasus. However, this view would require strong genetic evidence that peoples in the Caucasus are related despite their linguistic and cultural differences.<p><a id="Genetics" name="Genetics"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Genetics</span></h3>
      <p>Though the population of Azerbaijan is culturally diverse, <!--del_lnk--> genetic testing has revealed common genetic markers that support an autochthonous background for most Azeris. A 2003 study found that: &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Y-chromosome haplogroups indicate that Indo-European-speaking Armenians and Turkic-speaking Azerbaijanians are genetically more closely related to their geographic neighbors in the Caucasus than to their linguistic neighbors elsewhere.&quot; The authors of this study suggest that this indicates a language replacement of indigenous Caucasian peoples. There is evidence of limited genetic admixture derived from Central Asians (specifically <!--del_lnk--> Haplogroup H12), notably the <!--del_lnk--> Turkmen, that is higher than that of their neighbors, the <!--del_lnk--> Georgians and <!--del_lnk--> Armenians. <!--del_lnk--> MtDNA analysis indicates that the main relationship with Iranians is through a larger West Eurasian group that is secondary to that of the Caucasus, according to a study that did not include Azeris, but Georgians who have clustered with Azeris in other studies. The conclusion from the testing shows that the Azeris are a mixed population with relationships, in order of greatest similarity, with the Caucasus, Iranians and Near Easterners, Europeans, and Turkmen. Other genetic analysis of <!--del_lnk--> mtDNA and <!--del_lnk--> Y-chromosomes indicates that Caucasian populations are genetically intermediate between Europeans and Near Easterners, but that they are more closely related to Near Easterners overall. Another study, conducted in 2003 by the <i>Russian Journal of Genetics</i>, compared Iranians in Azerbaijan (the <!--del_lnk--> Talysh and <!--del_lnk--> Tats) with Turkic Azerbaijanis and found that,<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>The conclusion from this study further supports the view that groups within close geographic proximity to the Azeris are genetically similar despite linguistic differences. A recent study of the genetic landscape of Iran was completed by a team of <a href="../../wp/u/University_of_Cambridge.htm" title="Cambridge University">Cambridge</a> geneticists led by Dr. Maziar Ashrafian Bonab (an Iranian Azarbaijani).

      <p>The Azerbaijanis speak <!--del_lnk--> Azerbaijani (sometimes called Azerbaijani Turkish or Azeri), a <!--del_lnk--> Turkic language that is mutually intelligible with <!--del_lnk--> Turkish despite minor variations in accent, vocabulary and grammar. Other mutually intelligible Turkic languages include <!--del_lnk--> Turkmen and the Turkish spoken by the <!--del_lnk--> Turkomans of Iraq and the <!--del_lnk--> Qashqai. The Azerbaijani language is descended from the Western Oghuz Turkic language that became established in Azerbaijan in the 11th century CE. Early Oghuz was mainly an oral language. It began to develop as a <!--del_lnk--> literary language by the 13th century. Early oral Azerbaijani, derived from the Oghuz language, began with history recitations (<i>dastans</i>), including the <i><!--del_lnk--> Book of Dede Korkut</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Koroglu</i>, which contained <!--del_lnk--> Turkic mythology. Some of the earliest Azeri writings of the past are traced back to the poet <!--del_lnk--> Nes&icirc;m&icirc; (died 1417) and then decades later <!--del_lnk--> Fuz&ucirc;l&icirc; (1483&ndash;1556). <!--del_lnk--> Ismail I, Shah of <!--del_lnk--> Safavid Persia wrote Azeri poetry under the pen name <i>Khat&acirc;&#39;i</i>. Modern Azeri literature continued with a traditional emphasis upon, <a href="../../wp/h/Humanism.htm" title="Humanism">humanism</a>, as conveyed in the writings of <!--del_lnk--> Samed Vurgun, <!--del_lnk--> Reza Baraheni, <!--del_lnk--> Shahriar, and many others.<p>In addition to their mother tongue, many Azerbaijanis are equally at home in <a href="../../wp/r/Russian_language.htm" title="Russian language">Russian</a> and/or <!--del_lnk--> Persian.<p><a id="Religion" name="Religion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h3>

      <p>The majority of Azerbaijanis are <!--del_lnk--> Shi&#39;a Muslims. Religious minorities include <!--del_lnk--> Sunni Muslims, <a href="../../wp/j/Judaism.htm" title="Judaism">Jews</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Zoroastrians, <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christians</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Bah%25C3%25A1%2527%25C3%25AD_Faith.htm" title="Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; Faith">Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s</a>. While only a small minority of Azeris in Iran are Sunni, between 25-40% of Azeris in the Republic of Azerbaijan identify as nominal Sunnis, and an unknown number show no religious affiliation. In the Republic of Azerbaijan traditions from other religions are often celebrated in addition to <!--del_lnk--> Islamic holidays, including <!--del_lnk--> Norouz and <!--del_lnk--> Christmas.<p><a id="Performance_art" name="Performance_art"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Performance art</span></h3>

      <p>Azeris express themselves in a variety of artistic ways including dance, music, and the media. Azeri folk dances are ancient and similar to that of their neighbours in the Caucasus and Iran. The group dance is a common form found from <!--del_lnk--> southeastern Europe to the <a href="../../wp/c/Caspian_Sea.htm" title="Caspian Sea">Caspian Sea</a>. In the group dance the performers come together in a semi-circular or circular formation as, &quot;The leader of these dances often executes special figures as well as signaling and changes in the foot patterns, movements, or direction in which the group is moving, often by gesturing with his or her hand, in which a kerchief is held.&quot; Solitary dances are performed by both men and women and involve subtle hand motions in addition to sequenced steps.<p>Azeri musical tradition can be traced back to singing bards called <i><!--del_lnk--> Ashiqs</i>, a vocation that survives to this day. Modern Ashiqs play the <!--del_lnk--> saz (<!--del_lnk--> lute) and sing <i>dastans</i> (historical ballads). Other musical instruments include the <!--del_lnk--> tar (another type of lute), <!--del_lnk--> duduk (a wind instrument), <!--del_lnk--> Kamancha (fiddle), and the <!--del_lnk--> dhol (drums). Azeri classical music, called <i><!--del_lnk--> mugham</i>, is often an emotional singing performance. Composers <!--del_lnk--> Uzeyir Hajibeyov, <!--del_lnk--> Gara Garayev and <!--del_lnk--> Fikret Amirov created a hybrid style that combines Western <!--del_lnk--> classical music with mugham. Other Azeris, notably <!--del_lnk--> Vagif Mustafa Zadeh and <!--del_lnk--> Aziza Mustafa Zadeh, mixed <a href="../../wp/j/Jazz.htm" title="Jazz">jazz</a> with mugham. Some Azeri musicians have received international acclaim, including <!--del_lnk--> Rashid Behbudov (who could sing in over eight languages) and <!--del_lnk--> Muslim Magomayev (a pop star from the Soviet era).<p>Meanwhile in Iran, Azeri music has taken a different course. According to Iranian Azeri singer Hossein Alizadeh, &quot;Historically in Iran, music faced strong opposition from the religious establishment, forcing it to go underground.&quot; As a result, most Iranian Azeri music is performed outside of Iran amongst exile communities.<p>Azeri film and television is largely broadcast in Azerbaijan with limited outlets in Iran. Some Azeris have been prolific film-makers, such as <!--del_lnk--> Rustam Ibragimbekov, who wrote <i><!--del_lnk--> Burnt by the Sun</i>, winner of the Grand Prize at the <!--del_lnk--> Cannes Film Festival and an <!--del_lnk--> Academy Award for <!--del_lnk--> Best Foreign Language Film in 1994. Many Iranian Azeris have been prominent in the <!--del_lnk--> cinematic tradition of Iran, which has received critical praise since the 1980s.<p><a id="Sports" name="Sports"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Sports</span></h3>

      <p>Azerbaijan and Iranian Azerbaijan have developed distinct institutions as a result of divergent socio-political evolution. Azerbaijan began the 20th century with institutions based upon those of Russia and the Soviet Union, with strict state control over most aspects of society. Since, they have moved towards the adoption of Western social models as of the late 20th century. Since independence, relaxed state controls have allowed local <a href="../../wp/c/Civil_society.htm" title="Civil society">civil society</a> to develop. In contrast, in Iranian Azerbaijan Islamic theocratic institutions dominate nearly all aspects of society, with most political power in the hands of the <!--del_lnk--> Supreme Leader of Iran and the <!--del_lnk--> Council of Guardians. Yet both societies are in a state of change. In Azerbaijan there is a secular democratic system that is mired in political corruption and charges of election fraud. Azerbaijan&#39;s civil society is a work in progress:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>Despite these problems Azerbaijan has an active political opposition that seeks more expansive democratic reforms. Azeris in Iran remain intertwined with the Islamic republic&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> theocratic regime and lack any significant civil society of a secular nature that can pose a major challenge. There are signs of civil unrest due to the policies of the Iranian government in Iranian Azarbaijan and increased interaction with fellow Azeris in Azerbaijan and satellite broadcasts from <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> have revived Azeri nationalism.<p><a id="Women" name="Women"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Women</span></h2>

      <p>Azeri females have historically struggled against a legacy of male domination but have made great strides since the 20th century. In Azerbaijan, women were granted the right to vote in 1919. Women have attained Western-style equality in major cities such as <!--del_lnk--> Baku, although in rural areas more traditional views remain. Some problems that are especially prevalent include violence against women, especially in rural areas. Crimes such as rape are severely punished in Azerbaijan, but rarely reported, not unlike other parts of the former Soviet Union. Azeri women were forced to &quot;give up the veil,&quot; placing Azerbaijan in sharp contrast with Iranian Azarbajan. Women are underrepresented in elective office but have attained high positions in parliament. An Azeri woman is the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in Azerbaijan, and two others are Justices of the Constitutional Court. As of <!--del_lnk--> 6 November <!--del_lnk--> 2005, women constituted 12% of all MPs (15 seats in total) in the <!--del_lnk--> National Assembly of Azerbaijan. The Republic of Azerbaijan is also one of the few Muslim countries where <!--del_lnk--> abortion is available on demand.<p>In Iran, the continued unequal treatment of women has been met with increasingly vocal protests, including that of <!--del_lnk--> Shirin Ebadi, who won the <a href="../../wp/n/Nobel_Peace_Prize.htm" title="Nobel Peace Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> in 2003 for her strong advocacy for women&#39;s rights. A groundswell of grassroots movements have emerged seeking gender equality since the 1980s. Regular protests take place in defiance of government bans and are often dispersed through violence, as in June 2006 when: &quot;Thousands of women and male supporters came together on June 12 in Haft Tir Square in Tehran&quot;, and were dispersed through, &quot;brutal suppression.&quot; Past Iranian leaders, such as <!--del_lnk--> Mohammad Khatami, promised women greater rights, but the government has opposed changes that they interpret as contrary to Islamic doctrine. As of 2004, nine Azeri women have been elected to parliament (<!--del_lnk--> Majlis) and while most are committed to social change, some represent conservative positions regarding gender issues. The social fate of Azeri women largely mirrors that of other women in Iran.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijani_people&quot;</div>
