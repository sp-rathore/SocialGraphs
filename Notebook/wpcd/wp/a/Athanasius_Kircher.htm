      <p><b>Athanasius Kircher</b> (sometimes erroneously spelt <b>Kirchner</b>) (<!--del_lnk--> May 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1602&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 28 November <!--del_lnk--> 1680) was a 17th century <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">German</a> <!--del_lnk--> Jesuit <!--del_lnk--> scholar who published around 40 works, most notably in the fields of <!--del_lnk--> oriental studies, <a href="../../wp/g/Geology.htm" title="Geology">geology</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Medicine.htm" title="Medicine">medicine</a>. He made an early study of <!--del_lnk--> Egyptian hieroglyphs. One of the first people to observe microbes through a <a href="../../wp/m/Microscope.htm" title="Microscope">microscope</a>, he was thus ahead of his time in proposing that the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Death.htm" title="Black Death">plague</a> was caused by an infectious <!--del_lnk--> microorganism and in suggesting effective measures to prevent the spread of the disease.<p>He has been compared to <a href="../../wp/l/Leonardo_da_Vinci.htm" title="Leonardo da Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> for his inventiveness and the breadth and depth of his work. A scientific star in his day, towards the end of his life he was eclipsed by the <!--del_lnk--> rationalism of <a href="../../wp/r/Ren%25C3%25A9_Descartes.htm" title="Ren&eacute; Descartes">Ren&eacute; Descartes</a> and others. In the late 20th century, however, the <!--del_lnk--> aesthetic qualities of his work again began to be appreciated. One scholar, Edward W.

      <p>Kircher was born on <!--del_lnk--> May 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1601 or 1602 (he himself did not know) in <!--del_lnk--> Geisa, <!--del_lnk--> Buchonia, near <!--del_lnk--> Fulda. From his birthplace he took the epithets <i>Bucho, Buchonius</i> and <i>Fuldensis</i> which he sometimes added to his name. He attended the Jesuit College in Fulda from 1614 to 1618, when he joined the order himself as a <!--del_lnk--> seminarian.<p>The youngest of nine children, Kircher was a precocious youngster who was taught <!--del_lnk--> Hebrew by a <!--del_lnk--> rabbi in addition to his studies at school. He studied <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> and <!--del_lnk--> theology at <!--del_lnk--> Paderborn, but fled to <a href="../../wp/c/Cologne.htm" title="Cologne">Cologne</a> in 1622 to escape advancing <!--del_lnk--> Protestant forces. On the journey, he narrowly escaped death after falling through the ice crossing the frozen <a href="../../wp/r/Rhine.htm" title="Rhine">Rhine</a>&mdash; one of several occasions on which his life was endangered. Later, travelling to <!--del_lnk--> Heiligenstadt, he was caught and nearly <!--del_lnk--> hanged by a party of Protestant soldiers. At Heiligenstadt, he taught <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>, Hebrew and <!--del_lnk--> Syrian, and produced a show of <!--del_lnk--> fireworks and moving scenery for the visiting <!--del_lnk--> Elector <!--del_lnk--> Archbishop of Mainz, showing early evidence of his interest in <!--del_lnk--> mechanical devices. He joined the <!--del_lnk--> priesthood in 1628 and became professor of <a href="../../wp/e/Ethics.htm" title="Ethics">ethics</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> at the <!--del_lnk--> University of W&uuml;rzburg, where he also taught Hebrew and Syrian. From 1628, he also began to show an interest in Egyptian hieroglyphs.<p>Kircher published his first book (the <i>Ars Magnesia</i>, reporting his research on <a href="../../wp/m/Magnetism.htm" title="Magnetism">magnetism</a>) in 1631, but the same year he was driven by the continuing <!--del_lnk--> Thirty Years&#39; War to the papal <!--del_lnk--> University of Avignon in <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>. In 1633, he was called to <a href="../../wp/v/Vienna.htm" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> by the <!--del_lnk--> emperor to succeed <a href="../../wp/j/Johannes_Kepler.htm" title="Johannes Kepler">Kepler</a> as Mathematician to the <!--del_lnk--> Habsburg court. On the intervention of <!--del_lnk--> Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc, the order was rescinded and he was sent instead to <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a> to continue with his scholarly work, but he had already set off for Vienna. On the way, his ship was blown off-course and he arrived in Rome before he knew of the changed decision. He based himself in the city for the rest of his life, and from 1638 taught mathematics, <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physics</a> and <!--del_lnk--> oriental languages at the <!--del_lnk--> Collegio Romano for several years before being released to devote himself to research. He studied first <a href="../../wp/m/Malaria.htm" title="Malaria">malaria</a> and then the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Death.htm" title="Black Death">plague</a>, and amassed a collection of <a href="../../wp/a/Archaeology.htm" title="Archaeology">antiquities</a> which he exhibited along with devices of his own creation in the <!--del_lnk--> Museum Kircherianum.<p>In 1661, Kircher discovered the ruins of a <!--del_lnk--> church said to have been constructed by <!--del_lnk--> Constantine on the site of <!--del_lnk--> Saint Eustace&#39;s vision of <a href="../../wp/j/Jesus.htm" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a> in a stag&#39;s horns. He raised money to pay for the church&rsquo;s reconstruction as the <i>Santuario della Mentorella</i>, and his heart was buried in the church on his death.<p><a id="Works" name="Works"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Works</span></h2>
      <p>Kircher published a large number of substantial books on a very wide variety of subjects, such as <!--del_lnk--> Egyptology, <a href="../../wp/g/Geology.htm" title="Geology">geology</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> music theory. His <!--del_lnk--> syncretic approach paid no attention to the boundaries between disciplines which are now conventional: his <i>Magnes</i>, for example, was ostensibly a discussion of <a href="../../wp/m/Magnetism.htm" title="Magnetism">magnetism</a>, but also explored other forms of attraction such as <a href="../../wp/g/Gravitation.htm" title="Gravity">gravity</a> and <a href="../../wp/l/Love.htm" title="Love">love</a>. Perhaps Kircher&#39;s best-known work today is his <i><!--del_lnk--> Oedipus Aegyptiacus</i> (1652-54) a vast study of Egyptology and <!--del_lnk--> comparative religion. His books, written in <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a>, had a wide circulation in the 17th century, and they contributed to the dissemination of scientific information to a broader circle of readers.<p><a id="Egyptology" name="Egyptology"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Egyptology</span></h3>
      <p>Kircher was acknowledged as his era&#39;s greatest student of the mysteries of <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>. While some of his notions are long discredited, portions of his work have been valuable to later scholars; Kircher helped pioneer Egyptology as a field of serious study.<div class="thumb tleft">

      </div>
      <p>Kircher&#39;s interest in Egyptology began in 1628 when he became intrigued by a collection of hieroglyphs in the library at <!--del_lnk--> Speyer. He learned <!--del_lnk--> Coptic in 1633 and published the first grammar of that language in 1636, the <i>Prodromus coptus sive aegyptiacus</i>. In the <i>Lingua aegyptiaca restituta</i> of 1643, he argued correctly that <!--del_lnk--> Coptic was not a separate language, but the last development of <!--del_lnk--> ancient Egyptian. He also recognised the relationship between the <!--del_lnk--> hieratic and hieroglyphic scripts.<p>In <i>Oedipus Aegyptiacus</i> he argued, under the impression of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Hieroglyphica</i>, that <!--del_lnk--> ancient Egyptian was the language spoken by <!--del_lnk--> Adam and Eve, that <!--del_lnk--> Hermes Trismegistus was <!--del_lnk--> Moses, and that hieroglyphs were <!--del_lnk--> occult <!--del_lnk--> symbols which &quot;cannot be translated by words, but expressed only by marks, characters and figures.&quot; This led him to translate simple hieroglyphic texts now known to read as <i><u>d</u>d W<u>s</u>r</i> (&quot;Osiris says&quot;) as &quot;The treachery of Typhon ends at the throne of Isis; the moisture of nature is guarded by the vigilance of Anubis.&quot; Kircher apparently fooled himself (as well as some contemporaries) into believing that he could read the hieroglyphics, but his &quot;translations&quot; were largely figments of his own imagination, having little to do with the actual text.<p>Although his approach to deciphering the texts was based on a fundamental misconception, he did pioneer serious study of hieroglyphs, and the data which he collected were later used by <!--del_lnk--> Champollion in his successful efforts to decode the script. Kircher himself was alive to the possibility of the hieroglyphs constituting an <a href="../../wp/a/Alphabet.htm" title="Alphabet">alphabet</a>: he included in his proposed system (incorrect) derivations of the <!--del_lnk--> Greek alphabet from 21 hieroglyphs. He was actively involved in the erection of Obeliscs on Roman squares, often adding fantastic &quot;hieroglyphs&quot; of his own design in the blank areas that are now puzzling modern scholars.<p><a id="Sinology" name="Sinology"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Sinology</span></h3>

      <p>Kircher had an early interest in <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, telling his superior in 1629 that he wished to become a <!--del_lnk--> missionary to the country. His <i>China Monumentis</i> (1667) was an encyclopedia of China, which combined accurate <!--del_lnk--> cartography with mythical elements, such as <!--del_lnk--> dragons. The work emphasised the Christian elements of Chinese history, both real and imagined: he noted the early presence of <!--del_lnk--> Nestorians, but also claimed that the Chinese were descended from the sons of <!--del_lnk--> Ham, that <a href="../../wp/c/Confucius.htm" title="Confucius">Confucius</a> was Hermes Trismegistus/Moses and that the <!--del_lnk--> Chinese characters were corrupted hieroglyphs. In his system, <!--del_lnk--> ideograms were inferior to hieroglyphs because they referred to specific ideas rather than to mysterious complexes of ideas, while the signs of the <!--del_lnk--> Maya and <a href="../../wp/a/Aztec.htm" title="Aztec">Aztecs</a> were yet lower <!--del_lnk--> pictograms which referred only to objects. <!--del_lnk--> Umberto Eco comments that this idea reflected and supported the European attitude to the Chinese and native American civilisations;<p>&quot;China was presented not as an unknown barbarian to be defeated but as a prodigal son who should return to the home of the common father&quot;.

      <p>On a visit to <!--del_lnk--> southern Italy in 1638, the ever-curious Kircher was lowered into the <a href="../../wp/v/Volcano.htm" title="Volcano">crater</a> of <!--del_lnk--> Vesuvius, then on the brink of eruption, in order to examine its interior. He was also intrigued by the subterranean rumbling which he heard at the <!--del_lnk--> Strait of Messina. His geological and geographical investigations culminated in his <i>Mundus Subterraneus</i> of 1664, in which he suggested that the <a href="../../wp/t/Tide.htm" title="Tide">tides</a> were caused by water moving to and from a subterranean <a href="../../wp/o/Ocean.htm" title="Ocean">ocean</a>.<p>Kircher was also puzzled by <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil.htm" title="Fossil">fossils</a>. He understood that some were the remains of <a href="../../wp/a/Animal.htm" title="Animal">animals</a> which had turned to stone, but ascribed others to human invention or to the spontaneous generative force of the <a href="../../wp/s/Soil.htm" title="Soil">earth</a>. Not all the objects which he was attempting to explain were in fact fossils, hence the diversity of explanations.<p><a id="Medicine" name="Medicine"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Medicine</span></h3>
      <p>Kircher took a notably modern approach to the study of <!--del_lnk--> diseases, as early as 1646 using a <a href="../../wp/m/Microscope.htm" title="Microscope">microscope</a> to investigate the <!--del_lnk--> blood of <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Death.htm" title="Black Death">plague</a> victims. In his <i>Scrutinium Pestis</i> of 1658, he noted the presence of &quot;little worms&quot; or &quot;<!--del_lnk--> animalcules&quot; in the blood, and concluded that the disease was caused by <!--del_lnk--> microorganisms. The conclusion was correct, although it is likely that what he saw were in fact <!--del_lnk--> red or <!--del_lnk--> white <!--del_lnk--> blood cells and not the plague agent, <!--del_lnk--> Yersinia pestis. He also proposed <!--del_lnk--> hygienic measures to prevent the spread of disease, such as isolation, <!--del_lnk--> quarantine, burning clothes worn by the infected and wearing <!--del_lnk--> facemasks to prevent the inhalation of <!--del_lnk--> germs.<p><a id="Display_of_screen_images" name="Display_of_screen_images"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Display of screen images</span></h3>
      <p>In 1646, Kircher published <i>Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae</i>, on the subject of the display of images on a screen using an apparatus similar to the <!--del_lnk--> magic lantern as developed by <!--del_lnk--> Christian Huygens and others. Kircher described the construction of a &quot;catotrophic lamp&quot; that used reflection to project images on the wall of a darkened room. Although Kircher did not invent the device, he made improvements over previous models, and suggested methods by which exhibitors could use his device. Much of the significance of his work arises from Kircher rational approach towards the demystification of projected images . Previously such images had been used in Europe to mimic supernatural (Kircher himself cites the use of displayed images by the rabbis in the court of <!--del_lnk--> King Solomon). Kircher stressed that exhibitors should take great care to inform spectators that such images were purely naturalistic, and not magical in origin.<p><a id="Other" name="Other"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other</span></h3>

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Kircher constructed a <a href="../../wp/m/Magnetism.htm" title="Magnetism">magnetic</a> clock, the mechanism of which he explained in his <i>Magnes</i> (1641). The device had originally been invented by another Jesuit, Fr. Francis Line, and was described by an acquaintance of Line&#39;s in 1634. Kircher&#39;s patron Peiresc had claimed that the clock&#39;s motion supported the <!--del_lnk--> Copernican cosmological model, the argument being that the magnetic sphere in the clock was caused to rotate by the magnetic force of the <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">sun</a>. Kircher&#39;s model disproved the theory, showing that the motion could be produced by a <!--del_lnk--> water clock in the base of the device.<p>Other machines designed by Kircher include an <!--del_lnk--> aeolian harp, <!--del_lnk--> automatons such as a statue which spoke and listened via a <!--del_lnk--> speaking tube, a <!--del_lnk--> perpetual motion machine, or a <!--del_lnk--> cat piano which would drive spikes into the tails of cats which yowled to specified <!--del_lnk--> pitches, although he is not known to have actually constructed the instrument. He wrote an early description of the <!--del_lnk--> magic lantern, and is therefore believed to have been its inventor.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The <i>Musurgia Universalis</i> (1650) sets out Kircher&#39;s views on <a href="../../wp/m/Music.htm" title="Music">music</a>: he believed that the <!--del_lnk--> harmony of music reflected the proportions of the <a href="../../wp/u/Universe.htm" title="Universe">universe</a>.

One illustration shows the differences between the <!--del_lnk--> ears of humans and other animals.<p>Kircher wrote against the <!--del_lnk--> Copernican model in his <i>Magnes</i> (supporting instead that of <a href="../../wp/t/Tycho_Brahe.htm" title="Tycho Brahe">Tycho Brahe</a>), but in his later <i>Itinerarium extaticum</i> (1656, revised 1671) he presented several systems, including the Copernican, as alternative possibilities. In <i>Polygraphia nova</i> (1663) he proposed an artificial <!--del_lnk--> universal language.<p>Kircher received a copy of the <!--del_lnk--> Voynich Manuscript in 1666; it was sent to him by <!--del_lnk--> Johannes Marcus Marci in the hope of his being able to decipher it. The manuscript remained in the Collegio Romano until <!--del_lnk--> Victor Emmanuel II of Italy annexed the <!--del_lnk--> papal states in 1870.<p>In 1675, Kircher published <i>Arca No&euml;</i>, the results of his research on the biblical <!--del_lnk--> Ark of Noah&mdash; following the <!--del_lnk--> Counter-Reformation, <!--del_lnk--> allegorical interpretation was giving way to the study of the Old Testament as literal truth among Scriptural scholars. Kircher analyzed the dimensions of the Ark; based on the number of species known to him (excluding insects and other forms thought to <!--del_lnk--> arise spontaneously), he calculated that overcrowding would not have been a problem. He also discussed the logistics of the Ark voyage, speculating on whether extra livestock was brought to feed carnivores and what the daily schedule of feeding and caring for animals must have been.<p><a id="Influence" name="Influence"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Influence</span></h2>
      <p>For most of his professional life, Kircher was one of the scientific stars of the world: according to historian Paula Findlen, he was &quot;the first scholar with a global reputation&quot;. His importance was twofold: to the results of his own <!--del_lnk--> experiments and research he added information gleaned from his correspondence with over 760 scientists, physicians and above all his fellow Jesuits in all parts of the globe. The <i><a href="../../wp/e/Encyclop%25C3%25A6dia_Britannica.htm" title="Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica">Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</a></i> calls him a &quot;one-man intellectual clearing house&quot;. His works, illustrated to his orders, were extremely popular, and he was the first scientist to be able to support himself through the sale of his books. Towards the end of his life his stock fell, as the <!--del_lnk--> rationalist <a href="../../wp/r/Ren%25C3%25A9_Descartes.htm" title="Ren&eacute; Descartes">Cartesian</a> approach began to dominate (Descartes himself described Kircher as &quot;more quacksalver than savant&quot;).<p>Thereafter, Kircher was largely neglected until the late 20th century. One writer attributes his rediscovery to the similarities between his eclectic approach and <!--del_lnk--> postmodernism: &quot;at the start of the 21st century Kircher&#39;s taste for <!--del_lnk--> trivia, deception and wonder is back&rdquo;; &quot;Kircher&#39;s postmodern qualities include his subversiveness, his <!--del_lnk--> celebrity, his <a href="../../wp/t/Technology.htm" title="Technology">technomania</a> and his bizarre <!--del_lnk--> eclecticism&quot; <!--del_lnk--> . Because Kircher&#39;s science is now out of date, and as few of his works have been translated, the recent emphasis has been on their <!--del_lnk--> aesthetic qualities rather than their actual content, and a succession of exhibitions have highlighted the beauty of their illustrations. Historian Anthony Grafton has said that &quot;the staggeringly strange dark continent of Kircher&#39;s work [is] the setting for a <a href="../../wp/j/Jorge_Luis_Borges.htm" title="Borges">Borges</a> story that was never written&quot;, while <!--del_lnk--> Umberto Eco has written about Kircher in his novel <i><!--del_lnk--> The Island of the Day Before</i>, as well as in his non-fiction works <i>The Search for the Perfect Language</i> and <i>Serendipities</i>.<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Texts</span></h2>
