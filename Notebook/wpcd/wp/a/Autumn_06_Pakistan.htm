<h2>Pakistan Earthquake</h2><p><strong>23/08/2006</strong></p>
<p>The &ldquo;search and rescue&rdquo; teams from SOS Children&rsquo;s Villages continue to locate and identify unaccompanied children. Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf recently said in an interview that &ldquo;SOS Children&rsquo;s Villages is the best custodian of our Kashmiri children&rdquo;.</p><img src="../../wp/2/22576_Pakistan.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="Grandmother and her grandchildren" class="left" /><p>Many children have been reunited with their families through the SOS reunification programme, and nearly 200 children are being cared for directly by SOS Children in emergency shelters or at our children&rsquo;s villages.</p><p>Over 1,000 tents were distributed to families made homeless by the earthquake. Children&rsquo;s powdered milk, rusks and mineral water were also distributed. Some warm clothing is being stored for next winter, and SOS Children is currently distributing the remaining tents to people affected by this year&rsquo;s monsoon.</p><p>Supporters in the UK have made great efforts to raise funds for children in Kashmir. There have been collections, bacon butty mornings, a Bollywood Bazaar,and of course our own appeal. We continue to work with the government of Pakistan to ensure that aid reaches those who need it most. Thank you.</p><img src="../../wp/s/SOS_Newsletter_img_198.jpg" width="327" height="143" alt="SOS Children volunteers distributing roofing materials" class="right" /><p><strong>Giving Hope</strong></p><p>Earlier this year, members of the Pakistani Supporters&rsquo; Group and staff from British Airways visited Pakistan to see what SOS Children was doing for children affected by the earthquake.</p><p>Thanks go to Giving Hope, an organisation set up by British Airways employees in response to the earthquake, for their generous support and donations to the SOS Earthquake Appeal. The money will be used to provide a new family home for children orphaned by the earthquake at the SOS Children&rsquo;s Village in Islamabad.</p><p><a href="../../wp/a/Autumn_2006_Newsletter_Contents.htm">Back to Autumn 2006 Newsletter Contents</a>.</p><p><strong>Relevant Countries:</strong> <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan_A.htm">Pakistan</a>.</p>
