      <p><b>Allegory in the Middle Ages</b> was a vital element in the <!--del_lnk--> synthesis of Biblical and Classical traditions into what would become recognizable as Medieval culture. People of the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> consciously drew from the cultural legacies of the ancient world in shaping their institutions and ideas, and so <!--del_lnk--> allegory in <a href="../../wp/m/Medieval_literature.htm" title="Medieval literature">Medieval literature</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Medieval art was a prime mover for the synthesis and transformational continuity between the ancient world and the &quot;new&quot; Christian world. People of the Middle Ages did not see the same break between themselves and their classical forbears that modern observers see; rather, they saw continuity with themselves and the ancient world, using allegory as a synthesizing agent, bringing together a whole image.<p>

</script><a id="Four_types_of_allegory" name="Four_types_of_allegory"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Four types of allegory</span></h2>
      <p>There were four categories of allegory used in the Middle Ages, which had originated with the Bible commentators of the early Christian era. The first is simply the <i><!--del_lnk--> literal</i> interpretation of the events of the story for historical purposes with no underlying meaning. The second is called <i><!--del_lnk--> typological</i>, which is connecting the events of the <!--del_lnk--> Old Testament with the <!--del_lnk--> New Testament; in particular drawing allegorical connections between the events of Christ&#39;s life with the stories of the Old Testament. The third is <i><!--del_lnk--> moral</i> (or <i><!--del_lnk--> tropological</i>), which is how one should act in the present, the &quot;moral of the story&quot;. The fourth type of allegory is <i><!--del_lnk--> anagogical</i>, dealing with the future events of Christian history, heaven, hell, the last judgment; it deals with prophecies.<p>Thus the four types of allegory deal with past events (literal), the connection of past events with the present (typology), present events (moral), and the future (anagogical).<p><a href="../../wp/d/Dante_Alighieri.htm" title="Dante">Dante</a> describes the four meanings, or senses, of allegory in his <!--del_lnk--> epistle to <!--del_lnk--> Can Grande della Scala. He says the allegories of his work are not simple, but:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

        <td>Rather, it may be called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> polysemous&quot;, that is, of many senses [allegories]. A first sense derives from the letters themselves, and a second from the things signified by the letters. We call the first sense &quot;literal&quot; sense, the second the &quot;allegorical&quot;, or &quot;moral&quot; or &quot;anagogical&quot;. To clarify this method of treatment, consider this verse: <i>When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a barbarous people: Judea was made his sanctuary, Israel his dominion</i> (Psalm 113). Now if we examine the letters alone, the exodus of the children of Israel from Egypt in the time of Moses is signified; in the allegory, our redemption accomplished through Christ; in the moral sense, the conversion of the soul from the grief and misery of sin to the state of grace; in the anagogical sense, the exodus of the holy soul from slavery of this corruption to the freedom of eternal glory.. they can all be called allegorical.</td>

      <p>Medieval allegory began as a Christian method for synthesizing the discrepancies between the Old Testament and the New Testament. While both testaments were studied and seen as equally divinely inspired by <a href="../../wp/g/God.htm" title="God">God</a>, the Old Testament contained discontinuities for Christians -- for example the Jewish <!--del_lnk--> kosher laws. The Old Testament was therefore seen in relation to how it would predict the events of the New Testament, in particular how the events of the Old Testament related to the events of Christs life. The events of the Old Testament were seen as part of the story, with the events of Christ&#39;s life bringing these stories to a full conclusion. The technical name for seeing the New Testament in the Old is called <i><!--del_lnk--> typology</i>.<div class="thumb tleft">
       <div style="width:252px;"><a class="internal" href="../../images/164/16460.jpg.htm" title="Christ rises from the tomb, alongside Jonah spit onto the beach, a typological allegory."><img alt="Christ rises from the tomb, alongside Jonah spit onto the beach, a typological allegory." height="119" longdesc="/wiki/Image:Biblia.pauperum.jpg" src="../../images/164/16460.jpg" width="250" /></a><div class="thumbcaption">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>One example of typology is the story of <!--del_lnk--> Jonah and the whale from the Old Testament. Medieval allegorical interpretation of this story is that it prefigures Christ&#39;s burial, with the stomach of the whale as Christ&#39;s tomb. Jonah was eventually freed from the whale after three days, so did Christ rise from his tomb after three days. Thus, whenever one finds an allusion to Jonah in Medieval art or literature, it is usually an allegory for the burial and resurrection of Christ. Another common typological allegory is with the four major Old testament prophets <!--del_lnk--> Isaiah, <!--del_lnk--> Jeremiah, <!--del_lnk--> Ezekiel, and <!--del_lnk--> Daniel. These four prophets prefigure the four Apostles <!--del_lnk--> Matthew, <!--del_lnk--> Mark, <!--del_lnk--> Luke, <!--del_lnk--> John. There was no end to the number of analogies that commentators could find between stories of the Old Testament and the New.<p>There also existed a tradition in the Middle Ages of <i><!--del_lnk--> mythography</i> -- the allegorical interpretation of pagan myths. <a href="../../wp/v/Virgil.htm" title="Virgil">Virgil</a>&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Aeneid</i> and <!--del_lnk--> Ovid&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Metamorphoses</i> were standard textbooks throughout the Middle Ages, and each had a long tradition of allegorical interpretation. An illustrative example can be found in <!--del_lnk--> Sienna in a painting of a Christs crucifix (<i>Sano di Pietro&#39;s Crucifix</i>, 15th c). At the top of the cross can be seen a bird pecking its own breast, blood pouring forth from the wound and feeding its waiting chicks below. This is the <!--del_lnk--> pelican whose &quot;story&quot; was told by Roman naturalist <!--del_lnk--> Pliny the Elder. Thus by analogy to a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> pagan&quot; source, Christ feeds his own children with his own blood.<p>Allegory was even seen in the natural world, as animals, plants, and even non-living things were interpreted in books called <!--del_lnk--> bestiaries as symbols of Biblical figures and morals. For example, in one bestiary <!--del_lnk--> stags are compared to people devoted to the Church, because (according to medieval zoology) they leave their pastures for other (heavenly) pastures, and when they come to broad rivers (sin) they form in line and each rests its head on the haunches of the next (supporting each other by example and good works), speeding across the waters together.<p><a id="History_of_allegory" name="History_of_allegory"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History of allegory</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Late_Antiquity" name="Late_Antiquity"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Late Antiquity</span></h3>
      <p>Before the 5th century the traditions of allegorical interpretations were created in a time when rhetorical training was common, when the classics of mythology were still standard teaching texts, when the Greek and Roman pantheon of Gods were still visible forms (if not always fully recognized by the more learned populace), and when the new religions such as Christianity adopted or rejected pagan elements by way of allegoresis (the study and interpretation of allegory).<p>It was in this period that the first pure, freestanding allegorical work was written in about 400 AD by <!--del_lnk--> Prudentius called <i><!--del_lnk--> Psychomachia</i> (&quot;Soul-War&quot;). The plot consists of the personified &quot;good&quot; virtues of Hope, Sobriety, Chastity, Humility, etc. fighting the personified &quot;evil&quot; vices of Pride, Wrath, Paganism, Avarice, etc. The personifications are women, because in Latin words for abstract concepts are in the feminine gender; an uninformed reader of the work might take the story literally as a tale of many angry women fighting one another, because as the first &quot;pure&quot; allegory Prudentius provides no context or explanation of the allegory.<p>In this same period of the early 5th century three other authors of importance to the history of allegory emerged: <!--del_lnk--> Claudian, <!--del_lnk--> Macrobius and <!--del_lnk--> Martianus Capella. Little is known of these authors, even if they were truly Christian or not, but we do know they handed down the inclination to express learned material in allegorical form, mainly through personification, which later became a standard part of medieval schooling methods.<p>Claudian&#39;s first work <i>In Rufinum</i> was an attack against the ruthless <!--del_lnk--> Rufinus and would become a model for the 12th century <i><!--del_lnk--> Anticlaudianus</i>, a well known allegory for how to be an upstanding man. As well his <i>Rape of Prosperpine</i> was a litany of mythological allegories, personifications, and cosmological allegories. Macrobius wrote <i>Commentary of the Dream of Scipio</i> providing the Middle Ages with the tradition of a favorite topic, the allegorical treatment of dreams. Lastly Martianus wrote <i>Marriage of Philology and Mercury</i>, the title referring to the allegorical union of intelligent learning with the love of letters. It contained short treatises on the &quot;seven liberal arts&quot; (grammar, rhetoric, dialectic, geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, music) and thus became a standard textbook, greatly influencing educators and students throughout the Middle Ages.<p>Lastly, perhaps the most influential author of <!--del_lnk--> Late Antiquity was <!--del_lnk--> Boethius, in whose work <i><a href="../../wp/c/Consolation_of_Philosophy.htm" title="Consolation of Philosophy">Consolation of Philosophy</a></i> we are first introduced to the personified Lady Philosophy, the source of innumerable later such personified figures (Lady Luck, etc..)<p><a id="Early_Middle_Ages" name="Early_Middle_Ages"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early Middle Ages</span></h3>
      <p>After Boethius there exists no known work of allegory literature until the 12th century, and although allegorical thinking and elements and artwork abound during this period, not until the rise of the Medieval university in the High Middle Ages does sustained allegorical literature appear again.<p><a id="High_and_Late_Middle_Ages" name="High_and_Late_Middle_Ages"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">High and Late Middle Ages</span></h3>
      <p>The earliest works were by <!--del_lnk--> Bernard Silvestris (<i>Cosmographia</i>, 1147), and <!--del_lnk--> Alanus ab Insulis (<i>Plaint of Nature</i>, 1170, and <i>Anticlaudianus</i>) who pioneered the use of allegory (mainly personification) for the use of abstract speculation on metaphysics and scientific questions.<p>The High and Late Middle Ages saw many allegorical works and techniques. There were four &quot;great&quot; works from this period.<ul>
       <li><b>The Four Great Medieval Allegories</b><ul>
         <li><i><!--del_lnk--> Le Roman de la Rose</i>. A major allegorical work, it had many lasting influences on western literature, creating entire new genres and development of vernacular languages.<li><i><!--del_lnk--> The Divine Comedy</i>. Probably the greatest medieval work of literature, and the greatest work of allegory ever written.<li><i><!--del_lnk--> Piers Plowman</i>. An encyclopedic array of allegorical devices. Dream-vision; pilgrimage; personification; satire; typological story structure (the dreamer&#39;s progress mirrors the progress of biblical history from the Fall of Adam to Apocalypse).<li><i><!--del_lnk--> Pearl</i>. A plot based on an <!--del_lnk--> anagogical allegory; a dreamer is introduced to heavenly Jerusalem. Focus on the meaning of death. A religious response to <i>Consolation of Philosophy</i>.</ul>
