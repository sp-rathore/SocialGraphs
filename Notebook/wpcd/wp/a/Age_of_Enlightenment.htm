      <p>The <i><b>Age of Enlightenment</b></i> refers to either the <!--del_lnk--> eighteenth century in <!--del_lnk--> European philosophy, or the longer period including the seventeenth century and the <!--del_lnk--> Age of Reason. It can more narrowly refer to the historical intellectual movement <i>The Enlightenment</i>, which advocated <!--del_lnk--> Reason as a means to establishing an authoritative system of <a href="../../wp/a/Aesthetics.htm" title="Aesthetics">aesthetics</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Ethics.htm" title="Ethics">ethics</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Government.htm" title="Government">government</a>, and <a href="../../wp/l/Logic.htm" title="Logic">logic</a>, which would allow human beings to obtain objective truth about the universe. Emboldened by the revolution in <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physics</a> commenced by <a href="../../wp/i/Isaac_Newton.htm" title="Isaac Newton">Newtonian</a> <!--del_lnk--> kinematics, Enlightenment thinkers argued that same kind of systematic thinking could apply to all forms of human activity.<p>The intellectual leaders regarded themselves as a courageous elite who would lead the world into progress from a long period of doubtful <!--del_lnk--> tradition, irrationality, superstition, and tyranny, which they imputed to the <i><a href="../../wp/d/Dark_Ages.htm" title="Dark Ages">Dark Ages</a></i>. The movement helped create the intellectual framework for the <!--del_lnk--> American and <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French Revolutions</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Latin American independence movement, and the <!--del_lnk--> Polish Constitution of May 3; and led to the rise of classical <a href="../../wp/l/Liberalism.htm" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Capitalism.htm" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a>. It is matched with the high <a href="../../wp/b/Baroque.htm" title="Baroque">baroque</a> and classical eras in music, and the <!--del_lnk--> neo-classical period in the arts; it receives contemporary attention as being one of the central models for many movements in the <!--del_lnk--> modern period.<p>The enlightenment was mirrored by the Jewish <!--del_lnk--> Haskalah, which in Western Europe and particularly in Germany resulted in the elevation and eventual replacement of <!--del_lnk--> Yiddish by <!--del_lnk--> Hebrew, as well as the Jewish reform and Zionist Nationalist movements.<p>

      <p>Another important movement in 18th century philosophy, closely related to it, focused on belief and piety. Some of its proponents, such as <!--del_lnk--> George Berkeley, attempted to demonstrate rationally the existence of a supreme being. Piety and belief in this period were integral to the exploration of <!--del_lnk--> natural philosophy and <a href="../../wp/e/Ethics.htm" title="Ethics">ethics</a>, in addition to <a href="../../wp/p/Politics.htm" title="Politics">political</a> theories of the age. However, prominent Enlightenment philosophers such as <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Paine, <a href="../../wp/v/Voltaire.htm" title="Voltaire">Voltaire</a>, <a href="../../wp/j/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau.htm" title="Jean-Jacques Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>, and <a href="../../wp/d/David_Hume.htm" title="David Hume">David Hume</a> questioned and attacked the existing institutions of both <!--del_lnk--> Church and <!--del_lnk--> State.<p>The 19th century also saw a continued rise of <a href="../../wp/e/Empiricism.htm" title="Empiricism">empirical</a> philosophical ideas and their application to <a href="../../wp/p/Political_economy.htm" title="Political economy">political economy</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Government.htm" title="Government">government</a> and sciences such as <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physics</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Chemistry.htm" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Biology.htm" title="Biology">biology</a>.<p>The Enlightenment (if thought of as a short period) was preceded by the <!--del_lnk--> Age of Reason or (if thought of as a long period) by the <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Reformation. It was followed by <a href="../../wp/r/Romanticism.htm" title="Romanticism">Romanticism</a>.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The boundaries of the Enlightenment cover much of the seventeenth century as well, though others term the previous era &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The Age of Reason.&quot; For the present purposes, these two eras are <!--del_lnk--> split; however, it is equally acceptable to think of them conjoined as one long period.<p>Europe had been ravaged by religious wars; when peace in the political situation had been restored, after the <!--del_lnk--> Peace of Westphalia and the <!--del_lnk--> English Civil War, an intellectual upheaval overturned the accepted belief that mysticism and revelation are the primary sources of knowledge and wisdom&mdash;which was blamed for fomenting political instability. Instead, (according to those that split the two periods), the Age of Reason sought to establish axiomatic philosophy and absolutism as foundations for knowledge and stability. Epistemology, in the writings of <!--del_lnk--> Michel de Montaigne and <a href="../../wp/r/Ren%25C3%25A9_Descartes.htm" title="Ren&eacute; Descartes">Ren&eacute; Descartes</a>, was based on extreme skepticism and inquiry into the nature of &quot;knowledge.&quot; The goal of a philosophy based on self-evident axioms reached its height with <a href="../../wp/b/Baruch_Spinoza.htm" title="Baruch Spinoza">Baruch (Benedictus de) Spinoza</a>&#39;s Ethics, which expounded a pantheistic view of the universe where God and Nature were one. This idea then became central to the Enlightenment from Newton through to Jefferson. The ideas of <a href="../../wp/b/Blaise_Pascal.htm" title="Blaise Pascal">Pascal</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Gottfried_Leibniz.htm" title="Gottfried Leibniz">Leibniz</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Galileo_Galilei.htm" title="Galileo Galilei">Galileo</a> and other philosophers of the previous period also contributed to and greatly influenced the Enlightenment; for instance, according to E. Cassirer, Leibniz&rsquo;s treatise On Wisdom &quot;. . . identified the central concept of the Enlightenment and sketched its theoretical programme&quot; (Cassirer 1979: 121&ndash;123). There was a wave of change across European thinking, exemplified by Newton&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> natural philosophy, which combined mathematics of <!--del_lnk--> axiomatic proof with mechanics of physical observation, a coherent system of verifiable predictions, which set the tone for what followed Newton&#39;s <i><a href="../../wp/p/Philosophiae_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica.htm" title="Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica">Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</a></i> in the century after.<p>The Age of Enlightenment is also prominent in the history of Judaism, perhaps because of its conjunction with increased social acceptance of Jews in some western European states, especially those who were not orthodox or who converted to the officially sanctioned version of Christianity.<p><a id="Key_conflicts_within_Enlightenment-period_philosophy" name="Key_conflicts_within_Enlightenment-period_philosophy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Key conflicts within Enlightenment-period philosophy</span></h2>
      <p>As with theology, philosophy became a source of partisan debate, with different schools attempting to develop rationales for their viewpoints, which then, in turn, became generally accepted. Thus philosophers such as <!--del_lnk--> Spinoza searched for a metaphysics of ethics. This trend later influenced <!--del_lnk--> pietism and eventually <!--del_lnk--> transcendental searches such as those by <a href="../../wp/i/Immanuel_Kant.htm" title="Immanuel Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>.<p>Religion was linked to another concept which inspired a great amount of Enlightenment thought, namely the rise of the <!--del_lnk--> Nation-state. In medieval and Renaissance periods, the state was restricted by the need to work through a host of intermediaries. This system existed because of poor communication, where localism thrived in return for loyalty to some central organization. With the improvements in transportation, organization, navigation and finally the influx of gold and silver from trade and conquest, however, the state assumed more and more authority and power. Intellectuals responded with a series of theories on the purpose of, and limits of state power. Therefore, during The Enlightenment <!--del_lnk--> absolutism was cemented and a string of philosophers reacted by advocating limitation, from <a href="../../wp/j/John_Locke.htm" title="John Locke">John Locke</a> forward, who influenced both <a href="../../wp/v/Voltaire.htm" title="Voltaire">Voltaire</a> and <a href="../../wp/j/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau.htm" title="Jean-Jacques Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>. Enlightenment ideas influenced organisations seeking to effect state and social development, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Freemasons and <!--del_lnk--> Illuminati. And they ultimately had a profound effect on the actions of politically active individuals worldwide.<p>Within the period of the Enlightenment, these issues began to be explored in the question of what constituted the proper relationship of the citizen to the monarch or the state. The idea that <!--del_lnk--> society is a contract between individual and some larger entity, whether society or state, continued to grow throughout this period. A series of philosophers, including <!--del_lnk--> Rousseau, <!--del_lnk--> Montesquieu, <a href="../../wp/d/David_Hume.htm" title="David Hume">Hume</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Jefferson.htm" title="Thomas Jefferson">Jefferson</a> advocated this idea. Furthermore, thinkers of this age advocated the idea that nationality had a basis beyond mere preference. Philosophers such as <!--del_lnk--> Johann Gottfried von Herder reasserted the idea from Greek antiquity that <a href="../../wp/l/Language.htm" title="Language">language</a> had a decisive influence on cognition and thought, and that the meaning of a particular book or text was open to deeper exploration based on deeper connections, an idea now called <!--del_lnk--> hermeneutics. The original focus of his scholarship was to delve into the meaning in the <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">Bible</a> and in order to gain a deeper understanding of it. These two concepts - of the contractual nature between the state and the citizen, and the reality of the nation beyond that contract, had a decisive influence in the development of <a href="../../wp/l/Liberalism.htm" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a>, <a href="../../wp/d/Democracy.htm" title="Democracy">democracy</a> and constitutional government which followed.<p>At the same time, the integration of <a href="../../wp/a/Algebra.htm" title="Algebra">algebraic thinking</a>, acquired from the Islamic world over the previous two centuries, and <a href="../../wp/g/Geometry.htm" title="Geometry">geometric thinking</a> which had dominated Western mathematics and philosophy since at least <!--del_lnk--> Eudoxus, precipitated a scientific and mathematical revolution. Sir Isaac Newton&#39;s greatest claim to prominence came from a systematic application of algebra to geometry, and synthesizing a workable <a href="../../wp/c/Calculus.htm" title="Calculus">calculus</a> which was applicable to scientific problems. The Enlightenment was a time when the solar system was truly discovered: with the accurate calculation of orbits, such as <!--del_lnk--> Halley&#39;s comet, the discovery of the first planet since antiquity, <!--del_lnk--> Uranus by <!--del_lnk--> William Herschel, and the calculation of the mass of the Sun using Newton&#39;s theory of universal gravitation. These series of discoveries had a momentous effect on both pragmatic commerce and philosophy. The excitement engendered by creating a new and orderly vision of the world, as well as the need for a philosophy of science which could encompass the new discoveries, greatly influenced both religious and secular ideas. If Newton could order the cosmos with natural philosophy, so, many argued, could political philosophy order the body politic.<p>Within the Enlightenment, two main theories contended to be the basis of that ordering: divine right and natural law. It might seem that divine right would yield absolutist ideas, and that natural law would lead to theories of liberty. The writing of <!--del_lnk--> Jacques-Benigne Bossuet (1627-1704) set the paradigm for the divine right: that the universe was ordered by a reasonable God, and therefore his representative on earth had the powers of that God. The orderliness of the cosmos was seen as proof of God; therefore it was a proof of the power of monarchy. Natural law, began, not as a reaction against divinity, but instead, as an abstraction: God did not rule arbitrarily, but through natural laws that he enacted on earth. <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Hobbes.htm" title="Thomas Hobbes">Thomas Hobbes</a>, though an absolutist in government, drew this argument in <i><!--del_lnk--> Leviathan</i>. Once the concept of natural law was invoked, however, it took on a life of its own. If natural law could be used to bolster the position of the monarchy, it could also be used to assert the rights of subjects of that monarch, that if there were natural laws, then there were <!--del_lnk--> natural rights associated with them, just as there are rights under man-made laws.<p>What both theories had in common was the need for an orderly and comprehensible function of government. The &quot;Enlightened Despotism&quot; of, for example, <!--del_lnk--> Catherine the Great of Russia and <!--del_lnk--> Frederick the Great of Prussia (a state within The Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation), is not based on mystical appeals to authority, but on the pragmatic invocation of state power as necessary to hold back chaotic and anarchic warfare and rebellion. Frederick the Great was raised by his French governess, importing the Enlightenment to &quot;Germany.&quot; Regularization and standardization were seen as good things because they allowed the state to reach its power outwards over the entirety of its domain and because they liberated people from being entangled in endless local custom. Additionally, they expanded the sphere of economic and social activity.<p>Thus rationalization, standardization and the search for fundamental unities occupied much of the Enlightenment and its arguments over proper methodology and nature of understanding. The culminating efforts of the Enlightenment: for example the economics of <a href="../../wp/a/Adam_Smith.htm" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a>, the physical chemistry of <a href="../../wp/a/Antoine_Lavoisier.htm" title="Antoine Lavoisier">Antoine Lavoisier</a>, the idea of evolution pursued by <a href="../../wp/j/Johann_Wolfgang_Goethe.htm" title="Johann Wolfgang Goethe">Johann Wolfgang Goethe</a>, the declaration by Jefferson of inalienable rights, in the end overshadowed the idea of divine right and direct alteration of the world by the hand of God. It was also the basis for overthrowing the idea of a completely rational and comprehensible universe, and led, in turn, to the metaphysics of Hegel and <a href="../../wp/r/Romanticism.htm" title="Romanticism">Romanticism</a>.<p><a id="Role_of_the_Enlightenment_in_later_philosophy" name="Role_of_the_Enlightenment_in_later_philosophy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Role of the Enlightenment in later philosophy</span></h2>
      <p>The Enlightenment occupies a central role in the justification for the movement known as <!--del_lnk--> modernism. The neo-classicizing trend in modernism came to see itself as being a period of rationality which was overturning foolishly established traditions, and therefore analogized itself to the Encyclopediasts and other philosophes. A variety of 20th century movements, including <a href="../../wp/l/Liberalism.htm" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a> and <!--del_lnk--> neo-classicism traced their intellectual heritage back to the Enlightenment, and away from the purported emotionalism of the 19th century. Geometric order, rigor and reductionism were seen as virtues of the Enlightenment. The modern movement points to <!--del_lnk--> reductionism and <!--del_lnk--> rationality as crucial aspects of Enlightenment thinking of which it is the inheritor, as opposed to irrationality and emotionalism. In this view, the Enlightenment represents the basis for modern ideas of <a href="../../wp/l/Liberalism.htm" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a> against <!--del_lnk--> superstition and <!--del_lnk--> intolerance. Influential philosophers who have held this view are <!--del_lnk--> J&uuml;rgen Habermas and <!--del_lnk--> Isaiah Berlin.<p>This view asserts that the Enlightenment was the point where Europe broke through what historian Peter Gay calls &quot;the sacred circle,&quot; where previous dogma circumscribed thinking. The Enlightenment is held, in this view, to be the source of critical ideas, such as the centrality of <!--del_lnk--> freedom, <a href="../../wp/d/Democracy.htm" title="Democracy">democracy</a> and <!--del_lnk--> reason as being the primary values of a society. This view argues that the establishment of a contractual basis of rights would lead to the market mechanism and <a href="../../wp/c/Capitalism.htm" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> scientific method, religious and racial <!--del_lnk--> tolerance, and the organization of states into self-governing republics through democratic means. In this view, the tendency of the <!--del_lnk--> philosophes in particular to apply rationality to every problem is considered to be the essential change. From this point on, thinkers and writers were held to be free to pursue the truth in whatever form, without the threat of sanction for violating established ideas.<p>With the end of the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">Second World War</a> and the rise of <!--del_lnk--> post-modernity, these same features came to be regarded as liabilities - excessive specialization, failure to heed traditional wisdom or provide for unintended consequences, and the romanticization of Enlightenment figures - such as the <!--del_lnk--> Founding Fathers of the United States, prompted a backlash against both Science and Enlightenment based dogma in general. Philosophers such as <!--del_lnk--> Michel Foucault are often understood as arguing that the age of reason had to construct a vision of unreason as being demonic and subhuman, and therefore evil and befouling, whence by analogy to argue that rationalism in the modern period is, likewise, a construction. In their book, <i><!--del_lnk--> Dialectic of Enlightenment</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Max Horkheimer and <!--del_lnk--> Theodor Adorno wrote a penetrating critique of what they perceived as the contradictions of Enlightenment thought: Enlightenment was seen as being at once liberatory and, through the domination of <!--del_lnk--> instrumental rationality tending towards totalitarianism.<p>Alternatively, the Enlightenment was used as a powerful symbol to argue for the supremacy of rationalism and rationalization, and therefore any attack on it was connected to despotism and madness, for example in the writings of <!--del_lnk--> Gertrude Himmelfarb.<p>
