As of August 1, 2006, the population of the city proper is 741,329; the population of the official Greater Amsterdam area is approximately 1.5 million, but the real agglomeration is estimated at 2 to 2,5 million. Amsterdam is also one of the core urban centres of the greater metropolitan area called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Randstad&quot; (Ring City) which encompasses other Dutch cities such as <!--del_lnk--> Haarlem, <!--del_lnk--> Utrecht, <!--del_lnk--> Leiden, <a href="../../wp/t/The_Hague.htm" title="The Hague">The Hague</a> and <a href="../../wp/r/Rotterdam.htm" title="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a> and has a population of over 7.5 million.<p>Amsterdam has one of the largest historic city centres in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>, dating largely from the 17th century. At this time, a series of concentric, semi-circular <a href="../../wp/c/Canal.htm" title="Canal">canals</a> (&quot;grachten&quot;) were dug around the old city centre. Along the canals houses and warehouses were built. The canals still define Amsterdam&#39;s layout and appearance today. Many fine houses and mansions are situated along the canals. Some of the narrow brick houses are gradually sinking because they are built on wooden <!--del_lnk--> piles to cope with the marshy subsoil.<p>Although Amsterdam is officially designated as the capital of the Netherlands, it has never been (save a brief period between <!--del_lnk--> 1808 and <!--del_lnk--> 1810), the seat of the court, government, or parliament of the Netherlands, which are all located at <a href="../../wp/t/The_Hague.htm" title="The Hague">The Hague</a>.

      <p>Amsterdam began as a fishing village in the in the late 12th century. According to legend Amsterdam was founded by two <!--del_lnk--> Frisian fishermen, who landed on the shores of the Amstel in a small boat with their dog. The damming of the river <!--del_lnk--> Amstel gave it its name (in Dutch: Amstelredam &quot;Dam in the Amstel&quot;, turned into Amsterdam in the course of time). The traditional founding of the city of Amsterdam is October 27, 1275, when the inhabitants living around the Amstel dam were granted freedom from paying the <!--del_lnk--> tolls associated with the <!--del_lnk--> locks and bridges of Holland. It was given <!--del_lnk--> city rights in <!--del_lnk--> 1300 or <!--del_lnk--> 1301. From the <a href="../../wp/1/14th_century.htm" title="14th century">14th century</a> on, Amsterdam flourished, largely on the basis of trade with the cities of the <!--del_lnk--> Hanseatic League.<p>In the <a href="../../wp/1/16th_century.htm" title="16th century">16th century</a> the Dutch rebelled against <a href="../../wp/p/Philip_II_of_Spain.htm" title="Philip II of Spain">Philip II of Spain</a> and his successors. The revolt escalated into the <!--del_lnk--> Eighty Years&#39; War which ultimately led to Dutch independence. After the break with Spain the Dutch Republic became known for its relative religious tolerance. <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jew">Jews</a> from <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>, prosperous merchants from <a href="../../wp/a/Antwerp.htm" title="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> (economic and religious refugees from the part of the Low Countries still controlled by Spain), <!--del_lnk--> Huguenots from <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> (persecuted for their religion) sought safety in Amsterdam.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The <a href="../../wp/1/17th_century.htm" title="17th century">17th century</a> is considered Amsterdam&#39;s &quot;Golden Age&quot;. In the early 17th century Amsterdam became one of the wealthiest cities in the world. Ships sailed from Amsterdam to the Baltic Sea, <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a> and present-day <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> and formed the basis of a worldwide trading network. Amsterdam&#39;s merchants had the biggest share in the <!--del_lnk--> VOC and <!--del_lnk--> WIC. These companies acquired the overseas possessions which formed the seeds of the later Dutch colonies. Amsterdam was the most important point for the trans-shipment of goods in Europe and it was the leading financial centre of the world. Amsterdam&#39;s stock exchange was the first to trade continuously.<p>The population grew from slightly over 10,000 around 1500 to 30,000 around 1570, 60,000 around 1600, 105,000 in 1622 and almost 200,000 around 1700 (a twenty fold increase in 200 years). Thereafter, the population did not change much for another century and a half. During the century before <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> it almost quadrupled to 800,000, but then remained fairly constant again to this day.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The 18th and early 19th centuries saw a decline in Amsterdam&#39;s prosperity. The wars of the Dutch Republic with the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> took their toll on Amsterdam. During the <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleonic_Wars.htm" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> Amsterdam&#39;s fortunes reached their lowest point. However, with the establishment of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in <!--del_lnk--> 1815, things slowly began to improve. In Amsterdam new developments were started by people like <!--del_lnk--> Samuel Sarphati who found their inspiration in Paris.<p>The end of the 19th century is sometimes called Amsterdam&#39;s second Golden Age. New museums, a train station, and the Concertgebouw were built. At this time the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> reached Amsterdam. The <i><!--del_lnk--> Amsterdam-Rhine Canal</i> was dug to give Amsterdam a direct connection to the <a href="../../wp/r/Rhine.htm" title="Rhine">Rhine</a> and the <i><!--del_lnk--> North Sea Canal</i> to give the port a shorter connection to the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea.htm" title="North Sea">North Sea</a>. Both projects improved communication with the rest of Europe and the world dramatically. <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Conrad gives a brief description of Amsterdam, seen from the sea at this period, in <!--del_lnk--> <i>The Mirror of the Sea</i> (1906).<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Shortly before the <!--del_lnk--> First World War the city began expanding and new suburbs were built. During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, the Netherlands remained neutral. Amsterdam suffered a food shortage and heating fuel became scarce. The shortages sparked riots in which several people were killed.<p>Germany invaded the Netherlands on <!--del_lnk--> 10 May <!--del_lnk--> 1940, taking control of the country after five days of fighting. The Germans installed a Nazi civilian government in Amsterdam that cooperated in the persecution of Jews. However, a minority of people in Amsterdam helped the Jews in hiding and suffered persecution themselves in doing so. More than 103, 000 to 105,000 <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jew">Jews</a> were deported from the Netherlands to concentration camps, of whom perhaps the most famous was a young German girl, <a href="../../wp/a/Anne_Frank.htm" title="Anne Frank">Anne Frank</a>. Only 5,000 Dutch Jews survived the war. In the last months of the war, communication with the rest of the country broke down and food and fuel became scarce. Many inhabitants of the city had to travel to the countryside to collect food. Dogs, cats and raw sugar beets were consumed to stay alive. Most of the trees in Amsterdam were cut down for fuel and all the wood of the apartments from the Jewish people who were deported.<p><a id="Coat_of_arms" name="Coat_of_arms"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Coat of arms</span></h2>

      <p>The coat of arms of Amsterdam is composed of three <!--del_lnk--> St Andrew&#39;s crosses, aligned vertically. Historians believe they represent the three dangers which have traditionally plagued the city: flood, fire, and pestilence. The city&#39;s official motto, <i>Heldhaftig, Vastberaden, Barmhartig</i> (&quot;Valiant, Resolute, Merciful&quot;) which is displayed on the coat of arms, was bestowed on it by <!--del_lnk--> Queen Wilhelmina in 1947 in recognition of the city&#39;s bravery during World War II. The lions were added in the sixteenth century.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Crown of Austria was awarded to the city in 1489 by <!--del_lnk--> Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, out of gratitude for services and loans. The crown was a sign of imperial protection and acted as a seal of approval for Amsterdam merchants abroad. The Westertoren also features the imperial crown.<p><a id="City_government" name="City_government"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">City government</span></h2>

      <p>As all Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is governed by a <!--del_lnk--> mayor, his <!--del_lnk--> aldermen, and the <!--del_lnk--> municipal council. However, unlike most other Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is subdivided into fifteen <i>stadsdelen</i> (boroughs), a system that was implemented in the 1980s to improve local governance. The <i>stadsdelen</i> are responsible for many activities that previously had been run by the central city. Fourteen of these have their own council, chosen by a popular election. The fifteenth, Westpoort, covers the harbour of Amsterdam, has very few inhabitants, and is governed by the central municipal council. Local decisions are made at borough level, and only affairs pertaining to the whole city, such as major infrastructure projects, are handled by the central city council. <i>See also:</i> <!--del_lnk--> List of mayors of Amsterdam<p><a id="Tourist_attractions" name="Tourist_attractions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Tourist attractions</span></h2>

The <!--del_lnk--> Van Gogh Museum houses the largest collection of Van Gogh&#39;s paintings and drawings in the world. <!--del_lnk--> Anne Frank House is also a popular tourist attraction.<p>Amsterdam is also famous for its <!--del_lnk--> red-light district, <i><!--del_lnk--> de Wallen</i>. Prostitution is legal in the Netherlands at specific places. The red-light district is located in the centre of the city along major canals and is clearly marked on maps. However, this is not unique to Amsterdam as other Dutch cities such as <!--del_lnk--> Utrecht, <a href="../../wp/t/The_Hague.htm" title="The Hague">The Hague</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Leeuwarden, <!--del_lnk--> Haarlem and <!--del_lnk--> Groningen also have &quot;Hoerenbuurten&quot; (&quot;Hooker areas&quot;).<p>Centred around the Wallen, but also elsewhere in the city, <!--del_lnk--> coffee shops sell <!--del_lnk--> cannabis. This is not completely legal but is tolerated when small quantities of the drug (up to 5 grammes) are involved. There is also a festival held annually known as the Cannabis Cup. The event centers around high grade cannabis, mainly high quality marijuana grown under lights in Holland. Patrons of the festival can sample any of the various and numerous strains presented at the cup. At the end of the festival one of the strains presented is named the Cannabis Cup winner. Usually the cup winning strain becomes very sought after and well known.<p><a id="Nightlife" name="Nightlife"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Nightlife</span></h2>

      <p>Amsterdam enjoys a moderate temperate climate, with the weather patterns being strongly influenced by Amsterdam&#39;s proximity to the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the prevailing westerly winds. Winters are mild and average above freezing, although frosts are not uncommon during periods of easterly or northeasterly winds that blow from the interior of the continent. Summers are warm but seldom hot. Although days with measurable precipitation are common, Amsterdam averages less than 760 mm of precipitation annually. Most of the rain falls as protracted drizzle or light rain. Cloudy and damp days are common, particularly in the cooler months.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>
      <p>Amsterdam is the financial/business capital of the Netherlands and repeatedly chosen the fifth most important city in Europe to do business after London, Frankfurt, Paris and Brussels, but has reacently moved to a sixth place just behind Barcelona (Cushman and Wakefield).
