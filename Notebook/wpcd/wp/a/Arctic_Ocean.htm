      <p>The <b>Arctic Ocean</b>, located mostly in the <a href="../../wp/a/Arctic.htm" title="Arctic">Arctic</a> <!--del_lnk--> north polar region, is the smallest of the world&#39;s five <a href="../../wp/o/Ocean.htm" title="Ocean">oceans</a> and the shallowest. Even though the <!--del_lnk--> International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, <a href="../../wp/o/Oceanography.htm" title="Oceanography">oceanographers</a> may call it <i>the Arctic Mediterranean Sea</i> or simply <i>the Arctic Sea</i>, classifying it as one of the <!--del_lnk--> mediterranean seas of the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>.<p>Much of the ocean is covered by <!--del_lnk--> sea ice, either during the colder months or year-round. Little marine life exists where the ocean surface is covered with ice throughout the year. The Arctic Ocean&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> temperature and <!--del_lnk--> salinity vary <a href="../../wp/s/Season.htm" title="Season">seasonally</a> as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major seas, due to low <!--del_lnk--> evaporation, as well as limited outflow to the world ocean with heavy freshwater inflow.<p>The greatest inflow of water comes from the Atlantic by way of the <!--del_lnk--> Norwegian Current, which then flows along the Eurasian coast. Water also enters from the Pacific via the Bering Strait. The <!--del_lnk--> East Greenland Current carries the major outflow. Ice covers most of the ocean surface year-round, causing subfreezing temperatures much of the time. The Arctic is a major source of very cold air that inevitably moves toward the <!--del_lnk--> equator, meeting with warmer air in the middle <!--del_lnk--> latitudes and causing <a href="../../wp/r/Rain.htm" title="Rain">rain</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Snow.htm" title="Snow">snow</a>. Marine life abounds in open areas, especially the more southerly waters. The ocean&#39;s major ports are the <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russian</a> cities of <!--del_lnk--> Murmansk and <!--del_lnk--> Arkhangelsk. The Arctic Ocean is important as the shortest air route between the Pacific coast of North America and Europe overflies it.<p>

      <p>The Arctic Ocean occupies a roughly circular basin and covers an area of about 14,056,000 square km (5,440,000 mi&sup2;), slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. The coastline length is 45,389 kilometers (28,203 mi). Nearly landlocked, it is surrounded by the land masses of <!--del_lnk--> Eurasia, <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Greenland.htm" title="Greenland">Greenland</a>, and several islands. It includes <!--del_lnk--> Baffin Bay, <!--del_lnk--> Barents Sea, <!--del_lnk--> Beaufort Sea, <!--del_lnk--> Chukchi Sea, <!--del_lnk--> East Siberian Sea, <!--del_lnk--> Greenland Sea, <a href="../../wp/h/Hudson_Bay.htm" title="Hudson Bay">Hudson Bay</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Hudson Strait, <!--del_lnk--> Kara Sea, <!--del_lnk--> Laptev Sea, <!--del_lnk--> White Sea and other tributary bodies of water. It is connected to the Pacific Ocean by the <!--del_lnk--> Bering Strait and to the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> through the Greenland Sea. Its geographic coordinates are: <span class="plainlinksneverexpand"><!--del_lnk--> 90 _ 00 _ N _ 0 _ 00 _ E_ 90 &deg; 00 &prime; N 0 &deg; 00 &prime; E</span><p>An underwater <!--del_lnk--> mid-ocean ridge, the <!--del_lnk--> Lomonosov Ridge, divides the deep sea <!--del_lnk--> North Polar Basin into two basins: the <!--del_lnk--> Eurasian, or <!--del_lnk--> Nansen, Basin, (after <!--del_lnk--> Fridtjof Nansen) which is between 4,000 and 4,500&nbsp;meters (13,000 and 15,000 ft) deep, and the <!--del_lnk--> North American, or <!--del_lnk--> Hyperborean, Basin, which is about 4,000&nbsp;meters (13,000 ft) deep. The <!--del_lnk--> bathymetry of the ocean bottom is marked by <!--del_lnk--> fault-block ridges, <!--del_lnk--> plains of the abyssal zone, ocean deeps, and basins. The average depth of the Arctic Ocean is 1,038&nbsp;meters (3,407 ft). <!--del_lnk--> . The deepest point is in the Eurasian Basin deepest point, at 5,450&nbsp;meters (17,881 ft).<p>The Arctic Ocean contains a major chokepoint in the southern Chukchi Sea, which provides northern access to the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> via the <!--del_lnk--> Bering Strait between North America and Russia. The Arctic Ocean also provides the shortest marine link between the extremes of eastern and western Russia. There are several floating research stations in the Arctic, operated by the U.S. and Russia.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p>For much of Western history, the geography of the North Polar regions remained largely unexplored and conjectural. <!--del_lnk--> Pytheas of Massalia recorded an account of a journey northward in 325 B.C. to a land he called &quot;Ultima Thule,&quot; where the sun only set for three hours each day and the water was replaced by a congealed substance &quot;on which one can neither walk nor sail.&quot; He was probably describing loose sea ice known today as &quot;growlers&quot; and &quot;bergy bits.&quot; His &quot;Thule&quot; may have been Iceland, though the Faroe Islands have also been suggested.<p>Early cartographers were unsure whether to draw the region around the Pole as land (as in the map of <!--del_lnk--> Johannes Ruysch in 1507, or <!--del_lnk--> Gerardus Mercator&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> map of 1595) or water (as with <!--del_lnk--> Martin Waldseem&uuml;ller&#39;s <a href="../../images/34/3437.jpg.htm" title="Image:Martin waldseemuller map 1507 m 2.jpg">world map of 1507</a>). The fervent desire of Europeans for a northern passage to &quot;Cathay&quot; (<a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>) caused water to win out, and by 1723 mapmakers such as <!--del_lnk--> Johann Homann featured an extensive &quot;Oceanus Septentrionalis&quot; at the northerm edge of their charts. The few expeditions to penetrate much beyond the Arctic Circle in this era added only small islands, such as <!--del_lnk--> Nova Zemlya (11th century) and <!--del_lnk--> Spitzbergen (1596), though since these were often surrounded by pack-ice their northern limits were not so clear. The makers of navigational charts, more conservative than some of the more fanciful cartographers, tended to leave the region blank, with only the bits of known coastline sketched in.<p>This lack of knowledge of what lay north of the shifting barrier of ice gave rise to a number of conjectures. In England and other European nations, the myth of an &quot;Open Polar Sea&quot; was long-lived and persistent. <!--del_lnk--> John Barrow, longtime Second Secretary of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> Admiralty, made this belief the cornerstone of his campaign of Arctic exploration from 1818 to 1845. In the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> in the 1850s and &#39;60s, the explorers <!--del_lnk--> Elisha Kent Kane and <!--del_lnk--> Isaac Israel Hayes both claimed to have seen the shores of this elusive body of water. Even quite late in the century, the eminent authority <!--del_lnk--> Matthew Fontaine Maury included a description of the Open Polar Sea in his textbook The Physical Geography of the Sea (1883). Nevertheless, as all the explorers who trekked closer and closer to the pole reported, the Polar Ice Cap was ultimately quite thick, and persists year-round.<p><!--del_lnk--> Fridtjof Nansen was the first to make a naval crossing of the Arctic Ocean in <!--del_lnk--> 1896. The first surface crossing of the Arctic Ocean was led by <!--del_lnk--> Wally Herbert in <!--del_lnk--> 1969, in a dogsled expedition from <!--del_lnk--> Alaska to <a href="../../wp/s/Svalbard.htm" title="Svalbard">Svalbard</a> with air support.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h2>

      <p>The ocean is contained in a <!--del_lnk--> polar climate characterized by persistent cold and relatively narrow annual temperature ranges. Winters are characterized by continuous darkness, cold and stable weather conditions, and clear skies; summers are characterized by continuous daylight, damp and foggy weather, and weak cyclones with rain or snow.<p>There is considerable seasonal variation in how much <!--del_lnk--> pack ice covers the Arctic Ocean. Much of the ocean is also covered in snow for about 10 months of the year. The maximum snow cover is in March or April &mdash; about 20 to 50 centimeters (8 to 20 in) over the frozen ocean.<p>The average temperature is approximately -2&deg; celsius.<p><a id="Natural_resources" name="Natural_resources"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Natural hazards</span></h2>
      <p>Ice islands occasionally break away from northern <!--del_lnk--> Ellesmere Island, and icebergs are formed from glaciers in western Greenland and extreme northeastern Canada. <!--del_lnk--> Permafrost is found on most islands. The ocean is virtually ice locked from October to June, and ships are subject to superstructure icing from October to May.<p><a id="Plantlife" name="Plantlife"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Plantlife</span></h2>
      <p>The Arctic Ocean has relatively little plantlife except for <!--del_lnk--> Phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are a crucial part of the ocean and there are massive amounts of them in the Arctic. This is because during summer, the sun is out day and night, thus enabling the phytoplankton to <a href="../../wp/p/Photosynthesis.htm" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesize</a> for long periods of time and reproduce quickly. Phytoplankton can also reproduce by splitting themselves. Nutrients from the gulfstream and currents wash into the ocean too, making it the ocean with the most diverse wildlife.<div class="thumb tleft">
