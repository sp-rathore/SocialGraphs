      <p><b>Amber</b> is a <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil.htm" title="Fossil">fossil</a> <!--del_lnk--> resin much used for the manufacture of ornamental objects. Although not mineralized it is sometimes considered and used as a <!--del_lnk--> gemstone. Most of the world&#39;s amber is in the range of 30&ndash;90 million years old. Semi-fossilized resin or sub-fossil amber is called <!--del_lnk--> copal.<p>

      <p>The English name comes from the <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> &#x639;&#x646;&#x628;&#x631;, <i>&#x2BB;anbar</i>, probably through <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_language.htm" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a> , but this word referred originally to <!--del_lnk--> ambergris, which is an animal substance quite distinct from yellow amber. True amber has sometimes been called <i>kahroba</i>, a word of <!--del_lnk--> Persian derivation signifying &quot;that which attracts straw&quot;, in allusion to the power which amber possesses of acquiring an electric charge by friction. This property, first recorded by <!--del_lnk--> Thales of Miletus, suggested the word &quot;<a href="../../wp/e/Electricity.htm" title="Electricity">electricity</a>&quot;, from the <!--del_lnk--> Greek, <i><!--del_lnk--> elektron</i>, a name applied, however, not only to amber but also to an <!--del_lnk--> alloy of <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Silver.htm" title="Silver">silver</a>. By <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> writers amber is variously called <i><!--del_lnk--> electrum</i>, <i>sucinum</i> (<i>succinum</i>), and <i>glaesum</i> or <i>glesum</i>. The <a href="../../wp/h/Hebrew_language.htm" title="Hebrew language">Old Hebrew</a> &#x5D7;&#x5E9;&#x5DE;&#x5DC; <i>hashmal</i> seems to have meant amber, although Modern Hebrew uses Arabic-inspired &#x5E2;&#x5E0;&#x5D1;&#x5E8; <i>`inbar</i> while &#x5D7;&#x5E9;&#x5DE;&#x5DC; <i>hashmal</i> means electricity.<p>The <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a> word is <i>Bernstein</i> (&quot;burn stone&quot;), which comes from the <!--del_lnk--> Middle Low German <i>bernen</i> which means <i>burning</i>, this word is a cognate to Dutch <i>barnsteen</i>. This is likely related to the fact that amber can, indeed, burn. The <!--del_lnk--> Polish <i>bursztyn</i> was derived from the German word (like <!--del_lnk--> burmistrz or <!--del_lnk--> rotmistrz).<p>Amber, which has no primitive uses, has been found at <!--del_lnk--> Neolithic sites far from its source on the shores of the <!--del_lnk--> Baltic sea, mute witness, like <!--del_lnk--> obsidian, to long-distance trade routes established before the <a href="../../wp/b/Bronze_Age.htm" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a>. There is strong evidence for the theory that the Baltic coasts during the advanced civilization of the <!--del_lnk--> Nordic Bronze Age was the source of most amber in Europe, for example the amber jewelry found in graves from <!--del_lnk--> Mycenaean Greece has been found to originate from the Baltic Sea, specifically from the Samland area. Amber was mentioned by <a href="../../wp/h/Homer.htm" title="Homer">Homer</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Hesiod (<i><!--del_lnk--> Theogony</i> 337f.) <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a> and others. <!--del_lnk--> Pliny the Elder complains that a small statue of amber costs more than a healthy slave. <!--del_lnk--> Tacitus in his <i><!--del_lnk--> Germania</i> talks about the <!--del_lnk--> Aesti people as the only ones to gather amber from the <a href="../../wp/b/Baltic_Sea.htm" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic Sea</a> and who call it glaes (the -um ending is the latinised version).<p>Since the 13th century craftsmen <i>Paternostermacher</i> also called <i>Bernsteindreher</i> guilds are recorded in the <!--del_lnk--> Hanseatic cities, such as <!--del_lnk--> L&uuml;beck, Danzig (<!--del_lnk--> Gda&#x144;sk), Elbing (<!--del_lnk--> Elbl&#x105;g) and Stolp (<!--del_lnk--> S&#x142;upsk). Daniel Barholz, the city notary of Elbing, recorded in 1646, that the city council has in its employment <i>Bernsteindreher</i> (translation: amber turners).<p>During the 15th century, the <!--del_lnk--> Teutonic Knights controlled the production of amber in Europe, forbidding its unauthorised collection from beaches on the Baltic coastline under their jurisdiction, and punishing breakers of this ordinance with death. The Teutonic Order transported amber from Prussian Samland (<!--del_lnk--> Sambia) coast to the other cities, to be worked on by these special craftsmen.<p>The Paternostermacher (translation: Lord&#39;s Prayer (bead) makers) were represented in <i>Paternostermacher&auml;mter</i> (Guild Halls). These craftsmen also created the legendary <!--del_lnk--> Bernsteinzimmer (Amber Room) which was donated to Russian Tsar Peter the Great in 1716.<p>One can still go all along the Baltic Sea coastline of Germany (and since 1919 also Poland) and fish for amber with a net, the way it used to be fished for many centuries. In the <i>Deutsches Bernstein Museum</i> (German Amber Museum) at <!--del_lnk--> Ribnitz-Damgarten one can watch the <i>Bernsteindreher</i> at work, as well as try doing some of the polishing.<p><a id="Composition" name="Composition"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Composition</span></h2>
      <p>Amber is <!--del_lnk--> heterogeneous in composition, but consists of several <!--del_lnk--> resinous bodies more or less soluble in <a href="../../wp/e/Ethanol.htm" title="Ethanol">alcohol</a>, <!--del_lnk--> ether and <!--del_lnk--> chloroform, associated with an insoluble <!--del_lnk--> bituminous substance. Amber is a <!--del_lnk--> macromolecule by free <!--del_lnk--> radical polymerization of several precursors in the labdane family, communic acid, cummunol and biformene . Labdanes are tetrameric <!--del_lnk--> terpenes (C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>32</sub>) and trienes which means that the organic skeleton has three <!--del_lnk--> alkene groups available for <!--del_lnk--> polymerization. As amber matures over the years, more polymerization will take place as well as <!--del_lnk--> isomerization reactions, <!--del_lnk--> crosslinking and cyclization. The average composition of amber leads to the general formula <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon.htm" title="Carbon">C</a><sub>10</sub><a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">H</a><sub>16</sub><a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">O</a>.<p>Heating amber will soften it and eventually it will burn, which is why the <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a> word for amber is <i>bernstein</i>. Heated rather below 200&deg;C, amber suffers decomposition, yielding an &quot;oil of amber&quot;, and leaving a black residue which is known as &quot;amber colophony&quot;, or &quot;amber pitch&quot;; when dissolved in oil of <!--del_lnk--> turpentine or in <!--del_lnk--> linseed oil this forms &quot;amber varnish&quot; or &quot;amber lac&quot;.<p>True amber yields on dry distillation <!--del_lnk--> succinic acid, the proportion varying from about 3 to 8%, and being greatest in the pale opaque or <i>bony</i> varieties. The aromatic and irritating fumes emitted by burning amber are mainly due to this acid. True Baltic amber is distinguished by its yield of succinic acid, for many of the other fossil resins which are often termed amber contain either none of it, or only a very small proportion; hence the name <i>succinite</i> proposed by Professor <!--del_lnk--> James Dwight Dana, and now commonly used in scientific writings as a specific term for the real Prussian amber. Succinite has a hardness between 2 and 3, which is rather greater than that of many other fossil resins. Its specific gravity varies from 1.05 to 1.10. An effective tool for Amber analysis is <!--del_lnk--> IR spectroscopy. It enables the distinction between baltic amber and non-Baltic varieties because of a specific <!--del_lnk--> carbonyl absorption and it can also detect the relative age of an amber sample.<p><a id="Amber_in_Geology" name="Amber_in_Geology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Amber in Geology</span></h2>
      <p>The Baltic amber or succinite (historically documented as Prussian amber) is found as irregular nodules in a marine glauconitic sand, known as <i>blue earth,</i> occurring in the Lower <a href="../../wp/o/Oligocene.htm" title="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> strata of <!--del_lnk--> Sambia in <!--del_lnk--> Kaliningrad Oblast, where it is now systematically mined . It appears, however, to have been partly derived from yet earlier <!--del_lnk--> Tertiary deposits (<a href="../../wp/e/Eocene.htm" title="Eocene">Eocene</a>); and it occurs also as a derivative <a href="../../wp/m/Mineral.htm" title="Mineral">mineral</a> in later formations, such as the drift. Relics of an abundant flora occur as inclusions trapped within the amber while the resin was yet fresh, suggesting relations with the flora of Eastern <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a> and the southern part of <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>. Heinrich G&ouml;ppert named the common amber-yielding pine of the Baltic forests <i>Pinites succiniter</i>, but as the wood, according to some authorities, does not seem to differ from that of the existing genus it has been also called <i>Pinius succinifera</i>. It is improbable, however, that the production of amber was limited to a single species; and indeed a large number of conifers belonging to different genera are represented in the amber-flora.<p><a id="Amber_inclusions" name="Amber_inclusions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Amber inclusions</span></h2>

      <p>The resin contains, in addition to the beautifully preserved plant-structures, numerous remains of insects, spiders, annelids, crustaceans and other small organisms which became enveloped while the exudation was fluid. In most cases the organic structure has disappeared, leaving only a cavity, with perhaps a trace of <!--del_lnk--> chitin. Even hair and feathers have occasionally been represented among the enclosures. Fragments of wood frequently occur, with the tissues well-preserved by impregnation with the resin; while leaves, flowers and fruits are occasionally found in marvelous perfection. Sometimes the amber retains the form of drops and stalactites, just as it exuded from the ducts and receptacles of the injured trees. The abnormal development of resin has been called <i>succinosis</i>. Impurities are quite often present, especially when the resin dropped on to the ground, so that the material may be useless except for varnish-making, whence the impure amber is called <i>firniss</i>. Enclosures of <!--del_lnk--> pyrites may give a bluish colour to amber. The so-called <i>black amber</i> is only a kind of <!--del_lnk--> jet. <i>Bony amber</i> owes its cloudy opacity to minute bubbles in the interior of the resin. In the <a href="../../wp/d/Dominican_Republic.htm" title="Dominican Republic">Dominican Republic</a> exists a type of amber known as the <!--del_lnk--> blue amber.<p><a id="Locations_and_utilization" name="Locations_and_utilization"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Locations and utilization</span></h2>
      <p>Although amber is found along the shores of a large part of the <a href="../../wp/b/Baltic_Sea.htm" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic Sea</a> and the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea.htm" title="North Sea">North Sea</a>, the great amber-producing country is the promontory of <!--del_lnk--> Sambia, now part of <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>. Pieces of amber torn from the sea-floor are cast up by the waves, and collected at ebb-tide. Sometimes the searchers wade into the sea, furnished with nets at the end of long poles, by means of which they drag in the sea-weed containing entangled masses of amber; or they dredge from boats in shallow water and rake up amber from between the boulders. Divers have been employed to collect amber from the deeper waters. Systematic dredging on a large scale was at one time carried on in the <!--del_lnk--> Curonian Lagoon by Messrs Stantien and Becker, the great amber merchants of <!--del_lnk--> K&ouml;nigsberg. At the present time extensive mining operations are conducted in quest of amber. The <i>pit amber</i> was formerly dug in open works, but is now also worked by underground galleries. The nodules from the <i>blue earth</i> have to be freed from matrix and divested of their opaque crust, which can be done in revolving barrels containing sand and water. The sea-worn amber has lost its crust, but has often acquired a dull rough surface by rolling in sand.<p>Amber is extensively used for beads and other ornaments, and for cigar-holders and the mouth-pieces of pipes. It is regarded by the <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turks</a> as specially valuable, inasmuch as it is said to be incapable of transmitting infection as the pipe passes from mouth to mouth. The variety most valued in the East is the pale straw-coloured, slightly cloudy amber. Some of the best qualities are sent to <a href="../../wp/v/Vienna.htm" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> for the manufacture of smoking appliances. In working amber, it is turned on the <!--del_lnk--> lathe and polished with whitening and water or with rotten stone and oil, the final lustre being given by friction with flannel. During the working much electricity is developed.<p>When gradually heated in an oil-bath, amber becomes soft and flexible. Two pieces of amber may be united by smearing the surfaces with <!--del_lnk--> linseed oil, heating them, and then pressing them together while hot. Cloudy amber may be clarified in an oil-bath, as the oil fills the numerous <!--del_lnk--> pores to which the turbidity is due. Small fragments, formerly thrown away or used only for varnish, are now utilized on a large scale in the formation of &quot;ambroid&quot; or &quot;pressed amber&quot;. The pieces are carefully heated with exclusion of air and then compressed into a uniform mass by intense hydraulic pressure; the softened amber being forced through holes in a metal plate. The product is extensively used for the production of cheap jewellery and articles for smoking. This pressed amber yields brilliant interference colours in polarized light. Amber has often been imitated by other resins like <!--del_lnk--> copal and <!--del_lnk--> kauri, as well as by <!--del_lnk--> celluloid and even <a href="../../wp/g/Glass.htm" title="Glass">glass</a>. True amber is sometimes coloured artificially.<p>Amber was much valued as an ornamental material in very early times. It has been found in <!--del_lnk--> Mycenaean tombs; it is known from lake-dwellings in <a href="../../wp/s/Switzerland.htm" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, and it occurs with <!--del_lnk--> neolithic remains in <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, whilst in <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> it is found with interments of the <!--del_lnk--> bronze age. A remarkably fine cup turned in amber from a bronze-age <!--del_lnk--> barrow at <!--del_lnk--> Hove is now in the <a href="../../wp/b/Brighton.htm" title="Brighton">Brighton Museum</a>. Beads of amber occur with <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon relics in the south of England; and up to a comparatively recent period the material was valued as an <!--del_lnk--> amulet. It is still believed to possess a certain medicinal virtue.<p>Rolled pieces of amber, usually small but occasionally of very large size, may be picked up on the east coast of England, having probably been washed up from deposits under the North Sea. <!--del_lnk--> Cromer is the best-known locality, but it occurs also on other parts of the <a href="../../wp/n/Norfolk.htm" title="Norfolk">Norfolk</a> coast, such as <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Yarmouth.htm" title="Great Yarmouth">Great Yarmouth</a>, as well as <!--del_lnk--> Southwold, <!--del_lnk--> Aldeburgh and <!--del_lnk--> Felixstowe in <!--del_lnk--> Suffolk, and as far south as <!--del_lnk--> Walton-on-the-Naze in <!--del_lnk--> Essex, whilst northwards it is not unknown in <!--del_lnk--> Yorkshire. On the other side of the North Sea, amber is found at various localities on the coast of the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> and Denmark. On the shores of the Baltic it occurs not only on the German and Polish coast but in the south of <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, in <!--del_lnk--> Bornholm and other islands, and in southern <a href="../../wp/f/Finland.htm" title="Finland">Finland</a>. Amber has indeed a very wide distribution, extending over a large part of northern Europe and occurring as far east as the <!--del_lnk--> Urals. Some of the amber districts of the Baltic and North Sea were known in prehistoric times, and led to early trade with the south of Europe through the <!--del_lnk--> Amber Road. Amber was carried to <!--del_lnk--> Olbia on the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Sea.htm" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a>, Massilia (today <a href="../../wp/m/Marseille.htm" title="Marseille">Marseille</a>) on the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Adria at the head of the <!--del_lnk--> Adriatic; and from these centres it was distributed over the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Hellenic</a> world.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Amber Room was a collection of chamber wall panels commissioned in <!--del_lnk--> 1701 for the king of <!--del_lnk--> Prussia, then given to Tsar <a href="../../wp/p/Peter_I_of_Russia.htm" title="Peter I of Russia">Peter the Great</a>. The room was hidden in place from invading <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">Nazi</a> forces in 1941, who upon finding it in the Cathrine Palace, disassembled it and moved it to <!--del_lnk--> K&ouml;nigsberg. What happened to the room beyond this point is unclear. It is presumed lost. It was <!--del_lnk--> re-created in 2003.<p>Since the establishment of the <!--del_lnk--> Amber Road amber (which is also commonly referred to as the &quot;Lithuanian gold&quot;) has substantially contributed to <a href="../../wp/l/Lithuania.htm" title="Lithuania">Lithuanian</a> economy and culture. Nowadays a great variety of amber jewelry and amberware is offered to foreign <!--del_lnk--> tourists in most <!--del_lnk--> souvenir shops as distinctive to Lithuania and its cultural <!--del_lnk--> heritage.<p>Amber and certain similar substances are found to a limited extent at several localities in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, as in the green-sand of <!--del_lnk--> New Jersey, but they have little or no economic value. A fluorescent amber occurs in the southern state of Chiapas in <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, and is used extensively to create eye-catching jewellery. Blue amber is recorded in the <a href="../../wp/d/Dominican_Republic.htm" title="Dominican Republic">Dominican Republic</a>. These Central American ambers are formed from the resins of Legume trees (Hymenea) and not conifers.<p><a id="Varieties" name="Varieties"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Varieties</span></h2>
      <p>Besides succinite, which is the common variety of European amber, the following varieties also occur:<ul>
       <li>Gedanite, or <i>brittle amber,</i> closely resembling succinite, but much more brittle, not quite so hard, with a lower melting point and containing no succinic acid. It is often covered with a white powder easily removed by wiping. The name comes from Gedanum, the Latin name of <!--del_lnk--> Gda&#x144;sk at the <a href="../../wp/b/Baltic_Sea.htm" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic Sea</a>.<li>Stantienite, a brittle, deep brownish-black resin, destitute of succinic acid.<li>Beckerite, a rare amber in earthy-brown nodules, almost opaque, said to be related in properties to <!--del_lnk--> gutta-percha.<li>Glessite, a nearly opaque brown dark resin, with numerous microscopic cavities and dusty enclosures, named from glesum, an old name for amber.<li>Krantzite, a soft red amber-like resin, found in the lignites of <!--del_lnk--> Saxony.<li>Allingite, a <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil.htm" title="Fossil">fossil</a> resin allied to succinite, from Switzerland.<li>Roumanite, or Romanian amber, a dark reddish resin, occurring with lignite in Tertiary deposits. The nodules are penetrated by cracks, but the material can be worked on the lathe. <a href="../../wp/s/Sulfur.htm" title="Sulfur">Sulphur</a> is present to the extent of more than 1%, whence the smell of sulphuretted hydrogen when the resin is heated. According to Gheorghe Murgoci the Romanian amber is true succinite.<li>Simetite, or Sicilian amber, takes its name from the river Simeto or Giaretta. It occurs in lower <a href="../../wp/m/Miocene.htm" title="Miocene">Miocene</a> deposits and is also found washed up by the sea near <!--del_lnk--> Catania. This beautiful material presents a great diversity of tints, but a rich hyacinth red is common. It is remarkable for its fluorescence, which in the opinion of some authorities adds to its beauty. Amber is also found in many localities in <!--del_lnk--> Emilia, especially near the sulphur-mines of <!--del_lnk--> Cesena. It has been conjectured that the ancient <!--del_lnk--> Etruscan ornaments in amber were wrought in the Italian material, but it seems that amber from the Baltic reached the Etruscans at Hatria. It has even been supposed that amber passed from <!--del_lnk--> Sicily to northern Europe in early times - a supposition said to receive some support from the fact that much of the amber dug up in Denmark is red; but it must not be forgotten that reddish amber is found also on the Baltic, though not being fashionable it is used rather for varnish-making than for ornaments. Moreover, yellow amber after long burial is apt to acquire a reddish colour. The amber of Sicily seems not to have been recognized in ancient times, for it is not mentioned by local authorities like <!--del_lnk--> Diodorus Siculus.<li>Burmite is the name under which the Burmese amber is now described. Until the British occupation of <a href="../../wp/m/Myanmar.htm" title="Myanmar">Burma</a> but little was known as to its occurrence, though it had been worked for centuries and was highly valued by the natives and by the Chinese. It is found in flat rolled pieces, irregularly distributed through a blue clay probably of Miocene age. It occurs in the Hukawng valley, in the Nangotaimaw hills, where it is irregularly worked in shallow pits. The mines were visited some years ago by Dr Fritz Noetling, and the mineral has been described by Dr Otto Helm. The Burmese amber is yellow or reddish, some being of ruby tint, and like the Sicilian amber it is fluorescent. Burmite and simetite agree also in being destitute of succinic acid. Most of the Burmese amber is worked at <!--del_lnk--> Mandalay into rosary-beads and ear-cylinders.</ul>
      <p>Many other fossil resins more or less allied to amber have been described. Schraufite is a reddish resin from the <!--del_lnk--> Carpathian <!--del_lnk--> sandstone, and it occurs with <!--del_lnk--> jet in the <a href="../../wp/c/Cretaceous.htm" title="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> rocks of the <a href="../../wp/l/Lebanon.htm" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>; ambrite is a resin found in many of the <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coals</a> of <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>; retinite occurs in the lignite of <!--del_lnk--> Bovey Tracey in Devonshire and elsewhere; whilst <!--del_lnk--> copaline has been found in the <!--del_lnk--> London Clay of <!--del_lnk--> Highgate in North London. Chemawinite or cedarite is an amber-like resin from the <!--del_lnk--> Saskatchewan river in <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber&quot;</div>
