      <p>Algebra may be divided roughly into the following categories:<ul>
       <li><b><a href="../../wp/e/Elementary_algebra.htm" title="Elementary algebra">Elementary algebra</a></b>, in which the properties of operations on the <!--del_lnk--> real number system are recorded using symbols as &quot;place holders&quot; to denote <!--del_lnk--> constants and <!--del_lnk--> variables, and the rules governing <!--del_lnk--> mathematical expressions and <!--del_lnk--> equations involving these symbols are studied (note that this usually includes the subject matter of courses called <i>intermediate algebra</i> and <i>college algebra</i>);<li><b><!--del_lnk--> Abstract algebra</b>, sometimes also called <i>modern algebra</i>, in which <!--del_lnk--> algebraic structures such as <a href="../../wp/g/Group_%2528mathematics%2529.htm" title="Group (mathematics)">groups</a>, <!--del_lnk--> rings and <!--del_lnk--> fields are <!--del_lnk--> axiomatically defined and investigated;<li><b><a href="../../wp/l/Linear_algebra.htm" title="Linear algebra">Linear algebra</a></b>, in which the specific properties of <!--del_lnk--> vector spaces are studied (including <a href="../../wp/m/Matrix_%2528mathematics%2529.htm" title="Matrix (mathematics)">matrices</a>);<li><b><!--del_lnk--> Universal algebra</b>, in which properties common to all algebraic structures are studied.</ul>
      <p>In advanced studies, axiomatic algebraic systems such as groups, rings, fields, and algebras over a field are investigated in the presence of a natural <a href="../../wp/g/Geometry.htm" title="Geometry">geometric</a> structure (a <a href="../../wp/t/Topology.htm" title="Topology">topology</a>) which is compatible with the algebraic structure. The list includes a number of areas of <!--del_lnk--> functional analysis:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Normed linear spaces<li><!--del_lnk--> Banach spaces<li><!--del_lnk--> Hilbert spaces<li><!--del_lnk--> Banach algebras<li><!--del_lnk--> Normed algebras<li><!--del_lnk--> Topological algebras<li><!--del_lnk--> Topological groups</ul>
      <p><a id="Elementary_algebra" name="Elementary_algebra"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Elementary algebra</span></h2>
      <p><b>Elementary algebra</b> is the most basic form of algebra. It is taught to students who are presumed to have no knowledge of <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> beyond the basic principles of <a href="../../wp/a/Arithmetic.htm" title="Arithmetic">arithmetic</a>. Although in arithmetic, only <a href="../../wp/n/Number.htm" title="Number">numbers</a> and their arithmetical operations (such as +, &minus;, &times;, &divide;) occur, in algebra, numbers are often denoted by symbols (such as <i>a</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>). This is useful because:<ul>
       <li>It allows the general formulation of arithmetical laws (such as <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> = <i>b</i> + <i>a</i> for all <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>), and thus is the first step to a systematic exploration of the properties of the <!--del_lnk--> real number system.<li>It allows the reference to &quot;unknown&quot; numbers, the formulation of <!--del_lnk--> equations and the study of how to solve these (for instance, &quot;Find a number <i>x</i> such that 3<i>x</i> + 1 = 10&quot;).<li>It allows the formulation of <!--del_lnk--> functional relationships (such as &quot;If you sell <i>x</i> tickets, then your profit will be 3<i>x</i> - 10 dollars, or <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) = 3<i>x</i> - 10, where <i>f</i> is the function, and <i>x</i> is the number the function is performed on.&quot;).</ul>
      <p>
       <br />
      <p><a id="Abstract_algebra" name="Abstract_algebra"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Abstract algebra</span></h2>
      <p><b>Abstract algebra</b> extends the familiar concepts found in elementary algebra and <a href="../../wp/a/Arithmetic.htm" title="Arithmetic">arithmetic</a> of <!--del_lnk--> numbers to more general concepts.<p><b><a href="../../wp/s/Set.htm" title="Set">Sets</a></b>: Rather than just considering the different types of <a href="../../wp/n/Number.htm" title="Number">numbers</a>, abstract algebra deals with the more general concept of <i>sets</i>: a collection of objects called <!--del_lnk--> elements. All the familiar types of numbers are sets. Other examples of sets include the set of all two-by-two <a href="../../wp/m/Matrix_%2528mathematics%2529.htm" title="Matrix (mathematics)">matrices</a>, the set of all second-degree <!--del_lnk--> polynomials (<i>ax</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>bx</i> + <i>c</i>), the set of all two dimensional <!--del_lnk--> vectors in the plane, and the various <!--del_lnk--> finite groups such as the <!--del_lnk--> cyclic groups which are the group of integers <!--del_lnk--> modulo <i>n</i>. <!--del_lnk--> Set theory is a branch of <a href="../../wp/l/Logic.htm" title="Logic">logic</a> and not technically a branch of algebra.<p><b><!--del_lnk--> Binary operations</b>: The notion of <!--del_lnk--> addition (+) is abstracted to give a <i>binary operation</i>, * say. For two elements <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> in a set <i>S</i> <i>a</i>*<i>b</i> gives another element in the set, (technically this condition is called <!--del_lnk--> closure). <!--del_lnk--> Addition (+), <!--del_lnk--> subtraction (-), <!--del_lnk--> multiplication (&times;), and <!--del_lnk--> division (&divide;) are all binary operations as is addition and multiplication of matrices, vectors, and polynomials.<p><b><!--del_lnk--> Identity elements</b>: The numbers zero and one are abstracted to give the notion of an <i>identity element</i>. Zero is the identity element for addition and one is the identity element for multiplication. For a general binary operator * the identity element <i>e</i> must satisfy <i>a</i> * <i>e</i> = <i>a</i> and <i>e</i> * <i>a</i> = <i>a</i>. This holds for addition as <i>a</i> + 0 = <i>a</i> and 0 + <i>a</i> = <i>a</i> and multiplication <i>a</i> &times; 1 = <i>a</i> and 1 &times; <i>a</i> = <i>a</i>. However, if we take the positive natural numbers and addition, there is no identity element.<p><b><!--del_lnk--> Inverse elements</b>: The negative numbers give rise to the concept of <i>inverse elements</i>. For addition, the inverse of <i>a</i> is <i>-a</i>, and for multiplication the inverse is 1/<i>a</i>. A general inverse element <i>a</i><sup>-1</sup> must satisfy the property that <i>a</i> * <i>a</i><sup>-1</sup> = <i>e</i> and <i>a</i><sup>-1</sup> * <i>a</i> = <i>e</i>.<p><b><!--del_lnk--> Associativity</b>: Addition of integers has a property called associativity. That is, the grouping of the numbers to be added does not affect the sum. For example: (2+3)+4=2+(3+4). In general, this becomes (<i>a</i> * <i>b</i>) * <i>c</i> = <i>a</i> * (<i>b</i> * <i>c</i>). This property is shared by most binary operations, but not subtraction or division.<p><b><!--del_lnk--> Commutativity</b>: Addition of integers also has a property called commutativity. That is, the order of the numbers to be added does not affect the sum. For example: 2+3=3+2. In general, this becomes <i>a</i> * <i>b</i> = <i>b</i> * <i>a</i>. Only some binary operations have this property. It holds for the integers with addition and multiplication, but it does not hold for <!--del_lnk--> matrix multiplication.<p><a id="Groups" name="Groups"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Groups</span></h3>
      <p>Combining the above concepts gives one of the most important structures in mathematics: a <b><a href="../../wp/g/Group_%2528mathematics%2529.htm" title="Group (mathematics)">group</a></b>. A group is a combination of a set <i>S</i> and a <!--del_lnk--> binary operation &#39;*&#39; with the following properties:<ul>
       <li>The operation is closed: if <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are members of <i>S</i>, then so is <i>a</i> * <i>b</i>.</ul>
      <dl>
       <dd>
        <dl>
         <dd><small>In fact, it is redundant to mention this property, for every binary operation must be closed. So, the statement &quot;a group is a combination of a set <i>S</i> and a binary operation &#39;*&#39;&quot; is already saying that the operation is closed. However, <!--del_lnk--> closure is frequently emphasized repeating it as a group property.</small></dl>
      </dl>
      <ul>
       <li>An identity element <i>e</i> exists, such that for every member <i>a</i> of <i>S</i>, <i>e</i> * <i>a</i> and <i>a</i> * <i>e</i> are both identical to <i>a</i>.<li>Every element has an inverse: for every member <i>a</i> of <i>S</i>, there exists a member <i>a</i><sup>-1</sup> such that <i>a</i> * <i>a</i><sup>-1</sup> and <i>a</i><sup>-1</sup> * <i>a</i> are both identical to the identity element).<li>The operation is associative: if <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> are members of <i>S</i>, then (<i>a</i> * <i>b</i>) * <i>c</i> is identical to <i>a</i> * (<i>b</i> * <i>c</i>).</ul>
      <p>If a group is also <!--del_lnk--> commutative - that is, for any two members <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> of <i>S</i>, <i>a</i> * <i>b</i> is identical to <i>b</i> * <i>a</i> &ndash; then the group is said to be <!--del_lnk--> Abelian.<p>For example, the set of integers under the operation of addition is a group. In this group, the identity element is 0 and the inverse of any element <i>a</i> is its negation, -<i>a</i>. The associativity requirement is met, because for any integers <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, (<i>a</i> + <i>b</i>) + <i>c</i> = <i>a</i> + (<i>b</i> + <i>c</i>).<p>The nonzero <!--del_lnk--> rational numbers form a group under multiplication. Here, the identity element is 1, since 1 &times; <i>a</i> = <i>a</i> &times; 1 = <i>a</i> for any rational number <i>a</i>. The inverse of <i>a</i> is 1/<i>a</i>, since <i>a</i> &times; 1/<i>a</i> = 1.<p>The integers under the multiplication operation, however, do not form a group. This is because, in general, the multiplicative inverse of an integer is not an integer. For example, 4 is an integer, but its multiplicative inverse is 1/4, which is not an integer.<p>The theory of groups is studied in <!--del_lnk--> group theory. A major result in this theory is the <!--del_lnk--> classification of finite simple groups, mostly published between about 1955 and 1983, which is thought to classify all of the <!--del_lnk--> finite <!--del_lnk--> simple groups into roughly 30 basic types.<table class="wikitable">

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Semigroups, <!--del_lnk--> quasigroups, and <!--del_lnk--> monoids are structures similar to groups, but more general.

A <!--del_lnk--> semigroup has an <i>associative</i> binary operation, but might not have an identity element. A <!--del_lnk--> monoid is a semigroup which does have an identity but might not have an inverse for every element. A <!--del_lnk--> quasigroup satisfies a requirement that any element can be turned into any other by a unique pre- or post-operation; however the binary operation might not be associative.<p>All groups are monoids, and all monoids are semigroups.<p><a id="Rings_and_fields.E2.80.94structures_with_two_binary_operations" name="Rings_and_fields.E2.80.94structures_with_two_binary_operations"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Rings and fields&mdash;structures with two binary operations</span></h3>

      <p>The origins of algebra can be traced to the ancient <!--del_lnk--> Babylonians, who developed an advanced <a href="../../wp/a/Arithmetic.htm" title="Arithmetic">arithmetical system</a> with which they were able to do calculations in an algebraic fashion. With the use of this system they were able to apply formulas and calculate solutions for unknown values for a class of problems typically solved today by using <!--del_lnk--> linear equations, <!--del_lnk--> quadratic equations, and <!--del_lnk--> indeterminate linear equations. By contrast, most <!--del_lnk--> Egyptians of this era, and most <!--del_lnk--> Indian, <!--del_lnk--> Greek and <!--del_lnk--> Chinese mathematicians in the <!--del_lnk--> first millennium BC, usually solved such equations by <a href="../../wp/g/Geometry.htm" title="Geometry">geometric</a> methods, such as those described in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Rhind Mathematical Papyrus</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Sulba Sutras</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Euclid&#39;s <i>Elements</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art</i>. The geometric work of the Greeks, typified in the <i>Elements</i>, provided the framework for generalizing formulae beyond the solution of particular problems into more general systems of stating and solving equations.<p>The word &quot;algebra&quot; is named after the <!--del_lnk--> Arabic word &quot;<i>al-jabr</i>&quot; from the title of the book <i><span class="Unicode"><!--del_lnk--> al-Kit&#x101;b al-mu&#x1E2B;ta&#x1E63;ar f&#x12B; &#x1E25;is&#x101;b al-&#x11F;abr wa-l-muq&#x101;bala</span></i>, meaning <i>The book of Summary Concerning Calculating by Transposition and Reduction</i>, a book written by the <!--del_lnk--> Persian <!--del_lnk--> Muslim mathematician <span class="Unicode"><a href="../../wp/m/Muhammad_ibn_Musa_al-Khwarizmi.htm" title="Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi">Muhammad ibn M&#x16B;s&#x101; al-khw&#x101;rizm&#x12B;</a></span> in 820. The word <i>Al-Jabr</i> means <i>&quot;reunion&quot;</i>. The Hellenistic mathematician <!--del_lnk--> Diophantus has traditionally been known as &quot;the father of algebra&quot; but debate now exists as to whether or not Al-Khwarizmi should take that title from <!--del_lnk--> Diophantus. Those who support Al-Khwarizmi point to the fact that much of his work on <!--del_lnk--> reduction is still in use today and that he gave an exhaustive explanation of solving quadratic equations. While those who support <!--del_lnk--> Diophantus point to the fact that the algebra found in <i>Al-Jabr</i> is more elementary than the algebra found in <i>Arithmetica</i> and that <i>Arithmetica</i> is syncopated while <i>Al-Jabr</i> is fully rhetorical. Another <!--del_lnk--> Persian mathematician <!--del_lnk--> Omar Khayyam developed <!--del_lnk--> algebraic geometry and found the general geometric solution of the <!--del_lnk--> cubic equation. The Indian mathematicians <!--del_lnk--> Mahavira and <!--del_lnk--> Bhaskara, and the Chinese mathematician <!--del_lnk--> Zhu Shijie, solved various cubic, <!--del_lnk--> quartic, <!--del_lnk--> quintic and higher-order <!--del_lnk--> polynomial equations.<p>Another key event in the further development of algebra was the general algebraic solution of the cubic and quartic equations, developed in the mid-16th century. The idea of a <!--del_lnk--> determinant was developed by <!--del_lnk--> Japanese mathematician <!--del_lnk--> Kowa Seki in the 17th century, followed by <a href="../../wp/g/Gottfried_Leibniz.htm" title="Gottfried Leibniz">Gottfried Leibniz</a> ten years later, for the purpose of solving systems of simultaneous linear equations using <a href="../../wp/m/Matrix_%2528mathematics%2529.htm" title="Matrix (mathematics)">matrices</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Gabriel Cramer also did some work on matrices and determinants in the 18th century. <!--del_lnk--> Abstract algebra was developed in the 19th century, initially focusing on what is now called <!--del_lnk--> Galois theory, and on <!--del_lnk--> constructibility issues.<p>The stages of the development of symbolic algebra are roughly as follows:<ul>
       <li>Rhetorical algebra, which was developed by the Babylonians and remained dominant up to the 16th century;<li>Geometric constructive algebra, which was emphasised by the <!--del_lnk--> Vedic Indian and classical Greek mathematicians;<li>Syncopated algebra, as developed by <!--del_lnk--> Diophantus and in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Bakhshali Manuscript</i>; and<li>Symbolic algebra, which sees its culmination in the work of <a href="../../wp/g/Gottfried_Leibniz.htm" title="Leibniz">Leibniz</a>.</ul>
