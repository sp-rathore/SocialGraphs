      <p>In <a href="../../wp/g/Greek_mythology.htm" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythology</a>, <b>Athena</b> (<!--del_lnk--> Greek: <span class="polytonic" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#x1F08;&theta;&eta;&nu;&#x1FB6;</span>, <i>Ath&#x113;n&acirc;</i>, or <span class="polytonic" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#x1F08;&theta;&#x3AE;&nu;&eta;</span>, <i>Ath&eacute;n&#x113;</i>; <!--del_lnk--> Doric: <span class="polytonic" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#x1F08;&sigma;&#x3AC;&nu;&alpha;</span>, <i>As&aacute;na</i>) was the goddess of <a href="../../wp/c/Civilization.htm" title="Civilization">civilization</a>, specifically <!--del_lnk--> wisdom, <!--del_lnk--> weaving, and <!--del_lnk--> crafts . Athena&#39;s wisdom encompasses the technical knowledge employed in weaving, metal-working, but also includes the cunning intelligence (<i><!--del_lnk--> metis</i>) of such figures as <a href="../../wp/o/Odysseus.htm" title="Odysseus">Odysseus</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> owl and the <!--del_lnk--> olive tree are sacred to her.<p>She is attended by an owl, wears a goatskin breastplate called the <!--del_lnk--> Aegis given to her by her father, <a href="../../wp/z/Zeus.htm" title="Zeus">Zeus</a>, and is accompanied by the goddess of victory, <!--del_lnk--> Nike. She is often shown helmeted and with a shield bearing the <!--del_lnk--> Gorgon <!--del_lnk--> Medusa&#39;s head, a votive gift of <!--del_lnk--> Perseus. Athena is an armed warrior goddess, and appears in Greek mythology as a helper of many heroes, including <a href="../../wp/h/Heracles.htm" title="Heracles">Heracles</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Jason, and <a href="../../wp/o/Odysseus.htm" title="Odysseus">Odysseus</a>. She never had a consort or lover, and thus was often known as <i>Athena Parthenos</i> (&quot;Athena the virgin&quot;), hence her most famous temple, the <a href="../../wp/p/Parthenon.htm" title="Parthenon">Parthenon</a>, on the <!--del_lnk--> Acropolis in <a href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Athens">Athens</a>. In her role as a protector of the city, Athena was worshipped throughout the Greek world as <i>Athena Polias</i> (&quot;Athena of the city&quot;). She had a special relationship with <a href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Athens">Athens</a>, as is shown by the etymological connection of the names of the goddess and the city.<p>Athena is associated with <a href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Athens">Athens</a>, a plural name because it was the place where she presided over her sisterhood, the <i>Athenai</i>, in earliest times. Athena was probably already a goddess in the Aegean in prehistoric times. There is evidence that in early times, Athena was an <a href="../../wp/o/Owl.htm" title="Owl">owl</a> herself, or a <!--del_lnk--> bird goddess in general. In Book 3 of the <a href="../../wp/o/Odyssey.htm" title="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>, she takes the form of a <!--del_lnk--> sea-eagle. Her tasseled <!--del_lnk--> aegis may be the remnants of wings: she is depicted with wings on Archaic <!--del_lnk--> red-figure pottery.<p>In the <!--del_lnk--> Olympian pantheon, Athena was remade as the favorite daughter of Zeus, born fully armed from his forehead after he swallowed her mother, Metis. The story of her birth comes in several versions. In the one most commonly cited, Zeus lay with <!--del_lnk--> Metis, the goddess of crafty thought and wisdom, but immediately feared the consequences. It had been prophesied that Metis would bear children more powerful than the sire, even Zeus himself. In order to forestall these dire consequences, Zeus transformed Metis into a fly and swallowed her immediately after lying with her. He was too late: Metis had already conceived a child. Metis immediately began making a helmet and robe for her fetal daughter. The hammering as she made the helmet caused Zeus great pain and <!--del_lnk--> Prometheus, <!--del_lnk--> Hephaestus, <!--del_lnk--> Hermes or <!--del_lnk--> Palaemon (depending on the sources examined) cleaved Zeus&#39;s head with the double-headed Minoan axe (the <!--del_lnk--> labrys of the Great Goddess). Athena leaped from Zeus&#39;s head, fully grown and armed, and Zeus was none the worse for the experience.<p>Fragments attributed to the semi-legendary <!--del_lnk--> Phoenician historian <!--del_lnk--> Sanchuniathon, said to have written before the <!--del_lnk--> Trojan war, make Athena instead the daughter of <!--del_lnk--> Cronus, a king of <!--del_lnk--> Byblos who is said to have visited &#39;the inhabitable world&#39; and bequeathed <!--del_lnk--> Attica to Athena.<p>

      <p>Athena&#39;s name is possibly of <!--del_lnk--> Lydian origin. It may be a compound word derived in part from <!--del_lnk--> Tyrrhenian &quot;ati&quot;, meaning &quot;mother&quot; and the name of the <!--del_lnk--> Hurrian Goddess &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Hannahannah&quot; shortened in various places to &quot;Ana&quot;. In <!--del_lnk--> Mycenaean Greek, she possibly appears in a single inscription in the <!--del_lnk--> Linear B tablets: <i>A-ta-na-po-ti-ni-ja</i> <i>/Athana potniya/</i> appears on a text from the Late Minoan II-era &quot;Room of the Chariot Tablets&quot; in <!--del_lnk--> Knossos, the earliest Linear B archive anywhere. Though this phrase is often translated as &quot;Mistress Athena&quot;, it literally means &quot;the <i>potnia</i> of At(h)ana&quot;, which perhaps means &quot;the Lady of Athens&quot;; it is uncertain whether there is any connection to the city of Athens. We also find <i>A-ta-no-dju-wa-ja</i> <i>/Athana diwya/</i>, the final part being the Linear B spelling of what we know from ancient Greek as <i>Diwia</i> (Mycenaean <i>di-u-ja</i> or <i>di-wi-ja</i>) &quot;divine&quot; Athena was also a weaver and the god of crafts. (see <i><!--del_lnk--> dyeus</i>).<p>In his dialogue <i><!--del_lnk--> Cratylus</i>, <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a> gives the etymology of Athena&#39;s name based on the view of the ancient Athenians, from <i>A-theo-noa</i> (A-&theta;&epsilon;&omicron;-&nu;&#x3CC;&alpha;) or <i>E-theo-noa</i> (H-&theta;&epsilon;&omicron;-&nu;&#x3CC;&alpha;) meaning &quot;the mind of God&quot; (<i>Cratylus</i> 407b). <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a>, and also <a href="../../wp/h/Herodotus.htm" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>, noted that the Egyptian citizens of <!--del_lnk--> Sais in Egypt worshipped a goddess whose Egyptian name was <!--del_lnk--> Neith; they identified her with Athena. (<i><!--del_lnk--> Timaeus</i> 21e), (<i><!--del_lnk--> Histories</i> 2:170-175).<p><a id="Epithets_and_cult_titles" name="Epithets_and_cult_titles"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Epithets and cult titles</span></h2>
      <p>In poetry from Homer onward, Athena&#39;s most common <!--del_lnk--> epithet is <i>glaukopis</i> (&gamma;&lambda;&alpha;&upsilon;&kappa;&#x3CE;&pi;&iota;&sigmaf;), which is usually translated &quot;bright-eyed&quot; or &quot;with gleaming eyes&quot;. It is a combination of <i>glaukos</i> (&gamma;&lambda;&alpha;&#x3CD;&kappa;&omicron;&sigmaf;, meaning &quot;gleaming,&quot; &quot;silvery,&quot; and later, &quot;bluish-green&quot; or &quot;gray&quot;) and <i>ops</i> (&#x3CE;&psi;, &quot;eye,&quot; or sometimes, &quot;face&quot;). It is interesting to note that <i>glaux</i> (&gamma;&lambda;&alpha;&#x3CD;&xi;, &quot;owl&quot;) is from the same root, presumably because of its own distinctive eyes. The bird which sees in the night is closely associated with the goddess of wisdom: in archaic images, she is frequently depicted with an owl perched on her head. In earlier times, Athena may well have been a <!--del_lnk--> bird goddess, similar to <!--del_lnk--> Lilitu and/or the goddess depicted with owls, wings and bird talons on the <!--del_lnk--> Burney relief, a Mesopotamian terracotta relief of the early second millennium BCE..<p>In the <i><!--del_lnk--> Iliad</i> (4.514), the <!--del_lnk--> Homeric Hymns and in <!--del_lnk--> Hesiod&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Theogony</i>, she is given the curious epithet <i>Tritogeneia.</i> The meaning of this term is unclear. It seems to mean &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Triton-born,&quot; perhaps indicating that the sea-god was her father according to some early myths,or, less likely, that she was born near Lake Triton in <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>. Another possible meaning is &quot;triple-born&quot; or &quot;third-born,&quot; which may refer to her status as the third daughter of Zeus or the fact she was born from Metis, Zeus and herself; various legends list her as being the first child after Artemis and Apollo, though other legends identify her as Zeus&#39; first child.<p>In her role as judge at <!--del_lnk--> Orestes&#39; trial on the murder of his mother, <!--del_lnk--> Clytemnestra (which he won), Athena won the epithet <i>Athena Areia.</i><p>She was often referred to as Pallas Athena (&Pi;&alpha;&lambda;&lambda;&#x3AC;&sigmaf; &Alpha;&theta;&eta;&nu;&#x3AC;). The epithet derived from an ambiguous figure named <!--del_lnk--> Pallas, sometimes male, sometimes female, never mentioned apart from Athena. The goddess killed Pallas, in some versions by mistake, for instance in a Pelasgian version of her birth myth Pallas was the playmate who Athena killed by mistake in a game battle, after that taking the name of Pallas as a sign of mourning . In the <!--del_lnk--> Homeric Hymn to Hermes, Pallas was the father of the moon goddess <!--del_lnk--> Selene. In other versions Pallas was one of the <!--del_lnk--> Gigantes killed by her in the Gigantomachy; forever after she wore the goatskin fringed with <!--del_lnk--> chthonic serpents of Pallas, as the protective <!--del_lnk--> aegis. She may have absorbed and supplanted Pallas more gently: Walter Burkert says &quot;she is the Pallas of Athens, <i>Pallas Athenaie</i>, just as Hera of Argos is <i>Here Argeie</i>. For the Athenians, Burkert notes, she was simply &quot;the Goddess&quot;, <i>he theos</i>, certainly an ancient title.<p>Athena was given many other cult titles. She had the epithet <i>Athena Ergane</i> as the patron of craftsmen and artisans. With the epithet <i><!--del_lnk--> Athena Parthenos</i> (&quot;virgin&quot;), Athena was worshipped on the <!--del_lnk--> Acropolis, especially in the festival of the <!--del_lnk--> Panathenaea. With the epithet <i>Athena Promachos</i> she led in battle. With the epithet <i>Athena Polias</i> (&quot;of the city&quot;), Athena was the protectress of Athens and its Acropolis, but also of many other cities, including <!--del_lnk--> Argos, <!--del_lnk--> Sparta, <!--del_lnk--> Gortyn, <!--del_lnk--> Lindos, and <!--del_lnk--> Larisa. In each of these cities her temple was frequently the major temple on the acropolis.<p>Athena was often equated with <!--del_lnk--> Aphaea, a local goddess of the island of <!--del_lnk--> Aegina, located near <a href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Athens">Athens</a>, once Aegina was under Athenian control.<p><a id="Athena_in_classical_art" name="Athena_in_classical_art"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Athena in classical art</span></h2>

      <p>Athena is classically portrayed wearing full armor, with the helmet raised high on the forehead like a hat; she carries a spear and a shield with the head of the <!--del_lnk--> gorgon <!--del_lnk--> Medusa mounted on it. It is in this standing posture that she was depicted in <!--del_lnk--> Phidias&#39;s famous lost gold and ivory statue of her, 36 feet tall, the <!--del_lnk--> Athena Parthenos in the <a href="../../wp/p/Parthenon.htm" title="Parthenon">Parthenon</a>. Athena is also often depicted with an <a href="../../wp/o/Owl.htm" title="Owl">owl</a> (a symbol of wisdom) sitting on one of her shoulders. The <!--del_lnk--> Mourning Athena is a relief sculpture that dates around 460 BC and portrays a tired, emotional Athena. In earlier, archaic portraits of Athena in <!--del_lnk--> vase-paintings, the goddess retains some of her Minoan character, such as great birdwings.<p>Apart from her attributes, there seems to be a relative consensus in sculpture from the fifth century onward as to what Athena looked like. Most noticeable in the face is perhaps a high nose with a high bridge that seems like a natural extension of the forehead. The eyes are typically somewhat deeply set. The lips are usually full but the mouth is fairly narrow, usually just slightly wider than the nose. The neck is somewhat longish. The net result is a serene, somewhat aloof beauty.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Birth" name="Birth"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Birth</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Hesiod&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Theogony</i> gives the following account of Athena&#39;s birth: Metis (wisdom) was Zeus&#39; first wife. It was fated that she would have a daughter as strong and powerful as her father and that she would then have a son destined to rule the gods. Zeus, fearing that his son would overthrow him, tricked Metis and swallowed her. He ingested her and therefore her wisdom so that she might advise him in matters. However the immortal child Metis was pregnant with was not harmed, and Athena was born from his head after he had married Hera. Giving birth to Athena required Hephaestus taking his hammer and chisel and carving open Zeus&#39;s skull, so Athena could spring forth from her father&#39;s head. Hera was so annoyed at this that she gave birth to Hephaestus by herself. The son was never born and Zeus stayed as supreme ruler of Mount Olympus.<p>A fuller version says: Zeus lay with Metis, the goddess of crafty thought, but immediately feared the consequences.It had been prophesied that Metis would bear children more powerful than the father, and this includes even Zeus himself. In order to forestall these dire consequences, Zeus played a game with Metis. She transformed into many creatures, big and small. When Metis transformed into a fly, Zeus swallowed her immediately after lying with her. He was too late: Metis was already pregnant. Metis immediately began making a helmet and robe for her fetal daughter. The hammering as she made the helmet caused Zeus great pain and Hephaestus cut open Zeus&#39;s skull with the double-headed Minoan axe (labrys). Athena leaped from Zeus&#39;s skull, fully grown and armed, and Zeus was none the worse for the experience.This is the most common version of her birth.<p>
       <br /> Aside from Hesiod&#39;s account given above, there is another version of her birth of Pelasgian origin, accounting for her epithet <i>Tritoneia</i>; according this version Athena was born near the lagoon Tritonis in Libya and was raised by three nymphs. There are a very few references to her being the child of a giant named Pallas---hence her name &quot;Pallas Athena&quot;---but these are atypical. <p><a id="Erichthonius" name="Erichthonius"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Erichthonius</span></h3>

      </div>
      <p>According to <!--del_lnk--> Apollodorus, <!--del_lnk--> Hephaestus attempted to <!--del_lnk--> rape Athena but was unsuccessful. His <!--del_lnk--> semen fell on the ground, and <!--del_lnk--> Erichthonius was born from the Earth, <!--del_lnk--> Gaia. Athena then raised the baby as a foster mother. Alternatively, the semen landed on Athena&#39;s leg, and she wiped it off with a piece of wool which she tossed on the ground. Erichthonius arose from the ground and the wool. Another version says that Hephaestus wanted Athena to marry him but she disappeared on his bridal bed; he ejaculated onto the ground instead. Athena left the baby to three sisters, <!--del_lnk--> Herse, <!--del_lnk--> Pandrosa and <!--del_lnk--> Aglaura in a small box and warned them never to open it. Aglaula opened the <i><!--del_lnk--> cista</i> which contained the infant and future-king, Erichthonius, in the form of a <!--del_lnk--> serpent The sight caused Herse and Pandrosa to go insane and they threw themselves off the <!--del_lnk--> Acropolis&#39;.<p>An alternative version of the same story is that while Athena was gone to bring a mountain to use in the Acropolis, two of the willful sisters opened the box. A crow witnessed the opening and flew away to tell Athena, who fell into a rage and dropped the mountain (now <!--del_lnk--> Mt. Lykabettos) . The crow was not spared from her wrath, and it is believed Athena was the one who turned their feathers black. Herse and Pandrosa once again went insane and threw themselves to their deaths off a cliff. Jane Harrison (<i>Prolegomena</i>) finds these to be versions of a simple cautionary tale to discourage young girls from opening the <i><!--del_lnk--> cista</i> that they carried, not knowing its contents, in connection with the <!--del_lnk--> Thesmophoria.<p>Erichthonius later became <!--del_lnk--> King of Athens and implemented many beneficial changes to Athenian culture. During this time, Athena frequently protected him.<p><a id="Aglaura" name="Aglaura"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Aglaura</span></h3>
      <p>There is another version of the myth, told in <!--del_lnk--> Ovid&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Metamorphoses</i> in which Hermes falls in love with Herse. Herse, Aglaura and Pandrosa go to the temple to offer sacrifices to Athena. Hermes demands help from Aglaura to seduce Herse. Aglaura in exchange demands money from Hermes who gives her the money of sacrifice and seduces Herse.  Athena in punishment for Aglaura&#39;s greed asks the Envy to corrupt her feelings. Envy obeyed her commands and she infested Herse. Aglaura turns to stone.<p><a id="Athens" name="Athens"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Athens</span></h3>
      <p>Athena competed with <!--del_lnk--> Poseidon to be the patron deity of Athens, which was yet unnamed in this telling. They agreed that each would give the Athenians one gift and that the Athenians would choose the gift they preferred. Poseidon struck the ground with his <!--del_lnk--> trident and a spring sprung up; this gave them a means of trade and water, but it was salty and not very good for drinking. Athena, however, offered them the first domesticated <!--del_lnk--> olive tree. The Athenians (or their king, <!--del_lnk--> Cecrops) accepted the olive tree and along with it Athena as their patron, for the olive tree brought wood, oil and food. This is thought to commemorate a clash between the inhabitants during <!--del_lnk--> Mycenaean times and newer immigrants. It is interesting to note that Athens at its height was a significant sea power, defeating the <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Empire.htm" title="Persian Empire">Persian</a> fleet at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Salamis near <!--del_lnk--> Salamis Island in <!--del_lnk--> 480 BC. Athena was also the patron goddess of several other cities, notably <!--del_lnk--> Sparta. In an alternate version, Poseidon invents the first horse. Athena&#39;s gift is still chosen.<p><a id="Arachne" name="Arachne"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Arachne</span></h3>
      <p>A woman named <!--del_lnk--> Arachne once boasted that she was a superior weaver to Athena, the goddess of weaving. Athena appeared to her disguised as an old woman and told Arachne to repent for her <!--del_lnk--> hubris but Arachne instead challenged Athena to a contest. Athena threw off her disguise and the contest began. Athena wove a depiction of the conflict with Poseidon over Athens, while Arachne wove a depiction making fun of Zeus and his many wives. Athena was furious at her skill (the contest was never decided) and her choice of subject (after all, she is Zeus&#39;s favorite daughter.) Enraged, she destroyed Arachne&#39;s work and transformed her into the first <a href="../../wp/s/Spider.htm" title="Spider">spider</a>, which forever weaves a <!--del_lnk--> silk web to catch its food.<p><a id="Perseus_and_Medusa" name="Perseus_and_Medusa"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Perseus and Medusa</span></h3>
      <p>Athena guided <!--del_lnk--> Perseus in eliminating <!--del_lnk--> Medusa, a dangerous unreformed relic of the old pre-Olympian order, and she was awarded the grisly trophy that turned men to stone, for her shield.<p>She wears the aegis, a goatskin shield which had a fringe of snakes. When Perseus killed the gorgon Medusa, whose face turned men to stone, he gave the gorgon head to Athena, and the goddess placed it on her aegis. This is a protective measure, for the Medusa&#39;s head retained its petrifying power even after her death.<p>It was however Athena who made Medusa into what she was. Medusa was the only beautiful sister of the three Gorgons, but, Medusa had sex with &mdash; or was raped by &mdash; Poseidon in Athena&#39;s temple. Upon discovery of the desecration of her temple, Athena changed Medusa&#39;s form to match that of her sister Gorgons as punishment. Medusa&#39;s hair turned into snakes, meeting her gaze would turn all living creatures to stone, and Athena also caused her lower body to morph, as well as granting her the power of petrification as to hinder all chances of her ever having intimacy with a man.<p><a id="Heracles" name="Heracles"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Heracles</span></h3>
      <p>Athena instructed <a href="../../wp/h/Heracles.htm" title="Heracles">Heracles</a> how to remove the skin from the <!--del_lnk--> Nemean Lion, by using the lion&#39;s own claws to cut through its thick hide. The lion&#39;s hide became Heracles&#39; signature garment, along with the olive-wood club he used in the battle.

      <p><a href="../../wp/o/Odysseus.htm" title="Odysseus">Odysseus</a>&#39; cunning and shrewd nature quickly won Athena&#39;s favour, though she is unable to help him during his journey home from Troy until he washes up on the shore of an island where Nausicaa is washing her clothes. She appears in Nausicaa&#39;s dreams to ensure the princess rescues Odysseus and eventually sends him to Ithaca. Athena, herself, appears in disguise to Odysseus upon his arrival. She initially lies and tells him Penelope, his wife, has remarried and Odysseus is believed to be dead, though Odysseus lies to her, seeing through her disguise. Pleased with his resolve and shrewdness, she reveals herself to him and tells him everything he needed to know in order to win back his kingdom. She disguises him as an elderly man so that he will not be noticed by the Suitors or Penelope and she helps Odysseus defeat his suitors and end the feud against their relatives.<p><a id="Athena_in_post-classical_culture" name="Athena_in_post-classical_culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Athena in post-classical culture</span></h2>
