<h2>South Africa</h2>
<p>South Africa has one of the higest incidences of HIV/AIDS - 21.5% of the adult population.  In addition it is esotimated that there are over 1 million AIDS orphans which is half of all orphans.<br />SOS Children's Villages has worked specifically on projects supporting families affected by HIV/AIDS since January 2002 based on its seven SOS Children's Villages. In addition it has established one pilot project to focus on community support with plans for a further two depending on the outcome of the pilot project.</p><h3>SOS CHILDREN IN SOUTH AFRICA</h3>
