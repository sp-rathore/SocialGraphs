      <p><b>Accountancy</b> (<!--del_lnk--> profession) or <b>accounting</b> (<!--del_lnk--> methodology) is the measurement, disclosure or provision of assurance about financial information that helps managers, investors, tax authorities and other decision makers make resource allocation decisions. <!--del_lnk--> Financial accounting is one branch of accounting and historically has involved processes by which financial information about a business is recorded, classified, summarized, interpreted, and communicated.<p><!--del_lnk--> Auditing, a related but separate discipline, has two sub-disciplines: Internal and External auditing. External auditing is the process whereby an independent auditor examines an organization&#39;s financial statements and accounting records in order to express an opinion &mdash; that conveys reasonable but not absolute assurance &mdash; as to the truth and fairness of the statements and the accountant&#39;s adherence to <!--del_lnk--> Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), in all material respects.<p>Internal auditing is an examination in which management, and not the external public, is the main beneficiary. It is carried out usually by auditors employed by the company, but sometimes by external service providers. The internal auditor&#39;s role is broader, and basically depends on what kind of assurance management wants. It usually certifies the efficiency and effectiveness of processes, departments, projects or internal controls. The Institute of Internal Auditors is generally accepted as the custodian of Internal Auditing best practice.<p>At the heart of accounting is the measurement of financial transactions which are transfers of legal property rights made under contractual relationships. Non-financial transactions are specifically excluded due to conservatism and materiality principles.<p>Practitioners of accountancy are known as <b><!--del_lnk--> accountants</b>. There are many professional bodies for accountants throughout the world. Many allow their members to use titles indicating their membership. Examples are <!--del_lnk--> Chartered Certified Accountant (<!--del_lnk--> ACCA or <!--del_lnk--> FCCA), <!--del_lnk--> Chartered Accountant (FCA, CA or ACA) and <!--del_lnk--> Certified Public Accountant (CPA).<p>Accountancy attempts to create accurate <!--del_lnk--> financial reports that are useful to managers, regulators, and other <!--del_lnk--> stakeholders such as <!--del_lnk--> shareholders, <!--del_lnk--> creditors, or owners. The day-to-day record-keeping involved in this process is known as <!--del_lnk--> bookkeeping.<p>At the heart of modern financial accounting is the <!--del_lnk--> double-entry bookkeeping system. This system involves making at least two entries for every transaction: a debit in one account, and a corresponding credit in another account. The sum of all debits should always equal the sum of all credits. This provides an easy way to check for errors. This system was first used in medieval <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>, although claims have been made that the system dates back to <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Ancient Greece</a>.<p>According to critics of <!--del_lnk--> standard accounting practices, it has changed little since. <!--del_lnk--> Accounting reform measures of some kind have been taken in each generation to attempt to keep <!--del_lnk--> bookkeeping relevant to capital assets or production capacity. However, these have not changed the basic principles, which are supposed to be independent of <a href="../../wp/e/Economics.htm" title="Economics">economics</a> as such. In recent times, the divergence of accounting from economic principles has resulted in controversial reforms to make financial reports more indicative of economic reality.<p>

      <p>Accountancy&#39;s infancy dates back to the earliest days of <a href="../../wp/h/Human.htm" title="Human">human</a> <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Civilization.htm" title="Civilization">civilization</a> (the <!--del_lnk--> Sumerians in <a href="../../wp/m/Mesopotamia.htm" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>), when the need to maintain accurate records of the quantities and relative values of agricultural products first arose. Simple accounting is mentioned in the <!--del_lnk--> Christian Bible in the <!--del_lnk--> book of Matthew, in the Parable of the Talents (Matt. 25:19). The <!--del_lnk--> Quran also mentions simple accounting for trade and credit arrangements (Quran 2: 282).<p>Twelveth century writer <!--del_lnk--> Ibn Taymiyyah mentioned in his book <!--del_lnk--> Hisba (verification, calculation), detailed accounting systems used by the <!--del_lnk--> Muslims as early as in the mid-seventh century. The accounting practices were influenced by the <!--del_lnk--> Roman and the <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Empire.htm" title="Persian Empire">Persian</a> civilizations that Muslims interacted with. The most detailed example of a complex governmental accounting system is the Divan of <!--del_lnk--> Umar, the second <!--del_lnk--> Caliph of <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> in which all revenues and disbursements were recorded. The Divan of <!--del_lnk--> Umar has been described in detail by various Islamic historians and was used by <!--del_lnk--> Muslim rulers with mofidications and enhancements until the fall of the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>.<p><a id="Luca_Pacioli_and_the_birth_of_modern_accountancy" name="Luca_Pacioli_and_the_birth_of_modern_accountancy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Luca Pacioli and the birth of modern accountancy</span></h3>
      <p>The first book on accounting was written by a <a href="../../wp/c/Croatia.htm" title="Croatia">Croatian</a> merchant <!--del_lnk--> Benedetto Cotrugli, who is also known as Benedikt Kotruljevi&#x107;, from the city of <!--del_lnk--> Dubrovnik. During his life in <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> he met many merchants and decide to write, <i>Della Mercatvra et del Mercante Perfetto</i> (<i>On Trade and the Perfect Merchant</i>) in which he elaborated on the principles of modern, <!--del_lnk--> double-entry book-keeping. He finished his lifework in <!--del_lnk--> 1458. However, his work was not published until <!--del_lnk--> 1573, as a result of which his contributions to the field have been overlooked by the general public.<p>For this reason, <!--del_lnk--> Luca Pacioli (1445 - 1517), also known as Friar Luca dal Borgo, is credited for the &quot;birth&quot; of accounting. His <i>Summa de arithmetica, geometrica, proportioni et proportionalita</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Venice <!--del_lnk--> 1494), a synthesis of the mathematical knowledge of his time, includes the first published description of the method of keeping accounts that Venetian merchants used at that time, known as the <!--del_lnk--> double-entry accounting system. Although Pacioli codified rather than invented this system, he is widely regarded as the &quot;Father of Accounting&quot;. The system he published included most of the accounting cycle as we know it today. He described the use of journals and ledgers, and warned that a person should not go to sleep at night until the debits equalled the credits! His ledger had accounts for assets (including receivables and inventories), liabilities, capital, income, and expenses &mdash; the account categories that are reported on an organization&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> balance sheet and <!--del_lnk--> income statement, respectively. He demonstrated year-end closing entries and proposed that a trial balance be used to prove a balanced ledger. His treatise also touches on a wide range of related topics from accounting ethics to cost accounting.<p>The first known book in the <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English language</a> on accounting was published in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> by John Gouge (or Gough) in <!--del_lnk--> 1543. It is described as <i>A Profitable Treatyce called the Instrument or Boke to learn to knowe the good order of the kepyng of the famouse reconynge, called in Latin, Dare and Habere, and, in English, Debitor and Creditor</i>.<p>A short book of instructions was also published in 1588 by <!--del_lnk--> John Mellis of <!--del_lnk--> Southwark, in which he says, &quot;I am but the renuer and reviver of an ancient old copie printed here in London the 14 of August 1543: collected, published, made, and set forth by one Hugh Oldcastle, Scholemaster, who, as appeareth by his treatise, then taught Arithmetics, and this booke in Saint Ollaves parish in Marko Lane.&quot; John Mellis refers to the fact that the principle of accounts he explains (which is a simple system of double entry) is &quot;after the forme of Venice&quot;.<p>A book described as <i>The Merchants Mirrour, or directions for the perfect ordering and keeping of his accounts formed by way of Debitor and Creditor</i>, after the (so termed) Italian manner, by Richard Dafforne, accountant, published in 1635, contains many references to early books on the science of accountancy. In a chapter in this book, headed &quot;Opinion of Book-keeping&#39;s Antiquity,&quot; the author states, on the authority of another writer, that the form of book-keeping referred to had then been in use in Italy about two hundred years, &quot;but that the same, or one in many parts very like this, was used in the time of Julius Caesar, and in Rome long before.&quot; He gives quotations of Latin book-keeping terms in use in ancient times, and refers to &quot;ex Oratione Ciceronis pro Roscio Comaedo&quot;; and he adds:<dl>
       <dd>&quot;That the one side of their booke was used for Debitor, the other for Creditor, is manifest in a certain place, <i>Naturalis Historiae Plinii</i>, lib. 2, cap. 7, where hee, speaking of Fortune, saith thus:</dl>
      <dl>
       <dd><i>Huic Omnia Expensa.</i><dd><i>Huic Omnia Feruntur accepta et in tota Ratione mortalium sola.</i><dd><i>Utramque Paginam facit.&quot;</i></dl>
      <p>An early Dutch writer appears to have suggested that double-entry book-keeping was even in existence among the Greeks, pointing to scientific accountancy having been invented in remote times.<p>There were several editions of Richard Dafforne&#39;s book - the second edition in 1636, the third in 1656, and another in 1684. The book is a very complete treatise on scientific accountancy, beautifully prepared and containing elaborate explanations. The numerous editions tend to prove that the science was highly appreciated in the 17th century. From this time on, there has been a continuous supply of literature on the subject, many of the authors styling themselves accountants and teachers of the art, and thus proving that the professional accountant was then known and employed.<p><a id="Accountancy_qualifications_and_regulation" name="Accountancy_qualifications_and_regulation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Accountancy qualifications and regulation</span></h2>

      <p>The requirements for entry in the profession of accounting vary from country to country.<p>Accountants may be <!--del_lnk--> licensed by a variety of organisations, such as the <!--del_lnk--> British qualified accountancy bodies including <!--del_lnk--> Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (<!--del_lnk--> ACCA) and <!--del_lnk--> Institute of Chartered Accountants, and are recognized by titles such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Chartered Certified Accountant</i> (ACCA or FCCA) and <i><!--del_lnk--> Chartered Accountant</i> (UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India, Pakistan, South Africa), <i><!--del_lnk--> Certified Public Accountant</i> (Ireland, Japan, US, Singapore, Hong Kong, the Philippines), <i><!--del_lnk--> Certified Management Accountant</i> (Canada, U.S.), <i><!--del_lnk--> Certified General Accountant</i> (Canada), or <i><!--del_lnk--> Certified Practising Accountant</i> (Australia). Some Commonwealth countries (Australia and Canada) often recognise both the certified and chartered accounting bodies. The majority of &quot;public&quot; accountants in New Zealand and Canada are Chartered Accountants; however, Certified General Accountants are also authorized by legislation to practise public accounting and auditing in all Canadian provinces, except Ontario and Quebec, as of 2005. There is, however, no legal requirement for an accountant to be a paid-up member of one of the many Institutes and other bodies which are effectively a form of professional trade union. Unlike the <!--del_lnk--> Law Society, which can legally stop a solicitor from practising, accountancy institutes do not have such authority. However, auditors are regulated.<p><a id="Accounting_scholarship" name="Accounting_scholarship"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The &quot;Big Four&quot; accountancy firms</span></h2>
      <p>The &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Big Four auditors&quot; are the largest <!--del_lnk--> multinational accountancy firms.<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> PricewaterhouseCoopers<li><!--del_lnk--> Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu<li><!--del_lnk--> Ernst &amp; Young<li><!--del_lnk--> KPMG</ul>
      <p>These firms are associations of the partnerships in each country rather than having the classical structure of holding company and subsidiaries, but each has an international &#39;umbrella&#39; organization for co-ordination.<p>Before the Enron and other <!--del_lnk--> accounting scandals, there were five large firms and were called the Big Five. Since <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Andersen&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> assurance practice split (after the firm was found guilty in the Enron scandal), with a plurality joining KPMG in the US and Deloitte &amp; Touche outside of the US, Arthur Andersen left from the group. Previous to this there were also groupings referred to as the &quot;Big Six&quot; (Arthur Andersen, plus Coopers &amp; Lybrand before its merger with Price Waterhouse) and the &quot;Big Eight&quot; (Ernst and Young prior to their merger were Ernst&amp; Whinney and Arthur Young and Deloitte &amp; Touche was formed by the merger of Deloitte, Haskins and Sells with the firm Touche Ross).<p>Enron turned out to be only the first of a series of accounting scandals that enveloped the accounting industry in 2002.<p>This is likely to have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. accounting industry. Application of <!--del_lnk--> International Accounting Standards originating in <!--del_lnk--> International Accounting Standards Board headquartered in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> and bearing more resemblance to UK than current <!--del_lnk--> US practices is often advocated by those who note the relative stability of the UK accounting system (which reformed itself after scandals in the late 1980s and early 1990s). <!--del_lnk--> Accounting reform of a far more comprehensive sort is advocated by those who see issues with <a href="../../wp/c/Capitalism.htm" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> or <a href="../../wp/e/Economics.htm" title="Economics">economics</a>, and seek ecological or social accountability.<p><a id="Size_of_market_-_UK" name="Size_of_market_-_UK"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Size of market - UK</span></h2>
      <p>According to Accountancy Age&#39;s 2005 league table, fee income amongst the Top 50 accounting firms in the UK rose from &pound;6.3bn to &pound;7.0bn. This followed two successive years in which fee income had declined, largely a result of the sale by some of the larger firms of their consultancy arms. As detailed in the next section, fee income in most business areas - audit, tax, corporate finance and consultancy - rose in the 2005 survey, with insolvency and wealth management being the only segments where revenue fell.<p>PricewaterhouseCoopers remains the largest firm with fee income totalling &pound;1,780m followed by Deloitte (&pound;1,350m), KPMG (&pound;1,066m) and Ernst &amp; Young (&pound;945m). The combined revenue of the Big Four accounted for &pound;5.0bn, 72% of the fee income of the Top 50, down from 78-79% in the years up to the 2002 survey and the third year in succession a decline in their share has occurred (Chart 1). Ernst &amp; Young&#39;s fee income is the smallest of the largest four firms, but still over three times that of the next largest firm, <!--del_lnk--> Grant Thornton. The amount of fee income tapers off amongst the mid-tier firms so that in total there were only 25 firms that each generated more than &pound;15m of revenue in the 2005 survey. <!--del_lnk--> <p>For more details regarding British qualified accountancy professionals, please refer to the page of <!--del_lnk--> British qualified accountants.<p><a id="Topics_in_accounting" name="Topics_in_accounting"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountancy&quot;</div>
