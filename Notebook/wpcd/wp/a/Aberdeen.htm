The traditional industries were fishing, paper-making, shipbuilding and textiles, but they have been overtaken by the <!--del_lnk--> oil industry and Aberdeen&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> seaport. The seaport is the largest in the northeast of Scotland.<p>Aberdeen has won the <!--del_lnk--> Britain in Bloom competition ten times, and hosts the <!--del_lnk--> Aberdeen International Youth Festival.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p>The Aberdeen area has seen human settlement for at least 8,000 years. The city began as two separate <!--del_lnk--> burghs: <!--del_lnk--> Old Aberdeen at the mouth of the river Don; and New Aberdeen, a fishing and trading settlement, where the Denburn waterway entered the river Dee estuary. The earliest <!--del_lnk--> charter was granted by <!--del_lnk--> William the Lion in 1179 and confirmed the corporate rights granted by <!--del_lnk--> David I. In 1319, the Great Charter of <!--del_lnk--> Robert the Bruce transformed Aberdeen into a property-owning and financially independent community. Granted with it was the nearby Forest of Stocket, whose income formed the basis for the city&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Common Good Fund which still benefits Aberdonians.<p>During the <!--del_lnk--> Wars of Scottish Independence, Aberdeen was under <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a> rule, so <!--del_lnk--> Robert the Bruce laid siege to <!--del_lnk--> Aberdeen Castle before destroying it in 1308 followed by the massacring of the English garrison and the retaking of Aberdeen for the townspeople. When Bruce took over the castle and finished the siege, <!--del_lnk--> Bon Accord was used as the code to initiate the final attack and has been the city&#39;s motto ever since. The city was burned by <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_III_of_England.htm" title="Edward III of England">Edward III of England</a> in 1336, but was rebuilt and extended, and called New Aberdeen. The city was strongly fortified to prevent attacks by neighbouring lords, but the gates were removed by 1770. During the <!--del_lnk--> Wars of the Three Kingdoms of 1644-1647 the city was impartially plundered by both sides. In 1644, it was taken and ransacked by Royalist troops after the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Aberdeen. A quarter of the population died in 1647 from an outbreak of <!--del_lnk--> bubonic plague.<p>In the 18th century, a new Town Hall was built and the first social services appeared with the <!--del_lnk--> Infirmary at <!--del_lnk--> Woolmanhill in 1742 and the Lunatic Asylum in 1779. The council began major road improvements at the end of the century with the main thoroughfares of George Street, King Street and <!--del_lnk--> Union Street all completed at the start of the next century.<p>A century later, the increasing economic importance of Aberdeen and the development of the shipbuilding and fishing industries led to the existing harbour with Victoria Dock, the South Breakwater, and the extension to the North Pier. The expensive infrastructure program had repercussions, and in 1817 the city was bankrupt. However, a recovery was made in the general prosperity which followed the <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleonic_Wars.htm" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic wars</a>. Gas street lighting arrived in 1824 and an enhanced water supply appeared in 1830 when water was pumped from the Dee to a reservoir in Union Place. An underground sewer system replaced open sewers in 1865.<p>The city was first <!--del_lnk--> incorporated in 1891. Although Old Aberdeen still has a separate charter and history, it and New Aberdeen are no longer truly distinct. They are both part of the city, along with <!--del_lnk--> Woodside and the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Burgh of <!--del_lnk--> Torry to the south of the River Dee.<p><a id="Architecture" name="Architecture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Architecture</span></h2>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Union Street, built of granite in 1801-05, runs from Castle Street for nearly a mile (1.5&nbsp;km), is 70&nbsp;feet (21 m) wide, and originally contained the principal shops and most public buildings. Part of the street crosses the Denburn ravine (utilised for the line of the <!--del_lnk--> Great North of Scotland Railway) by Union Bridge, a granite arch of 132&nbsp;feet (40&nbsp;m) span, with portions of the older town still fringing the gorge, 50&nbsp;feet (15&nbsp;m) below the level of <!--del_lnk--> Union Street.<p>The Town House, built in Franco-Scottish Gothic style, is at the east end of Union Street. Containing the great hall, with an open timber ceiling and oak-panel walls, the Sheriff Court House and the <!--del_lnk--> Town and County Hall contains portraits of various <!--del_lnk--> Lord Provosts and distinguished citizens. On the south-western corner is the 210&nbsp;foot (64&nbsp;m) grand tower high enough to give a view of the city and surrounding country. Adjoining the Town House is the old North of Scotland Bank building, in <!--del_lnk--> Greek Revival style.<p>Other notable buildings on the street are the Town and County Bank, the <!--del_lnk--> Music Hall, the Trinity Hall of the incorporated trades (1398-1527, now a shopping centre), the Palace Hotel, and the former office of the Northern Assurance Company. Many of the city&#39;s most renowned buildings were designed by local architect <!--del_lnk--> Archibald Simpson. Just off Union Street, <!--del_lnk--> Marischal College is the second largest granite building in the world. Its present frontage was inaugurated by King <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Edward VII of the United Kingdom">Edward VII</a> in 1906, but the central parts by Archibald Simpson are considerably older.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Mercat Cross, built in 1686 by <!--del_lnk--> John Montgomery, is an open-arched structure, 21&nbsp;feet (6&nbsp;m) in diameter and 18&nbsp;feet (5&nbsp;m) high with a large hexagonal base from the centre of which rises a shaft with a Corinthian capital, on which is the royal <!--del_lnk--> unicorn. The base is highly decorated, including medallions illustrating Scottish monarchs from <!--del_lnk--> James I to <!--del_lnk--> James VII.<p>Notable religious buildings are <!--del_lnk--> the Kirk of St Nicholas, in the centre of the city, with a large <!--del_lnk--> kirkyard separated from <!--del_lnk--> Union Street by a 147&nbsp;foot (45&nbsp;m) long Ionic facade, built in 1830. The divided church within, with a central tower and spire, forms one continuous building 220&nbsp;feet (67&nbsp;m) in length. In <!--del_lnk--> Old Aberdeen, <!--del_lnk--> St. Machar&#39;s Cathedral was started in the 12th century but took centuries to complete with the exception of the period of the episcopates of <!--del_lnk--> William Elphinstone and <!--del_lnk--> Gavin Dunbar, who completed the structure by adding the two western spires and the southern transept.<p>The ancient <!--del_lnk--> Brig o&#39; Balgownie, a picturesque single arch spanning the deep black stream, is said to have been built by <!--del_lnk--> King Robert I. The Bridge of Dee consists of seven semicircular ribbed arches, is about 30&nbsp;feet (10&nbsp;m) high, and was built early in the 16th century by Bishops <!--del_lnk--> Elphinstone and <!--del_lnk--> Dunbar. It was nearly all rebuilt in 1718-1723 and in 1842 was widened from 14 to 26&nbsp;feet (4 to 8&nbsp;m) wide.<div class="center">

      <p>Traditionally, Aberdeen was home to fishing, textile mills, ship building and paper making. These industries have all but gone now and have been replaced. High technology developments in the electronics design and development industry, research in agriculture and fishing and of course the <!--del_lnk--> oil industry, which has been largely responsible for Aberdeen&#39;s economic boom in the last three decades, are now major parts of Aberdeen&#39;s economy.<p>Until the 1970s, most of Aberdeen&#39;s leading industries dated from the 18th Century; mainly these were textiles, foundry work, shipbuilding and <!--del_lnk--> paper-making &amp;mdash, the oldest industry in the city, with paper having been first made there in 1694. Paper-making has reduced in importance since the closures of Donside Paper Mill in 2001 and the Davidson Mill in 2005 leaving the Stoneywood Paper Mill with a workforce of approximately 500. Textile production ended in 2004 when <!--del_lnk--> Richards of Aberdeen closed.<p>Grey granite was <!--del_lnk--> quarried at <!--del_lnk--> Rubislaw quarry for more than 300 years, and used for paving setts, kerb and building stones, and monumental and other ornamental pieces. Aberdeen granite was used to build the terraces of the <!--del_lnk--> Houses of Parliament and <!--del_lnk--> Waterloo Bridge in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>. Quarrying finally ceased in 1971.<p>Fishing was once the predominant industry, but was surpassed by deep-sea fisheries, which derived a great impetus from improved technologies throughout the 20th Century. Catches have fallen due to overfishing and the use of the harbour by oil support vessels,  and so although still an mportant fishing port it is now eclipsed by the more northerly ports of <!--del_lnk--> Peterhead and <!--del_lnk--> Fraserburgh. The <!--del_lnk--> Fisheries Research Services is based in Aberdeen, including its headquarters, and a marine research lab in Torry.<p>Aberdeen is well regarded for the agricultural and soil research that takes place at <!--del_lnk--> The Macaulay Institute, which has close links to the city&#39;s two universities. The <!--del_lnk--> Rowett Research Institute is a world renowned research centre for studies into food and nutrition located in Aberdeen. It has produced three Nobel laureates and there is a high concentration of <!--del_lnk--> life scientists working in the city.<p>There is also a dynamic and fast growing electronics design and development industry.<p>With the discovery of significant <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea_oil.htm" title="North Sea oil">oil deposits</a> in the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea.htm" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> during the late 20th Century, Aberdeen became the centre of <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>&#39;s <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> industry. With the second largest heliport in the world and an important service ship harbour port serving <!--del_lnk--> oil rigs off-shore, Aberdeen is often called the <i>Oil Capital of Europe</i>.<p>Local political attempts have been made to turn Aberdeen&#39;s reputation as the <i>Oil Capital of Europe</i> into the <i>Energy Capital of Europe</i> as oil supplies may start to dwindle in coming years, and there is considerable interest in the development of new energy sources; technology transfer from oil to other industries is anticipated.<p>Aberdeen has managed to avoid the dilapidation of city centres as often seen in the late 20th century, with only supermarkets and &quot;warehouse&quot; style stores in the outlying areas of the city. The city ranks fourth in Scotland for shopping. The centre has remained relatively prosperous, although Union Street has more than its fair share of discount stores and empty units. The traditional shopping streets are <!--del_lnk--> Union Street and George Street which are now backed up by inner-city shopping centres, notably the <!--del_lnk--> Bon Accord-St Nicholas Centre and the <!--del_lnk--> The Mall Trinity.<p><a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h2>

      <p>Aberdeen has two universities, the <!--del_lnk--> University of Aberdeen and <!--del_lnk--> Robert Gordon University. Aberdeen has a higher student rate than the national average of 11.5% compared to 7% nationally.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> University of Aberdeen began life as <!--del_lnk--> King&#39;s College, Aberdeen, which was founded in 1495 by <!--del_lnk--> William Elphinstone (1431-1514), <!--del_lnk--> Bishop of Aberdeen and Chancellor of Scotland. <!--del_lnk--> Marischal College, a separate institution, was founded in &quot;New&quot; Aberdeen by George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal of Scotland in 1593. These institutions were amalgamated to form the present University of Aberdeen in 1860. The university is the fifth oldest in the English speaking world.<p><!--del_lnk--> Robert Gordon&#39;s College (originally Robert Gordon&#39;s Hospital) was founded in 1729 by the merchant <!--del_lnk--> Robert Gordon, grandson of the map maker Robert Gordon of Straloch, and was further endowed in 1816 by Alexander Simpson of Collyhill. Originally devoted to the instruction and maintenance of the sons of poor burgesses of guild and trade in the city, it was reorganised in 1881 as a day and night school for secondary and technical education. In 1903, the vocational education component of the college was designated a <!--del_lnk--> Central Institution and was renamed as the Robert Gordon Institute of Technology in 1965. In 1992, university status was gained and it became the <!--del_lnk--> Robert Gordon University.<p>Aberdeen is also home to two artistic schools: <!--del_lnk--> Gray&#39;s School of Art, founded in 1886, which is one of the oldest established colleges of art in the UK, and is now incorporated into Robert Gordon University; and <!--del_lnk--> The Scott Sutherland School of Architecture and The Built Environment, which is situated on the Garthdee Campus of the Robert Gordon University, next to Gray&#39;s School of Art.<p><!--del_lnk--> Aberdeen College has several campuses in the city and offers a wide variety of part-time and full-time courses leading to several different qualifications. It is the largest further education institution in Scotland.<p><a id="Schools" name="Schools"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Schools</span></h3>
      <p>There are currently 12 secondary schools and 54 primary schools which are run by the city council.

In 2001 the UK <!--del_lnk--> census records the <!--del_lnk--> Aberdeen City Council area&#39;s population at 212,125, but the Aberdeen locality&#39;s population at 184,788. The latest official population estimate, published by the General Register for Scotland for 2005, is 202,370. Data from the Aberdeen specific locality of the 2001 UK census shows that the demographics include a median male age of 35 and female age of 38 which are younger than Scotland&#39;s average and a 49% to 51% male to female ratio.<p>The census showed that there are less young people in Aberdeen, with 16.4&nbsp;% under 16, opposed to the national average of 19.2&nbsp;%. Ethnically, 15.7&nbsp;% were born outside of Scotland, higher than the national average of 12.9&nbsp;%. Of this population 8.4&nbsp;% were born in England. 3&nbsp;% of Aberdonians stated to be from an ethnic minority (non-white) in the 2001 census, with 0.7% from the Indian-subcontinent and 0.6% Asian, in comparison Scotland&#39;s overall population of non-white origin is 2&nbsp;%.

The city won the 2006 Scotland in Bloom &quot;Best City&quot; award along with the International Cities in Bloom award. The suburb of <!--del_lnk--> Dyce also won the Small Towns award.<p><!--del_lnk--> Duthie Park opened in 1899 on the north bank of the <!--del_lnk--> river Dee.

There are football pitches, two golf courses, a pitch and putt course and a horse riding school.<p>Aberdeen&#39;s success in the Britain in Bloom competitions is often attributed to <!--del_lnk--> Johnston Gardens, a small park of one hectare in the west end of the city containing many different flowers and plants which have been renowned for their beauty. The garden was in 2002, named the best garden in <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">Britain</a>.<p><!--del_lnk--> Seaton Park, formerly the grounds of a private house, is on the edge of the grounds of <!--del_lnk--> St Machar&#39;s Cathedral. The Cathedral Walk is maintained in a formal style with a great variety of plants providing a popular display. The park includes several other areas with contrasting styles to this.<p><!--del_lnk--> Union Terrace Gardens opened in 1879 and is situated in the centre of the city. It is a popular rendezvous location in the heart of the city with locals, in particular students and other young locals and is filled with trees of over 200 years old and flowers arranged in the city&#39;s coat of arms in summer.<p>Situated next to each other, <!--del_lnk--> Victoria Park and <!--del_lnk--> Westburn Park cover 26 acres between them. <!--del_lnk--> Victoria Park opened in 1871.

      <p>The local dialect of <!--del_lnk--> Lowland Scots is often known as the <i>Doric</i>, and is spoken not just in the city, but across the north-east of Scotland. It differs somewhat from other Scots dialects most noticeable are the pronunciation <i>f</i> for what is normally written <i>wh</i> and <i>ee</i> for what in standard English would usually be written <i>oo</i> (Scots <i>ui</i>). Every year the annual Doric Festival takes place in Aberdeenshire to celebrate the history of the north-east&#39;s language.<p>As with all Scots dialects in urban areas, it is not spoken as widely as it used to be in Aberdeen.
