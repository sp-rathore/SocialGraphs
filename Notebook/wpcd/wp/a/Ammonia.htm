      <p><b>Ammonia</b> is a <!--del_lnk--> compound of <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen.htm" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a> and <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> with the <!--del_lnk--> formula <b>NH<sub>3</sub></b>. At <!--del_lnk--> standard temperature and pressure, ammonia is a <a href="../../wp/g/Gas.htm" title="Gas">gas</a>. It is <!--del_lnk--> toxic and <!--del_lnk--> corrosive to some materials, and has a characteristic pungent <!--del_lnk--> odour. Ammonia used commercially can be <i>anhydrous ammonia</i> (not dissolved in water) or an aqueous solution of ammonia and water referred to as <!--del_lnk--> ammonium hydroxide. <i>Anhydrous ammonia</i> must be stored under pressure or at low temperature to remain a liquid. <!--del_lnk--> Ammonium hydroxide strength is measured in units of <!--del_lnk--> baume (density), with 26 degrees baume (about 30 weight percent ammonia at 15.5 &deg;C) being the typical high concentration commercial product. Household ammonia ranges in concentration from 5 to 10 weight percent ammonia. See <!--del_lnk--> Baum&eacute; scale.<p>An ammonia molecule has a <!--del_lnk--> trigonal pyramid shape, as predicted by <!--del_lnk--> VSEPR theory. This shape gives the molecule an overall <!--del_lnk--> dipole moment, and makes it <!--del_lnk--> polar so that ammonia readily dissolves in <!--del_lnk--> water. The nitrogen atom in the molecule has a <!--del_lnk--> lone electron pair, and ammonia acts as a <!--del_lnk--> base. That means that, when in aqueous solution, it can take a <a href="../../wp/p/Proton.htm" title="Proton">proton</a> from water to produce a <!--del_lnk--> hydroxide <!--del_lnk--> anion and an <!--del_lnk--> ammonium <!--del_lnk--> cation (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), which has the shape of a regular <!--del_lnk--> tetrahedron. The degree to which ammonia forms the ammonium ion depends on the <!--del_lnk--> pH of the <!--del_lnk--> solution&mdash;at &quot;physiological&quot; pH (~7), about 99% of the ammonia molecules are <!--del_lnk--> protonated.<p>The main uses of ammonia are in the production of <a href="../../wp/f/Fertilizer.htm" title="Fertilizer">fertilizers</a>, <!--del_lnk--> explosives and <!--del_lnk--> polymers. It is also the active ingredient in household glass cleaners. Ammonia is found in small quantities in the atmosphere, being produced from the <!--del_lnk--> putrefaction of <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen.htm" title="Nitrogen">nitrogenous</a> animal and vegetable matter. Ammonia and ammonium salts are also found in small quantities in rainwater, while <!--del_lnk--> ammonium chloride (sal-ammoniac) and <!--del_lnk--> ammonium sulfate are found in volcanic districts; crystals of <!--del_lnk--> ammonium bicarbonate have been found in <!--del_lnk--> Patagonian <!--del_lnk--> guano. The kidneys excrete NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> to neutralize excess acid.  Ammonium salts also are found distributed through all fertile soil and in seawater. Substances containing ammonia, or that are similar to it, are called <i>ammoniacal</i>.<p>

      <p>Salts of ammonia have been known from very early times; thus the term <i>Hammoniacus sal</i> appears in the writings of <!--del_lnk--> Pliny, although it is not known whether the term is identical with the more modern <i>sal-ammoniac</i>.<p>In the form of sal-ammoniac, ammonia was known to the <a href="../../wp/a/Alchemy.htm" title="Alchemy">alchemists</a> as early as the 13th century, being mentioned by <!--del_lnk--> Albertus Magnus. It was also used by <!--del_lnk--> dyers in the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> in the form of fermented <!--del_lnk--> urine to alter the colour of vegetable dyes. In the 15th century, <!--del_lnk--> Basilius Valentinus showed that ammonia could be obtained by the action of alkalis on sal-ammoniac. At a later period, when sal-ammoniac was obtained by distilling the hoofs and horns of oxen and neutralizing the resulting carbonate with <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrochloric_acid.htm" title="Hydrochloric acid">hydrochloric acid</a>, the name &quot;spirit of hartshorn&quot; was applied to ammonia.<p>Gaseous ammonia was first isolated by <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Priestley in 1774 and was termed by him <i>alkaline air</i>; however it was acquired by the alchemist <!--del_lnk--> Basil Valentine. Eleven years later in 1785, <!--del_lnk--> Claude Louis Berthollet ascertained its composition.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Haber process to produce ammonia from the nitrogen contained in the air was developed by <!--del_lnk--> Fritz Haber and <!--del_lnk--> Carl Bosch in 1909 and patented in 1910. It was first used on an industrial scale by the Germans during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, following the allied blockade that cut off the supply of nitrates from <a href="../../wp/c/Chile.htm" title="Chile">Chile</a>. The ammonia was used to produce explosives to sustain their war effort.<p><a id="Synthesis_and_production" name="Synthesis_and_production"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Synthesis and production</span></h2>
      <p>Because of its many uses, ammonia is one of the most highly produced inorganic chemicals. There are dozens of chemical plants worldwide that produce ammonia. The worldwide <!--del_lnk--> ammonia production in 2004 was 109 million <!--del_lnk--> metric tonnes. the <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">People&#39;s Republic of China</a> produced 28.4% of the worldwide production followed by <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> with 8.6%, <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> with 8.4%, and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> with 8.2%. About 80% or more of the ammonia produced is used for fertilizing agricultural crops.<p>Before the start of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> most ammonia was obtained by the dry <!--del_lnk--> distillation of nitrogenous vegetable and animal waste products, including <a href="../../wp/c/Camel.htm" title="Camel">camel</a> <!--del_lnk--> dung where it was <!--del_lnk--> distilled by the reduction of <!--del_lnk--> nitrous acid and <!--del_lnk--> nitrites with <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a>; additionally, it was produced by the distillation of <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a>; and also by the decomposition of ammonium salts by <!--del_lnk--> alkaline hydroxides such as <!--del_lnk--> quicklime, the salt most generally used being the chloride (<!--del_lnk--> sal-ammoniac) thus:<dl>
       <dd>
        <dl>

      </dl>
      <p>Today, the typical modern ammonia-producing plant first converts <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_gas.htm" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a> (i.e. <!--del_lnk--> methane) or <!--del_lnk--> liquified petroleum gas (such gases are <!--del_lnk--> propane and <!--del_lnk--> butane) or petroleum <!--del_lnk--> naphtha into gaseous <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a>. Starting with a natural gas feedstock, the processes used in producing the hydrogen are:<ul>
       <li>The first step in the process is to remove <a href="../../wp/s/Sulfur.htm" title="Sulfur">sulfur</a> compounds from the feedstock because sulfur deactivates the <!--del_lnk--> catalysts used in subsequent steps. Sulfur removal requires catalytic <!--del_lnk--> hydrogenation to convert sulfur compounds in the feedstocks to gaseous <!--del_lnk--> hydrogen sulfide:</ul>
      <dl>
       <dd>
        <dl>
         <dd>H<sub>2</sub> + RSH &rarr; RH + H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>(<i>g</i>)</sub></dl>
      </dl>
      <ul>
       <li>The gaseous hydrogen sulfide is then absorbed and removed by passing it through beds of <!--del_lnk--> zinc oxide where it is converted to solid <!--del_lnk--> zinc sulfide:</ul>
      <dl>
       <dd>
        <dl>
         <dd>H<sub>2</sub>S + ZnO &rarr; ZnS + H<sub>2</sub>O</dl>
      </dl>
      <ul>
       <li>Catalytic <!--del_lnk--> steam reforming of the sulfur-free feedstock is then used to form hydrogen plus <!--del_lnk--> carbon monoxide:</ul>
      <dl>
       <dd>
        <dl>
         <dd>CH<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; CO + 3 H<sub>2</sub></dl>
      </dl>
      <ul>
       <li>The next step then uses catalytic <!--del_lnk--> shift conversion to convert the <!--del_lnk--> carbon monoxide to <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> and more hydrogen:</ul>
      <dl>
       <dd>
        <dl>
         <dd>CO + H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub></dl>
      </dl>
      <ul>
       <li>The carbon dioxide is then removed either by absorption in aqueous <!--del_lnk--> ethanolamine solutions or by <!--del_lnk--> adsorption in <!--del_lnk--> pressure swing adsorbers (PSA) using proprietary solid adsorption media.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>The final step in producing the hydrogen is to use catalytic methanation to remove any small residual amounts of carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide from the hydrogen:</ul>
      <dl>
       <dd>
        <dl>
         <dd>CO + 3 H<sub>2</sub> &rarr; CH<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<dd>CO<sub>2</sub> + 4 H<sub>2</sub> &rarr; CH<sub>4</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O</dl>
      </dl>
      <ul>
       <li>To produce the desired end-product ammonia, the hydrogen is then catalytically reacted with nitrogen (derived from process air) to form anhydrous liquid ammonia. This step is known as the ammonia synthesis loop (also referred to as the <!--del_lnk--> Haber-Bosch process):</ul>
      <dl>
       <dd>
        <dl>
         <dd>3 H<sub>2</sub> + N<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 2 NH<sub>3</sub></dl>
      </dl>
      <p>The steam reforming, shift conversion, carbon dioxide removal and methanation steps each operate at absolute pressures of about 25 to 35 <!--del_lnk--> bar, and the ammonia synthesis loop operates at absolute pressures ranging from 60 to 180 bar depending upon which proprietary design is used. There are many engineering and construction companies that offer proprietary designs for ammonia synthesis plants. <!--del_lnk--> Haldor Topsoe of <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Lurgi AG of <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Kellogg, Brown and Root of the United States are among the most experienced companies in that field.<p><a id="Biosynthesis" name="Biosynthesis"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Biosynthesis</span></h2>
      <p>In certain organisms, ammonia is produced from atmospheric N<sub>2</sub> by <!--del_lnk--> enzymes called <!--del_lnk--> nitrogenases. The overall process is called <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen_fixation.htm" title="Nitrogen fixation">nitrogen fixation</a>. Although it is unlikely that biomimetic methods will be developed that are competitive with the <!--del_lnk--> Haber process, intense effort has been directed toward understanding the mechanism of biological nitrogen fixation. The scientific interest in this problem is motivated by the unusual structure of the active site of the enzyme, which consists of an Fe<sub>7</sub>MoS<sub>9</sub> ensemble.<p>Ammonia is also a metabolic product of <!--del_lnk--> amino acid <!--del_lnk--> deamination.

      <p>Ammonia is a colourless <a href="../../wp/g/Gas.htm" title="Gas">gas</a> with a characteristic pungent smell; it is <!--del_lnk--> lighter than air, its density being 0.589 times that of <a href="../../wp/e/Earth%2527s_atmosphere.htm" title="Earth&#39;s atmosphere">air</a>. It is easily liquefied; the <!--del_lnk--> liquid boils at -33.3 &deg;C, and solidifies at -77.7 &deg;C to a mass of white crystals. <!--del_lnk--> Liquid ammonia possesses strong <!--del_lnk--> ionizing powers (<!--del_lnk--> &epsilon; = 22), and <!--del_lnk--> solutions of <a href="../../wp/s/Salt.htm" title="Salt">salts</a> in liquid ammonia have been much studied. Liquid ammonia has a very high <!--del_lnk--> standard enthalpy change of vaporization (23.35&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> kJ/mol, <i>c.f.</i> <!--del_lnk--> water 40.65&nbsp;kJ/mol, <!--del_lnk--> methane 8.19&nbsp;kJ/mol, <!--del_lnk--> phosphine 14.6&nbsp;kJ/mol) and can therefore be used in laboratories in non-insulated vessels at room temperature, even though it is well above its boiling point.<p>It is <!--del_lnk--> miscible with water. All the ammonia contained in an aqueous solution of the gas may be expelled by boiling. The <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">aqueous</a> solution of ammonia is <!--del_lnk--> basic. The maximum concentration of ammonia in water (a <!--del_lnk--> saturated solution) has a <!--del_lnk--> density of 0.880 g /<!--del_lnk--> cm&sup3; and is often known as &#39;.880 Ammonia&#39;. Ammonia does not sustain <!--del_lnk--> combustion, and it does not burn readily unless mixed with <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a>, when it burns with a pale yellowish-green flame. At high temperature and in the presence of a suitable catalyst, ammonia is decomposed into its constituent elements. <a href="../../wp/c/Chlorine.htm" title="Chlorine">Chlorine</a> catches fire when passed into ammonia, forming <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen.htm" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a> and <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrochloric_acid.htm" title="Hydrochloric acid">hydrochloric acid</a>; unless the ammonia is present in excess, the highly explosive <!--del_lnk--> nitrogen trichloride (NCl<sub>3</sub>) is also formed.<p>The ammonia molecule readily undergoes <!--del_lnk--> nitrogen inversion at room temperature - that is, the nitrogen atom passes through the <!--del_lnk--> plane of symmetry of the three hydrogen atoms; a useful analogy is an <!--del_lnk--> umbrella turning itself inside out in a strong wind. The energy barrier to this inversion is 24.7 kJ/mol in ammonia, and the <!--del_lnk--> resonance frequency is 23.79 <!--del_lnk--> GHz, corresponding to <!--del_lnk--> microwave radiation of a <!--del_lnk--> wavelength of 1.260 cm.

      <p>Although ammonia is well-known as a base, it can also act as an extremely weak <!--del_lnk--> acid.

      <p>Ammonia can act as a <!--del_lnk--> nucleophile in <!--del_lnk--> substitution reactions. <!--del_lnk--> Amines can be formed by the reaction of ammonia with <!--del_lnk--> alkyl halides, although the resulting &ndash;NH<sub>2</sub> group is also nucleophilic and secondary and tertiary amines are often formed as by-products. Using an excess of ammonia helps minimise multiple substitution, and neutralises the <!--del_lnk--> hydrogen halide formed. <!--del_lnk--> Methylamine is prepared commercially by the reaction of ammonia with <!--del_lnk--> chloromethane, and the reaction of ammonia with 2-bromopropanoic acid has been used to prepare <!--del_lnk--> racemic <!--del_lnk--> alanine in 70% yield. <!--del_lnk--> Ethanolamine is prepared by a ring-opening reaction with <!--del_lnk--> ethylene oxide: the reaction is sometimes allowed to go further to produce <!--del_lnk--> diethanolamine and <!--del_lnk--> triethanolamine.<p><!--del_lnk--> Amides can be prepared by the reaction of ammonia with a number of <!--del_lnk--> carboxylic acid derivatives. <!--del_lnk--> Acyl chlorides are the most reactive, but the ammonia must be present in at least a two-fold excess to neutralise the <!--del_lnk--> hydrogen chloride formed. <!--del_lnk--> Esters and <!--del_lnk--> anhydrides also react with ammonia to form amides. Ammonium salts of carboxylic acids can be <!--del_lnk--> dehydrated to amides so long as there are no thermally sensitive groups present: temperatures of 150&ndash;200 &deg;C are required.<p>The <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> in ammonia is capable of replacement by <a href="../../wp/m/Metal.htm" title="Metal">metals</a>, thus <a href="../../wp/m/Magnesium.htm" title="Magnesium">magnesium</a> burns in the gas with the formation of <!--del_lnk--> magnesium nitride Mg<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, and when the gas is passed over heated <a href="../../wp/s/Sodium.htm" title="Sodium">sodium</a> or <a href="../../wp/p/Potassium.htm" title="Potassium">potassium</a>, sodamide, NaNH<sub>2</sub>, and potassamide, KNH<sub>2</sub>, are formed.

      <p>Ammonia can act as a <!--del_lnk--> ligand in <!--del_lnk--> transition metal <!--del_lnk--> complexes. It is a pure &sigma;-donor, in the middle of the <!--del_lnk--> spectrochemical series, and shows intermediate <!--del_lnk--> hard-soft behaviour. For historical reasons, ammonia is named <b>ammine</b> in the nomenclature of <!--del_lnk--> coordination compounds. Some notable ammine complexes include:<ul>
       <li><b>Tetraaminecopper(II)</b>, [Cu(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>, a characteristic dark blue complex formed by adding ammonia to solution of copper(II) salts.<li><b>Diamminesilver(I)</b>, [Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>, the active species in <!--del_lnk--> Tollens&#39; reagent. Formation of this complex can also help to distinguish between precipitates of the different silver halides: <!--del_lnk--> AgCl is soluble in dilute (2M) ammonia solution, <!--del_lnk--> AgBr is only soluble in concentrated ammonia solution while <!--del_lnk--> AgI is insoluble in aqueous solution of ammonia.</ul>
      <p>Ammine complexes of <a href="../../wp/c/Chromium.htm" title="Chromium">chromium</a>(III) were known in the late 19th century, and formed the basis of <!--del_lnk--> Alfred Werner&#39;s theory of coordination compounds. Werner noted that only two isomers (<i>fac</i>- and <i>mer</i>-) of the complex [CrCl<sub>3</sub>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>] could be formed, and concluded that the ligands must be arranged around the metal ion at the <!--del_lnk--> vertices of an <!--del_lnk--> octahedron. This has since been confirmed by <!--del_lnk--> X-ray crystallography.<p>An ammine ligand bound to a metal ion is markedly more <!--del_lnk--> acidic than a free ammonia molecule, although deprotonation in aqueous solution is still rare. One example is the <!--del_lnk--> Calomel reaction, where the resulting amidomercury(II) compound is highly insoluble.<dl>

      <p>The most important single use of ammonia is in the production of <!--del_lnk--> nitric acid. A mixture of one part ammonia to nine parts air is passed over a <a href="../../wp/p/Platinum.htm" title="Platinum">platinum</a> gauze <!--del_lnk--> catalyst at 850 &deg;C, whereupon the ammonia is oxidized to <!--del_lnk--> nitric oxide.<dl>

      <p>The catalyst is essential, as the normal oxidation (or combustion) of ammonia gives <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen.htm" title="Nitrogen">dinitrogen</a> and water: the production of nitric oxide is an example of <!--del_lnk--> kinetic control. As the gas mixture cools to 200&ndash;250 &deg;C, the nitric oxide is in turn oxidized by the excess of <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> present in the mixture, to give <!--del_lnk--> nitrogen dioxide. This is reacted with water to give nitric acid for use in the production of <a href="../../wp/f/Fertilizer.htm" title="Fertilizer">fertilizers</a> and <!--del_lnk--> explosives.<p>In addition to serving as a fertilizer ingredient, ammonia can also be used directly as a fertilizer by forming a solution with irrigation water, without additional chemical processing. This later use allows the continuous growing of nitrogen dependent crops such as <a href="../../wp/m/Maize.htm" title="Maize">maize</a> (corn) without <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">crop</a> rotation but this type of use leads to poor <a href="../../wp/s/Soil.htm" title="Soil">soil</a> health.<p>Ammonia has thermodynamic properties that make it very well suited as a <!--del_lnk--> refrigerant, since it liquefies readily under pressure, and was used in virtually all refrigeration units prior to the advent of <!--del_lnk--> haloalkanes such as <!--del_lnk--> Freon. However, ammonia is a toxic irritant and its corrosiveness to any <a href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper">copper</a> <!--del_lnk--> alloys increases the risk that an undesirable leak may develop and cause a noxious hazard. Its use in small refrigeration units has been largely replaced by haloalkanes, which are not toxic irritants and are practically not <!--del_lnk--> flammable. Ammonia continues to be used as a <!--del_lnk--> refrigerant in large industrial processes such as bulk icemaking and industrial food processing. Ammonia is also useful as a component in <!--del_lnk--> absorption-type refrigerators, which do not use compression and expansion cycles but can exploit heat differences. Since the implication of haloalkane being major contributors to <a href="../../wp/o/Ozone_depletion.htm" title="Ozone depletion">ozone depletion</a>, ammonia is again seeing increasing use as a refrigerant.<p>It is also sometimes added to drinking water along with <a href="../../wp/c/Chlorine.htm" title="Chlorine">chlorine</a> to form <!--del_lnk--> chloramine, a <!--del_lnk--> disinfectant. Unlike chlorine on its own, chloramine does not combine with organic (carbon containing) materials to form <!--del_lnk--> carcinogenic <!--del_lnk--> halomethanes such as <!--del_lnk--> chloroform.<p>Liquid ammonia was used as the fuel of the rocket airplane, the <!--del_lnk--> X-15. Although not as powerful as other fuels, it left no soot in the reusable rocket engine, and has about the same <!--del_lnk--> density as the oxidizer, liquid oxygen, which simplified the aircraft&#39;s keeping the same centre of gravity in flight.<p>During the 1960s, <a href="../../wp/t/Tobacco.htm" title="Tobacco">Tobacco</a> companies such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Brown &amp; Williamson</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Philip Morris</i> began using ammonia in <!--del_lnk--> cigarettes.

      <p>Ammonia is an important source of nitrogen for living systems. Although atmospheric nitrogen abounds, few living creatures are capable of utilizing this nitrogen. Nitrogen is required for the synthesis of amino acids, which are the building blocks of <a href="../../wp/p/Protein.htm" title="Protein">protein</a>. Some plants rely on ammonia and other nitrogenous wastes incorporated into the soil by decaying matter. Others, such as nitrogen-fixing <!--del_lnk--> legumes, benefit from <!--del_lnk--> symbiotic relationships with <!--del_lnk--> rhizobia which create ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen.<p>Ammonia also plays a role in both normal and abnormal animal <!--del_lnk--> physiology. Ammonia is created through normal amino acid metabolism and is toxic in high concentrations. The <!--del_lnk--> liver converts ammonia to <!--del_lnk--> urea through a series of reactions known as the <!--del_lnk--> urea cycle. Liver dysfunction, such as that seen in <!--del_lnk--> cirrhosis, may lead to elevated amounts of ammonia in the blood (<!--del_lnk--> hyperammonemia). Likewise, defects in the enzymes responsible for the urea cycle, such as <!--del_lnk--> ornithine transcarbamylase, lead to hyperammonemia. Hyperammonemia contributes to the confusion and <!--del_lnk--> coma of <!--del_lnk--> hepatic encephalopathy as well as the neurologic disease common in people with urea cycle defects and <!--del_lnk--> organic acidurias.<p>Ammonia is important for normal animal acid/base balance. After formation of ammonium from <!--del_lnk--> glutamine, <!--del_lnk--> &alpha;-ketoglutarate may be degraded to produce two molecules of <!--del_lnk--> bicarbonate which are then available as buffers for dietary acids. Ammonium is excreted in the urine resulting in net acid loss. Ammonia may itself diffuse across the renal tubules, combine with a hydrogen ion, and thus allow for further acid excretion.<p><a id="Liquid_ammonia_as_a_solvent" name="Liquid_ammonia_as_a_solvent"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Liquid ammonia as a solvent</span></h2>
      <p>Liquid ammonia is the best-known and most widely studied non-aqueous ionizing solvent.

Comparison of the physical properties of NH<sub>3</sub> with those of water shows that NH<sub>3</sub> has the lower melting point, boiling point, density, <!--del_lnk--> viscosity, <!--del_lnk--> dielectric constant and <!--del_lnk--> electrical conductivity; this is due at least in part to the weaker H bonding in NH<sub>3</sub> and the fact that such bonding cannot form cross-linked networks since each NH<sub>3</sub> molecule has only 1 lone-pair of electrons compared with 2 for each H<sub>2</sub>O molecule.

      <p>The toxicity of ammonia solutions does not usually cause problems for humans and other mammals, as a specific mechanism exists to prevent its build-up in the bloodstream. Ammonia is converted to <!--del_lnk--> carbamoyl phosphate by the enzyme <!--del_lnk--> carbamoyl phosphate synthase, and then enters the <!--del_lnk--> urea cycle to be either incorporated into <!--del_lnk--> amino acids or excreted in the urine. However <a href="../../wp/f/Fish.htm" title="Fish">fish</a> and <!--del_lnk--> amphibians lack this mechanism, as they can usually eliminate ammonia from their bodies by direct excretion. Ammonia even at dilute concentrations is highly toxic to aquatic animals, and for this reason it is <!--del_lnk--> classified as <i>dangerous for the environment</i>. Ammonium compounds should never be allowed to come in contact with bases (unless an intended and contained reaction), as dangerous quantities of ammonia gas could be released.<p><a id="Household_use" name="Household_use"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Household use</span></h3>
      <p>Solutions of ammonia (5&ndash;10% by weight) are used as household cleaners, particularly for glass. These solutions are irritating to the eyes and <!--del_lnk--> mucous membranes (respiratory and digestive tracts), and to a lesser extent the skin. They should <b>never</b> be mixed with <a href="../../wp/c/Chlorine.htm" title="Chlorine">chlorine</a>-containing products or strong oxidants, for example household <!--del_lnk--> bleach, as a variety of toxic and <!--del_lnk--> carcinogenic compounds are formed (<i>e.g.</i>, <!--del_lnk--> chloramine, <!--del_lnk--> hydrazine, and chlorine gas).<p><a id="Laboratory_use_of_ammonia_solutions" name="Laboratory_use_of_ammonia_solutions"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Laboratory use of ammonia solutions</span></h3>
      <p>The hazards of ammonia solutions depend on the concentration: &quot;dilute&quot; ammonia solutions are usually 5&ndash;10% by weight (&lt;5.62 mol/L); &quot;concentrated&quot; solutions are usually prepared at &gt;25% by weight. A 25% (by weight) solution has a density of 0.907 g/cm&sup3;, and a solution which has a lower density will be more concentrated. The <!--del_lnk--> European Union classification of ammonia solutions is given in the table.<table class="wikitable">

      <p>The ammonia vapour from concentrated ammonia solutions is severely irritating to the eyes and the respiratory tract, and these solutions should only be handled in a fume hood. Saturated (&quot;0.880&quot;) solutions can develop a significant pressure inside a closed bottle in warm weather, and the bottle should be opened with care: this is not usually a problem for 25% (&quot;0.900&quot;) solutions.<p>Ammonia solutions should not be mixed with <!--del_lnk--> halogens, as toxic and/or explosive products are formed. Prolonged contact of ammonia solutions with <!--del_lnk--> silver, <a href="../../wp/m/Mercury_%2528element%2529.htm" title="Mercury (element)">mercury</a> or <!--del_lnk--> iodide salts can also lead to explosive products: such mixtures are often formed in <!--del_lnk--> qualitative chemical analysis, and should be acidified and diluted before disposal once the test is completed.<p><a id="Laboratory_use_of_anhydrous_ammonia_.28gas_or_liquid.29" name="Laboratory_use_of_anhydrous_ammonia_.28gas_or_liquid.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Laboratory use of anhydrous ammonia (gas or liquid)</span></h3>
      <p>Anhydrous ammonia is classified as <b>toxic</b> (<b>T</b>) and <b>dangerous for the environment</b> (<b>N</b>). The gas is flammable (<!--del_lnk--> autoignition temperature: 651 &deg;C) and can form explosive mixtures with air (16&ndash;25%). The <!--del_lnk--> permissible exposure limit (PEL) in the United States is 50&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ppm (35&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup>), while the <!--del_lnk--> IDLH concentration is estimated at 300&nbsp;ppm. Repeated exposure to ammonia lowers the sensitivity to the smell of the gas: normally the odour is detectable at concentrations of less than 0.5&nbsp;ppm, but desensitized individuals may not detect it even at concentrations of 100&nbsp;ppm. Anhydrous ammonia corrodes <!--del_lnk--> copper- and <!--del_lnk--> zinc-containing <!--del_lnk--> alloys, and so <!--del_lnk--> brass fittings should not be used for handling the gas. Liquid ammonia can also attack rubber and certain plastics.<p>Ammonia reacts violently with the halogens, and causes the explosive <!--del_lnk--> polymerization of <!--del_lnk--> ethylene oxide. It also forms explosive compounds with compounds of <!--del_lnk--> gold, <a href="../../wp/s/Silver.htm" title="Silver">silver</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Mercury_%2528element%2529.htm" title="Mercury (element)">mercury</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Germanium.htm" title="Germanium">germanium</a> or <a href="../../wp/t/Tellurium.htm" title="Tellurium">tellurium</a>, and with <!--del_lnk--> stibine. Violent reactions have also been reported with <!--del_lnk--> acetaldehyde, <!--del_lnk--> hypochlorite solutions, <!--del_lnk--> potassium ferricyanide and <!--del_lnk--> peroxides.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia&quot;</div>
