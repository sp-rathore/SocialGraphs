      <p>Aluminium is a soft, lightweight <a href="../../wp/m/Metal.htm" title="Metal">metal</a> with normally a dull silvery appearance caused by a thin layer of <!--del_lnk--> oxidation that forms quickly when the metal is exposed to air. Aluminium oxide has a higher melting point than pure aluminium. Aluminium is nontoxic (as the metal), nonmagnetic, and nonsparking. It has a tensile strength of about 49 megapascals (MPa) in a pure state and 400 MPa as an alloy. Aluminium is about one-third as dense as <a href="../../wp/s/Steel.htm" title="Steel">steel</a> or <a href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper">copper</a>; it is <!--del_lnk--> malleable, <!--del_lnk--> ductile, and easily machined and cast. It has excellent <a href="../../wp/c/Corrosion.htm" title="Corrosion">corrosion</a> resistance and durability because of the protective oxide layer. Aluminium mirror finish has the highest reflectance of any metal in the 200-400 nm (UV) and the 3000-10000 nm (far IR) regions, while in the 400-700 nm visible range it is slightly outdone by <a href="../../wp/s/Silver.htm" title="Silver">silver</a> and in the 700-3000 (near IR) by <a href="../../wp/s/Silver.htm" title="Silver">silver</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a>, and <a href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper">copper</a>. It is the second-most malleable metal (after <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a>) and the sixth-most <!--del_lnk--> ductile. Aluminium is a good <!--del_lnk--> heat conductor.<div style="float:right;width:208px;">

      <p>Whether measured in terms of quantity or value, the use of aluminium exceeds that of any other metal except <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a>, and it is important in virtually all segments of the world economy.<p>Pure aluminium has a low <!--del_lnk--> tensile strength, but readily forms <!--del_lnk--> alloys with many elements such as <a href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper">copper</a>, <a href="../../wp/z/Zinc.htm" title="Zinc">zinc</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Magnesium.htm" title="Magnesium">magnesium</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Manganese.htm" title="Manganese">manganese</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Silicon.htm" title="Silicon">silicon</a> (e.g., <!--del_lnk--> duralumin). Today almost all materials that claim to be aluminium are actually an alloy thereof. Pure aluminium is encountered only when corrosion resistance is more important than strength or hardness.<p>When combined with thermo-mechanical processing aluminium <!--del_lnk--> alloys display a marked improvement in mechanical properties. Aluminium alloys form vital components of <a href="../../wp/a/Aircraft.htm" title="Aircraft">aircraft</a> and <!--del_lnk--> rockets as a result of their high strength to weight ratio.<p>Aluminium is an excellent reflector (approximately 99%) of <!--del_lnk--> visible light and a good reflector (approximately 95%) of <!--del_lnk--> infrared. A thin layer of aluminium can be deposited onto a flat surface by <!--del_lnk--> chemical vapor deposition or chemical means to form <!--del_lnk--> optical coatings and <!--del_lnk--> mirrors. These coatings form an even thinner layer of protective aluminium oxide that does not deteriorate as <a href="../../wp/s/Silver.htm" title="Silver">silver</a> coatings do.

      <p>Aluminium alloys with a wide range of properties are used in engineering structures. Alloy systems are classified by a number system (<!--del_lnk--> ANSI) or by names indicating their main alloying constituents (<!--del_lnk--> DIN and <!--del_lnk--> ISO). Selecting the right alloy for a given application entails considerations of strength, <!--del_lnk--> ductility, formability, <!--del_lnk--> weldability and <a href="../../wp/c/Corrosion.htm" title="Corrosion">corrosion</a> resistance to name a few. A brief historical overview of alloys and manufacturing technologies is given in Ref. Aluminium is used extensively in modern aircraft due to its light weight.<p>Improper use of aluminium can result in problems, particularly in contrast to <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a> or <a href="../../wp/s/Steel.htm" title="Steel">steel</a>, which appear &quot;better behaved&quot; to the intuitive designer, mechanic, or technician. The reduction by two thirds of the weight of an aluminium part compared to a similarly sized iron or steel part seems enormously attractive, but it should be noted that it is accompanied by a reduction by two thirds in the stiffness of the part. Therefore, although direct replacement of an <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a> or <a href="../../wp/s/Steel.htm" title="Steel">steel</a> part with a duplicate made from aluminium may still give acceptable strength to withstand peak loads, the increased flexibility will cause three times more deflection in the part.<p>Where failure is not an issue but excessive flex is undesirable due to requirements for precision of location or efficiency of transmission of power, simple replacement of steel tubing with similarly sized aluminium tubing will result in a degree of flex which is undesirable; for instance, the increased flex under operating loads caused by replacing steel bicycle frame tubing with aluminium tubing of identical dimensions will cause misalignment of the power-train as well as absorbing the operating force. To increase the rigidity by increasing the thickness of the walls of the tubing increases the weight proportionately, so that the advantages of lighter weight are lost as the rigidity is restored.<p>Aluminium can best be used by redesigning the part to suit its characteristics; for instance making a bicycle of aluminium tubing which has an oversize diameter rather than thicker walls. In this way, rigidity can be restored or even enhanced without increasing weight. The limit to this process is the increase in susceptibility to what is termed &quot;<!--del_lnk--> buckling&quot; failure, where the deviation of the force from any direction other than directly along the axis of the tubing causes folding of the walls of the tubing.<p>The latest models of the <!--del_lnk--> Corvette automobile, among others, are a good example of redesigning parts to make best use of aluminium&#39;s advantages. The aluminium chassis members and suspension parts of these cars have large overall dimensions for stiffness but are lightened by reducing cross-sectional area and removing unneeded metal; as a result, they are not only equally or more durable and stiff as the usual steel parts, but they possess an airy gracefulness which most people find attractive. Similarly, aluminium bicycle frames can be optimally designed so as to provide rigidity where required, yet have flexibility in terms of absorbing the shock of bumps from the road and not transmitting them to the rider.<p>The strength and durability of aluminium varies widely, not only as a result of the components of the specific alloy, but also as a result of the particular manufacturing process; for this reason, it has from time to time gained a bad reputation. For instance, a high frequency of failure in many early aluminium bicycle frames in the 1970s resulted in just such a poor reputation; with a moment&#39;s reflection, however, the widespread use of aluminium components in the aerospace and automotive high performance industries, where huge stresses are undergone with vanishingly small failure rates, proves that properly built aluminium bicycle components should not be unusually unreliable, and this has subsequently proved to be the case.<p>Similarly, use of aluminium in automotive applications, particularly in engine parts which must survive in difficult conditions, has benefited from development over time. An <!--del_lnk--> Audi engineer commented about the V12 engine, producing over 500 horsepower (370 kW), of an <!--del_lnk--> Auto Union race car of the 1930s which was recently restored by the Audi factory, that the aluminium alloy of which the engine was constructed would today be used only for lawn furniture and the like. Even the aluminium <!--del_lnk--> cylinder heads and <!--del_lnk--> crankcase of the <!--del_lnk--> Corvair, built as recently as the 1960s, earned a reputation for failure and stripping of <!--del_lnk--> threads in holes, even as large as <!--del_lnk--> spark plug holes, which is not seen in current aluminium cylinder heads.<p><a id="Heat_sensitivity" name="Heat_sensitivity"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Heat sensitivity</span></h4>
      <p>Often, the metal&#39;s sensitivity to heat must also be considered. Even a relatively routine workshop procedure involving heating is complicated by the fact that aluminium, unlike steel, will melt without first turning red. Forming operations where a <!--del_lnk--> blow torch is used therefore requires some expertise since no visual signs reveal how close the material is to melting.<p>Aluminium also is subject to internal stresses and strains when it is overheated; the tendency of the metal to <!--del_lnk--> creep under these stresses tends to result in delayed distortions. For instance, the warping or cracking of overheated aluminium automobile cylinder heads is commonly observed, sometimes years later, as is the tendency of welded aluminium bicycle frames to gradually twist out of alignment from the stresses of the welding process. Thus, aerospace uses of aluminium avoid heat altogether by joining parts with <!--del_lnk--> adhesives or mechanical fasteners. These adhesive junctures were used for some bicycle frames in the 1970s &mdash; with unfortunate results when the aluminium tubing corroded slightly, loosening the adhesive and collapsing the frame.<p>Stresses in overheated aluminium can be relieved by heat-treating the parts in an oven and gradually cooling it &mdash; in effect <!--del_lnk--> annealing the stresses. Yet these parts can still become distorted, so that heat-treating of welded bicycle frames, for instance, can result in a significant fraction becoming misaligned. If the misalignment is not too severe, the cooled parts can be bent into alignment; of course, if the frame is properly designed for rigidity (see above), that bending will require enormous force.<p>Aluminium&#39;s intolerance to high temperatures has not precluded its use in rocketry; even for use for constructing combustion chambers where gases can reach 3500K. The <!--del_lnk--> Agena upper stage engine used a regeneratively cooled aluminium design for some parts of the nozzle, including the thermally critical throat region; in fact the extremely high thermal conductivity of aluminium prevented the throat from reaching the melting point even under massive heat flux, and good reliability and light weight resulted.<p><a id="Household_wiring" name="Household_wiring"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Household wiring</span></h3>
      <p>Because of its high conductivity and relatively low price compared to <a href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper">copper</a> in the 1960s, aluminium was introduced at that time for household electrical wiring in the United States even though many fixtures had not been designed to accept aluminium wire. But the new use brought some problems:<ul>
       <li>The greater <!--del_lnk--> coefficient of thermal expansion of aluminium causes the wire to expand and contract relative to the dissimilar metal <a href="../../wp/s/Screw.htm" title="Screw">screw</a> connection, eventually loosening the connection.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>Pure aluminium has a tendency to &quot;creep&quot; under steady sustained pressure (to a greater degree as the temperature rises), again loosening the connection.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Galvanic corrosion from the dissimilar metals increases the electrical resistance of the connection.</ul>
      <p>All of this resulted in overheated connections, and fires broke out. Builders then became wary of using the wire, and many jurisdictions outlawed its use in very small sizes in new construction. Yet newer fixtures eventually were introduced with connections designed to avoid loosening and overheating. At first they were marked &quot;Al/Cu&quot;, but they now bear a &quot;CO/ALR&quot; coding. Another way to forestall the heating problem is to <!--del_lnk--> crimp the aluminium wire to a short &quot;<!--del_lnk--> pigtail&quot; of copper wire. A properly done high-pressure crimp by the proper tool is tight enough to eliminate any thermal expansion of the aluminium and to exclude any atmospheric <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a>, thus preventing corrosion between the dissimilar metals. Today, new alloys are used for aluminium wiring in combination with aluminium terminations. Connections made with these products are as safe as those made with copper.<dl>

In 1761 <!--del_lnk--> Guyton de Morveau suggested calling the base alum <i>alumine.</i> In 1808, <a href="../../wp/h/Humphry_Davy.htm" title="Humphry Davy">Humphry Davy</a> identified the existence of a metal base of alum, which he at first named <i>alumium</i> and later <i>aluminium</i> (see Spelling section, below).<p><!--del_lnk--> Friedrich W&ouml;hler is generally credited with isolating aluminium (<a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>alumen</i>, <!--del_lnk--> alum) in 1827 by mixing anhydrous <a href="../../wp/a/Aluminium_chloride.htm" title="Aluminium chloride">aluminium chloride</a> with <a href="../../wp/p/Potassium.htm" title="Potassium">potassium</a>.

      <p>Aluminium was selected as the material to be used for the apex of the <!--del_lnk--> Washington Monument, at a time when one <!--del_lnk--> ounce cost twice the daily wages of a common worker in the project; aluminium was a semiprecious metal at that time.<p>The American <!--del_lnk--> Charles Martin Hall of <!--del_lnk--> Oberlin, Ohio applied for a <!--del_lnk--> patent (400655) in 1886 for an electrolytic process to extract aluminium using the same technique that was independently being developed by the Frenchman <!--del_lnk--> Paul H&eacute;roult in Europe. The invention of the <!--del_lnk--> Hall-H&eacute;roult process in 1886 made extracting aluminium from minerals cheaper, and is now the principal method in common use throughout the world.

      <p>Although aluminium is the most abundant metallic element in Earth&#39;s crust (believed to be 7.5% to 8.1%), it is very rare in its free form, occurring in oxygen-deficient environments such as volcanic mud, and it was once considered a <!--del_lnk--> precious metal more valuable than <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Napoleon III of France had a set of aluminium plates reserved for his finest guests. Others had to make do with gold ones. Aluminium has been produced in commercial quantities for just over 100 years. <sup>[<i><!--del_lnk--> citations needed</i>]</sup><p>Recovery of the metal via <a href="../../wp/r/Recycling.htm" title="Recycling">recycling</a> has become an important facet of the aluminium industry. Recycling involves melting the scrap, a process that uses only five percent of the energy needed to produce aluminium from ore. Recycling was a low-profile activity until the late 1960s, when the growing use of aluminium <!--del_lnk--> beverage cans brought it to the public consciousness.<p>Aluminium is a reactive metal that is difficult to extract from ore, <!--del_lnk--> aluminium oxide (Al<sub>2</sub><a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">O</a><sub>3</sub>). Direct reduction &mdash; with <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon.htm" title="Carbon">carbon</a>, for example &mdash; is not economically viable since aluminium oxide has a melting point of about 2,000 &deg;C. Therefore, it is extracted by <!--del_lnk--> electrolysis; that is, the aluminium oxide is dissolved in molten <!--del_lnk--> cryolite and then reduced to the pure metal. By this process, the operational temperature of the reduction cells is around 950 to 980 &deg;C. Cryolite is found as a mineral in Greenland, but in industrial use it has been replaced by a synthetic substance. Cryolite is a mixture of aluminium, <a href="../../wp/s/Sodium.htm" title="Sodium">sodium</a>, and <a href="../../wp/c/Calcium.htm" title="Calcium">calcium</a> <!--del_lnk--> fluorides: (Na<sub>3</sub>AlF<sub>6</sub>). The aluminium oxide (a white powder) is obtained by refining <!--del_lnk--> bauxite in the <!--del_lnk--> Bayer process. (Previously, the <!--del_lnk--> Deville process was the predominant refining technology.)<p>The electrolytic process replaced the <!--del_lnk--> W&ouml;hler process, which involved the reduction of anhydrous <a href="../../wp/a/Aluminium_chloride.htm" title="Aluminium chloride">aluminium chloride</a> with <a href="../../wp/p/Potassium.htm" title="Potassium">potassium</a>. Both of the <!--del_lnk--> electrodes used in the electrolysis of aluminium oxide are <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon.htm" title="Carbon">carbon</a>. Once the ore is in the molten state, its ions are free to move around. The reaction at the <!--del_lnk--> cathode &mdash; the negative terminal &mdash; is<dl>
       <dd>Al<sup>3+</sup> + 3 e<sup>-</sup> &rarr; Al</dl>
      <p>Here the aluminium ion is being <!--del_lnk--> reduced (electrons are added). The aluminium metal then sinks to the bottom and is tapped off.<p>At the positive electrode (<!--del_lnk--> anode), oxygen is formed:<dl>
       <dd>2 O<sup>2-</sup> &rarr; O<sub>2</sub> + 4 e<sup>-</sup></dl>
      <p>This carbon <!--del_lnk--> anode is then oxidised by the oxygen, releasing carbon dioxide. The anodes in a reduction must therefore be replaced regularly, since they are consumed in the process:<dl>
       <dd>O<sub>2</sub> + C &rarr; CO<sub>2</sub></dl>
      <p>Unlike the anodes, the cathodes are not oxidised because there is no oxygen present at the cathode. The carbon cathode is protected by the liquid aluminium inside the cells. Nevertheless, cathodes do erode, mainly due to electrochemical processes. After five to ten years, depending on the current used in the electrolysis, a cell has to be rebuilt because of cathode wear.<p>Aluminium <!--del_lnk--> electrolysis with the <!--del_lnk--> Hall-H&eacute;roult process consumes a lot of energy, but alternative processes were always found to be less viable economically and/or ecologically. The world-wide average specific energy consumption is approximately 15&plusmn;0.5 <!--del_lnk--> kilowatt-hours per kilogram of aluminium produced from alumina. (52 to 56 <!--del_lnk--> MJ/kg). The most modern smelters reach approximately 12.8 kW&middot;h/kg (46.1 MJ/kg). Reduction line current for older technologies are typically 100 to 200 kA. State-of-the-art smelters operate with about 350 kA. Trials have been reported with 500 kA cells.<p>Electric power represents about 20% to 40% of the cost of producing aluminium, depending on the location of the smelter. Smelters tend to be situated where electric power is both plentiful and inexpensive, such as <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> South Island of <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>, the <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">People&#39;s Republic of China</a>, the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Quebec and <!--del_lnk--> British Columbia in <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>, and <a href="../../wp/i/Iceland.htm" title="Iceland">Iceland</a>.

He wrote in the journal <i>Chemical Philosophy</i>: &quot;As yet Aluminium has not been obtained in a perfectly free state.&quot; But the same year, an anonymous contributor to the <i><!--del_lnk--> Quarterly Review,</i> a British political-literary journal, objected to <i>aluminium</i> and proposed the name <i>aluminium</i>, &quot;for so we shall take the liberty of writing the word, in preference to aluminium, which has a less classical sound.&quot; <p>The <i>-ium</i> suffix had the advantage of conforming to the precedent set in other newly discovered elements of the period: <a href="../../wp/p/Potassium.htm" title="Potassium">potassium</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Sodium.htm" title="Sodium">sodium</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Magnesium.htm" title="Magnesium">magnesium</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Calcium.htm" title="Calcium">calcium</a>, and <a href="../../wp/s/Strontium.htm" title="Strontium">strontium</a> (all of which Davy had isolated himself). Nevertheless, <i>-um</i> spellings for elements were not unknown at the time, as for example <a href="../../wp/p/Platinum.htm" title="Platinum">platinum</a>, known to Europeans since the 16th century, <a href="../../wp/m/Molybdenum.htm" title="Molybdenum">molybdenum</a>, discovered in 1778, and <a href="../../wp/t/Tantalum.htm" title="Tantalum">tantalum</a>, discovered in 1802.<p>Americans adopted <i>-ium</i> for most of the 19th century, with <i>aluminium</i> appearing in <!--del_lnk--> Webster&#39;s Dictionary of 1828. In 1892, however, <!--del_lnk--> Charles Martin Hall used the <i>-um</i> spelling in an advertising handbill for his new electrolytic method of producing the metal, despite his constant use of the <i>-ium</i> spelling in all the patents he filed between 1886 and 1903. It has consequently been suggested that the spelling on the flier was a simple spelling mistake.  Hall&#39;s domination of production of the metal ensured that the spelling <i>aluminium</i> became the standard in North America; the <i>Webster Unabridged Dictionary</i> of 1913, though, continued to use the <i>-ium</i> version.<p>In 1926, the <!--del_lnk--> American Chemical Society officially decided to use <i>aluminium</i> in its publications; American dictionaries typically label the spelling <i>aluminium</i> as a British variant.<p><a id="Present-day_spelling" name="Present-day_spelling"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Present-day spelling</span></h3>
      <p>In the UK and other countries using <!--del_lnk--> British spelling, only <i>aluminium</i> is used. In the United States, the spelling <i>aluminium</i> is largely unknown, and the spelling <i>aluminium</i> predominates. The <!--del_lnk--> Canadian Oxford Dictionary prefers <i>aluminium</i>.<p>In other <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English-speaking</a> countries, the spellings (and associated pronunciations) <i>aluminium</i> and <i>aluminium</i> are both in common use in scientific and nonscientific contexts. The spelling in virtually all other languages is analogous to the <i>-ium</i> ending.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) adopted <i>aluminium</i> as the standard international name for the element in <!--del_lnk--> 1990, but three years later recognized <i>aluminium</i> as an acceptable variant. Hence their periodic table includes both, but places aluminium first. IUPAC officially prefers the use of <i>aluminium</i> in its internal publications, although several IUPAC publications use the spelling <i>aluminium</i>.<p><a id="Chemistry" name="Chemistry"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Chemistry</span></h2>

       <li><!--del_lnk--> Fajans rules show that the simple trivalent cation Al<sup>3+</sup> is not expected to be found in anhydrous salts or binary compounds such as Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The hydroxide is a weak base and aluminium salts of weak acids, such as carbonate, can&#39;t be prepared. The salts of strong acids, such as nitrate, are stable and soluble in water, forming hydrates with at least six molecules of <!--del_lnk--> water of crystallization.<li><!--del_lnk--> Aluminium hydride, (AlH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>n</sub>, can be produced from <!--del_lnk--> trimethylaluminium and an excess of hydrogen. It burns explosively in air. It can also be prepared by the action of <a href="../../wp/a/Aluminium_chloride.htm" title="Aluminium chloride">aluminium chloride</a> on <!--del_lnk--> lithium hydride in <!--del_lnk--> ether solution, but cannot be isolated free from the solvent.<li><!--del_lnk--> Aluminium carbide, Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub> is made by heating a mixture of the elements above 1000&deg;C. The pale yellow crystals have a complex lattice structure, and react with water or dilute acids to give <!--del_lnk--> methane. The <!--del_lnk--> acetylide, Al<sub>2</sub>(C<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, is made by passing <!--del_lnk--> acetylene over heated aluminium.<li><!--del_lnk--> Aluminium nitride, AlN, can be made from the elements at 800&deg;C. It is hydrolysed by <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a> to form <a href="../../wp/a/Ammonia.htm" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a> and <!--del_lnk--> aluminium hydroxide.<li><!--del_lnk--> Aluminium phosphide, AlP, is made similarly, and hydrolyses to give <!--del_lnk--> phosphine.<li><!--del_lnk--> Aluminium oxide, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, occurs naturally as <a href="../../wp/c/Corundum.htm" title="Corundum">corundum</a>, and can be made by burning aluminium in oxygen or by heating the hydroxide, nitrate or sulfate. As a <!--del_lnk--> gemstone, its hardness is only exceeded by <a href="../../wp/d/Diamond.htm" title="Diamond">diamond</a>, <!--del_lnk--> boron nitride, and <!--del_lnk--> carborundum. It is almost insoluble in water.<li><!--del_lnk--> Aluminium hydroxide may be prepared as a gelatinous precipitate by adding ammonia to an aqueous solution of an aluminium salt. It is <!--del_lnk--> amphoteric, being both a very weak acid, and forming aluminates with <!--del_lnk--> alkalis. It exists in various crystalline forms.<li><!--del_lnk--> Aluminium sulfide, Al<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, may be prepared by passing <!--del_lnk--> hydrogen sulfide over aluminium powder. It is <!--del_lnk--> polymorphic.<li><!--del_lnk--> Aluminium iodide, (AlI<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, is a <!--del_lnk--> dimer with applications in <!--del_lnk--> organic synthesis.<li><!--del_lnk--> Aluminium fluoride, AlF<sub>3</sub>, is made by treating the hydroxide with HF, or can be made from the elements. It consists of a giant molecule which sublimes without melting at 1291&deg;C. It is very inert. The other trihalides are dimeric, having a bridge-like structure.<li>Aluminium fluoride/water complexes: When aluminium and fluoride are together in aqueous solution, they readily form complex ions such as AlF(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub><sup>+2</sup>, AlF<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub><sup>0</sup>, AlF<sub>6</sub><sup>-3</sup>. Of these, AlF<sub>6</sub><sup>-3</sup> is the most stable. This is explained by the fact that aluminium and fluoride, which are both very compact ions, fit together just right to form the octahedral aluminium hexafluoride complex. When aluminium and fluoride are together in water in a 1:6 molar ratio, AlF<sub>6</sub><sup>-3</sup> is the most common form, even in rather low concentrations.<li>Organo-metallic compounds of empirical formula AlR<sub>3</sub> exist and, if not also giant molecules, are at least <!--del_lnk--> dimers or trimers. They have some uses in <!--del_lnk--> organic synthesis, for instance <!--del_lnk--> trimethylaluminium.<li>Alumino-hydrides of the most electropositive elements are known, the most useful being <a href="../../wp/l/Lithium_aluminium_hydride.htm" title="Lithium aluminium hydride">lithium aluminium hydride</a>, Li[AlH<sub>4</sub>]. It decomposes into <!--del_lnk--> lithium hydride, aluminium and hydrogen when heated, and is hydrolysed by water. It has many uses in organic chemistry, particularly as a reducing agent. The aluminohalides have a similar structure.</ul>
