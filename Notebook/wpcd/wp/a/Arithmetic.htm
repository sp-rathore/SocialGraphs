      <p><b>Arithmetic</b> or <b>arithmetics</b> (from the <!--del_lnk--> Greek word <i>&alpha;&rho;&iota;&theta;&mu;&#x3CC;&sigmaf;</i> = number) is the oldest and most elementary branch of mathematics, used by almost everyone, for tasks ranging from simple daily counting to advanced <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">science</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Business.htm" title="Business">business</a> calculations. In common usage, the word refers to a branch of (or the forerunner of) <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> which records elementary properties of certain <i>operations</i> on <a href="../../wp/n/Number.htm" title="Number">numbers</a>. Professional <!--del_lnk--> mathematicians sometimes use the term <i>higher arithmetic</i> as a synonym for <!--del_lnk--> number theory, but this should not be confused with <a href="../../wp/e/Elementary_arithmetic.htm" title="Elementary arithmetic">elementary arithmetic</a>.<p>

      <p>The prehistory of arithmetic is limited by a very small number of small artifacts indicating a clear conception of addition and subtraction, the best-known being the <!--del_lnk--> Ishango Bone from <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>, dating from 18,000 BC.<p>It is clear that the <!--del_lnk--> Babylonians had solid knowledge of almost all aspects of elementary arithmetic circa 1850 BC, historians can only infer the methods utilized to generate the arithmetical results (see <!--del_lnk--> Plimpton 322). Likewise, a definitive <a href="../../wp/a/Algorithm.htm" title="Algorithm">algorithm</a> for multiplication and the use of <!--del_lnk--> unit fractions can be found in the <!--del_lnk--> Rhind Mathematical Papyrus dating from Ancient Egypt circa 1650 BC.<p>In the <!--del_lnk--> Pythagorean school, in the second half of the <!--del_lnk--> 6th century BC, arithmetic was considered one of the four quantitative or mathematical sciences (<i>Mathemata</i>). These were carried over in medi&aelig;val universities as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Quadrivium</i> which, together with the <i><!--del_lnk--> Trivium</i> of grammar, rhetoric and dialectic, constituted the <i>septem liberales artes</i> (seven liberal arts).<p>Modern algorithms for arithmetic (both for hand and electronic computation) were made possible by the introduction of <!--del_lnk--> Arabic numerals and <!--del_lnk--> decimal place notation for numbers. Although it is now considered elementary, its simplicity is the culmination of thousands of years of mathematical development. By contrast, the ancient mathematician <a href="../../wp/a/Archimedes.htm" title="Archimedes">Archimedes</a> devoted an entire work, <!--del_lnk--> The Sand Reckoner, to devising a notation for a certain large integer. The flourishing of algebra in the medieval Islamic world and in Renaissance Europe was an outgrowth of the enormous simplification of computation through decimal notation.<p><a id="Decimal_arithmetic" name="Decimal_arithmetic"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Decimal arithmetic</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Decimal notation constructs all real numbers from the basic digits, the first ten non-negative integers 0,1,2,...,9. A decimal numeral consists of a sequence of these basic digits, with the &quot;denomination&quot; of each digit depending on its <i>position</i> with respect to the decimal point: for example, 507.36 denotes 5 hundreds (10<sup>2</sup>), plus 0 tens (10<sup>1</sup>), plus 7 units (10<sup>0</sup>), plus 3 tenths (10<sup>-1</sup>) plus 6 hundredths (10<sup>-2</sup>). An essential part of this notation (and a major stumbling block in achieving it) was conceiving of 0 as a number comparable to the other basic digits.<p><!--del_lnk--> Algorism comprises all of the rules of performing arithmetic computations using a decimal system for representing numbers in which numbers written using ten symbols having the values 0 through 9 are combined using a place-value system (positional notation), where each symbol has ten times the weight of the one to its right. This notation allows the addition of arbitrary numbers by adding the digits in each place, which is accomplished with a 10 x 10 addition table. (A sum of digits which exceeds 9 must have its 10-digit carried to the next place leftward.) One can make a similar algorithm for multiplying arbitrary numbers because the set of denominations {...,10<sup>2</sup>,10,1,10<sup>-1</sup>,...} is closed under multiplication. Subtraction and division are achieved by similar, though more complicated algorithms.<p><a id="Arithmetic_operations" name="Arithmetic_operations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Arithmetic operations</span></h2>
      <p>The traditional arithmetic operations are <!--del_lnk--> addition, <!--del_lnk--> subtraction, <!--del_lnk--> multiplication and <!--del_lnk--> division, although more advanced operations (such as manipulations of <!--del_lnk--> percentages, <!--del_lnk--> square root, <!--del_lnk--> exponentiation, and <!--del_lnk--> logarithmic functions) are also sometimes included in this subject. Arithmetic is performed according to an <!--del_lnk--> order of operations. Any set of objects upon which all four operations of arithmetic can be performed (except <!--del_lnk--> division by zero), and wherein these four operations obey the usual laws, is called a <!--del_lnk--> field.<p><a id="Addition_.28.2B.29" name="Addition_.28.2B.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Addition (+)</span></h3>
      <dl>

      <p>Addition is the basic <!--del_lnk--> operation of arithmetic. In its simplest form, addition combines two <a href="../../wp/n/Number.htm" title="Number">numbers</a>, the <i>addends</i> or <i><!--del_lnk--> terms</i>, into a single number, the <i>sum</i>.<p>Adding more than two numbers can be viewed as repeated addition; this procedure is known as <!--del_lnk--> summation and includes ways to add infinitely many numbers in an <!--del_lnk--> infinite series; repeated addition of the number <!--del_lnk--> one is the most basic form of <!--del_lnk--> counting.<p>Addition is <!--del_lnk--> commutative and <!--del_lnk--> associative so the order in which the terms are added does not matter. The <!--del_lnk--> identity element of addition (the <!--del_lnk--> additive identity) is 0, that is, adding zero to any number will yield that same number. Also, the <!--del_lnk--> inverse element of addition (the <!--del_lnk--> additive inverse) is the opposite of any number, that is, adding the opposite of any number to the number itself will yield the additive identity, 0. For example, the opposite of 7 is (-7), so 7 + (-7) = 0.<p><a id="Subtraction_.28.E2.88.92.29" name="Subtraction_.28.E2.88.92.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Subtraction (&minus;)</span></h3>
      <dl>
       <dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Subtraction is essentially the opposite of addition. Subtraction finds the <i>difference</i> between two numbers, the <i>minuend</i> minus the <i>subtrahend</i>. If the minuend is larger than the subtrahend, the difference will be positive; if the minuend is smaller than the subtrahend, the difference will be negative; and if they are equal, the difference will be <!--del_lnk--> zero.<p>Subtraction is neither commutative nor associative. For that reason, it is often helpful to look at subtraction as addition of the minuend and the opposite of the subtrahend, that is <i>a</i>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;<i>b</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>a</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;(&minus;<i>b</i>). When written as a sum, all the properties of addition hold.<p><a id="Multiplication_.28.C3.97_or_.C2.B7.29" name="Multiplication_.28.C3.97_or_.C2.B7.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Multiplication (&times; or &middot;)</span></h3>
      <dl>
       <dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Multiplication is in essence repeated addition, or the sum of a list of identical numbers. Multiplication finds the <i>product</i> of two numbers, the <i>multiplier</i> and the <i>multiplicand</i>, sometimes both just called <i>factors</i>.<p>Multiplication, as it is really repeated addition, is commutative and associative; further it is <!--del_lnk--> distributive over addition and subtraction. The <!--del_lnk--> multiplicative identity is 1, that is, multiplying any number by 1 will yield that same number. Also, the <!--del_lnk--> multiplicative inverse is the <!--del_lnk--> reciprocal of any number, that is, multiplying the reciprocal of any number by the number itself will yield the multiplicative identity, 1.<p><a id="Division_.28.C3.B7_or_.2F.29" name="Division_.28.C3.B7_or_.2F.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Division (&divide; or /)</span></h3>
      <dl>
       <dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Division is essentially the opposite of multiplication. Division finds the <i>quotient</i> of two numbers, the <i>dividend</i> divided by the <i>divisor</i>. Any dividend <!--del_lnk--> divided by zero is undefined. For positive numbers, if the dividend is larger than the divisor, the quotient will be greater than one, otherwise it will be less than one (a similar rule applies for negative numbers and negative one). The quotient multiplied by the divisor always yields the dividend.<p>Division is neither commutative nor associative. As it is helpful to look at subtraction as addition, it is helpful to look at division as multiplication of the dividend times the <!--del_lnk--> reciprocal of the divisor, that is <i>a</i>&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;<i>b</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>a</i>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>b</i></sub>. When written as a product, it will obey all the properties of multiplication.<p><a id="Examples" name="Examples"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Examples</span></h3>

      <p>The term <i>arithmetic</i> is also used to refer to <!--del_lnk--> number theory. This includes the properties of integers related to <a href="../../wp/p/Prime_number.htm" title="Prime number">primality</a>, <!--del_lnk--> divisibility, and the <!--del_lnk--> solution of equations by integers, as well as modern research which is an outgrowth of this study. It is in this context that one runs across the <a href="../../wp/f/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic.htm" title="Fundamental theorem of arithmetic">fundamental theorem of arithmetic</a> and <!--del_lnk--> arithmetic functions. <i>A Course in Arithmetic</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Serre reflects this usage, as do such phrases as <i>first order arithmetic</i> or <i>arithmetical algebraic geometry</i>. Number theory is also referred to as &#39;the higher arithmetic&#39;, as in the title of <!--del_lnk--> H. Davenport&#39;s book on the subject.<p><a id="Arithmetic_in_education" name="Arithmetic_in_education"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Arithmetic in education</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Primary education in mathematics often places a strong focus on algorithms for the arithmetic of <!--del_lnk--> natural numbers, <!--del_lnk--> integers, <!--del_lnk--> rational numbers (<!--del_lnk--> vulgar fractions), and <!--del_lnk--> real numbers (using the <!--del_lnk--> decimal place-value system). This study is sometimes known as <!--del_lnk--> algorism.<p>The difficulty and unmotivated appearance of these algorithms has long led educators to question this curriculum, advocating the early teaching of more central and intuitive mathematical ideas. One notable movement in this direction was the <!--del_lnk--> New Math of the 1960s and &#39;70s, which attempted to teach arithmetic in the spirit of axiomatic development from set theory, an echo of the prevailing trend in higher mathematics .<p>Since the introduction of the electronic <!--del_lnk--> calculator, which can perform the algorithms far more efficiently than humans, an influential school of educators has argued that mechanical mastery of the standard arithmetic algorithms is no longer necessary. In their view, the first years of school mathematics could be more profitably spent on understanding higher-level ideas about what numbers are used for and relationships among number, quantity, measurement, and so on. However, most research mathematicians still consider mastery of the manual algorithms to be a necessary foundation for the study of algebra and computer science. This controversy was central to the &quot;Math Wars&quot; over California&#39;s primary school curriculum in the 1990s, and continues today .<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic&quot;</div>
