      <p><b>Astrology</b> is a group of <!--del_lnk--> systems, <!--del_lnk--> traditions, and <!--del_lnk--> beliefs in which knowledge of the relative positions of <!--del_lnk--> celestial bodies and related information is held to be useful in understanding, interpreting, and organizing knowledge about <!--del_lnk--> personality, human affairs, and other terrestrial events. A practitioner of astrology is called an <b><!--del_lnk--> astrologer</b>, or, less often, an astrologist. Historically, the term <i>mathematicus</i> was used to denote a person proficient in astrology, <a href="../../wp/a/Astronomy.htm" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a>, and <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>.<p>Although the two fields share a <!--del_lnk--> common origin, modern astronomy is entirely distinct from astrology. While astronomy is the <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">scientific</a> study of astronomical objects and phenomena, the practice of astrology is concerned with the correlation of heavenly bodies (which historically involved measurement of the celestial sphere) with earthly and human affairs. Astrology is variously considered by its proponents to be a <!--del_lnk--> symbolic language, a form of <a href="../../wp/a/Art.htm" title="Art">art</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">science</a>, or <!--del_lnk--> divination. The <!--del_lnk--> scientific community generally considers astrology to be a <!--del_lnk--> pseudoscience or <!--del_lnk--> superstition as it has failed empirical tests in controlled studies.<p>The word <i>astrology</i> is derived from the <!--del_lnk--> Greek &alpha;&sigma;&tau;&rho;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&#x3AF;&alpha;, from &#x3AC;&sigma;&tau;&rho;&omicron;&nu; (<i>astron</i>, &quot;star&quot;) and &lambda;&#x3CC;&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf; (<i><!--del_lnk--> logos</i>, &quot;word&quot;). The -&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&#x3AF;&alpha; suffix is written in <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> as <i><!--del_lnk--> -logy</i>, &quot;study&quot; or &quot;discipline&quot;.<table align="right" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="margin: 0 0 1em 1em; border: 1px solid #aaaaaa; clear: both">

Although the principle that events in the heavens are mirrored by those on Earth was once generally held in most traditions of astrology around the world, in the West there has historically been a debate among astrologers over the nature of the mechanism behind astrology and whether or not celestial bodies are only signs or portents of events, or if they are actual causes of events through some sort of force or mechanism.<p>While the connection between <!--del_lnk--> celestial mechanics and terrestrial <!--del_lnk--> dynamics was explored first by <a href="../../wp/i/Isaac_Newton.htm" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a> with his development of a universal theory of <a href="../../wp/g/Gravitation.htm" title="Gravitation">gravitation</a>, claims that the gravitational effects of the celestial bodies are what accounts for astrological generalizations are not substantiated by the scientific community, nor are they advocated by most astrologers.<p>Many of those who practice astrology believe that the positions of certain celestial bodies either influence or correlate with human affairs. Most modern astrologers believe that the cosmos (and especially the <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_System.htm" title="Solar system">solar system</a>) acts as a single unit, so that any happening in any part of it inevitably is reflected in every other part. Skeptics dispute these claims, pointing to a lack of concrete evidence of significant influence of this sort.<p>Most astrological traditions are based on the relative positions and movements of various real or construed celestial bodies and on the construction of celestial patterns as seen at the time and place of the event being studied. These are chiefly the <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">Sun</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Moon.htm" title="Moon">Moon</a>, the <a href="../../wp/p/Planet.htm" title="Planet">planets</a>, the <a href="../../wp/s/Star.htm" title="Star">stars</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> lunar nodes. The calculations performed in casting a <!--del_lnk--> horoscope involve <a href="../../wp/a/Arithmetic.htm" title="Arithmetic">arithmetic</a> and simple <a href="../../wp/g/Geometry.htm" title="Geometry">geometry</a> which serve to locate the apparent position of heavenly bodies on desired dates and times based on astronomical tables. The frame of reference for such apparent positions is defined by the <!--del_lnk--> tropical or <!--del_lnk--> sidereal <!--del_lnk--> zodiacal signs on one hand, and by the local <!--del_lnk--> horizon (<!--del_lnk--> ascendant) and <!--del_lnk--> midheaven on the other. This latter (local) frame is typically further divided into the twelve <!--del_lnk--> astrological houses.<p>In the past, astrologers often relied on close observation of celestial objects and the charting of their movements. Today astrologers use data provided by <!--del_lnk--> astronomers which are transformed to a set of astrological tables called <!--del_lnk--> ephemerides, showing the changing zodiacal positions of the heavenly bodies through time.<p><a id="Traditions" name="Traditions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Traditions</span></h2>

      <p>Horoscopic astrology is a very specific and complex system that was developed in the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> region and specifically <!--del_lnk--> Hellenistic Egypt sometime around the late 2nd or early 1st century BCE. The tradition deals with two-dimensional diagrams of the heavens created for specific moments in time. The diagram is then used to interpret the inherent meaning underlying the alignment of celestial bodies at that moment based on a specific set of rules and guidelines. One of the defining characteristics of this form of astrology that makes it distinct from other traditions is the computation of the degree of the Eastern horizon rising against the backdrop of the <!--del_lnk--> ecliptic at the specific moment under examination, otherwise known as the ascendant. Horoscopic astrology has been the most influential and widespread form of astrology across the world, especially in <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>, and the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, and there are several major traditions of horoscopic astrology including <!--del_lnk--> Indian, Hellenistic, Medieval, and most other modern Western traditions of astrology.<p><a id="The_horoscope" name="The_horoscope"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The horoscope</span></h3>

      <p>Central to horoscopic astrology and its branches is the calculation of the horoscope or astrological chart. This two-dimensional diagrammatic representation shows the celestial bodies&#39; apparent positions in the heavens from the vantage of a location on Earth at a given time and place. In ancient Hellenistic astrology the ascendant demarcated the first celestial house of a horoscope. The word for the ascendant in Greek was <i>horoskopos</i> from which &quot;horoscope&quot; derives. In modern times, however, the word has come to refer to the astrological chart as a whole.<p><a id="The_tropical_and_sidereal_zodiacs" name="The_tropical_and_sidereal_zodiacs"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The tropical and sidereal zodiacs</span></h3>
      <p>The path of the Sun across the heavens as seen from Earth during a full year is called the ecliptic. This, and the nearby band of sky followed by the visible planets, is called the zodiac.<p>The majority of Western astrologers base their work on the tropical zodiac which evenly divides the ecliptic into 12 segments of 30 degrees each. The Sun&#39;s position at the <!--del_lnk--> March equinox, zero degrees <!--del_lnk--> Aries, marks the beginning of the zodiac. The zodiacal signs in this system bear no relation to the <!--del_lnk--> constellations of the same name but stay aligned to the months and seasons. The tropical zodiac is used as a historical coordinate system in astronomy.<p>Practitioners of the Jyotish (<!--del_lnk--> Hindu) astrological tradition and a minority of Western astrologers use the sidereal zodiac. This zodiac uses the same evenly divided ecliptic but approximately stays aligned to the positions of the observable constellations with the same name as the zodiacal signs. The sidereal zodiac is computed from the tropical zodiac by adding an offset called <!--del_lnk--> ayanamsa. This offset changes with the <!--del_lnk--> precession of the equinoxes.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Traditions of horoscopic astrology can be divided into four branches which are directed towards specific subjects or purposes. Often these branches use a unique set of techniques or a different application of the core principles of the system to a different area. Many other subsets and applications of astrology are derived from these four fundamental branches.<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Natal astrology, the study of a person&#39;s natal chart in order to gain information about the individual and his/her life experience. This includes <!--del_lnk--> Judicial astrology.<li><!--del_lnk--> Katarchic astrology, which includes both <!--del_lnk--> electional and event astrology. The former uses astrology to determine the most auspicious moment to begin an enterprise or undertaking, and the latter to understand everything about an event from the time at which it took place.<li><!--del_lnk--> Horary astrology, used to answer a specific question by studying the chart of the moment the question is posed to an astrologer.<li><!--del_lnk--> Mundane or world astrology, the application of astrology to world events, including weather, earthquakes, and the rise and fall of empires or religions.</ul>

This Babylonian astrology came to Greece initially as early as the middle of the 4th century BCE, and then around the late 2nd or early 1st century BCE after the <!--del_lnk--> Alexandrian conquests, this Babylonian astrology was mixed with the Egyptian tradition of decanic astrology to create horoscopic astrology. This new form of astrology, which appears to have originated in <!--del_lnk--> Alexandrian Egypt, quickly spread across the ancient world into Europe, the Middle East and India.<p><a id="Before_the_scientific_revolution" name="Before_the_scientific_revolution"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Before the scientific revolution</span></h3>
      <p>From the classical period through the <!--del_lnk--> scientific revolution, astrological training played a critical role in advancing astronomical, mathematical, medical and psychological knowledge. Insofar as the interpretation of supposed astrological influences included the observation and long-term tracking of celestial objects, it was often astrologers who provided the first systematic documentation of the movements of the Sun, the Moon, the planets, and the stars. The differentiation between astronomy and astrology varied from place to place; they were indistinguishable in ancient Babylonia and for most of the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, but separated to a greater degree in ancient Greece (see <!--del_lnk--> astrology and astronomy). Astrology was not always uncritically accepted before the modern era; it was often challenged by Hellenistic skeptics, church authorities and medieval thinkers.<p>The pattern of astronomical knowledge gained from astrological endeavours has been historically repeated across numerous cultures, from <!--del_lnk--> ancient India through the classical <a href="../../wp/m/Maya_civilization.htm" title="Maya civilization">Maya civilization</a> to medieval Europe. Given this historical contribution, astrology has been called a <!--del_lnk--> protoscience along with <!--del_lnk--> pseudosciences such as <a href="../../wp/a/Alchemy.htm" title="Alchemy">alchemy</a> (see &quot;Western astrology and alchemy&quot; below).<p>Many prominent scientists, such as <!--del_lnk--> Nicholas Copernicus, <a href="../../wp/t/Tycho_Brahe.htm" title="Tycho Brahe">Tycho Brahe</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Galileo_Galilei.htm" title="Galileo Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a>, <a href="../../wp/j/Johannes_Kepler.htm" title="Johannes Kepler">Johannes Kepler</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Carl Gustav Jung and others, practiced or significantly contributed to astrology.<p><a id="Effects_on_world_culture" name="Effects_on_world_culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Effects on world culture</span></h2>

      <p>Astrology has had a profound influence over the past few thousand years on Western and Eastern cultures.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Influenza, from medieval Latin <i>influentia</i> meaning influence, was so named because doctors once believed epidemics to be caused by unfavorable planetary and stellar influences.

      <p>Different astrological traditions are dependent on a particular culture&#39;s prevailing mythology. These varied mythologies naturally reflect the cultures they emerge from. Images from these mythological systems are usually understandable to natives of the culture they are a part of. Most classicists think that Western astrology is dependent on <a href="../../wp/g/Greek_mythology.htm" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythology</a>.<p>Many writers, notably <!--del_lnk--> Geoffrey Chaucer and <a href="../../wp/w/William_Shakespeare.htm" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>, used astrological symbolism to add subtlety and nuance to the description of their characters&#39; motivation(s). Often, an understanding of astrological symbolism is needed to fully appreciate such literature. Some modern thinkers, notably Carl Jung, believe in its descriptive powers regarding the mind without necessarily subscribing to its predictive claims. Consequently, some regard astrology as a way of learning about one self and one&#39;s motivations. Increasingly, psychologists and historians have become interested in Jung&#39;s theory of the fundamentality and indissolubility of archetypes in the human mind and their correlation with the symbols of the horoscope.<p><a id="Western_astrology_and_alchemy" name="Western_astrology_and_alchemy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Western astrology and alchemy</span></h3>

      <p>Alchemy in the <!--del_lnk--> Western World and other locations where it was widely practiced was (and in many cases still is) allied and intertwined with traditional Babylonian-Greek style astrology; in numerous ways they were built to complement each other in the search for <!--del_lnk--> hidden knowledge (knowledge that is not common i.e. the occult). Astrology has used the concept of <!--del_lnk--> classical elements from antiquity up until the present day today. Most modern astrologers use the four classical elements extensively, and indeed it is still viewed as a critical part of interpreting the astrological chart. Traditionally, each of the seven planets in the solar system as known to the ancients was associated with, held dominion over, and &quot;ruled&quot; a certain <a href="../../wp/m/Metal.htm" title="Metal">metal</a> (see also <!--del_lnk--> astrology and the classical elements).<p><a id="The_seven_liberal_arts_and_Western_astrology" name="The_seven_liberal_arts_and_Western_astrology"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The seven liberal arts and Western astrology</span></h3>

      <p>By the time of <a href="../../wp/f/Francis_Bacon.htm" title="Francis Bacon">Francis Bacon</a> and the scientific revolution, newly emerging scientific disciplines acquired a method of systematic empirical induction validated by experimental observations, which led to the scientific revolution. At this point, astrology and astronomy began to diverge; astronomy became one of the central sciences while astrology was increasingly viewed as an occult science or superstition by natural scientists. This separation accelerated through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.<p>Within the contemporary scientific community, astrology is generally labeled as a pseudoscience, and it has been criticized as being unscientific both by scientific bodies and by individual scientists. In 1975, the <!--del_lnk--> American Humanist Association published one of the most widely known modern criticisms of astrology, characterizing those who continue to have faith in the subject as doing so &quot;in spite of the fact that there is no verified scientific basis for their beliefs, and indeed that there is strong evidence to the contrary&quot;. Astronomer <a href="../../wp/c/Carl_Sagan.htm" title="Carl Sagan">Carl Sagan</a> did not sign the statement, noting that, while he felt astrology lacked validity, he found the statement&#39;s tone <!--del_lnk--> authoritarian. He suggested that the lack of a causal mechanism for astrology was relevant but not in itself convincing.<p>Although astrology has had no accepted scientific standing for some time, it has been the subject of much research among astrologers since the beginning of the twentieth century. In his landmark study of twentieth-century research into natal astrology, vocal astrology critic Geoffrey Dean noted and documented the burgeoning research activity, primarily within the astrological community.<p><a id="Claims_about_obstacles_to_research" name="Claims_about_obstacles_to_research"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Claims about obstacles to research</span></h3>
      <p>Astrologers have argued that there are significant obstacles in carrying out scientific research into astrology today, including funding, lack of background in science and statistics by astrologers, and insufficient expertise in astrology by research scientists. There are only a handful of journals dealing with scientific research into astrology (i.e. astrological journals directed towards scientific research or <!--del_lnk--> scientific journals publishing astrological research). Some astrologers have argued that few practitioners today pursue scientific testing of astrology because they feel that working with clients on a daily basis provides a personal validation for them.<p>Another argument made by astrologers is that most studies of astrology do not reflect the nature of astrological practice and that existing experimental methods and research tools are not adequate for studying this complex discipline. Some astrology proponents claim that the prevailing attitudes and motives of many opponents of astrology introduce conscious or unconscious bias in the formulation of hypotheses to be tested, the conduct of the tests, and the reporting of results.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p><a id="Mechanism" name="Mechanism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Mechanism</span></h3>
      <p>Many critics claim that a central problem to astrology is the lack of evidence for a scientifically defined mechanism by which celestial objects can supposedly influence terrestrial affairs. Astrologers claim that a lack of an explanatory mechanism would not scientifically invalidate astrological findings. Though physical mechanisms are still among the <!--del_lnk--> proposed theories of astrology, few modern astrologers believe in a direct causal relationship between heavenly bodies and earthly events. Some have posited <!--del_lnk--> acausal, purely <!--del_lnk--> correlative, relationships between astrological observations and events, such as the theory of <!--del_lnk--> synchronicity proposed by Jung. <!--del_lnk--> Astrophysicist Victor Mansfield suggests that astrology should draw inspiration from <!--del_lnk--> quantum physics. Others have posited a basis in <!--del_lnk--> divination. Still others have argued that empirical correlations can stand on their own <!--del_lnk--> epistemologically, and do not need the support of any theory or mechanism. To some observers, these non-mechanistic concepts raise serious questions about the feasibility of validating astrology through scientific testing, and some have gone so far as to reject the applicability of the scientific method to astrology almost entirely. Some astrologers, on the other hand, believe that astrology is amenable to the scientific method, given sufficiently sophisticated analytical methods, and they cite pilot studies they claim support this view. Consequently, a number of astrologers have called for or advocated continuing studies of astrology based on statistical validation.<p><a id="Research_claims_and_counter-claims" name="Research_claims_and_counter-claims"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Research claims and counter-claims</span></h3>

      <p>Several individuals, most notably French psychologist and statistician <!--del_lnk--> Michel Gauquelin, claimed to have found correlations between some planetary positions and certain human traits such as vocations. Gauquelin&#39;s most widely known claim is known as the <!--del_lnk--> Mars effect, which is said to demonstrate a correlation between the planet Mars occupying certain positions in the sky more often at the birth of eminent sports champions than at the birth of ordinary people. Since its original publication in 1955, the Mars effect has been the subject of studies claiming to refute it, and studies claiming to support and/or expand the original claims, but neither the claims nor the counterclaims have received mainstream scientific notice.<p>Besides the claims of the Mars effect, astrological researchers claim to have found statistical correlations for physical attributes, accidents, personal and mundane events, social trends such as economics and large geophysical patterns. None of these claims, however, have been published in a mainstream scientific journal.<p>The scientific community, where it has commented, claims that astrology has repeatedly failed to demonstrate its effectiveness in numerous controlled studies. <!--del_lnk--> Effect size studies in astrology conclude that the mean accuracy of astrological predictions is no greater than what is expected by chance, and astrology&#39;s perceived performance has disappeared on critical inspection. When tested against <!--del_lnk--> personality tests, astrologers have shown a consistent lack of agreement with these tests. One such <!--del_lnk--> double-blind study in which astrologers attempted to match birth charts with results of a personality test, which was published in the reputable <!--del_lnk--> peer-reviewed scientific journal <i><!--del_lnk--> Nature</i>, claimed to refute astrologers&#39; assertions that they can solve clients&#39; personal problems by reading individuals&#39; natal charts. The study concluded that astrologers had no special ability to interpret personality from astrological readings. Another study that used a personality test and a questionnaire contended that some astrologers failed to predict objective facts about people or agree with each other&#39;s interpretations. When testing for <!--del_lnk--> cognitive, <!--del_lnk--> behavioural, <!--del_lnk--> physical and other variables, one study of astrological &quot;<!--del_lnk--> time twins&quot; claimed that human characteristics are not molded by the influence of the Sun, Moon and planets at the time of birth. Skeptics of astrology also suggest that the perceived accuracy of astrological interpretations and descriptions of one&#39;s personality can be accounted for by the <!--del_lnk--> fact that people tend to exaggerate positive &#39;hits&#39; and overlook whatever does not fit, especially when <!--del_lnk--> vague language is used. They also claim that statistical research is often wrongly seen as evidence for astrology due to uncontrolled artifacts.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology&quot;</div>
