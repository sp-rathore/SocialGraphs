      <p>Asunci&oacute;n is one of the oldest cities in <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a>, being known as &quot;Mother of Cities&quot;. It was from here that the colonial expeditions departed to found other cities, including the second foundation of <a href="../../wp/b/Buenos_Aires.htm" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a> and of other important cities such as <!--del_lnk--> Villarrica, <!--del_lnk--> Corrientes, <!--del_lnk--> Santa Fe and <!--del_lnk--> Santa Cruz de la Sierra. The site of the city may have been first visited by <!--del_lnk--> Juan de Ayolas, but the town, called <i>Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Asunci&oacute;n</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Our Lady of the Assumption), was founded on the feast day of the Assumption <!--del_lnk--> August 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1537, by <!--del_lnk--> Juan de Salazar and <!--del_lnk--> Gonzalo de Mendoza, relative of <!--del_lnk--> Pedro de Mendoza. Thus, the city became the centre of a large Spanish colonial province comprising part of Brazil, present-day Paraguay and northeastern Argentina: the <!--del_lnk--> Giant Province of the Indies. In 1603 Asunci&oacute;n was the seat of the <!--del_lnk--> First Synod of Asunci&oacute;n, which set guidelines for the <!--del_lnk--> evangelization of the natives in their <!--del_lnk--> lingua franca, <!--del_lnk--> Guaran&iacute;.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1731 an uprising under <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; de Antequera y Castro was one of the first rebellions against <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spanish</a> colonial rule. The uprising failed but it was the first sign of the independent spirit that was growing among the <!--del_lnk--> criollos, <a href="../../wp/m/Mestizo.htm" title="Mestizo">mestizos</a> and <!--del_lnk--> natives of Paraguay. The event influenced the independence of Paraguay, which then materialised in <!--del_lnk--> 1811. The secret reunions between the independence leaders to plan an ambush against the Spanish Governor in Paraguay <!--del_lnk--> Bernardo de Velasco were held at the home of <!--del_lnk--> Juana Mar&iacute;a de Lara, in downtown Asunci&oacute;n. On the night of <!--del_lnk--> May 14 and <!--del_lnk--> May 15 the rebels succeeded and were able to force the governor Velasco to surrender. Today, Lara&#39;s home is known as <!--del_lnk--> Casa de la Independencia (House of the Independence) and serves as a museum and historical building.<p>After Paraguay became independent, there was signifcant change in Asunci&oacute;n. Under the presidency of <!--del_lnk--> Gaspar Rodr&iacute;guez de Francia roads were made throughout the city and the streets were named. However, it was during the presidency of <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Antonio L&oacute;pez that Asunci&oacute;n (and Paraguay) progressed, as the new president implemented new economic policies. More than 400 schools, metallurgic factories and the first railroad service in <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a> were built during the L&oacute;pez presidency. After L&oacute;pez died, his son <!--del_lnk--> Francisco Solano L&oacute;pez became the new president and led the country through the disastrous <!--del_lnk--> War of the Triple Alliance that lasted for five years. After the <!--del_lnk--> War of the Triple Alliance (<!--del_lnk--> 1865-<!--del_lnk--> 70), Asunci&oacute;n was occupied by <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazilian</a> troops until <!--del_lnk--> 1876. <p>Many historians have claimed that this war has provoked the constant downfall of the city and country, since it massacred two thirds of the country&#39;s population. Progress has been tremendously slowed down ever since, and the economy has constantly found itself in stagnation.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>
      <p>Asunci&oacute;n&#39;s current population is approximately 539,000 people in the city proper. Roughly 30% of Paraguay&#39;s 6 million people live within Greater Asunci&oacute;n. Sixty-five percent of the total population in the city are under the age of 30.<p>The population has increased greatly during the last few decades as a consequence of internal <!--del_lnk--> migration from other <!--del_lnk--> Departments of Paraguay at first because of the economic boom in the 1970&#39;s, and later because of economic recession in the countryside. The adjacent cities in the Gran Asunci&oacute;n area like <!--del_lnk--> Luque, <!--del_lnk--> Lambar&eacute;, <!--del_lnk--> San Lorenzo, <!--del_lnk--> Fernando de la Mora and <!--del_lnk--> Mariano Roque Alonso have absorbed most of this influx due to the low cost of the land and easy access to Asuncion. These cities have also experienced significant economic growth and expansion, to the point that the boundaries between Asuncion and its adjacent cities has almost but disappeared.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>
      <p>Asunci&oacute;n is located between the <!--del_lnk--> parallels 25&ordm; 15&#39; and 25&ordm; 20&#39; of south <!--del_lnk--> latitude and between the meridians 57&ordm; 40&#39; and 57&ordm; 30&#39; of west <!--del_lnk--> longitude. The city sits on the left bank of the <!--del_lnk--> Paraguay River, which separates the city in the north-west from the Occidental Region of Paraguay and <a href="../../wp/a/Argentina.htm" title="Argentina">Argentina</a> in the south part of the city. The rest of the city is surrounded by the <!--del_lnk--> Central Department.<p><a id="Physical_setting" name="Physical_setting"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Physical setting</span></h3>
      <p>Since the location is right next to the Paraguay River the city offers beautiful landscapes and spreads out on gentle hills in a pattern of rectangular blocks. Places like <!--del_lnk--> Cerro Lambar&eacute; (a hill) located in <!--del_lnk--> Lambar&eacute; offer a spectacular show in the spring because of the <!--del_lnk--> lapacho trees in the area. Parks like Parque Caballero and Parque Carlos Antonio L&oacute;pez offer big areas of typical Paraguayan nature and are often frequented by tourists. There are several slightly elevated areas throughout the city (small hills) such as Cabar&aacute;, Clavel, Tarum&aacute;, Cachinga, Tacumb&uacute;, among others.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h2>
      <p>The climate of Asunci&oacute;n can be described as warm and humid for the most part of the year. The average temperature of the city is of 24&deg;<!--del_lnk--> C (75.2 <!--del_lnk--> F). The average maxima is of 29.4&ordm;C (84.92 F) and the average minima is of 19.2&ordm;C (66.56 F). In 2002, the registered level of rain was of 1,420 milimeters. Usually October is the month with the most <!--del_lnk--> precipations, while September is the month with the least amount of precipitation.<p><a id="Neighbourhoods" name="Neighbourhoods"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Neighbourhoods</span></h2>
      <p>The neighbourhoods of Asuncion, called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> barrios&quot; by its residents, are the territorial units established by law, and of which Asunci&oacute;n is subdivided into.<p>The city of Asunci&oacute;n is composed of the following neighbourhoods<table>

      <p>Since its foundation, Asunci&oacute;n has always been the centre of the economic activity in Paraguay. This is mainly due to the location of all the national politic governing bodies and because most of the industrial, diplomatic and economic activities are taken in the city. Most of the population concentrates on commerce and services, followed by the industry and construction sector. <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">Agriculture</a> and <!--del_lnk--> animal husbandry is basically non-existent because Asunci&oacute;n is a strictly urban area.<p><a id="Transportation" name="Transportation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transportation</span></h2>
      <p>Because the <!--del_lnk--> Paraguay River runs right next to Asunci&oacute;n the city is served by a river terminal in the downtown area and in the Sajonia neighbourhood. Public transportation is used heavily and is served through buses that reach all the regions of the city. The main long-distance bus terminal is on the Republica Argentina Avenue and its bus services connect all of the <!--del_lnk--> Departments of Paraguay, as well as international routes to nearby countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia and Uruguay. Asunci&oacute;n is served by the <!--del_lnk--> Silvio Pettirossi International Airport located in the city of <!--del_lnk--> Luque.<p><a id="Tourist_attractions" name="Tourist_attractions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Tourist attractions</span></h2>
