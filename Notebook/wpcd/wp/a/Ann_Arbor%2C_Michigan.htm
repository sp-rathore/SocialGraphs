Supposedly named for the spouses of the city&#39;s founders and for the stands of trees in the area, Ann Arbor is best known as the location of the main campus of the <!--del_lnk--> University of Michigan, which moved there from <a href="../../wp/d/Detroit%252C_Michigan.htm" title="Detroit, Michigan">Detroit</a> in 1837.<p>The city&#39;s economy, which was once noted for production of agricultural implements, carriages, furniture, pianos and organs, pottery, and flour, is now dominated by <a href="../../wp/e/Education.htm" title="Education">education</a>, <!--del_lnk--> high-tech, and <a href="../../wp/b/Biotechnology.htm" title="Biotechnology">biotechnology</a>. Average home prices and property taxes are well above the state and national medians.

      <p>Ann Arbor was founded in January 1824 by <!--del_lnk--> John Allen and <!--del_lnk--> Elisha Rumsey, both of whom were land speculators. There are various accounts concerning the origin of the settlement&#39;s name, but one states that Allen and Rumsey decided to name it &quot;Ann&#39;sarbour&quot; for their spouses, both named Ann, and for the stands of <!--del_lnk--> burr oak in the 640 <!--del_lnk--> acres (260&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ha) of land they had purchased for <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">$</a>800 from the federal government. The <!--del_lnk--> Native Americans of the region knew the settlement as <i>Kaw-goosh-kaw-nick</i>, after the sound of Allen&#39;s grist mill.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Ann Arbor later became the seat of Washtenaw County in 1827, and was incorporated as a village in 1833. The town set aside 40 acres (16 hectares) of undeveloped land and offered it to the State of Michigan as the site of the state capitol, but it lost the bid to <!--del_lnk--> Lansing in 1836. In 1837 the unused land was given to the <!--del_lnk--> University of Michigan, forever linking Ann Arbor and its history with the university. The town became a regional transportation hub in 1839 with the arrival of the <!--del_lnk--> Michigan Central Railroad. Ann Arbor was chartered as a city in 1851.<p>During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Ford Motor Company&#39;s nearby <!--del_lnk--> Willow Run plant turned out <!--del_lnk--> B-24 Liberator bombers. The population of Ann Arbor exploded with an influx of military personnel, war workers, and their families.<p>The city gained a reputation as an important centre for liberal politics over the course of the 1960s and 1970s. Presidential candidate <a href="../../wp/j/John_F._Kennedy.htm" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> unveiled his <!--del_lnk--> Peace Corps proposal in 1960 at the University of Michigan, and there in 1964 President <a href="../../wp/l/Lyndon_B._Johnson.htm" title="Lyndon B. Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> first called for a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Great Society.&quot; The city also became a locus for <!--del_lnk--> left-wing activism, serving as a hub for the <!--del_lnk--> civil-rights movement and <!--del_lnk--> anti-Vietnam War movement, as well as the student movement. The first major meetings of the national left-wing campus group <!--del_lnk--> Students for a Democratic Society took place in Ann Arbor in 1960, and in 1965 the city was home to the first U.S. <!--del_lnk--> teach-in against the <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_War.htm" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>. Over the course of the ensuing fifteen years, a plethora of <!--del_lnk--> countercultural and <!--del_lnk--> New Left enterprises sprang up and developed strong constituencies within the city.<p>These influences washed into municipal politics during the early and mid-1970s when three members of the local, progressive <!--del_lnk--> Human Rights Party (HRP) won city-council seats on the strength of the student vote. During their time on the council, HRP representatives successfully fought for measures ranging from pioneering <a href="../../wp/c/Civil_rights.htm" title="Civil rights">antidiscrimination</a> ordinances to <!--del_lnk--> measures decriminalizing marijuana possession to a <!--del_lnk--> rent-control ordinance &ndash; many of which remain in effect in modified form today.<p>Alongside these liberal and left-wing efforts, a small handful of conservative institutions were also born in Ann Arbor. These include <!--del_lnk--> Word of God (established in 1967), a charismatic inter-denominational movement of national scope; and the <!--del_lnk--> Thomas More Law Centre (established in 1999), a leading religious-conservative advocacy group.<p>The economy of Ann Arbor underwent a gradual shift from a manufacturing base to a service and technology base over the course of the 20th century, a shift which accelerated in the 1970s and 1980s. At the same time, the downtown has transformed from one dominated primarily by retail establishments dealing in staple goods to one comprised mainly of eateries, caf&eacute;s, bars and clubs, and specialty shops.<p>Over the past several decades, the city has increasingly found itself grappling with the effects of sharply rising land values and <!--del_lnk--> gentrification, as well as <!--del_lnk--> urban sprawl stretching far into the outlying countryside. On <!--del_lnk--> November 2, <!--del_lnk--> 2004, voters approved a <!--del_lnk--> greenbelt plan under which the city government would buy development rights to pieces of land adjacent to Ann Arbor to preserve them from sprawling development. Since then, a vociferous local debate has hinged on whether, and how, to accommodate and guide development within city limits.<p><a id="Geography_and_climate" name="Geography_and_climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography and climate</span></h2>

      <p>According to the <!--del_lnk--> United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 27.7&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> square miles (71.7&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km&sup2;); 27.0&nbsp;square miles (70.0&nbsp;km&sup2;) of it is land and 0.7 square miles (1.7&nbsp;km&sup2;) or 2.42% of it is water, much of which is part of the <!--del_lnk--> Huron River. Ann Arbor is approximately 40&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> miles (64&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km) west of <!--del_lnk--> Detroit, a 45-minute car ride on <!--del_lnk--> I-94. <!--del_lnk--> Ann Arbor Charter Township is adjacent, on the city&#39;s north and east sides.<p>Ann Arbor is situated on the <!--del_lnk--> Huron River, in a productive agricultural and fruit-growing region. The landscape of Ann Arbor consists of rolling hills and <!--del_lnk--> valleys, with the terrain becoming steeper near the Huron River. The elevation ranges from about 750&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> feet (230&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> m) along the Huron River to about 900&nbsp;feet (275&nbsp;m) above sea level in southern and northeastern Ann Arbor. The elevation is about 839&nbsp;feet (256&nbsp;m) at Ann Arbor Municipal Airport, which is located at <span class="plainlinksneverexpand"><!--del_lnk--> 42&deg;13.38&prime;N 83&deg;44.74&prime;W</span>.<p><a id="Cityscape" name="Cityscape"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cityscape</span></h3>
      <p>Ann Arbor&#39;s &quot;Tree Town&quot; moniker stems from the dense forestation of its parks and residential areas. The city holds almost as many trees as residents, with more than 50,000 trees sited along city streets and an equal number in city parks. In recent years, the <!--del_lnk--> emerald ash borer has destroyed many of the city&#39;s approximately 10,500 <!--del_lnk--> ash trees.<p>The city contains 147 municipal parks, ranging from neighbourhood vest-pocket parks to large recreation areas, with several large city parks and a university park bordering sections of the Huron River. The largest are Argo Park, Riverside Park, County Farm Park, and Gallup Park (near the Huron Parkway), while Fuller Recreation Area, near the <!--del_lnk--> University Hospital complex, contains sports fields, pedestrian and <!--del_lnk--> bike paths, and swimming pools. <!--del_lnk--> Nichols Arboretum, which is jointly owned by the City of Ann Arbor and the <!--del_lnk--> University of Michigan (and known locally as &quot;The Arboretum&quot; or just &quot;The Arb&quot;), is a 123-acre (50 hectare) preserve containing hundreds of plant and tree species on the east side of the city near downtown.<p>The Kerrytown Shops, Main Street Business District, the State Street Business District, and the South University Business District are commercial areas in downtown. Three commercial areas south of downtown include the areas near <!--del_lnk--> I-94 and Ann Arbor-Saline Road, Briarwood Mall, and the South Industrial area. Other commercial areas include the Arborland/Washtenaw Avenue and Packard Road merchants on the east side, the Plymouth Road area in the northeast, and the Westgate/West Stadium areas on the west side. The downtown contains a mix of 19th and early 20th-century structures and modern-style buildings, as well as a <!--del_lnk--> farmers&#39; market in the Kerrytown district. The city&#39;s commercial districts are mostly comprised of two to four-story structures, although the downtown and the area near Briarwood Mall contain a small number of high-rise buildings.<p>Ann Arbor&#39;s residential neighborhoods contain a range of architectural styles, from classic 19th and early 20th-century designs to <!--del_lnk--> ranch-style houses. More contemporary-style houses are located farther from the downtown district. Surrounding the University of Michigan campus are houses and apartment complexes occupied primarily by student renters. The 19th-century buildings and streetscape of the Old West Side neighbourhood have been preserved virtually intact; in 1972, the district was listed on the <!--del_lnk--> National Register of Historic Places, and it is further protected via city ordinances and a nonprofit preservation group.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>
      <p>Ann Arbor has a typically <!--del_lnk--> Midwestern <a href="../../wp/t/Temperate.htm" title="Temperate">temperate</a> seasonal climate, which is influenced by the <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Lakes.htm" title="Great Lakes">Great Lakes</a>. There are four seasons, with winters being cold with moderate <!--del_lnk--> snowfall while summers can be warm and humid. The area does experience <!--del_lnk--> lake effect, primarily in the form of increased cloudiness during late fall and early winter. The highest average temperature is in July at 83&nbsp;&deg;<!--del_lnk--> F (28&nbsp;&deg;<!--del_lnk--> C) while the lowest average temperature is in January at 16&nbsp;&deg;F (&minus;9&nbsp;&deg;C). However, summer temperatures can top 90&nbsp;&deg;F (32&nbsp;&deg;C), and winter temperatures can drop below 0&nbsp;&deg;F (&minus;17&nbsp;&deg;C). Average monthly precipitation ranges from 2 to 4&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> inches (44 to 92&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mm), with the heaviest occurring during the summer months. Snowfall, which normally occurs from November to April, ranges from 1 to 10&nbsp;inches (3 to 25&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> cm) per month. The highest recorded temperature was 105&nbsp;&deg;F (40.6&nbsp;&deg;C) on <!--del_lnk--> July 24, <!--del_lnk--> 1934, while the lowest recorded temperature was &minus;22.0&nbsp;&deg;F (&minus;30&nbsp;&deg;C) on <!--del_lnk--> January 19, <!--del_lnk--> 1994.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>Ann Arbor has a <!--del_lnk--> mayor-<!--del_lnk--> council form of government. The mayor, who is elected every even-numbered year, is the presiding officer of the City Council and has the power to appoint all Council committee members as well as board and commission members, with the approval of the City Council. The City Council has ten members, two from each of the city&#39;s five wards, with the mayor wielding the tie-breaking vote. Council members serve two-year terms, with half the council elected in annual elections.<p>Ann Arbor is located in the 15th Congressional district, and is represented by Representative <!--del_lnk--> John Dingell (<!--del_lnk--> D), the longest-serving member of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_House_of_Representatives.htm" title="United States House of Representatives">U.S. House</a>. On the state level, the city is in the 18th district in the <!--del_lnk--> Michigan Senate. In the <!--del_lnk--> Michigan State House of Representatives, the city of Ann Arbor is in the 53rd district, while northeastern Ann Arbor and Ann Arbor Township are in the 52nd district. As the seat of <!--del_lnk--> Washtenaw County, the city is the location of the county&#39;s trial, civil, and criminal courts. Ann Arbor is also the site of a <!--del_lnk--> United States district court, whose downtown building also houses a <!--del_lnk--> post office.<p><!--del_lnk--> Left-wing politics have been particularly strong in municipal government since the 1960s &ndash; an orientation evident in the passage of <!--del_lnk--> rent-control and strong <a href="../../wp/c/Civil_rights.htm" title="Civil rights">antidiscrimination</a> ordinances, as well as voter-approved charter amendments that have <!--del_lnk--> lessened the penalties for possession of marijuana (1974) and that aim to protect access to <!--del_lnk--> abortion in the city should it ever become illegal in the State of Michigan (1990). In 1974, <!--del_lnk--> Kathy Kozachenko&#39;s victory in an Ann Arbor city-council race made her the country&#39;s first openly <!--del_lnk--> gay or <!--del_lnk--> lesbian candidate to win public office. In 1975, Ann Arbor became the first U.S. city to use <!--del_lnk--> instant-runoff voting for a mayoral race. Adopted through a ballot initiative sponsored by the local <!--del_lnk--> Human Rights Party, which feared a splintering of the left/liberal vote, the process was repealed in 1976 after use in only one election. As of February 2006, <!--del_lnk--> Democrats hold the mayorship and all ten council seats. The city is often considered to be the most liberal area of Michigan.<p><a id="Sister_cities" name="Sister_cities"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Sister cities</span></h3>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> University of Michigan is the dominant institution of higher learning in Ann Arbor, providing the city with a distinctly <!--del_lnk--> college-town atmosphere. Much of the campus is adjacent to and intermixed with the city&#39;s downtown district. Because the campus and the city expanded side-by-side, there is often no firm divide between the two, with university buildings scattered through much of the city centre.<p>Other colleges and universities located in the city are <!--del_lnk--> Cleary University, a private business school; <!--del_lnk--> Concordia University, a Lutheran liberal-arts institution; and <!--del_lnk--> Washtenaw Community College. <!--del_lnk--> Ave Maria School of Law, a Catholic institution established by <!--del_lnk--> Domino&#39;s Pizza cofounder <!--del_lnk--> Tom Monaghan, opened in northeastern Ann Arbor in 2000. There were plans to establish <!--del_lnk--> Ave Maria University on land occupied by Domino&#39;s Farms. However, due to conflicts with local zoning authorities, the new campus is under construction near <!--del_lnk--> Naples, Florida.<p>The Ann Arbor Public School District &ndash; which enrolls a total of 16,885 students (2004/2005 September head count) &ndash; consists of twenty-one <!--del_lnk--> elementary schools, five <!--del_lnk--> middle schools, and five <!--del_lnk--> high schools (two traditional, <!--del_lnk--> Pioneer and <!--del_lnk--> Huron, as well as three alternative schools: <!--del_lnk--> Community High, Stone School, and Roberto Clemente). The district operates a K-8 open school program, Ann Arbor Open, out of the former Mack School. This program is open to all families who live anywhere in the district. Ann Arbor Public Schools also operates a preschool and family centre with programs starting as early as birth for at-risk infants and other programs for at-risk children before <!--del_lnk--> kindergarten. The district has constructed a new preschool centre to open in September 2006, with both free and tuition-based programs for all preschoolers in the district.<p>Due to overcrowding problems at the two traditional high schools, a third traditional high school is under construction. Originally slated to open for the fall of 2007, the school is now slated to open in September 2008.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

Ford Presidential Library.<p>Ann Arbor is known for college sports, notably at the University of Michigan, a member of the <!--del_lnk--> Big Ten Conference. Several well-known college sports facilities exist in the city, including <!--del_lnk--> Michigan Stadium(The Big House). Theoretically on college football game days, Ann Arbor can become Michigan&#39;s second most populous city (114,000 Ann Arbor residents plus the 110,000 seating capacity at Michigan Stadium). <!--del_lnk--> Crisler Arena and <!--del_lnk--> Yost Ice Arena play host to the school&#39;s basketball and ice hockey teams, respectively. <!--del_lnk--> Concordia University, a member of the <!--del_lnk--> NAIA, also fields sports teams.<p>A person from Ann Arbor is called an &quot;Ann Arborite,&quot; and many long-time residents call themselves &quot;townies.&quot; The city itself is often called <i>A&sup2;</i> (&quot;A-squared&quot;) or <i>A2</i> (&quot;A two&quot;), and less commonly <i>Tree Town</i> (or, usually <!--del_lnk--> tongue-in-cheek, <i>The People&#39;s Republic of Ann Arbor</i>). Recently, some youth have taken to calling Ann Arbor <i>Ace Deuce</i> or simply <i>The Deuce</i>. Ann Arbor is also referred to as &quot;28 square miles surrounded by reality&quot; a phrase originally coined by Wisconsin Governor Lee Dreyfus to describe Madison, Wisconsin.<p><a id="Events" name="Events"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Events</span></h3>
      <p>A number of annual events &ndash; many of them centered on performing and visual arts &ndash; draw visitors to Ann Arbor from around the state and the region. The Ann Arbor Folk Festival, an annual <!--del_lnk--> benefit concert held in late January for the <!--del_lnk--> Ark, features many folk musicians. The <!--del_lnk--> Ann Arbor Film Festival is held for six days in March at the <!--del_lnk--> Michigan Theatre. EdgeFest is a multi-venue festival of avant-garde and progressive jazz, held each autumn since 1997.<p>One unorthodox annual event is <!--del_lnk--> Hash Bash. Held on the first Saturday of April since 1971, the Hash Bash is an event in support of the reform of <!--del_lnk--> marijuana laws. It includes speeches, live music, street vending, and occasional <!--del_lnk--> civil disobedience. Another unorthodox event is the <!--del_lnk--> Naked Mile. Since 1986, it has featured students <!--del_lnk--> running naked through the streets in late April to celebrate the end of the winter semester. Originally police blocked off the streets to allow the run, but beginning in 2000, a crackdown by university and city police citing safety concerns has forced participants to adapt, with the event appearing in various reduced forms since.<p>Many large-scale events occur during the summer months. These include the Taste of Ann Arbor, a one-day event held during the first week of June in the downtown area; and the Ann Arbor Summer Festival, a three-and-a-half-week series of concerts, plays, and films typically held from mid-June through early July at the Power Centre and atop the adjacent parking structure, which is host to the free &quot;Top of the Park&quot; events. In <!--del_lnk--> 2006 the &quot;Top of the Park&quot; events were moved from the top of the Power Centre parking structure to a nearby courtyard near Rackham building due to construction.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Ann Arbor Art Fairs, a set of four concurrent juried fairs held on downtown streets, began in 1960. Scheduled on Wednesday through Saturday in the third week of July, the fairs draw upward of half a million visitors from across the nation. The oldest and most competitive of the four fairs is the Ann Arbor Street Art Fair.<p>Other summertime events include the Blues and Jazz Festival (established in 1969), which is usually held in mid-September at Gallup Park and also at various venues around town. The Dexter-Ann Arbor Run is a running race from <!--del_lnk--> Dexter to downtown Ann Arbor along the <!--del_lnk--> Huron River. In late August the Shopping Cart Race, an unofficial and somewhat underground competition, has been held since 1998 as part of the annual <!--del_lnk--> Seize the Week series of events, known through 2004 as &quot;Punk Week&quot;.<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Infrastructure</span></h2>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> University of Michigan Medical Centre, the preeminent health facility in the city, is considered one of the nation&#39;s best hospitals, taking the #11 slot in the 2005 <i><!--del_lnk--> U.S. News and World Report</i>. The University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) includes University Hospital, C.S. Mott Children&#39;s Hospital and Women&#39;s Hospital in its core complex. UMHS also operates out-patient clinics and facilities throughout the city. The area&#39;s other major medical centers include a large facility operated by the <!--del_lnk--> Department of Veterans Affairs in Ann Arbor and Saint Joseph Mercy Hospital in nearby <!--del_lnk--> Ypsilanti.<p><a id="Transportation" name="Transportation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Transportation</span></h3>

      <p>The city is belted by three <!--del_lnk--> highway-grade roadways: <!--del_lnk--> I-94 (which runs along the southern portion of the city), <!--del_lnk--> US 23 (which primarily runs along the eastern edge of Ann Arbor), and <!--del_lnk--> M-14 (which runs along the northern edge of the city).<p>The streets in downtown Ann Arbor conform to a grid pattern, though this pattern is less apparent in the surrounding areas. Several major roads branch out from the downtown district like spokes on a wheel to the highways surrounding the city. Some of the major surface arteries lead to the I-94/M-14 juncture in the west, US 23 in the east, and the city&#39;s southern areas. Also, a large network of <!--del_lnk--> bike paths crisscrosses the city.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Ann Arbor Transportation Authority (AATA), which brands itself as &quot;The Ride,&quot; operates public <!--del_lnk--> bus services throughout Ann Arbor and nearby <!--del_lnk--> Ypsilanti. A separate free bus service operates within the University of Michigan campuses. Plans have been floated several times to operate a trolley service between downtown and Briarwood Mall along disused rail tracks, although these have not come to fruition as of 2005. A downtown bus depot served by <!--del_lnk--> Greyhound Lines provides out-of-town bus service, and is the city&#39;s only remaining example of the <!--del_lnk--> Streamline Moderne architectural style.<p><!--del_lnk--> Ann Arbor Municipal Airport is a small aircraft general aviation facility located south of <!--del_lnk--> I-94. <!--del_lnk--> Detroit Metropolitan Airport, the area&#39;s large international airport, is located about 28 miles (45 km) east of the city, in <!--del_lnk--> Romulus. Additionally, <!--del_lnk--> Willow Run Airport in nearby Ypsilanti serves freight, corporate, and general aviation clients.<p>The city was a major rail hub, notably for freight traffic between <!--del_lnk--> Toledo and ports north of <a href="../../wp/c/Chicago.htm" title="Chicago">Chicago, Illinois</a>, from 1878 to 1982, though the <!--del_lnk--> Ann Arbor Railroad also sold 1.1 million passenger tickets in 1913 alone. The city was also served by the <!--del_lnk--> Michigan Central Railroad starting in 1837. Currently, <a href="../../wp/a/Amtrak.htm" title="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> provides service to Ann Arbor, operating its <!--del_lnk--> Wolverine three times daily in each direction between Chicago and <!--del_lnk--> Pontiac, via <a href="../../wp/d/Detroit%252C_Michigan.htm" title="Detroit, Michigan">Detroit</a>. Rail service is provided at the Ann Arbor Train Station; the present-day station neighbors the city&#39;s old Michigan Central Depot, which was renovated as a restaurant in 1969. There have been plans to build a <!--del_lnk--> commuter rail link between Ann Arbor and Detroit, with the U.S. federal government providing <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">$</a>100 million to enable its development.<p><a id="Utilities" name="Utilities"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Utilities</span></h3>

      <p>The city provides sewage disposal and water supply services, with water coming from the Huron River and groundwater sources. There are two <a href="../../wp/w/Water_purification.htm" title="Water purification">water-treatment</a> plants, one main and three outlying <a href="../../wp/d/Dam.htm" title="Dam">reservoirs</a>, four pump stations, and two <!--del_lnk--> elevated tanks. These facilities serve the city, which is divided into five water districts. Along with these facilities, the city&#39;s water department also operates four dams along the Huron River, two of which provide <!--del_lnk--> hydroelectric power. The city also offers waste management services, with recycling being handled by Recycle Ann Arbor. Other utilities are primarily provided by private entities. <!--del_lnk--> Electrical power and gas are provided by <!--del_lnk--> DTE Energy, <!--del_lnk--> Consumers Energy, and <!--del_lnk--> MichCon. <a href="../../wp/a/AT%2526T.htm" title="AT&amp;T">AT&amp;T</a>, the successor to Michigan Bell, <!--del_lnk--> Ameritech, and SBC Communications, is the primary wired telephone service provider for the area.
