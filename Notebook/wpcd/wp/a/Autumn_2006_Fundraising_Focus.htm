<h2>‘6 Villages for 2006’ campaign</h2><p><strong>23/08/2006</strong></p>
<p>Italy was crowned World Cup champion but the real winner was SOS Children.  As a result of the funds raised we will be able to support 800 orphaned and abandoned children in new family homes in six new SOS Children&rsquo;s Villages.  </p><p>In addition, we will be able to provide support to over 5,000 children and 1,000 families through additional community outreach programmes.</p><img src="../../wp/t/Twin_Towers.jpg" width="500" height="501" alt="Twin Towers at Wembley" class="right" /><p>A monoprint of Wembley&rsquo;s famous Twin Towers was the highlight of a football inspired art exhibition held at Ninetythree Gallery in London to support the &lsquo;6 Villages for 2006&rsquo; campaign. The online prediction game, SOS Football, raised more vital funds for the campaign by testing fans' knowledge of the teams.</p><p>A big thank you to everyone involved in the campaign and for making it such a huge success.</p><h3>Christmas Cards</h3>
