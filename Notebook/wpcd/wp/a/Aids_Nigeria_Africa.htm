<h2>NIGERIA</h2>
<p>The incidence of HIV/AIDS among the adult population is estimated by UNICEF to be 5.4%.  This is a national average.  The figure in Abuja, the federal capital is over 12%.  HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention including reducing mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS is a high priority for both government and NGOs.  UNICEF estimates that there are over 1.8 million orphans as a result of HIV/AIDS.  This is more than a quarter of all orphans.<br />SOS Children in Nigeria works with other NGOs which have programmes involved with the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS. This supplements the Family Strengthening Programmes of the SOS Social Centres.</p><h3>SOS SOCIAL CENTRE ISOLO - LAGOS</h3>
<p>SOS Children began working in Nigeria in 1973 in Isolo, a suburb of Lagos.  In 2004, in response to the growing needs of the local community, the SOS Social Centre began working to help inparticular children from families affected by HIV/AIDS.  This included practical help with payment of rent and school fees and donations of clothing and food as well as counselling and medical care in cooperation with the local authorities and other NGOs.</p><h3>SOS SOCIAL CENTRE EJIGBO - LAGOS</h3>
<p>As part of SOS Children's development of its Family Strengthening Programme, the SOS Social Centre Ejigbo opened in 2004.  Ejigbo is a suburb of Lagos and is about seven miles from the SOS Children's village at Isolo.  The social centre works with the Lagos State AIDS Control Agency and provides counselling services with the collaboration of Medecins Sans Frontiere and Head High International.</p><h3>SOS SOCIAL CENTRE OWU-IJEBU</h3>
<p>The SOS Children's village at Owu-Ijebu opened in 1996.  In 2004, the SOS Social Centre opened to support families affected by HIV/AIDS as part of its family strengthening programme.  The social centre supports children from 50 families who were orphaned as a result of HIV/AIDS.  This help includes paying for school fees and education materials as well as food and medecines.</p><h3>SOS SOCIAL CENTRE GWAGWALADA - ABUJA</h3>
<p>As part of the SOS Children's Village planned (2006/7) to be opened in Gwagwalada a suburb of Abuja, the federal capital of Nigeria, there will be an SOS Social Centre. The numbers of health centres and hospitals in the area are inadequate to meet the needs of the majority of the territory's ever increasing population. Primary health care and community outreach programmes will be provided for the local community.  This will include HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and counselling.</p>
