      <p>An <b>aircraft carrier</b> is a <!--del_lnk--> warship designed to deploy and recover <a href="../../wp/a/Aircraft.htm" title="Aircraft">aircraft</a> &mdash; in effect acting as a sea-going <!--del_lnk--> airbase. Aircraft carriers thus allow a <!--del_lnk--> naval force to project <!--del_lnk--> air power great distances without having to depend on local bases for land-based aircraft.<p>Modern navies that operate such ships treat aircraft carriers as the <!--del_lnk--> capital ship of the fleet, a role previously played by the <!--del_lnk--> battleship. The change, part of the growth of air power as a significant part of warfare, took place during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. A battleship could fire hundreds of large caliber shells at a target and score possibly a dozen hits. Their maximum range was usually no more than thirty miles. However, an aircraft launched from a carrier could deliver &quot;<!--del_lnk--> smart weapons&quot; accurately at a range of over one hundred miles. Thus, the aircraft carrier could perform the original mission of the battleship, causing heavy damage to an enemy fleet at great distance and with superior accuracy. Due to the long range of the striking aircraft heavy armour was less of a requirement and because of this, for example during World War II, aircraft carriers were less expensive and time consuming to build than battleships. Unescorted carriers are considered vulnerable to attack by other ships, aircraft, submarines or missiles and therefore travel as part of a <!--del_lnk--> carrier battle group. Unlike other types of capital ships in the 20th century, aircraft carrier designs since World War II have been effectively unlimited by any consideration save budgetary, and the ships have ballooned in size accordingly: The large, modern <!--del_lnk--> <i>Nimitz</i> class of United States Navy carriers has a displacement nearly four times that of the World War II-era <!--del_lnk--> USS <i>Enterprise</i>.<p>

      <p>The key aspect of the aircraft carrier is that it is, in effect, a runway at sea and modern aircraft carriers have a flat-top deck design that serves as a <!--del_lnk--> flight deck for <!--del_lnk--> take-off and <!--del_lnk--> landing of aircraft. Aircraft take off to the front, into the wind, and land from the rear. Carriers steam at speed, for example up to 35&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> knots (65&nbsp;km/h), into the wind during take-off in order to increase the <!--del_lnk--> apparent wind speed, thereby reducing the speed of the aircraft relative to the ship. On some ships, a steam-powered <!--del_lnk--> catapult is used to propel the aircraft forward assisting the power of its engines and allowing it to take off in a shorter distance than would otherwise be required, even with the headwind effect of the ship&#39;s course. On other carriers, aircraft do not require assistance for take off &mdash; the requirement for assistance relates to aircraft design and performance. Conversely, when landing on a carrier, conventional aircraft rely upon a <!--del_lnk--> tailhook that catches on <!--del_lnk--> arrestor wires stretched across the deck to bring them to a stop in a shorter distance than normal. Other aircraft &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> helicopters and <!--del_lnk--> V/STOL (Vertical/Short Take-Off and Landing) designs &mdash; utilize their hover capability to land vertically and so require no assistance in speed reduction upon landing.<p>Conventional (&quot;tailhook&quot;) aircraft rely upon a <!--del_lnk--> landing signal officer (LSO) to control the plane&#39;s landing approach, visually gauging altitude, attitude, and speed, and transmitting that data to the pilot. Before the angled deck emerged in the 1950s, LSOs used colored paddles to signal corrections to the pilot. From the late 1950s onward, visual landing aids such as mirrors provided information on proper <!--del_lnk--> glide slope, but LSOs still transmit voice calls to landing pilots by radio.<p>Since the early 1950s it has been common to direct the landing recovery area off to port at an angle to the line of the ship. The primary function of the angled deck landing area is to allow aircraft who miss the arresting wires, referred to as a &quot;bolter&quot;, to become airborne again without the risk of hitting aircraft parked on the forward parts of the deck. The angled deck also allows launching of aircraft at the same time as others land.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The above deck areas of the warship (the <!--del_lnk--> bridge, flight <!--del_lnk--> control tower, and so on) are concentrated to the <!--del_lnk--> starboard side of the deck in a relatively small area called an &quot;island&quot;. Very few carriers have been designed or built without an island and such a configuration has not been seen in a fleet sized carrier.<p>A more recent configuration, used by the British <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Navy.htm" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a>, has a &#39;ski-jump&#39; ramp at the forward end of the flight deck. This was developed to help launch <!--del_lnk--> VTOL (or <!--del_lnk--> STOVL) aircraft (aircraft that are able to take off and land with little or no forward movement) such as the <!--del_lnk--> Sea Harrier. Although the aircraft are capable of flying vertically off the deck, using the ramp is more fuel efficient. As catapults and arrestor cables are unnecessary, carriers with this arrangement reduce weight, complexity, and space needed for equipment. The disadvantage of the ski jump &mdash; and hence, the reason this configuration has not appeared on American supercarriers &mdash; is the penalty that it exacts on aircraft size, payload and fuel load (and hence, range): Large, slow planes like the <!--del_lnk--> E-2 Hawkeye and heavily-laden strike fighters like the <!--del_lnk--> F/A-18E/F Super Hornet cannot use a ski jump because their high weight requires either a longer takeoff roll than is possible on a carrier deck (even on the large <!--del_lnk--> Russian aircraft carrier Kuznetsov, lightly-loaded <!--del_lnk--> Su-33 air superiority fighters require almost the entire length of the deck to take off) or catapult assistance.<p><a id="Common_types" name="Common_types"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Common types</span></h2>
      <p>Over the course of the last century there have been several types of aircraft carrier, some of which are now obsolete. They can be generally categorized as follows:<p><a id="Initial_designs_and_inter-war_developments" name="Initial_designs_and_inter-war_developments"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Initial designs and inter-war developments</span></h3>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Balloon carriers were used during in the 19th and early 20th century, mainly for observation purposes.<li><!--del_lnk--> Seaplane tenders, such as <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Engadine</i>, fell out of frontline use after the 1920s when carriers capable of handling conventional aircraft came into fleets and the superiority of landplanes over <!--del_lnk--> seaplanes in naval operations became firmly established<li>Standard carriers, such as <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Ark Royal</i>, typically 20,000 to 65,000&nbsp;tonnes. Often known as &quot;fleet carriers&quot;<li>Flying aircraft carrier; <!--del_lnk-->  an airship that can carry aircraft. Examples include <!--del_lnk--> USS <i>Akron</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Macon</i></ul>
      <p><a id="World_War_II_developments" name="World_War_II_developments"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">World War II developments</span></h3>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Escort aircraft carriers, such as <!--del_lnk--> USS <i>Barnes</i>, were built only during World War II, and were used by the British Royal Navy and U.S. Navy<li><!--del_lnk--> Light aircraft carriers, such as <!--del_lnk--> USS <i>Independence</i>, were designed to primarily carry fighters<li><!--del_lnk--> CAM ships, such as <!--del_lnk--> SS <i>Michael E</i>, cargo carrying merchant ships which could launch but not retrieve fighter aircraft. These vessels were an emergency measure during World War II<li><!--del_lnk--> Merchant aircraft carriers (MACs), such as <!--del_lnk--> MV <i>Empire MacAlpine</i>, another emergency measure which saw cargo-carrying merchant ships equipped with flight decks<li><!--del_lnk--> Battlecarriers were created by the Imperial Japanese Navy to partially compensate for the loss of carrier strength at <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Midway.htm" title="Battle of Midway">Midway</a>. Two of them were made from <!--del_lnk--> <i>Ise</i> class battleships during late 1943. The aft turrets were removed and replaced with a hangar, deck and catapult. The heavy cruiser <!--del_lnk--> <i>Mogami</i> concurrently received a similar conversion. With half a flight deck and half of a battleship&#39;s armament, the ships were singularly worthless and seldom left port.<li><!--del_lnk--> Submarine aircraft carriers, such as the French <!--del_lnk--> <i>Surcouf</i>, or the Japanese <!--del_lnk--> I-400 class submarines which were capable of carrying 3 <!--del_lnk--> Aichi <!--del_lnk--> M6A <i>Seiran</i> aircraft. The first of these were built in the 1920s</ul>
      <p>Some <!--del_lnk--> cruisers and <!--del_lnk--> capital ships of the inter-war years often carried a catapult launched seaplane for reconnaissance and spotting the fall of the guns. It was launched by a catapult and recovered by crane from the water after landing. These were highly successful during World War II; there were many notable successes early in the war as shown by <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Warspite</i>&rsquo;s <!--del_lnk--> Walrus during operations in the Norwegian fjords in 1940. The Japanese Rufe floatplane derived from the Zero was a formidable fighter with only a slight loss in flight performance, one of their pilots scored 26 kills in the Rufe; a score only bettered by a handful of American pilots throughout WW2. Other Japanese seaplanes launched from tenders and warships sank merchant ships and small-scale ground attacks. The culmination of the type was the American 300+ mph Curtis SC-1 SeaHawk which was actually a fighter aircraft like the Rufe in addition to a two-seat gunnery spotter and transport for an injured man in a litter. Spotter seaplane aircraft on U.S. Navy cruisers and battleships were in service until 1949.<p>By World War II, <!--del_lnk--> seaplane tenders were no longer considered as the main method to project air power at sea due to the lessened flight performance of their seaplanes over land and carrier-based planes. Carriers could operate conventional aircraft that could fly farther, faster, and carry more weapons, all while boasting greater performance. However, seaplane tenders in conjunction with PBY Catalina patrol bombers could range farther across the oceans than short-range carrier planes as the &quot;eyes of the fleet&quot; and rescued thousands of men stranded in the water who would have perished otherwise. As the end of the war neared, early helicopters were taking over many of the roles of <!--del_lnk--> seaplanes but at a marked loss in speed, range and flexibility that has not been regained to the present day. In the 1950s the aerodynamic limitations of seaplanes had finally been overcome; several seaplane designs were superior in performance to their land-based counterparts; the P-6M Seamaster patrol bomber and R3Y Tradewind &quot;Flying LST&quot; transport planes flew faster than the B-52 and the C-130; but in a power struggle with the ruling aircraft carrier bureaucracy were cancelled despite that their use in conjunction with special seaplane tenders would be more tactically and cost effective than large, vulnerable aircraft carriers operating shorter ranged and lesser payload aircraft.<p><a id="Post-war_developments" name="Post-war_developments"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Post-war developments</span></h3>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Amphibious assault carriers, such as <!--del_lnk--> USS <i>Tarawa</i>, which often also serve the purpose of carrying and landing <!--del_lnk--> soldiers and operate a large contingent of helicopters for that purpose. Also known as &quot;commando carriers&quot; or &quot;helicopter carriers&quot;.<li><!--del_lnk--> Anti-submarine warfare carriers, also known as &quot;helicopter carriers.&quot;<li><!--del_lnk--> Supercarriers, such as <!--del_lnk--> USS <i>Nimitz</i>, typically 75,000&nbsp;tonnes or greater. Powered by nuclear reactors and forming the core of a fleet designed to operate far from home.</ul>
      <p>Many modern warships have <!--del_lnk--> helicopter landing capability and helicopter assault ships represent a new form of amphibious assault carrier.<p><a id="History_and_milestones" name="History_and_milestones"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History and milestones</span></h2>
      <p>Though aircraft carriers are given their definition with respect to fixed-wing aircraft, the first known instance of using a ship for airborne operations occurred in 1806, when the British Royal Navy&#39;s Lord <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Cochrane launched kites from the 32-gun frigate <i><!--del_lnk--> HMS Pallas</i> in order to drop propaganda leaflets on the French territory.<p><a id="Balloon_carriers" name="Balloon_carriers"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Balloon carriers</span></h3>

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> July 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1849, the Austrian Navy ship <i>Vulcano</i> launched a manned hot air balloon in order to drop bombs on <!--del_lnk--> Venice, although the attempt failed due to contrary winds.<p>Later, during the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>, about the time of the <!--del_lnk--> Peninsula Campaign, gas-filled <!--del_lnk--> balloons were being used to perform reconnaissance on Confederate positions, the battles turned inland into the heavily forested areas of the Peninsula where balloons could not travel. A coal barge, the George Washington Parke Custis, was cleared of all deck rigging to accommodate the gas generators and apparatus of balloons. From the GWP Prof. <!--del_lnk--> Thaddeus S. C. Lowe, Chief Aeronaut of the <!--del_lnk--> Union Army Balloon Corps, made his first ascents over the <!--del_lnk--> Potomac River and telegraphed claims of the success of the first aerial venture ever made from a water-borne vessel. Other barges were converted to assist with the other military balloons transported about the eastern waterways. It is only fair to point out in deference to modern aircraft carriers that none of these Civil War crafts had ever taken to the high seas.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The invention of the <!--del_lnk--> seaplane in March 1910 with the French <i><!--del_lnk--> Le Canard</i> led to the earliest development of a ship designed to carry airplanes, albeit equipped with floats: in December <!--del_lnk--> 1911 appears the French Navy <i><!--del_lnk--> La Foudre</i>, the first <!--del_lnk--> seaplane carrier, and the first known carrier of <!--del_lnk--> airplanes. Commissioned as a seaplane tender, and carrying float-equipped planes under hangars on the main deck, from where they were lowered on the sea with a crane, she participated in tactical exercises in the Mediterranean in 1912. <i>La Foudre</i> was further modified in November 1913 with a 10 meters flat deck to launch her seaplanes.<p><!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Hermes</i>, temporarily converted as an experimental seaplane carrier in April-May 1913, is also one of the first seaplane carriers, and the first experimental seaplane carrier of the British Navy. She was originally laid down as a merchant ship, but was converted on the building stocks to be a seaplane carrier for a few trials in 1913, before being converted again to a cruiser, and back again to a seaplane carrier in 1914. She served in the <!--del_lnk--> Dardanelles campaign and was sunk by a German submarine in October 1914. The first seaplane tender of the US Navy was the <!--del_lnk--> USS <i>Mississippi</i>, converted to that role in December 1913.<p><a id="Genesis_of_the_flat-deck_carrier" name="Genesis_of_the_flat-deck_carrier"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Genesis of the flat-deck carrier</span></h3>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 placed strict limits on the tonnages of battleships and <!--del_lnk--> battlecruisers for the major naval powers after <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, as well as limits not only on the total tonnage for carriers, but also an upper limit on 27,000&nbsp;tonnes for each ship. Although exceptions were made regarding the max ship tonnage (fleet units counted, experimental units did not), the total tonnage could not be exceeded. However, while all of the major navies were over-tonnage on battleships, they were all considerably under-tonnage on aircraft carriers. Consequently, many battleships and battlecruisers under construction (or in service) were converted into aircraft carriers. The first ship to have a full length flat deck was <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Argus</i> the conversion of which was completed in September 1918, with the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Navy not following suit until 1920, when the conversion of <!--del_lnk--> USS <i>Langley</i> (an experimental ship which did not count against America&#39;s carrier tonnage) had completed.

      <p>The first purpose-designed aircraft carrier to be developed was the <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Hermes</i>, although the first one to be commissioned was the Japanese <!--del_lnk--> <i>H&#x14D;sh&#x14D;</i> (commissioned in December 1922, followed by HMS <i>Hermes</i> in July 1923). <i>Hermes</i>&#39; design preceded and influenced that of <i>H&#x14D;sh&#x14D;</i>, and its construction actually began earlier, but numerous tests, experiments and budget considerations delayed its commission.<p>By the late 1930s, aircraft carriers around the world typically carried three types of aircraft: <!--del_lnk--> torpedo bombers, also used for conventional bombings and <!--del_lnk--> reconnaissance; <!--del_lnk--> dive bombers, also used for reconnaissance (in the U.S. Navy, this type of aircraft were known as &quot;scout bombers&quot;); and <!--del_lnk--> fighters for fleet defence and bomber escort duties. Because of the restricted space on aircraft carriers, all these aircraft were of small, single-engined types, usually with <!--del_lnk--> folding wings to facilitate storage.<p><a id="Second_World_War" name="Second_World_War"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Second World War</span></h3>
      <p>Aircraft carriers played a significant role in World War II. With seven aircraft carriers afloat, the British Royal Navy had a considerable numerical advantage at the start of the war as neither the Germans nor the Italians had carriers of their own. However, the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Glorious</i> by <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">German</a> battlecruisers during the Norwegian campaign in 1940.<p>This apparent weakness to battleships was turned on its head in November 1940 when <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Illustrious</i> launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at <!--del_lnk--> Taranto. This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships in the harbour at a cost of two of the 21 attacking <!--del_lnk--> Fairey Swordfish <!--del_lnk--> torpedo bombers. Carriers also played a major part in reinforcing <a href="../../wp/m/Malta.htm" title="Malta">Malta</a>, both by transporting planes and by defending convoys sent to supply the besieged island. The use of carriers prevented the <!--del_lnk--> Italian Navy and land-based German aircraft from dominating the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> theatre.<p>In the Atlantic, aircraft from HMS <i>Ark Royal</i> and <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Victorious</i> were responsible for slowing <!--del_lnk--> <i>Bismarck</i> during May 1941. Later in the war, escort carriers proved their worth guarding convoys crossing the <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic and <!--del_lnk--> Arctic oceans.<p>Many of the major battles in the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific involved aircraft carriers. <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> started the war with ten aircraft carriers, the largest and most modern carrier fleet in the world at that time. There were six American aircraft carriers at the beginning of the hostilities, although only three of them were operating in the Pacific.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Drawing on the 1939 Japanese development of low-depth runs for aerial torpedoes and the 1940 British aerial attack on the Italian fleet at <!--del_lnk--> Taranto, the 1941 Japanese surprise <a href="../../wp/a/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor.htm" title="Attack on Pearl Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbour</a> was a clear illustration of the <!--del_lnk--> power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Concentrating six flattops in a single striking unit marked a turning point in naval history, as no other nation had fielded anything comparable. (Though Germany and Italy began construction of carriers, neither were completed. Of the two, Germany&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Graf Zeppelin</i> had the greater potential.)<p>Meanwhile, the Japanese began their advance through <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asia and the <!--del_lnk--> sinking of <i>Prince of Wales</i> and <i>Repulse</i> by Japanese land-based aircraft drove home the need for this ship class for fleet defence from aerial attack. In April 1942, the Japanese fast carrier strike force ranged into the <!--del_lnk--> Indian Ocean and sank shipping, including the damaged and undefended carrier <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Hermes</i>. Smaller Allied fleets with inadequate aerial protection were forced to retreat or be destroyed. In the <!--del_lnk--> Coral Sea, US and Japanese fleets traded aircraft strikes in the first battle where neither side&#39;s ships sighted the other. At the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Midway.htm" title="Battle of Midway">Battle of Midway</a> four Japanese carriers were sunk by planes from three American carriers, and the battle is considered the turning point of the war in the Pacific.<p>Subsequently the US was able to build up large numbers of aircraft aboard a mixture of fleet, light and (newly commissioned) escort carriers, primarily with the introduction of the <!--del_lnk--> Essex class in 1943. These ships, around which were built the fast carrier task forces of the <!--del_lnk--> Third and <!--del_lnk--> Fifth Fleets, played a major part in winning the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific war. The eclipse of the battleship as the primary component of a fleet was clearly illustrated by the sinking of the largest battleship ever built, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Yamato</i>, by carrier-borne aircraft in 1945. Japan also built the largest aircraft carrier of the war, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Shinano</i>, which, like <i>Yamato</i>, was named after a Japanese province.<p><a id="Wartime_innovations" name="Wartime_innovations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Wartime innovations</span></h2>

      <p>Combat experience proved that the British invention of the sealed &quot;hurricane bow&quot; which protected against storms was superior to any other use for the very front of the ship, be it machine-guns or a second flight deck. This became standard for British and American carriers. The Japanese carrier <!--del_lnk--> <i>Taih&#x14D;</i> was the first of their ships to incorporate it.<p>Starting late in the war with the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Midway</i> class, American carriers had grown so large that it was no longer practical to continue the concept of designing the hangar deck to be the strength deck, and all subsequent American carriers have the flight deck as the strength deck, leaving only the island as superstructure.<p><a id="Light_Aircraft_Carriers" name="Light_Aircraft_Carriers"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Light Aircraft Carriers</span></h3>
      <p>The loss of three major carriers in quick succession in the Pacific led the US Navy to develop the light carrier (CVL) from <!--del_lnk--> light cruiser hulls that had already been laid down. These were intended to add fighter squadrons to a task force, and were used in the US Navy only during World War II. The actual U.S. Navy classification was small aircraft carrier (CVL), not light. Prior to July <!--del_lnk--> 1943, they were just classified as aircraft carriers (CV).<p>The British Royal Navy made a similar design which served both them and <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth countries after World War II. One of these carriers, India&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> INS <i>Viraat</i>, formerly <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Hermes</i>, is still being used.<p><a id="Escort_Carriers_and_Merchant_Aircraft_Carriers" name="Escort_Carriers_and_Merchant_Aircraft_Carriers"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Escort Carriers and Merchant Aircraft Carriers</span></h3>
      <p>To protect Atlantic <!--del_lnk--> convoys, the British developed what they called <!--del_lnk--> Merchant Aircraft Carriers, which were merchant ships equipped with a flat deck for half a dozen aircraft. These operated with civilian crews, under merchant colors, and carried their normal cargo besides providing air support for the convoy. As there was no lift or hangar, aircraft maintenance was limited and the aircraft spent the entire trip sitting on the deck.<p>These served as stop-gap until dedicated <!--del_lnk--> escort carriers could be built in the US (US classification <i>CVE</i>). About a third of the size of a fleet carrier, it carried about two dozen aircraft for anti-submarine duties. Over one hundred were built or converted from merchantmen.<p>Escort carriers were built in the US from two basic hull designs: one from a merchant ship, and the other from a slightly larger, slightly faster tanker. Besides defending convoys, these were used to transport aircraft across the ocean. Nevertheless, some participated in the battles to liberate the <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>, notably the <!--del_lnk--> battle off Samar in which six escort carriers and their escorting destroyers briefly took on five Japanese battleships and bluffed them into retreating.<p><a id="Catapult_Aircraft_Merchantmen" name="Catapult_Aircraft_Merchantmen"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Catapult Aircraft Merchantmen</span></h3>
      <p>As an emergency stop-gap before sufficient merchant aircraft carriers became available, the British provided air cover for convoys using <i>Catapult aircraft merchantman</i> (CAM ships) and <!--del_lnk--> merchant aircraft carriers. CAM ships were merchant vessels equipped with an aircraft, usually a battle-weary <!--del_lnk--> Hawker Hurricane, launched by a catapult. Once launched, the aircraft could not land back on the deck and had to ditch in the sea if it was not within range of land. Over two years, fewer than 10 launches were ever made, yet these flights did have some success: 6 bombers for the loss of a single pilot.<p><a id="Post-war_developments_2" name="Post-war_developments_2"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Post-war developments</span></h2>

      <p>During the Second World War, aircraft would land on the flight deck parallel to the long axis of the ship&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> hull. Aircraft which had already landed would be parked on the deck at the bow end of the flight deck. A crash barrier was raised behind them to stop any landing aircraft which overshot the landing area because its landing hook missed the arrestor cables. If this happened, it would often cause serious damage or injury and even, if the crash barrier was not strong enough, destruction of parked aircraft.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>An important development of the early 1950s was the British invention of the angled deck, where the runway was canted at an angle of a few degrees across the ship. If an aircraft misses the arrestor cables, the pilot only needs to increase <!--del_lnk--> engine power to maximum to get airborne again and will not hit the parked aircraft because the angled deck points out over the sea. The <!--del_lnk--> USS <i>John C. Stennis</i> is an example of an aircraft carrier that utilizes the concept of an angled landing deck.<p><a id="Steam_catapults" name="Steam_catapults"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Steam catapults</span></h3>
      <p>The modern <!--del_lnk--> steam-powered catapult, powered by steam from the ship&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> boilers or reactors, was invented by Commander C.C. Mitchell <!--del_lnk--> RNVR. It was widely adopted following trials on <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Perseus</i> between 1950 and 1952 which showed it to be more powerful and reliable than the compressed air catapults which had been introduced in the 1930s.<p><a id="Landing_systems" name="Landing_systems"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Landing systems</span></h3>
      <p>Another British invention was the glide-slope indicator (also known as a &quot;meatball&quot;). This was a gyroscopically-controlled lamp (which used a <!--del_lnk--> Fresnel lens) on the port side of the deck which could be seen by the aviator who was about to land, indicating to him whether he was too high or too low in relation to the desired glidepath. It also took into account the effect of the waves on the flight deck. The device became a necessity as the landing speed of aircraft increased.<p><a id="Nuclear_age" name="Nuclear_age"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Nuclear age</span></h3>
      <p>The US Navy prematurely attempted to become a strategic nuclear force with the project to build <!--del_lnk--> <i>United States</i>, termed CVA, with the &quot;A&quot; signifying &quot;atomic&quot;. This ship would have carried twin-propeller bombers, each of which could carry an atomic bomb. The project was cancelled under pressure from the newly-created <!--del_lnk--> United States Air Force, and the letter &quot;A&quot; was re-cycled to mean &quot;attack.&quot; But this only delayed the growth of carriers. <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_weapon.htm" title="Nuclear weapon">Nuclear weapons</a> would put to sea despite Air Force objections in 1955 aboard <!--del_lnk--> USS <i>Forrestal</i>, and by the end of the fifties the Navy had a series of nuclear-armed attack aircraft.<p>The US Navy also built aircraft carriers powered by nuclear reactors. <!--del_lnk--> USS <i>Enterprise</i> was the first aircraft carrier to be powered in this way and subsequent supercarriers took advantage of this technology to increase their endurance. The only other nation to have followed the US lead is France with <!--del_lnk--> <i>Charles de Gaulle</i>.<p><a id="Helicopters" name="Helicopters"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Helicopters</span></h3>
      <p>The post-war years also saw the development of the helicopter with different capabilities to a fighter aircraft. Whereas fixed-wing aircraft are suited to air-to-air combat and air-to-surface attack, helicopters are used to transport equipment and personnel and can be used in an <!--del_lnk--> anti-submarine warfare role with dipped sonar and missiles.<p>In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the UK converted some of its old carriers into Commando Carriers, sea-going helicopter airfields like <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Bulwark</i>. To militate against the expensive connotations of the term &quot;aircraft carrier&quot;, the new <!--del_lnk--> <i>Invincible</i> class carriers were originally designated &quot;through deck cruisers&quot; and were initially helicopter only craft to operate as escort carriers. The arrival of the Sea Harrier meant they could carry fixed wing aircraft despite their short flight deck.<p><a id="Post-Second_World_War_conflicts" name="Post-Second_World_War_conflicts"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Post-Second World War conflicts</span></h2>

      <p>The United States Navy fought &quot;the most protracted, bitter, and costly war&quot; (Ren&eacute; Francillon) in the history of naval aviation from <!--del_lnk--> August 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1964 to <!--del_lnk--> August 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1973 in the waters of the <a href="../../wp/s/South_China_Sea.htm" title="South China Sea">South China Sea</a>. Operating from two deployment points (<!--del_lnk--> Yankee Station and <!--del_lnk--> Dixie Station), carrier aircraft supported combat operations in <!--del_lnk--> South Vietnam and conducted bombing operations in conjunction with the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Air Force in <!--del_lnk--> North Vietnam under <!--del_lnk--> Operations Flaming Dart, <!--del_lnk--> Rolling Thunder, and <!--del_lnk--> Linebacker.<p>21 aircraft carriers (all operational attack carriers during the era except <!--del_lnk--> <i>John F. Kennedy</i>) deployed to <!--del_lnk--> Task Force 77 of the U.S. <!--del_lnk--> Seventh Fleet, conducting 86 war cruises and operating 9,178 total days on the line in the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf of Tonkin. 530 aircraft were lost in combat and 329 more in operational accidents, causing the deaths of 377 naval aviators, with 64 others reported missing and 179 taken <!--del_lnk--> prisoner-of-war. 205 officers and men of the ship&#39;s complements of three carriers (<!--del_lnk--> <i>Forrestal</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Enterprise</i>, and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Oriskany</i>) were killed in major shipboard fires.<p><a id="Falklands_War" name="Falklands_War"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Falklands War</span></h3>
      <p>During the <!--del_lnk--> Falklands War the United Kingdom was able to win a conflict 8,000&nbsp;miles (13,000&nbsp;km) from home in large part due to the use of the full size carrier HMS <i>Hermes</i> and the smaller <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Invincible</i>. The Falklands showed the value of a <!--del_lnk--> VSTOL aircraft &mdash; the <!--del_lnk--> Hawker-Siddeley Harrier (the RN Sea Harrier and press-ganged RAF Harriers) in defending the fleet and assault force from shore based aircraft and for attacking the enemy. Helicopters from the carriers were used to deploy troops and pick up the wounded.<p><a id="Operations_in_the_Gulf" name="Operations_in_the_Gulf"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Operations in the Gulf</span></h3>
      <p>The US has also made use of carriers in the <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Gulf.htm" title="Persian Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and to protect its interests in the Pacific. During the <!--del_lnk--> 2003 invasion of Iraq US aircraft carriers served as the primary base of US air power. Even without the ability to place significant numbers of aircraft in Middle Eastern airbases, the United States was capable of carrying out significant air attacks from carrier-based squadrons. Recently, US aircraft carriers, such as the USS <i>Ronald Reagan</i> provided air support for counter-insurgency operations in Iraq.<p><a id="Aircraft_carriers_today" name="Aircraft_carriers_today"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Aircraft carriers today</span></h2>

      <p>Aircraft carriers are generally the largest ships operated by <!--del_lnk--> navies; a <!--del_lnk--> <i>Nimitz</i> class carrier powered by two <!--del_lnk--> nuclear reactors and four <!--del_lnk--> steam turbines is 1092&nbsp;feet (333&nbsp;m) long and costs about $4.5 billion. The United States has the majority of aircraft carriers with a dozen in service and a dozen in reserve, and its aircraft carriers are a cornerstone of American power projection capability.<p>Nine countries maintain aircraft carriers: <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, and <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>.

This is often termed a battle group or carrier group, sometimes a <!--del_lnk--> carrier battle group.<p>In the early 21st century, worldwide aircraft carriers are capable of carrying about 1250 aircraft. US carriers account for over 1000 of these; the second leading country, the United Kingdom fields around 66 aircraft. The United Kingdom and France are both undergoing a major expansion in carrier capability (with a <!--del_lnk--> common ship class), but the United States will still maintain a very large lead.<p><a id="Future_aircraft_carriers" name="Future_aircraft_carriers"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Future aircraft carriers</span></h2>
