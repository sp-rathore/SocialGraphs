      <p><b>Ancient Greece</b> is the period in <!--del_lnk--> Greek history which lasted for around one thousand years and ended with the rise of <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>. It is considered by some historians to be one of the foundational cultures of <!--del_lnk--> Western Civilization. <!--del_lnk--> Greek culture was a powerful influence in the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>, which carried a version of it to many parts of <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>. The civilization of the Ancient Greeks has been immensely influential on the language, politics, educational systems, philosophy, science, and arts, fuelling the <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> in Western Europe and again resurgent during various <a href="../../wp/n/Neoclassicism.htm" title="Neoclassicism">neo-Classical</a> revivals in <a href="../../wp/1/18th_century.htm" title="18th century">18th</a> and <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a> Europe and the <!--del_lnk--> Americas.<p><b>Ancient Greece</b> is also the term used to describe the <!--del_lnk--> Greek-speaking world in ancient times. It refers not only to the modern <a href="../../wp/c/Continent.htm" title="Continent">continental</a> <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greece</a>, but also to areas of <!--del_lnk--> Hellenic culture that were settled in ancient times by Greeks: <a href="../../wp/c/Cyprus.htm" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> and the Aegean islands, the <!--del_lnk--> Aegean <!--del_lnk--> coast of <!--del_lnk--> Anatolia (then known as <!--del_lnk--> Ionia), <!--del_lnk--> Sicily and southern <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> (known as <!--del_lnk--> Magna Graecia), and the scattered Greek settlements on the coasts of <!--del_lnk--> Colchis, <!--del_lnk--> Illyria, <!--del_lnk--> Thrace, <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Cyrenaica, southern <!--del_lnk--> Gaul, east and northeast of the <!--del_lnk--> Iberian peninsula, <!--del_lnk--> Iberia and <!--del_lnk--> Taurica.<p>

      <p>There are no fixed or universally agreed upon dates for the beginning or the end of the Ancient Greek period. In common usage it refers to all Greek history before the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>, but historians use the term more precisely. Some writers include the periods of the Greek-speaking <!--del_lnk--> Mycenaean civilization that collapsed about <!--del_lnk--> 1150 BC, though most would argue that the influential <a href="../../wp/m/Minoan_civilization.htm" title="Minoan civilization">Minoan</a> was so different from later Greek cultures that it should be classed separately.<p>In the modern Greek school-books, &quot;ancient times&quot; is a period of about 900 years, from the catastrophe of <!--del_lnk--> Mycenae until the conquest of the country by the <!--del_lnk--> Romans, that is divided in four periods, based on styles of art as much as culture and politics. The historical line starts with <!--del_lnk--> Greek Dark Ages (<!--del_lnk--> 1100&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 800 BC). In this period artists use geometrical schemes such as squares, circles, lines to decorate <!--del_lnk--> amphoras and other pottery. The <!--del_lnk--> archaic period (<!--del_lnk--> 800&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 500 BC) represents those years when the artists made larger free-standing sculptures in stiff, hieratic poses with the dreamlike &quot;archaic smile&quot;. In the <!--del_lnk--> classical period (500&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 323 BC) artists perfected the style that since has been taken as exemplary: &quot;classical&quot;, such as the <a href="../../wp/p/Parthenon.htm" title="Parthenon">Parthenon</a>. In the <a href="../../wp/h/Hellenistic_Greece.htm" title="Hellenistic Greece">Hellenistic</a> years that followed the conquests of <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander</a> (323&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 146 BC), also known as <!--del_lnk--> Alexandrian, aspects of Hellenic civilization expanded to Egypt and <!--del_lnk--> Bactria.<p>Traditionally, the Ancient Greek period was taken to begin with the date of the first recorded <a href="../../wp/o/Olympic_Games.htm" title="Olympic Games">Olympic Games</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 776 BC, but many historians now extend the term back to about <!--del_lnk--> 1000 BC. The traditional date for the end of the Ancient Greek period is the death of <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a> in 323 BC. The following period is classed <a href="../../wp/h/Hellenistic_Greece.htm" title="Hellenistic Greece">Hellenistic</a> or the integration of Greece into the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Republic in 146 BC.<p>These dates are historians&#39; conventions and some writers treat the Ancient Greek civilization as a continuum running until the advent of <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> in the <a href="../../wp/3/3rd_century.htm" title="3rd century">3rd century</a>.<p><a id="Origins" name="Origins"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Origins</span></h2>
      <p>The Greeks are believed to have migrated southward into the Balkan peninsula in several waves beginning in the late <!--del_lnk--> 3rd millennium BC, the last being the <!--del_lnk--> Dorian invasion. <!--del_lnk--> Proto-Greek is assumed to date to some time between the 23rd and 17th centuries BC. The period from <!--del_lnk--> 1600 BC to about 1100 BC is described in <!--del_lnk--> History of Mycenaean Greece known for the reign of <!--del_lnk--> King Agamemnon and the wars against Troy as narrated in the epics of <a href="../../wp/h/Homer.htm" title="Homer">Homer</a>. The period from 1100 BC to the <!--del_lnk--> 8th century BC is a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Dark Age&quot; from which no primary texts survive, and only scant archaeological evidence remains. Secondary and tertiary texts such as <a href="../../wp/h/Herodotus.htm" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>&#39; <i>Histories</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Pausanias&#39; <i>Description of Greece</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Diodorus&#39; <i>Bibliotheca</i>, and <!--del_lnk--> Jerome&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Chronicon</i> contain brief chronologies and king lists for this period. The history of Ancient Greece is often taken to end with the reign of <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>, who died in <!--del_lnk--> 323 BC. Subsequent events are described in <a href="../../wp/h/Hellenistic_Greece.htm" title="Hellenistic Greece">Hellenistic Greece</a>.<p>Any history of Ancient Greece requires a cautionary note on sources. Those Greek historians and political writers whose works have survived, notably <a href="../../wp/h/Herodotus.htm" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Thucydides.htm" title="Thucydides">Thucydides</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Xenophon, <a href="../../wp/d/Demosthenes.htm" title="Demosthenes">Demosthenes</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, were mostly either <a href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Athens">Athenian</a> or pro-Athenian. That is why we know far more about the history and politics of Athens than of any other city, and why we know almost nothing about some cities&#39; histories. These writers, furthermore, concentrate almost wholly on political, military and diplomatic history, and ignore economic and social history. All histories of Ancient Greece have to contend with these limits in their sources.<p><a id="The_rise_of_Greece" name="The_rise_of_Greece"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The rise of Greece</span></h2>

      <p>In the 8th century BC, Greece began to emerge from the Dark Ages which followed the fall of the Mycenaean civilization. Literacy had been lost and the Mycenaean script forgotten, but the Greeks created the <!--del_lnk--> Greek alphabet, most likely by modifying the <!--del_lnk--> Phoenician. From about 800 BC written records begin to appear. Greece was divided into many small self-governing communities, the latter being a pattern dictated by Greek geography, where every island, valley and plain is cut off from its neighbours by the sea or mountain ranges.<p><!--del_lnk--> Population grew beyond the capacity of its limited <a href="../../wp/a/Arable_land.htm" title="Arable land">arable land</a> (according to Mogens Herman Hansen, the population of Ancient Greece increased by a factor larger than ten during the period from 800 BC to 350 BC, increasing from a population of 700,000 to a total estimated population of 8 to 10 million) . From about <!--del_lnk--> 750 BC the Greeks began 250 years of expansion, settling colonies in all directions. To the east, the <!--del_lnk--> Aegean coast of <!--del_lnk--> Asia Minor was colonized first, followed by <!--del_lnk--> Cyprus and the coasts of <!--del_lnk--> Thrace, the <!--del_lnk--> Sea of Marmara and south coast of the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Sea.htm" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a>. Eventually Greek colonization reached as far north-east as present day <a href="../../wp/u/Ukraine.htm" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>. To the west the coasts of <!--del_lnk--> Illyria, <!--del_lnk--> Sicily and southern <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> were settled, followed by the south coast of France, <!--del_lnk--> Corsica, and even northeastern <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>. Greek colonies were also founded in <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">Egypt</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Libya. Modern <!--del_lnk--> Syracuse, <!--del_lnk--> Naples, <a href="../../wp/m/Marseille.htm" title="Marseille">Marseille</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/Istanbul.htm" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> had their beginnings as the Greek colonies Syracusae <i>(&Sigma;&upsilon;&rho;&alpha;&kappa;&omicron;&#x3CD;&sigma;&alpha;&iota;)</i>, Neapolis <i>(&Nu;&epsilon;&#x3AC;&pi;&omicron;&lambda;&iota;&sigmaf;)</i>, Massalia <i>(&Mu;&alpha;&sigma;&sigma;&alpha;&lambda;&#x3AF;&alpha;)</i> and <!--del_lnk--> Byzantion <i>(&Beta;&upsilon;&zeta;&#x3AC;&nu;&tau;&iota;&omicron;&nu;)</i>.<p>By the <!--del_lnk--> 6th century BC the Greek world had become a cultural and linguistic area much larger than the geographical area of present Greece. Greek colonies were not politically controlled by their founding cities, although they often retained religious and commercial links with them. The Greeks both at home and abroad organized themselves into independent communities, and the city (<i><!--del_lnk--> polis</i>) became the basic unit of Greek government.<p>In this period a huge economic development occurred in Greece and its overseas colonies, with the growth of commerce and manufacture. There also was a large improvement in the living standards of the population. Some studies estimate that the average size of the Greek household, in the period from <!--del_lnk--> 800 BC to <!--del_lnk--> 300 BC, increased five times, which indicates a large increase in the average income of the population.<p>At its economic height, in the 4th century BC, Ancient Greece was the most advanced economy in the world. According to some economic historians, it was one of the most advanced pre-industrial economies. This is demonstrated by the average daily wage of the Greek worker, it was, in terms of grain (about 13 kg), more than 4 times the average daily wage of the Egyptian (about 3kg).<p><a id="Social_and_political_conflict" name="Social_and_political_conflict"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Social and political conflict</span></h2>
      <p>The Greek cities were originally monarchies, although many of them were very small and the term &quot;King&quot; (<i><!--del_lnk--> basileus</i>) for their rulers is misleadingly grand. In a country always short of farmland, power rested with a small class of landowners, who formed a warrior <!--del_lnk--> aristocracy fighting frequent petty inter-city wars over land and rapidly ousting the monarchy. About this time the rise of a mercantile class (shown by the introduction of <!--del_lnk--> coinage in about <!--del_lnk--> 680 BC) introduced class conflict into the larger cities. From <!--del_lnk--> 650 BC onwards, the aristocracies had to fight not to be overthrown and replaced by <!--del_lnk--> populist leaders called <!--del_lnk--> tyrants (<i>tyrranoi</i>), a word which did not necessarily have the modern meaning of oppressive dictators.<p>By the <!--del_lnk--> 6th century BC several cities had emerged as dominant in Greek affairs: <a href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Athens">Athens</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Sparta, <!--del_lnk--> Corinth, and <!--del_lnk--> Thebes. Each of them had brought the surrounding rural areas and smaller towns under their control, and Athens and Corinth had become major maritime and mercantile powers as well. Athens and Sparta developed a rivalry that dominated Greek politics for generations.<p>In Sparta, the <!--del_lnk--> landed aristocracy retained their power, and the constitution of <!--del_lnk--> Lycurgus (about <!--del_lnk--> 650 BC) entrenched their power and gave Sparta a permanent militarist regime under a dual monarchy. Sparta dominated the other cities of the <!--del_lnk--> Peloponnese, with the sole exceptions of <!--del_lnk--> Argus and <!--del_lnk--> Achaia.<p>In Athens, by contrast, the monarchy was abolished in <!--del_lnk--> 683 BC, and reforms of <!--del_lnk--> Solon established a moderate system of aristocratic government. The aristocrats were followed by the tyranny of <!--del_lnk--> Pisistratus and his sons, who made the city a great naval and commercial power. When the Pisistratids were overthrown, <!--del_lnk--> Cleisthenes established the world&#39;s first <!--del_lnk--> democracy (<!--del_lnk--> 500 BC), with power being held by an assembly of all the male citizens. But it must be remembered that only a minority of the male inhabitants were citizens, excluding slaves, freedmen and non-Athenians.<p><a id="The_Persian_Wars" name="The_Persian_Wars"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Persian Wars</span></h2>

      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> Ionia (the modern Aegean coast of <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>) the Greek cities, which included great centres such as <!--del_lnk--> Miletus and <!--del_lnk--> Halicarnassus, were unable to maintain their independence and came under the rule of the <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Empire.htm" title="Persian Empire">Persian Empire</a> in the mid 6th century BC. In <!--del_lnk--> 499 BC the Greeks rose in the <!--del_lnk--> Ionian Revolt, and Athens and some other Greek cities went to their aid.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 490 BC the Persian Great King, <!--del_lnk--> Darius I, having suppressed the Ionian cities, sent a fleet to punish the Greeks. The Persians landed in <!--del_lnk--> Attica, but were defeated at the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Marathon.htm" title="Battle of Marathon">Battle of Marathon</a> by a Greek army led by the Athenian general <!--del_lnk--> Miltiades. The burial mound of the Athenian dead can still be seen at Marathon.<p>Ten years later Darius&#39; successor, <!--del_lnk--> Xerxes I, sent a much more powerful force by land. After being delayed by the Spartan King <!--del_lnk--> Leonidas I at <!--del_lnk--> Thermopylae, Xerxes advanced into Attica, where he captured and burned Athens. But the Athenians had evacuated the city by sea, and under <!--del_lnk--> Themistocles they defeated the Persian fleet at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Salamis. A year later, the Greeks, under the Spartan <!--del_lnk--> Pausanius, defeated the Persian army at <!--del_lnk--> Plataea.<p>The Athenian fleet then turned to chasing the Persians out of the Aegean Sea, and in <!--del_lnk--> 478 BC they captured <!--del_lnk--> Byzantium. In the course of doing so Athens enrolled all the island states and some mainland allies into an alliance, called the <!--del_lnk--> Delian League because its treasury was kept on the sacred island of <!--del_lnk--> Delos. The Spartans, although they had taken part in the war, withdrew into isolation after it, allowing Athens to establish unchallenged naval and commercial power.<p><a id="Dominance_of_Athens" name="Dominance_of_Athens"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Dominance of Athens</span></h2>

      <p>The Persian Wars ushered in a century of Athenian dominance of Greek affairs. Athens was the unchallenged master of the sea, and also the leading commercial power, although Corinth remained a serious rival. The leading statesman of this time was <a href="../../wp/p/Pericles.htm" title="Pericles">Pericles</a>, who used the tribute paid by the members of the Delian League to build the <a href="../../wp/p/Parthenon.htm" title="Parthenon">Parthenon</a> and other great monuments of classical Athens. By the mid 5th century the League had become an <!--del_lnk--> Athenian Empire, symbolized by the transfer of the League&#39;s treasury from Delos to the Parthenon in <!--del_lnk--> 454 BC.<p>The wealth of Athens attracted talented people from all over Greece, and also created a wealthy leisure class who became patrons of the arts. The Athenian state also sponsored learning and the arts, particularly architecture. Athens became the centre of Greek literature, philosophy (see <!--del_lnk--> Greek philosophy) and the arts (see <!--del_lnk--> Greek theatre). Some of the greatest names of Western cultural and intellectual history lived in Athens during this period: the dramatists <!--del_lnk--> Aeschylus, <!--del_lnk--> Aristophanes, <!--del_lnk--> Euripides, and <!--del_lnk--> Sophocles, the philosophers <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a>, and <a href="../../wp/s/Socrates.htm" title="Socrates">Socrates</a>, the historians <a href="../../wp/h/Herodotus.htm" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Thucydides.htm" title="Thucydides">Thucydides</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Xenophon, the poet <!--del_lnk--> Simonides and the sculptor <!--del_lnk--> Pheidias. The city became, in Pericles&#39;s words, &quot;the school of Hellas&quot;.<p>The other Greek states at first accepted Athenian leadership in the continuing war against the Persians, but after the fall of the conservative politician <!--del_lnk--> Cimon in <!--del_lnk--> 461 BC, Athens became an increasingly open imperialist power. After the Greek victory at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Eurymedon in <!--del_lnk--> 466 BC, the Persians were no longer a threat, and some states, such as <!--del_lnk--> Naxos, tried to secede from the League, but were forced to submit. The new Athenian leaders, <a href="../../wp/p/Pericles.htm" title="Pericles">Pericles</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Ephialtes, let relations between Athens and Sparta deteriorate, and in <!--del_lnk--> 458 BC war broke out. After some years of inconclusive war a 30-year peace was signed between the <!--del_lnk--> Delian League and the <!--del_lnk--> Peloponnesian League (Sparta and her allies). This coincided with the last battle between the Greeks and the Persians, a sea battle off <!--del_lnk--> Salamis in <a href="../../wp/c/Cyprus.htm" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, followed by the <!--del_lnk--> Peace of Callias (<!--del_lnk--> 450 BC) between the Greeks and Persians.<p><a id="The_Peloponnesian_War" name="The_Peloponnesian_War"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Peloponnesian War</span></h2>

      <p>In 431 BC war broke out again between Athens and Sparta and its allies. The immediate causes of the Peloponnesian War vary from account to account. However, three causes are fairly consistent among the ancient historians, namely <a href="../../wp/t/Thucydides.htm" title="Thucydides">Thucydides</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Plutarch. Prior to the war, Corinth and one of its colonies, <!--del_lnk--> Corcyra (modern-day <!--del_lnk--> Corfu), got into a dispute in which Athens intervened. Soon after, Corinth and Athens argued over control of <!--del_lnk--> Potidaea (near modern-day <!--del_lnk--> Nea Potidaia), eventually leading to an Athenian siege of Potidaea. Finally, Athens issued a series of economic decrees known as the <!--del_lnk--> &quot;Megarian Decrees&quot; that placed economic sanctions on the Megarian people. Athens was accused by the Peloponnesian allies of violating the <!--del_lnk--> Thirty Years Peace through all of the aforementioned actions, and Sparta formally declared war on Athens.<p>It should be noted that many historians consider these simply to be the immediate causes of the war. They would argue that the underlying cause was the growing resentment of Sparta and its allies at the dominance of Athens over Greek affairs. The war lasted 27 years, partly because Athens (a naval power) and Sparta (a land-based military power) found it difficult to come to grips with each other.<p>Sparta&#39;s initial strategy was to invade <!--del_lnk--> Attica, but the Athenians were able to retreat behind their walls. An outbreak of <!--del_lnk--> plague in the city during the siege caused heavy losses, including Pericles. At the same time the Athenian fleet landed troops in the Peloponnese, winning battles at <!--del_lnk--> Naupactus (429 BC) and <!--del_lnk--> Pylos (425 BC). But these tactics could bring neither side a decisive victory. After several years of inconclusive campaigning, the moderate Athenian leader <!--del_lnk--> Nicias concluded the <!--del_lnk--> Peace of Nicias (421 BC).<p>In 418 BC, however, hostility between Sparta and the Athenian ally <!--del_lnk--> Argos led to a resumption of fighting. At <!--del_lnk--> Mantinea Sparta defeated the combined armies of Athens and her allies. The resumption of fighting brought the war party, led by <a href="../../wp/a/Alcibiades.htm" title="Alcibiades">Alcibiades</a>, back to power in Athens. In 415 BC Alcibiades persuaded the Athenian Assembly to launch a major expedition against <!--del_lnk--> Syracuse, a Peloponnesian ally in <!--del_lnk--> Sicily. Though Nicias was a skeptic about the <!--del_lnk--> Sicilian Expedition, he was appointed along with Alcibiades to lead the expedition. Due to accusations against him, Alcibiades fled to Sparta where he persuaded Sparta to send aid to Syracuse. As a result, the expedition was a complete disaster and the whole expeditionary force was lost. Nicias was executed by his captors.<p>Sparta had now built a fleet (with the help of the Persians) to challenge Athenian naval supremacy, and had found a brilliant military leader in <!--del_lnk--> Lysander, who seized the strategic initiative by occupying the <!--del_lnk--> Hellespont, the source of Athens&#39; grain imports. Threatened with starvation, Athens sent its last remaining fleet to confront Lysander, who decisively defeated them at <!--del_lnk--> Aegospotami (405 BC). The loss of her fleet threatened Athens with bankruptcy. In 404 BC Athens sued for peace, and Sparta dictated a predictably stern settlement: Athens lost her city walls, her fleet, and all of her overseas possessions. The totalitarian party took power in Athens with Spartan support.<p><a id="Spartan_and_Theban_dominance" name="Spartan_and_Theban_dominance"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Spartan and Theban dominance</span></h2>

      <p>The end of the Peloponnesian War left Sparta the master of Greece, but the narrow outlook of the Spartan warrior elite did not suit them to this role. Within a few years the democratic party regained power in Athens and other cities. In <!--del_lnk--> 395 BC the Spartan rulers removed Lysander from office, and Sparta lost her naval supremacy. <a href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Athens">Athens</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Argos, <!--del_lnk--> Thebes, and <!--del_lnk--> Corinth, the latter two formerly Spartan allies, challenged Spartan dominance in the <a href="../../wp/c/Corinthian_War.htm" title="Corinthian War">Corinthian War</a>, which ended inconclusively in <!--del_lnk--> 387 BC. That same year Sparta shocked Greek opinion by concluding the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Antalcidas with Persia, by which they surrendered the Greek cities of Ionia and Cyprus; thus they reversed a hundred years of Greek victories against Persia. Sparta then tried to further weaken the power of Thebes, which led to a war where Thebes formed an alliance with the old enemy, Athens.<p>Then the Theban generals <a href="../../wp/e/Epaminondas.htm" title="Epaminondas">Epaminondas</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Pelopidas won a decisive victory at <!--del_lnk--> Leuctra (<!--del_lnk--> 371 BC). The result of this battle was the end of Spartan supremacy and the establishment of Theban dominance, but Athens herself recovered much of her former power because the supremacy of Thebes was short-lived. With the death of Epaminondas at <!--del_lnk--> Mantinea (<!--del_lnk--> 362 BC) the city lost its greatest leader, and his successors blundered into an ineffectual ten-year war with <!--del_lnk--> Phocis. In <!--del_lnk--> 346 BC the Thebans appealed to <!--del_lnk--> Philip II of Macedon to help them against the Phocians, thus drawing <a href="../../wp/m/Macedon.htm" title="Macedon">Macedon</a> into Greek affairs for the first time.<p><a id="The_rise_of_Macedon" name="The_rise_of_Macedon"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The rise of Macedon</span></h2>

      <p>The Kingdom of <a href="../../wp/m/Macedon.htm" title="Macedon">Macedon</a> was formed in the 7th century BC. They played little part in Greek politics before the 5th century BC. In the beginning of the 4th century BC, King Philip of Macedon, an ambitious man who had been educated in Thebes, wanted to play a larger role. In particular, he wanted to be accepted as the new leader of Greece in recovering the freedom of the Greek cities of Asia from Persian rule. By seizing the Greek cities of <!--del_lnk--> Amphipolis, <!--del_lnk--> Methone and <!--del_lnk--> Potidaea, he gained control of the gold and silver mines of Macedonia. This gave him the resources to realize his ambitions.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Philip established Macedonian dominance over <!--del_lnk--> Thessaly (<!--del_lnk--> 352 BC) and <!--del_lnk--> Thrace, and by <!--del_lnk--> 348 BC he controlled everything north of <!--del_lnk--> Thermopylae. He used his great wealth to bribe Greek politicians, creating a &quot;Macedonian party&quot; in every Greek city. His intervention in the war between Thebes and Phocis brought him great recognition, and gave him his opportunity to become a power in Greek affairs. Against him the Athenian leader <a href="../../wp/d/Demosthenes.htm" title="Demosthenes">Demosthenes</a>, in a series of famous speeches (<!--del_lnk--> philippics) roused the Athenians to resist Philip&#39;s advance.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 339 BC Thebes and Athens formed an alliance to resist Philip&#39;s growing influence. Philip struck first, advancing into Greece and defeating the allies at <!--del_lnk--> Chaeronea in <!--del_lnk--> 338 BC. This traditionally marks the start of the decline of the city-state institution, though they mostly survived as independent states until <!--del_lnk--> Roman times.<p><!--del_lnk--> Philip tried to win over the Athenians by flattery and gifts, but these efforts met with limited success. He organized the cities into the <!--del_lnk--> League of Corinth, and announced that he would lead an invasion of Persia to liberate the Greek cities and avenge the Persian invasions of the previous century.

      <p>Philip was succeeded by his 20-year-old son <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander</a>, who immediately set out to carry out his father&#39;s plans. When he saw that Athens had fallen, he wanted to bring back the tradition of Athens by destroying the Persian King. He travelled to Corinth where the assembled Greek cities recognized him as leader of the Greeks, then set off north to assemble his forces. The core structure of his army was the hardy Macedonian mountain-fighter, but he bolstered his numbers and diversified his army with levies from all corners of Greece. He enriched his tactics and formation with Greek strategem ranging from Theban cavalry structure to Spartan guerilla tactics. His engineering and manufacturing were largely derived of Greek origin &ndash; involving everything from Archimedal siege-weaponry to Ampipholian ship-reinforcement. But while Alexander was campaigning in Thrace, he heard that the Greek cities had rebelled. He swept south again, captured Thebes, and razed the city to the ground. He left only one building standing, the house of Pindar, a poet who had written in favour of Alexander&#39;s ancestor, Alexander the First. This acted as a symbol and warning to the Greek cities that his power could no longer be resisted, whilst reminding them he would preserve and respect their culture if they were obedient.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 334 BC Alexander crossed into Asia, and defeated the Persians at the river <!--del_lnk--> Granicus. This gave him control of the Ionian coast, and he made a triumphal procession through the liberated Greek cities. After settling affairs in <!--del_lnk--> Anatolia, he advanced south through <!--del_lnk--> Cilicia into <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a>, where he defeated <!--del_lnk--> Darius III at <!--del_lnk--> Issus (<!--del_lnk--> 333 BC). He then advanced through <!--del_lnk--> Phoenicia to <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, which he captured with little resistance, the Egyptians welcoming him as a liberator from Persian oppression, and the prophesized son of <!--del_lnk--> Amun.<p>Darius was now ready to make peace and Alexander could have returned home in triumph, but Alexander was determined to conquer Persia and make himself the ruler of the world. He advanced north-east through Syria and <a href="../../wp/m/Mesopotamia.htm" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, and defeated Darius again at <!--del_lnk--> Gaugamela (<!--del_lnk--> 331 BC). Darius fled and was killed by his own followers, and Alexander found himself the master of the Persian Empire, occupying <!--del_lnk--> Susa and <!--del_lnk--> Persepolis without resistance.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Meanwhile the Greek cities were making renewed efforts to escape from Macedonian control. At <!--del_lnk--> Megalopolis in <!--del_lnk--> 331 BC, Alexander&#39;s regent <!--del_lnk--> Antipater defeated the Spartans, who had refused to join the Corinthian League or recognize Macedonian supremacy.<p>Alexander pressed on, advancing through what are now <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> to the <!--del_lnk--> Indus river valley, and by <!--del_lnk--> 326 BC he had reached <!--del_lnk--> Punjab. He might well have advanced down the <!--del_lnk--> Ganges to <!--del_lnk--> Bengal had not his army, convinced they were at the end of the world, refused to go any further. Alexander reluctantly turned back, and died of a fever in <!--del_lnk--> Babylon in <!--del_lnk--> 323 BC.<p>Alexander&#39;s empire broke up soon after his death, but his conquests permanently changed the Greek world. Thousands of Greeks travelled with him or after him to settle in the new Greek cities he had founded as he advanced, the most important being <!--del_lnk--> Alexandria in <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>. Greek-speaking kingdoms in Egypt, Syria, Persia and Bactria were established. The knowledge and cultures of east and west began to permeate and interact. The <!--del_lnk--> Hellenistic age had begun.<p><a id="Society" name="Society"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Society</span></h2>
      <p>The distinguishing features of Ancient Greek society were the division between free and slave, the differing roles of men and women, the relative lack of status distinctions based on birth, and the importance of religion. The way of life of the Athenians was common in the Greek world compared to Sparta&#39;s special system.<p><a id="Social_Structure" name="Social_Structure"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Social Structure</span></h3>
      <p>Only free people could be citizens entitled to the full protection of the law in a <!--del_lnk--> city-state. In most city-states, unlike <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Rome</a>, social prominence did not allow special rights. For example, being born in a certain family generally brought no special privileges. Sometimes families controlled public religious functions, but this ordinarily did not give any extra power in the government. In <a href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Athens">Athens</a>, the population was divided into four social classes based on wealth. People could change classes if they made more money. In <!--del_lnk--> Sparta, all male citizens were given the title of &quot;equal&quot; if they finished their education. However, Spartan kings, who served as the city-state&#39;s dual military and religious leaders, came from two families. <!--del_lnk--> Slaves had no power or status. They had the right to have a family and own property, however they had no political rights. By <!--del_lnk--> 600 BC <!--del_lnk--> chattel slavery had spread in <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greece</a>. By the <!--del_lnk--> 5th century BC slaves made up one-third of the total population in some city-states. Slaves outside of Sparta almost never revolted because they were made up of too many nationalities and were too scattered to organize.<p>Most families owned slaves as household servants and labourers, and even poor families might have owned a few slaves. Owners were not allowed to beat or kill their slaves. Owners often promised to free slaves in the future to encourage slaves to work hard. Unlike in Rome, slaves who were freed did not become citizens. Instead, they were mixed into the population of <i><!--del_lnk--> metics</i>, which included people from foreign countries or other city-states who were officially allowed to live in the state.<p>City-states also legally owned slaves. These public slaves had a larger measure of independence than slaves owned by families, living on their own and performing specialized tasks. In Athens, public slaves were trained to look out for counterfeit coinage, while temple slaves acted as servants of the temple&#39;s deity.<p>Sparta had a special type of slaves called <i><!--del_lnk--> helots</i>. Helots were Greek war captives owned by the state and assigned to families. Helots raised food and did household chores so that women could concentrate on raising strong children while men could devote their time to training as <!--del_lnk--> hoplites. Their masters treated them harshly and helots often revolted.<p><a id="Way_of_Life" name="Way_of_Life"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Way of Life</span></h3>

      <p>For a long time, the way of life in the Greek city-states remained the same. People living in cities resided in low <!--del_lnk--> apartment buildings or single-family homes, depending on their wealth. Residences, public buildings, and temples were situated around the <!--del_lnk--> agora. Citizens also lived in small villages and farmhouses scattered across the state&#39;s countryside. In Athens, more people lived outside the city walls than inside (it is estimated that from a total population of four hundred thousand people, 160,000 people lived inside the city, which is a large rate of urbanization for a pre-industrial society).<p>A common Greek household was simple if compared to a modern one, containing bedrooms, storage rooms, and a kitchen situated around a small inner courtyard. Its average size, about 230 square metres in the 4th century, was much larger than the houses of other ancient civilizations.<p>A household consisted of a single set of parents and their children, but generally no relatives. Men were responsible for supporting the family by work or investments in land and commerce. Women were responsible for managing the household&#39;s supplies and overseeing slaves, who fetched water in jugs from public <!--del_lnk--> fountains, cooked, cleaned, and looked after babies. Men kept separate rooms for entertaining guests because male visitors were not permitted in rooms where women and children spent most of their time. Wealthy men would sometimes invite friends over for a <i><!--del_lnk--> symposium</i>. Light came from <a href="../../wp/o/Olive_oil.htm" title="Olive oil">olive</a> <!--del_lnk--> oil lamps, while heat came from <!--del_lnk--> charcoal <!--del_lnk--> braziers. Furniture was simple and sparse, which included wooden chairs, tables, and beds.<p>The majority of Greeks worked in <!--del_lnk--> agriculture, probably 80% of the entire population, which is similar to all pre-industrial civilizations. The soil in Greece is poor and rainfall is very unpredictable. Research suggests the climate has changed little since ancient times, so frequent weeding and turning of soil was needed. Oxen might have helped with ploughing, however most tasks would have been done by hand. The Greek farmer would ideally plan for a surplus of crops to contribute to feasts and to buy pottery, fish, salt and metals.<p>Ancient Greek food was simple as well. Poor people mainly ate <a href="../../wp/b/Barley.htm" title="Barley">barley</a> <!--del_lnk--> porridge flavoured with <a href="../../wp/o/Onion.htm" title="Onion">onions</a>, <!--del_lnk--> vegetables, and <a href="../../wp/c/Cheese.htm" title="Cheese">cheese</a> or olive oil. Few people ever ate meat regularly, except for the free distributions from <!--del_lnk--> animal sacrifices at state festivals. Sheep when eaten was mutton: &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Philochorus [3rd c.] relates that a prohibition was issued at Athens against anyone tasting lamb which had not been shorn. Bakeries sold fresh <a href="../../wp/b/Bread.htm" title="Bread">bread</a> daily, while small stands offered snacks. <a href="../../wp/w/Wine.htm" title="Wine">Wine</a> diluted with <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a> was a favoured beverage.<p>Greek clothing changed little over time. Both men and women wore loose <!--del_lnk--> peplos and <!--del_lnk--> chitons. The tunics often had colourful designs and were worn cinched with a belt. People wore cloaks and hats in cold weather, and in warm weather <!--del_lnk--> sandals replaced <!--del_lnk--> leather <!--del_lnk--> boots. Women wore <a href="../../wp/j/Jewellery.htm" title="Jewellery">jewellery</a> and <!--del_lnk--> cosmetics - especially powdered lead, which gave them a pale complexion. Men grew beards until <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a> created a vogue for <!--del_lnk--> shaving.<p>Medicine in Ancient Greece was limited if compared to modern medicine. <a href="../../wp/h/Hippocrates.htm" title="Hippocrates">Hippocrates</a> helped separate superstition from medical treatment in the 5th century BC. Herbal remedies were used to reduce pain, and doctors were able to perform some surgery. But they had no cure for infections, so even healthy people could die quickly from disease at any age.<p>To keep fit and to be ready for <!--del_lnk--> military service, men exercised daily. Almost every city-state had at least one <!--del_lnk--> gymnasium, a combination exercise building, running track, bathing facility, lecture hall, and park. In most cities (other than Sparta) gymnasia were open only to males, and exercise was taken in the <!--del_lnk--> nude. City-state <!--del_lnk--> festivals provided great amounts of entertainment. Gods were honoured with competitions in <a href="../../wp/m/Music.htm" title="Music">music</a>, <a href="../../wp/d/Drama.htm" title="Drama">drama</a>, and <a href="../../wp/p/Poetry.htm" title="Poetry">poetry</a>. Athenians boasted that their city hosted a festival nearly every other day. Huge Panhellenic festivals were held at <!--del_lnk--> Olympia, <!--del_lnk--> Delphi, <!--del_lnk--> Nemea and <!--del_lnk--> Isthmia. Athletes and musicians who won these competitions became rich and famous. The most popular and expensive competition was <!--del_lnk--> chariot racing.<p><a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h3>
      <p>For most of Greek history, education was private, except in Sparta. During the <!--del_lnk--> Hellenistic period, some city-states established public schools. Only wealthy families could afford a teacher. Boys learned how to read, write and quote literature. They also learned to sing and play one musical instrument and were trained as athletes for military service. They studied not for a job but to become an effective citizen. Girls also learned to read, write and do simple <a href="../../wp/a/Arithmetic.htm" title="Arithmetic">arithmetic</a> so they could manage the household. They almost never received education after childhood.<p>A small number of boys continued their education after childhood, one example is the Spartans (with military education). A crucial part of a wealthy teenager&#39;s education was a <!--del_lnk--> loving mentor relationship with an elder. The teenager learned by watching his mentor talking about politics in the <i>agora</i>, helping him perform his public duties, exercising with him in the gymnasium and attending symposia with him. The richest students continued their education to <!--del_lnk--> college, and went to a <a href="../../wp/u/University.htm" title="University">university</a> in a large city. These universities were organized by famous teachers. Some of Athens&#39; greatest universities included the <!--del_lnk--> Lyceum and the <!--del_lnk--> Academy.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece&quot;</div>
