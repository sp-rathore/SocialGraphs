      <p><a id="Birth" name="Birth"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Birth</span></h2>
      <p>Achilles was the son of the immortal <!--del_lnk--> Peleus, king of the <!--del_lnk--> Myrmidons in <!--del_lnk--> Troy (southeast <!--del_lnk--> Thessaly), and the sea nymph <!--del_lnk--> Thetis. <a href="../../wp/z/Zeus.htm" title="Zeus">Zeus</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Poseidon had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until <!--del_lnk--> Prometheus, the food-bringer, warned Zeus of a prophecy that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed to Peleus. As with most mythology there is a tale which offers an alternate version of these events: in <i><!--del_lnk--> Argonautica</i> (iv.760) <!--del_lnk--> Hera alludes to Thetis&#39; chaste resistance to the advances of <a href="../../wp/z/Zeus.htm" title="Zeus">Zeus</a>, that Thetis had been so loyal to Hera&#39;s marriage bond that she coolly rejected him.<p>According to the incomplete poem <i>Achilleis</i> written by <!--del_lnk--> Statius in the first century AD, and to no other sources, when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river <!--del_lnk--> Styx. However, she forgot to wet the heel she held him by, leaving him vulnerable at that spot. (See <!--del_lnk--> Achilles&#39; heel, <!--del_lnk--> Achilles&#39; tendon.) It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier. In another version of this story, Thetis anointed the boy in <!--del_lnk--> ambrosia and put him on top of a fire to burn away the mortal parts of his body. She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage.<p>However none of the sources before Statius makes any reference to this invulnerability. To the contrary, in the <i>Iliad</i> Homer mentions Achilles being wounded: in Book 21 the <!--del_lnk--> Paeonian hero <!--del_lnk--> Asteropaeus, son of Pelegon, challenged Achilles by the river Scamander. He cast two spears at once, one grazed Achilles&#39; elbow, &quot;drawing a spurt of blood.&quot;<p>Also in the fragmentary poems of the <!--del_lnk--> Epic Cycle in which we can find description of the hero&#39;s death, <!--del_lnk--> K&ugrave;pria (unknown author), <i><!--del_lnk--> Aithiopis</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Arctinus of Miletus, <i><!--del_lnk--> Ilias Mikr&agrave;</i> by Lesche of Mytilene, Iliou p&egrave;rsis by <!--del_lnk--> Arctinus of Miletus, there is no trace of any reference to his invulnerability or his famous (achilles) heel; in the later vase-paintings presenting Achilles&#39; death, the arrow (or in many cases arrows) hit his body.<p>Peleus entrusted Achilles to <!--del_lnk--> Chiron the <!--del_lnk--> Centaur, on Mt. <!--del_lnk--> Pelion, to be raised.<p><a id="Achilles_in_the_Trojan_War" name="Achilles_in_the_Trojan_War"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Achilles in the Trojan War</span></h2>

      <p>Achilles is the only mortal to experience consuming rage (<i>menis</i>). His anger is at some times wavering, at other times absolute. The humanization of Achilles by the events of the war is an important theme of the narrative.<p><a id="Telephus" name="Telephus"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Telephus</span></h4>
      <p>When the Greeks left for the Trojan War, they accidentally stopped in <!--del_lnk--> Mysia, ruled by King <!--del_lnk--> Telephus. In the resulting battle, Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal; Telephus consulted an oracle, who stated that &quot;he that wounded shall heal&quot;.<p>According to other reports in <!--del_lnk--> Euripides&#39; lost play about Telephus, he went to <!--del_lnk--> Aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound. Achilles refused, claiming to have no medical knowledge. Alternatively, Telephus held <!--del_lnk--> Orestes for ransom, the ransom being Achilles&#39; aid in healing the wound. <a href="../../wp/o/Odysseus.htm" title="Odysseus">Odysseus</a> reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound; therefore, the spear must be able to heal it. Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed. This is an example of <!--del_lnk--> sympathetic magic.<p><a id="Cycnus_of_Colonae" name="Cycnus_of_Colonae"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Cycnus of Colonae</span></h4>
      <p>According to traditions related by <!--del_lnk--> Plutarch and the Byzantine scholar <!--del_lnk--> John Tzetzes, once the Greek ships arrived in Troy, Achilles fought and killed <!--del_lnk--> Cycnus of Colonae, a son of Poseidon. Cycnus was invulnerable, except for his head.<p><a id="Troilus" name="Troilus"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Troilus</span></h4>
      <p>According to <!--del_lnk--> Dares Phrygius&#39; <i>Account of the Destruction of Troy</i>, the Latin summary through which the story of Achilles was transmitted to medieval Europe, while <!--del_lnk--> Troilus, the youngest son of <!--del_lnk--> Priam and <!--del_lnk--> Hecuba (who some say was fathered by <!--del_lnk--> Apollo), was watering his horses at the Lion Fountain outside the walls of Troy, Achilles saw him and fell in love with his beauty (whose &quot;loveliness of form&quot; was described by <!--del_lnk--> Ibycus as being like &quot;gold thrice refined&quot;). The youth rejected his advances and took refuge inside the temple of Apollo. Achilles pursued him into the sanctuary and decapitated him on the god&#39;s own altar. At the time, Troilus was said to be a year short of his twentieth birthday, and the legend goes that if Troilus had lived to be twenty, Troy would have been invincible.<p><a id="In_the_Iliad" name="In_the_Iliad"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">In the <i>Iliad</i></span></h4>

      <p><a href="../../wp/h/Homer.htm" title="Homer">Homer&#39;s</a> <i><!--del_lnk--> Iliad</i> is the most famous narrative of Achilles&#39; deeds in the <a href="../../wp/t/Trojan_War.htm" title="Trojan War">Trojan War</a>. The Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the war, and does not narrate Achilles&#39; death. It begins with Achilles&#39; withdrawal from battle after he is dishonored by <a href="../../wp/a/Agamemnon.htm" title="Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>, the commander of the <!--del_lnk--> Achaean forces. Agamemnon had taken a woman named <!--del_lnk--> Chryseis as his slave, her father <!--del_lnk--> Chryses, a priest of <a href="../../wp/a/Apollo.htm" title="Apollo">Apollo</a>, begged Agamemnon to return her to him. Agamemnon refused and Apollo sent a plague amongst the Greeks. The prophet <!--del_lnk--> Calchas correctly determined the source of the troubles but would not speak unless Achilles vowed to protect him. Achilles did so and Calchas declared Chyrsies must be returned to her father. Agamemnon consented, but then commanded that Achilles&#39; slave <!--del_lnk--> Briseis be brought to replace Chryseis. Angry at the dishonor (and as he says later, because he loved Briseis) and at the urging of Thetis, Achilles refused to fight or lead his <!--del_lnk--> Myrmidons alongside the other Greek forces.<p>As the battle turned against the Greeks, <!--del_lnk--> Nestor declared that had Agamemnon not angered Achilles, the Trojans would not be winning and urged Agamemnon to appease Achilles. Agamemnon agreed and sent <a href="../../wp/o/Odysseus.htm" title="Odysseus">Odysseus</a> and two other chieftains to Achilles with the offer of the return of Briseis and other gifts. Achilles refused and urged the Greeks to sail home as he was planning to do.<p>Eventually, however, hoping to retain glory despite his absence from the battle, Achilles prayed to his mother Thetis, asking her to plead with Zeus to allow the Trojans to push back the Greek forces. The Trojans, led by <!--del_lnk--> Hector, subsequently pushed the Greek army back toward the beaches and assaulted the Greek ships. With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction, Achilles consented to Patroclus (sometimes considered Achilles&#39; lover) leading the <!--del_lnk--> Myrmidons into battle, though Achilles would remain at his camp. Patroclus succeeded in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches, but was killed by Hector before he could lead a proper assault on the city of Troy.<p><a id="Hector_versus_Achilles" name="Hector_versus_Achilles"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Hector versus Achilles</span></h3>
      <p>After receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from <!--del_lnk--> Antilochus, the son of Nestor, Achilles grieved over his friend and held many funeral games in his honour. His mother Thetis came to comfort the distraught Achilles. She persuaded <!--del_lnk--> Hephaestus to make new armor for him, in place of the armor that Patroclus had been wearing which was taken by <!--del_lnk--> Hector. The new armor included the <!--del_lnk--> Shield of Achilles, described in great detail by the poet.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Enraged over the death of Patroclus, Achilles ended his refusal to fight and took the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector. Achilles even got in a fight with the river god <!--del_lnk--> Scamander who became angry that Achilles was choking his waters with all the men he killed. The god tried to drown Achilles but was stopped by <!--del_lnk--> Hera and Hephaestus. Zeus himself took note of Achilles&#39; rage and sent the gods to restrain him so that he would not go on to sack Troy itself, seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles could defy fate itself as Troy was not meant to be destroyed yet. Finally Achilles found his prey. Achilles chased Hector around the wall of Troy three times before <a href="../../wp/a/Athena.htm" title="Athena">Athena</a>, in the form of Hector&#39;s favorite and dearest brother, <!--del_lnk--> Deiphobus, persuaded Hector to fight face to face. Achilles got his vengeance, killing Hector with a blow to the neck. He then tied Hector&#39;s body to his <!--del_lnk--> chariot and dragged it around the battlefield for nine days.<p>With the assistance of the god <!--del_lnk--> Hermes, Priam, Hector&#39;s father, went to Achilles&#39; tent and convinced Achilles to permit him to allow Hector his funeral rites. The final passage in the <i>Iliad</i> is Hector&#39;s funeral, after which the doom of Troy is just a matter of time.<p><a id="Memnon" name="Memnon"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Memnon</span></h4>
      <p>Following the death of Patroclus, Achilles&#39;s closest companion was Nestor&#39;s son <!--del_lnk--> Antilochus. When <!--del_lnk--> Memnon of <a href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia.htm" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> killed Antilochus, Achilles was once again drawn onto the battlefield to seek revenge. The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus, except that Memnon (unlike Hector) is also the son of a goddess (like Achilles). Many Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the <i>Iliad&#39;</i>s description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles&#39; reaction to it. The episode then formed the basis of the <!--del_lnk--> cyclic epic <i><!--del_lnk--> Aethiopis</i>, which was composed after the <i>Iliad</i>, possibly in the 7th century BC. The <i>Aethiopis</i> is now lost, except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors. <!--del_lnk--> Quintus of Smyrna also gives us an epic treatment of Memnon&#39;s mortal death and the immortality then bestowed upon him by Zeus as well as lyrical description of his countrymen&#39;s extreme grief.<p><a id="Penthesilea.2C_and_the_death_of_Achilles" name="Penthesilea.2C_and_the_death_of_Achilles"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Penthesilea, and the death of Achilles</span></h4>

      <p>Achilles, after his temporary truce with Priam, fought and killed the <!--del_lnk--> Amazonian warrior queen <!--del_lnk--> Penthesilea.<p>As predicted by <!--del_lnk--> Hector with his dying breath, Achilles was thereafter killed by <!--del_lnk--> Paris &mdash; either by an arrow (to the heel according to <!--del_lnk--> Statius), or in an older version by a knife to the back while visiting <!--del_lnk--> Polyxena, a princess of Troy. In some versions, the god <a href="../../wp/a/Apollo.htm" title="Apollo">Apollo</a> guided Paris&#39; arrow.<p>Both versions conspicuously deny the killer any sort of valor owing to the common conception that Paris was a coward and not the man his brother Hector was, and Achilles remains undefeated on the battlefield. His bones are mingled with those of <!--del_lnk--> Patroclus, and funeral games are held. He was represented in the lost Trojan War epic of <!--del_lnk--> Arctinus of Miletus as living after his death in the island of <!--del_lnk--> Leuke at the mouth of the <a href="../../wp/d/Danube.htm" title="Danube">Danube</a> (see below).<p>Paris was later killed by <!--del_lnk--> Philoctetes using the enormous bow of <a href="../../wp/h/Heracles.htm" title="Heracles">Heracles</a>.<p><a id="The_fate_of_Achilles.27_armor" name="The_fate_of_Achilles.27_armor"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The fate of Achilles&#39; armor</span></h4>
      <p>Achilles&#39; armor was the object of a feud between <a href="../../wp/o/Odysseus.htm" title="Odysseus">Odysseus</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Telamonian Ajax (Achilles&#39; older cousin). They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles and the most deserving to receive it. Odysseus won. Ajax went mad with grief and anguish and vowed to kill his comrades; he started killing cattle or sheep, thinking in his madness that they were Greek soldiers. He then killed himself.<p><a id="Achilles_and_Patroclus" name="Achilles_and_Patroclus"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Achilles and Patroclus</span></h2>

      <p>Achilles&#39; relationship with Patroclus is a key aspect of his myth. Its exact nature has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times. In the <i><!--del_lnk--> Iliad</i>, it is clear that the two heroes have a deep and extremely meaningful friendship, but the evidence of a romantic or sexual element is equivocal. Commentators from the classical period to today have tended to interpret the relationship through the lens of their own cultures. Thus, in <!--del_lnk--> 5th century BC <a href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Athens">Athens</a> the relationship was commonly interpreted as <!--del_lnk--> pederastic. Contemporary readers are more likely to interpret the two heroes either as non-sexual &quot;war buddies&quot; or as an egalitarian <!--del_lnk--> homosexual couple.<p><a id="The_cult_of_Achilles_in_antiquity" name="The_cult_of_Achilles_in_antiquity"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The cult of Achilles in antiquity</span></h2>
      <p>There was an archaic cult of Achilles on the <!--del_lnk--> White Island, <i>Leuce</i>, in the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Sea.htm" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a> off the modern coasts of <a href="../../wp/r/Romania.htm" title="Romania">Romania</a> and <a href="../../wp/u/Ukraine.htm" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, with a temple and an <!--del_lnk--> oracle which survived into the Roman period.<p>In the lost epic <i><!--del_lnk--> Aithiopis</i>, a continuation of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Iliad</i> attributed to <!--del_lnk--> Arktinus of Miletos, Achilles&rsquo; mother Thetis returned to mourn him and removed his ashes from the pyre and took them to Leuce at the mouths of the Danube. There the Achaeans raised a tumulus for him and celebrated funeral games.<p><!--del_lnk--> Pliny&#39;s Natural History (IV.27.1) mentions a <!--del_lnk--> tumulus that is no longer evident (<i>Insula Achillis tumulo eius viri clara</i>), on the island consecrated to him, located at a distance of fifty Roman miles from <!--del_lnk--> Peuce by the <!--del_lnk--> Danube Delta, and the temple there. <!--del_lnk--> Pausanias has been told that the island is &quot;covered with forests and full of animals, some wild, some tame. In this island there is also Achilles&rsquo; temple and his statue&rdquo; (III.19.11). Ruins of a square temple 30 meters to a side, possibly that dedicated to Achilles, were discovered by Captain Kritzikly in 1823, but there has been no modern archeology done on the island.<p><!--del_lnk--> Pomponius Mela tells that Achilles is buried in the island named Achillea, between Boristhene and Ister (<i>De situ orbis</i>, II, 7). And the Greek geographer Dionysius Periegetus of Bithynia, who lived at the time of Domitian, writes that the island was called <i>Leuce</i> &quot;because the wild animals which live there are white. It is said that there, in Leuce island, reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes, and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island; this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues, because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour&rdquo; (<i>Orbis descriptio</i>, v. 541, quoted in Densu&#x15F;ianu 1913).<p>The <i><!--del_lnk--> Periplus of the Euxine Sea</i> gives the following details: &quot;It is said that the goddess Thetis raised this island from the sea, for her son Achilles, who dwells there. Here is his temple and his statue, an archaic work. This island is not inhabited, and goats graze on it, not many, which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships, sacrifice to Achilles. In this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts, craters, rings and precious stones, offered to Achilles in gratitude. One can still read inscriptions in Greek and Latin, in which Achilles is praised and celebrated. Some of these are worded in Patroclus&rsquo; honor, because those who wish to be favored by Achilles, honor Patroclus at the same time. There are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds, which look after Achilles&rsquo; temple. Every morning they fly out to sea, wet their wings with water, and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it. And after they finish the sprinkling, they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings. Other people say still more, that some of the men who reach this island, come here intentionally. They bring animals in their ships, destined to be sacrificed. Some of these animals they slaughter, others they set free on the island, in Achilles&rsquo; honour. But there are others, who are forced to come to this island by sea storms. As they have no sacrificial animals, but wish to get them from the god of the island himself, they consult Achilles&rsquo; oracle. They ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island, and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair. But in case the oracle denies them permission, because there is an oracle here, they add something to the price offered, and if the oracle refuses again, they add something more, until at last, the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient. And then the victim doesn&rsquo;t run away any more, but waits willingly to be caught. So, there is a great quantity of silver there, consecrated to the hero, as price for the sacrificial victims. To some of the people who come to this island, Achilles appears in dreams, to others he would appear even during their navigation, if they were not too far away, and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships&rdquo;. (quoted in Densu&#x15F;ianu)<p>The <!--del_lnk--> heroic cult of Achilles on Leuce island was widespread in Antiquity, not only along the sealanes of the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Sea.htm" title="Black Sea">Pontic Sea</a> but also in maritime cities whose economic interests were tightly connected to the riches of the Black Sea.<p>Achilles from Leuce island was venerated as <i>Pontarches</i> the lord and master of the Pontic (Black) Sea, the protector of sailors and navigation. Sailors went out of their way to offer sacrifice. To Achilles of Leuce were dedicated a number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters: Achilleion in Messenia (<!--del_lnk--> Stephanus Byzantinus), Achilleios in Laconia (<!--del_lnk--> Pausanias, III.25,4) <!--del_lnk--> Nicolae Densu&#x15F;ianu (Densu&#x15F;ianu 1913) even thought he recognized Achilles in the name of <!--del_lnk--> Aquileia and in the north arm of the Danube delta, the arm of Chilia (&quot;Achileii&quot;), though his conclusion, that Leuce had sovereign rights over Pontos, evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law.&quot;<p>Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing. Pausanias (III.19,13) reports that the <!--del_lnk--> Delphic Pythia sent a lord of Croton to be cured of a chest wound. <!--del_lnk--> Ammianus Marcellinus (XXII.8) attributes the healing to waters (<i>aquae</i>) on the island.<p><a id="The_cult_of_Achilles_in_modern_times:_The_Achilleion_in_Corfu" name="The_cult_of_Achilles_in_modern_times:_The_Achilleion_in_Corfu"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The cult of Achilles in modern times: The Achilleion in Corfu</span></h3>
      <p>In the region of Gastouri (&Gamma;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&#x3CD;&rho;&iota;) to the south of the city of <!--del_lnk--> Corfu <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greece</a>, Empress of Austria <!--del_lnk--> Elisabeth of Bavaria also known as Sissi built in 1890 a summer palace with Achilles as its central theme and it is a monument to <!--del_lnk--> platonic <a href="../../wp/r/Romanticism.htm" title="Romanticism">romanticism</a>. The palace, naturally, was named after Achilles: <i><!--del_lnk--> Achilleion</i> (&Alpha;&chi;&#x3AF;&lambda;&lambda;&epsilon;&iota;&omicron;&nu;). This elegant structure abounds with paintings and statues of Achilles both in the main hall and in the lavish gardens depicting the heroic and tragic scenes of the <!--del_lnk--> Trojan war.<p><a id="The_name_of_Achilles" name="The_name_of_Achilles"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The name of Achilles</span></h2>
      <p>Achilles&#39; name can be analyzed as a combination of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#x1F04;&chi;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> (<i>akhos</i>) &quot;grief&quot; and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&lambda;&alpha;&#x3CC;&sigmaf;</span> (<i>Laos</i>) &quot;a people, tribe, nation, etc.&quot; In other words, Achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people, grief being a theme raised numerous times in the <i>Iliad</i> (frequently by Achilles). Achilles&#39; role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of Achilles as the hero of <i>kleos</i> (glory, usually glory in war).<p><i>Laos</i> has been construed by <!--del_lnk--> Gregory Nagy, following Leonard Palmer, to mean <i>a corps of soldiers</i>. With this derivation, the name would have a double meaning in the poem: When the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring grief to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.<p>Centuries after Homer, his name was turned into the female form of <!--del_lnk--> Achillia, attested on <!--del_lnk--> a relief from Halicarnassus as the name of a female gladiator fighting &#39;Amazonia&#39;. Roman gladiatorial games often referenced classical mythology and this seems to reference Achilles&#39; fight with Penthesilea, but give it an extra twist of Achilles being &#39;played&#39; by a man.<p><a id="Other_stories_about_Achilles" name="Other_stories_about_Achilles"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Other stories about Achilles</span></h2>

      <p>Some post-Homeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war, Thetis (or, in some versions, Peleus) hides the young man at the court of <!--del_lnk--> Lycomedes, king of <!--del_lnk--> Skyros. There, Achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among Lycomedes&#39; daughters, perhaps under the name &quot;Pyrrha&quot; (the red-haired girl). With Lycomedes&#39; daughter <!--del_lnk--> Deidamia, whom in the account of <!--del_lnk--> Statius he rapes, Achilles there fathers a son, <!--del_lnk--> Neoptolemus (also called Pyrrhus, after his father&#39;s possible alias). According to this story, Odysseus learns from the prophet <!--del_lnk--> Calchas that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles&#39; aid. Odysseus goes to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women&#39;s clothes and jewelry and places a shield and spear among his goods. When Achilles instantly takes up the spear, Odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the Greek campaign. In another version of the story, Odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes&#39; women; while the women flee in panic, Achilles prepares to defend the court, thus giving his identity away.<p>In Homer&#39;s <i><a href="../../wp/o/Odyssey.htm" title="Odyssey">Odyssey</a></i>, there is a passage in which Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades. One of these is Achilles, who when greeted as &quot;blessed in life, blessed in death&quot;, responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead. This has been interpreted as a rejection of his warrior life, but also as indignity to his martyrdom being slighted.

By the fifth and fourth centuries, the deep &mdash; and arguably ambiguous &mdash; friendship portrayed in Homer blossomed into an unequivocal erotic love affair in the works of <!--del_lnk--> Aeschylus, <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Aeschines, and seems to have inspired the enigmatic verses in <!--del_lnk--> Lycophron&#39;s third century <i>Alexandra</i> that claim Achilles slew Troilus in a matter of unrequited love.<p>The kings of the <!--del_lnk--> Epirus claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son. <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>, son of the Epiran princess <!--del_lnk--> Olympias, could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor; he is said to have visited his tomb while passing Troy.<p>Achilles fought and killed the <!--del_lnk--> Amazon <!--del_lnk--> Helene. Some also said he married <!--del_lnk--> Medea, and that after both their deaths they were united in the Elysian Fields of Hades &mdash; as Hera promised Thetis in Apollonius&#39; <!--del_lnk--> Argonautica.

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Greek tragedian <!--del_lnk--> Aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles, given the title <i>Achilleis</i> by modern scholars.

Extant fragments of <i>Myrmidons</i> and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play.<p>Another lost play by Aeschylus, <i>The Myrmidons</i>, focused on the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus; only a few lines survive today.<p>The tragedian <!--del_lnk--> Sophocles also wrote a play with Achilles as the main character, <i>The Lovers of Achilles</i>.
