      <p>The name Australia is derived from the <!--del_lnk--> Latin <i>Australis</i>, meaning <i>of the South</i>. Legends of an &quot;unknown land of the south&quot; (<i><!--del_lnk--> terra australis incognita</i>) dating back to Roman times were commonplace in mediaeval geography, but they were not based on any actual knowledge of the continent. The Dutch adjectival form <i>Australische</i> was used by Dutch officials in <a href="../../wp/j/Jakarta.htm" title="Jakarta">Batavia</a> to refer to the newly discovered land to the south as early as 1638. The first use of the word &quot;Australia&quot; in the English language was a 1693 translation of <i>Les Aventures de Jacques Sadeur dans la D&eacute;couverte et le Voyage de la Terre Australe</i>, a 1692 French novel by <!--del_lnk--> Gabriel de Foigny under the pen name Jacques Sadeur. <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Dalrymple then used it in <i>An Historical Collection of Voyages and Discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean</i> (1771), to refer to the entire South Pacific region. In 1793, <!--del_lnk--> George Shaw and <!--del_lnk--> Sir James Smith published <i>Zoology and Botany of New Holland</i>, in which they wrote of &quot;the vast island, or rather continent, of Australia, Australasia or <!--del_lnk--> New Holland.&quot;<p>The name &quot;Australia&quot; was popularised by the 1814 work <i>A Voyage to Terra Australis</i> by the navigator <!--del_lnk--> Matthew Flinders, who was the first recorded person to circumnavigate Australia. Despite its title, which reflected the view of the <!--del_lnk--> British Admiralty, Flinders used the word &quot;Australia&quot; in the book, which was widely read and gave the term general currency. Governor <!--del_lnk--> Lachlan Macquarie of <!--del_lnk--> New South Wales subsequently used the word in his dispatches to <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>. In 1817, he recommended that it be officially adopted. In 1824, the Admiralty agreed that the continent should be known officially as Australia.<p>The word &quot;Australia&quot; in <a href="../../wp/a/Australian_English.htm" title="Australian English">Australian English</a> is <!--del_lnk--> pronounced as <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/&#x259;.&#x2C8;st&#x279;&aelig;&#x26A;.lj&#x259;/</span>, <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/&#x259;.&#x2C8;st&#x279;&aelig;&#x26A;.li&#x2D0;.&#x259;/</span> or <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/&#x259;.&#x2C8;st&#x279;&aelig;&#x26A;.j&#x259;/</span>.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>The first human habitation of Australia is estimated to have occurred between 42,000 and 48,000 years ago. The first Australians were the ancestors of the current Indigenous Australians; they arrived via <!--del_lnk--> land bridges and short sea-crossings from present-day <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asia. Most of these people were <!--del_lnk--> hunter-gatherers, with a complex <!--del_lnk--> oral culture and spiritual values based on reverence for the land and a belief in the <!--del_lnk--> Dreamtime. The <!--del_lnk--> Torres Strait Islanders, ethnically <!--del_lnk--> Melanesian, inhabited the <!--del_lnk--> Torres Strait Islands and parts of far-north <!--del_lnk--> Queensland; their cultural practices are distinct from those of the Aborigines.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The first undisputed recorded European sighting of the Australian mainland was made by the Dutch navigator <!--del_lnk--> Willem Janszoon, who sighted the coast of <!--del_lnk--> Cape York Peninsula in 1606. During the 17th century, the Dutch charted the whole of the western and northern coastlines of what they called <!--del_lnk--> New Holland, but made no attempt at settlement. In 1770, <a href="../../wp/j/James_Cook.htm" title="James Cook">James Cook</a> sailed along and mapped the east coast of Australia, which he named <!--del_lnk--> New South Wales and claimed for Britain. The expedition&#39;s discoveries provided impetus for the establishment of a <!--del_lnk--> penal colony there.<p>The British <!--del_lnk--> Crown Colony of New South Wales started with the establishment of a settlement at <!--del_lnk--> Port Jackson by Captain <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Phillip on <!--del_lnk--> 26 January <!--del_lnk--> 1788. This date was later to become Australia&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> national day, <!--del_lnk--> Australia Day. <!--del_lnk--> Van Diemen&#39;s Land, now known as <!--del_lnk--> Tasmania, was settled in 1803 and became a separate colony in 1825. The United Kingdom formally claimed the western part of Australia in 1829. Separate colonies were created from parts of New South Wales: <!--del_lnk--> South Australia in 1836, <!--del_lnk--> Victoria in 1851, and <!--del_lnk--> Queensland in 1859. The <!--del_lnk--> Northern Territory (NT) was founded in 1863 as part of the Province of South Australia. South Australia was founded as a &quot;free province&quot; &mdash; that is, it was never a penal colony. Victoria and Western Australia were also founded &quot;free&quot;, but later accepted transported convicts. The transportation of convicts to Australia was phased out between 1840 and 1864.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The Indigenous Australian population, estimated at about 350,000 at the time of European settlement, declined steeply for 150 years following settlement, mainly because of <!--del_lnk--> infectious disease combined with forced re-settlement and cultural disintegration. The <!--del_lnk--> removal of children, that some historians and Indigenous Australians have argued could be considered to constitute <!--del_lnk--> genocide by some definitions, may have made a contribution to the decline in the indigenous population. Such interpretations of Aboriginal history are disputed by some as being exaggerated or fabricated for political or ideological reasons. This debate is known within Australia as the <!--del_lnk--> History Wars. Following the <!--del_lnk--> 1967 referendum, the Federal government gained the power to implement policies and make laws with respect to Aborigines.

      <p>A <!--del_lnk--> gold rush began in Australia in the early 1850s, and the <!--del_lnk--> Eureka Stockade rebellion against mining licence fees in 1854 was an early expression of civil disobedience. Between 1855 and 1890, the six colonies individually gained <!--del_lnk--> responsible government, managing most of their own affairs while remaining part of the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>. The Colonial Office in London retained control of some matters, notably foreign affairs, defence and international shipping. On <!--del_lnk--> 1 January <!--del_lnk--> 1901, <!--del_lnk--> federation of the colonies was achieved after a decade of planning, consultation and voting, and the Commonwealth of Australia was born, as a <!--del_lnk--> Dominion of the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>. The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) was formed from New South Wales in 1911 to provide a location for the proposed new federal capital of Canberra (Melbourne was the capital from 1901 to 1927). The Northern Territory was transferred from the control of the South Australian government to the Commonwealth in 1911. Australia willingly participated in World War I; many Australians regard the defeat of the <!--del_lnk--> Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZACs) at <!--del_lnk--> Gallipoli as the birth of the nation &mdash; its first major military action. Much like Gallipoli, the <!--del_lnk--> Kokoda Track Campaign is regarded by many as a nation-defining battle from <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Statute of Westminster 1931 formally ended most of the constitutional links between Australia and the United Kingdom when Australia <!--del_lnk--> adopted it in 1942. The shock of the United Kingdom&#39;s defeat in Asia in 1942 and the threat of Japanese invasion caused Australia to turn to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> as a new ally and protector. Since 1951, Australia has been a formal military ally of the US under the auspices of the <!--del_lnk--> ANZUS treaty. After World War II, Australia encouraged mass immigration from Europe; since the 1970s and the abolition of the <!--del_lnk--> White Australia policy, immigration from Asia and other parts of the world was also encouraged. As a result, Australia&#39;s demography, culture and image of itself were radically transformed. Final constitutional ties between Australia and the United Kingdom were severed in 1986 with the passing of the <!--del_lnk--> Australia Act 1986, ending any British role in the Australian States, and ending judicial appeals to the UK <!--del_lnk--> Privy Council Australian voters rejected a move to become a republic in 1999 by a 55% majority. Since the election of the <!--del_lnk--> Whitlam Government in 1972, there has been an increasing focus on the nation&#39;s future as a part of the <!--del_lnk--> Asia-Pacific region.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>

      <p>The Commonwealth of Australia is a <a href="../../wp/c/Constitutional_monarchy.htm" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a> with a <a href="../../wp/p/Parliamentary_system.htm" title="Parliamentary system">parliamentary system</a> of government. <a href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a> is the <!--del_lnk--> Queen of Australia, a role that is distinct from her position as monarch of the other <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth Realms. The Queen is nominally represented by the <!--del_lnk--> Governor-General at Federal level and by the Governors at State level. Although the <!--del_lnk--> Constitution gives extensive <!--del_lnk--> executive powers to the Governor-General, these are normally exercised only on the advice of the <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister. The most notable exercise of the Governor-General&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> reserve powers outside the Prime Minister&#39;s direction was the dismissal of the Whitlam Government in the <!--del_lnk--> constitutional crisis of 1975.<p>There are <!--del_lnk--> three branches of government:<ul>
       <li>The legislature: the <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth Parliament, comprising the Queen, the Senate, and the House of Representatives; the Queen is represented by the Governor-General, who in practice exercises constitutional power only on the advice of the Prime Minister.<li>The executive: the <!--del_lnk--> Federal Executive Council (the Governor-General as advised by the Executive Councillors); in practice, the councillors are the Prime Minister and Ministers of State.<li>The judiciary: the <!--del_lnk--> High Court of Australia and other <!--del_lnk--> federal courts. The State courts became formally independent from the <!--del_lnk--> Judicial Committee of the Privy Council when the <i><!--del_lnk--> Australia Act</i> was passed in 1986.</ul>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> bicameral Commonwealth Parliament consists of the Queen, the <!--del_lnk--> Senate (the upper house) of 76 senators, and a <!--del_lnk--> House of Representatives (the lower house) of 150 members. Members of the lower house are elected from single-member constituencies, commonly known as &#39;electorates&#39; or &#39;seats&#39;. Seats in the House of Representatives are allocated to states on the basis of population. In the Senate, each state, regardless of population, is represented by 12 senators, while the territories (the ACT and the NT) are each represented by two. Elections for both chambers are held every three years; typically only half of the Senate seats are put to each election, because senators have overlapping six-year terms. The party with majority support in the House of Representatives forms Government, with its leader becoming Prime Minister.<p>There are three major political parties: the <!--del_lnk--> Labor Party, the <!--del_lnk--> Liberal Party and the <!--del_lnk--> National Party. Independent members and several minor parties &mdash; including the <!--del_lnk--> Greens and the <!--del_lnk--> Australian Democrats &mdash; have achieved representation in Australian parliaments, mostly in upper houses, although their influence has been marginal. Since the <!--del_lnk--> 1996 election, the <!--del_lnk--> Liberal/National Coalition led by the Prime Minister, <a href="../../wp/j/John_Howard.htm" title="John Howard">John Howard</a>, has been in power in Canberra. In the <!--del_lnk--> 2004 election, the Coalition won control of the Senate, the first time that a party (or coalition of governing parties) has done so while in government in more than 20 years. The Labor Party is in power in every state and territory. <!--del_lnk--> Voting is compulsory for all enrolled citizens 18 years and over in each state and territory and at the federal level.<p><a id="States_and_territories" name="States_and_territories"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">States and territories</span></h2>

      <p>Australia consists of six states, two major mainland territories, and other minor territories. The states are <!--del_lnk--> New South Wales, <!--del_lnk--> Queensland, <!--del_lnk--> South Australia, <!--del_lnk--> Tasmania, <!--del_lnk--> Victoria and <!--del_lnk--> Western Australia. The two major mainland territories are the <!--del_lnk--> Northern Territory and the <!--del_lnk--> Australian Capital Territory. In most respects, the territories function similarly to the states, but the Commonwealth Parliament can override any legislation of their parliaments. By contrast, federal legislation overrides state legislation only with respect to certain areas as set out in <!--del_lnk--> Section 51 of the <!--del_lnk--> Constitution; all residual legislative powers are retained by the state parliaments, including powers over hospitals, education, police, the judiciary, roads, public transport and local government.<p>Each state and territory has its own <!--del_lnk--> legislature (<!--del_lnk--> unicameral in the case of the Northern Territory, the ACT and Queensland, and bicameral in the remaining states). The <!--del_lnk--> lower house is known as the <!--del_lnk--> Legislative Assembly (<!--del_lnk--> House of Assembly in South Australia and Tasmania) and the <!--del_lnk--> upper house is known as the <!--del_lnk--> Legislative Council. The <!--del_lnk--> heads of the governments in each state and territory are called <!--del_lnk--> premiers and <!--del_lnk--> chief ministers, respectively. The Queen is represented in each state by a <!--del_lnk--> governor; an <!--del_lnk--> administrator in the Northern Territory, and the Governor-General in the ACT, have analogous roles.<p>Australia also has several minor territories; the federal government administers a separate area within New South Wales, the <!--del_lnk--> Jervis Bay Territory, as a naval base and sea port for the national capital. In addition Australia has the following, inhabited, external territories: <a href="../../wp/n/Norfolk_Island.htm" title="Norfolk Island">Norfolk Island</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Christmas_Island.htm" title="Christmas Island">Christmas Island</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Cocos_%2528Keeling%2529_Islands.htm" title="Cocos (Keeling) Islands">Cocos (Keeling) Islands</a>, and several largely uninhabited external territories: <!--del_lnk--> Ashmore and Cartier Islands, <!--del_lnk--> Coral Sea Islands, <a href="../../wp/h/Heard_Island_and_McDonald_Islands.htm" title="Heard Island and McDonald Islands">Heard Island and McDonald Islands</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Australian Antarctic Territory.<p><a id="Foreign_relations_and_the_military" name="Foreign_relations_and_the_military"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Foreign relations and the military</span></h2>

      <p>Over recent decades, <!--del_lnk--> Australia&#39;s foreign relations have been driven by a close association with the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, through the <!--del_lnk--> ANZUS pact and by a desire to develop relationships with <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a> and the Pacific, particularly through <!--del_lnk--> ASEAN and the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Islands Forum. In 2005 Australia secured an inaugural seat at the <!--del_lnk--> East Asia Summit following its accession to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. Australia is a member of the <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth of Nations, in which the <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth Heads of Government meetings provide the main forum for co-operation. Much of Australia&#39;s diplomatic energy is focused on international trade liberalisation. Australia led the formation of the <!--del_lnk--> Cairns Group and <!--del_lnk--> APEC, and is a member of the <!--del_lnk--> OECD and the <!--del_lnk--> WTO. Australia has pursued several major bilateral free trade agreements, most recently the <!--del_lnk--> Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement. Australia is a founding member of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>, and maintains an international aid programme under which some 60 countries receive assistance. The 2005 &ndash; 06 budget provides A$2.5&nbsp;bn for development assistance; as a percentage of GDP, this contribution is less than that of the UN <!--del_lnk--> Millennium Development Goals.<p>Australia&#39;s armed forces &mdash; the <!--del_lnk--> Australian Defence Force (ADF) &mdash; comprise the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Australian Navy (RAN), the <!--del_lnk--> Australian Army, and the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), numbering about 51,000 . All branches of the ADF have been involved in UN and regional peacekeeping (most recently in East Timor, the Solomon Islands and <a href="../../wp/s/Sudan.htm" title="Sudan">Sudan</a>), disaster relief, and armed conflict, including the <!--del_lnk--> 2003 Invasion of Iraq. The government appoints the chief of the Defence Force from one of the armed services; the current chief is Air Chief Marshal <!--del_lnk--> Angus Houston. In the 2006-07 Budget, defence spending is $19.6 billion.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

Australia has a total 25,760&nbsp;kilometres (16,007&nbsp;mi) of coastline and claims an extensive <!--del_lnk--> Exclusive Economic Zone of 8,148,250&nbsp;square kilometres (3,146,057&nbsp;sq.&nbsp;mi). This exclusive economic zone does not include the <!--del_lnk--> Australian Antarctic Territory.<p>The <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Barrier_Reef.htm" title="Great Barrier Reef">Great Barrier Reef</a>, the world&#39;s largest <!--del_lnk--> coral reef, lies a short distance off the north-east coast and extends for over 2,000&nbsp;kilometres (1,250&nbsp;mi). The world&#39;s largest <!--del_lnk--> monolith, <!--del_lnk--> Mount Augustus, is located in Western Australia. At 2,228&nbsp;metres (7,310&nbsp;ft), <!--del_lnk--> Mount Kosciuszko on the <!--del_lnk--> Great Dividing Range is the highest mountain on the Australian mainland, although <!--del_lnk--> Mawson Peak on the remote Australian territory of <a href="../../wp/h/Heard_Island_and_McDonald_Islands.htm" title="Heard Island and McDonald Islands">Heard Island</a> is taller at 2,745&nbsp;metres (9,006&nbsp;ft).<p>By far the largest part of Australia is <!--del_lnk--> desert or <!--del_lnk--> semi-arid. Australia is the driest inhabited continent, the flattest, and has the oldest and least fertile soils. Only the south-east and south-west corners of the continent have a temperate climate.

Because of the great age and consequent low levels of fertility of the continent, its extremely variable weather patterns, and its long-term geographic isolation, much of Australia&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> biota is unique and <a href="../../wp/b/Biodiversity.htm" title="Biodiversity">diverse</a>. About 85% of <!--del_lnk--> flowering plants, 84% of <a href="../../wp/m/Mammal.htm" title="Mammal">mammals</a>, more than 45% of <!--del_lnk--> birds, and 89% of in-shore, temperate-zone fish are <!--del_lnk--> endemic. Many of Australia&#39;s ecoregions, and the species within those regions, are threatened by human activities and <!--del_lnk--> introduced plant and animal species. The federal <i>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</i> is a legal framework used for the protection of threatened species. Numerous <!--del_lnk--> protected areas have been created under the country&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Biodiversity Action Plan to protect and preserve Australia&#39;s unique ecosystems, 64 wetlands are registered under the <!--del_lnk--> Ramsar Convention, and 16 <a href="../../wp/w/World_Heritage_Site.htm" title="World Heritage Site">World Heritage Sites</a> have been established. Australia was ranked thirteenth in the World on the 2005 <!--del_lnk--> Environmental Sustainability Index.<p>Most Australian woody plant species are evergreen and many are adapted to fire and drought, including many <!--del_lnk--> eucalyptus and <!--del_lnk--> acacias. Australia has a rich variety of endemic <!--del_lnk--> legume species that thrive in nutrient-poor soils because of their symbiosis with <!--del_lnk--> Rhizobia bacteria and <!--del_lnk--> mycorrhizal fungi. Well-known Australian fauna include <!--del_lnk--> monotremes (the <a href="../../wp/p/Platypus.htm" title="Platypus">platypus</a> and <!--del_lnk--> echidna); a host of <!--del_lnk--> marsupials, including the <a href="../../wp/k/Kangaroo.htm" title="Kangaroo">kangaroo</a>, <!--del_lnk--> koala, <a href="../../wp/w/Wombat.htm" title="Wombat">wombat</a>; and birds such as the <a href="../../wp/e/Emu.htm" title="Emu">emu</a>, and <a href="../../wp/k/Kookaburra.htm" title="Kookaburra">kookaburra</a>. The <a href="../../wp/d/Dingo.htm" title="Dingo">dingo</a> was introduced by Austronesian people that traded with Indigenous Australians around 4000 <!--del_lnk--> BCE. Many plant and animal species became extinct soon after human settlement, including the <!--del_lnk--> Australian megafauna; others have become extinct since European settlement, among them the <!--del_lnk--> Thylacine.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>

      <p>Australia has a prosperous, Western-style <!--del_lnk--> mixed economy, with a per capita <!--del_lnk--> GDP slightly higher than the UK, <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> in terms of <!--del_lnk--> purchasing power parity. The country was ranked third in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>&#39; 2005 <!--del_lnk--> Human Development Index and sixth in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Economist</i> worldwide quality-of-life index 2005. In recent years, the Australian economy has been resilient in the face of global economic downturn. Rising output in the domestic economy has been offsetting the global slump, and business and consumer confidence remains robust. Current areas of concern to some economists include Australia&#39;s high <!--del_lnk--> current account deficit and also the high levels of net foreign debt owed by the private sector.<p>In the 1980s, the <!--del_lnk--> Hawke Government started the process of economic reform by <!--del_lnk--> floating the <!--del_lnk--> Australian dollar in 1983, and deregulating the financial system. Since 1996, the Howard government has continued the process of micro-economic reform, including <a href="../../wp/w/WorkChoices.htm" title="WorkChoices">partial deregulation of the labour market</a> and the privatisation of state-owned businesses, most notably in the <!--del_lnk--> telecommunications industry. Substantial reform of the indirect tax system was implemented in July 2000 with the introduction of a 10% <!--del_lnk--> Goods and Services Tax, which has slightly reduced the heavy reliance on personal and company income tax that still characterises Australia&#39;s tax system.<p>The Australian economy has not suffered a <!--del_lnk--> recession since the early 1990s. As of July 2006, unemployment was 4.8% with 10,223,300 persons employed. The service sector of the economy, including tourism, education, and financial services, comprises 69% of GDP. <!--del_lnk--> Agriculture and natural resources comprise 3% and 5% of GDP but contribute substantially to Australia&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> export performance. Australia&#39;s largest export markets include <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">China</a>, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/South_Korea.htm" title="South Korea">South Korea</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>.<p>Traditionally, the absence of an export oriented manufacturing industry has been considered a key weakness of the Australian economy. More recently, rising prices for Australia&#39;s commodity exports and increasing tourism has to some extent alleviated this criticism. Nevertheless, Australia has developed the world&#39;s third largest current account deficit in absolute terms (in relative terms over 7% of GDP). This has been considered problematic by some economists, especially as it has coincided with high prices for Australia&#39;s exports and low interest rates which keeps the cost of servicing the foreign debt unusually low.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

Australia&#39;s population has quadrupled since the end of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, spurred by an ambitious <!--del_lnk--> immigration program.

Indigenous Australians have higher rates of imprisonment and unemployment, lower levels of education and life expectancies for males and females that are 17 years lower than those of other Australians.

      <p>In common with many other developed countries, Australia is experiencing a demographic shift towards an older population, with more retirees and fewer people of working age. A large number of Australians (759,849 for the period 2002&ndash;03) live outside their home country. Australia has maintained one of the most active <!--del_lnk--> immigration programmes in the world to boost population growth. Most immigrants are skilled, but the immigration quota includes categories for family members and <!--del_lnk--> refugees.<p><a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> is the <!--del_lnk--> official language, and is spoken and written in a distinct variety known as <a href="../../wp/a/Australian_English.htm" title="Australian English">Australian English</a>. According to the 2001 census, <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> is the only language spoken in the home for around 80% of the population. The next most common languages spoken at home are <a href="../../wp/c/Chinese_language.htm" title="Chinese language">Chinese languages</a> (2.1%), <!--del_lnk--> Italian (1.9%) and <!--del_lnk--> Greek (1.4%). A considerable proportion of first- and second-generation migrants are <!--del_lnk--> bilingual. It is believed that there were between 200 and 300 <!--del_lnk--> Australian Aboriginal languages at the time of first European contact. Only about 70 of these languages have survived, and all but 20 of these are now <!--del_lnk--> endangered. An indigenous language remains the main language for about 50,000 (0.25%) people. Australia has a <!--del_lnk--> sign language known as <!--del_lnk--> Auslan, which is the main language of about 6,500 <!--del_lnk--> deaf people.<p>Australia has no <!--del_lnk--> state religion. The 2001 census identified that 68% of Australians call themselves Christian: 27% identifying themselves as <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic and 21% as <a href="../../wp/a/Anglican_Communion.htm" title="Anglican Communion">Anglican</a>. Australians who identify themselves as followers of non-Christian religions number 5%. A total of 16% were categorised as having &quot;No Religion&quot; (which includes non-theistic beliefs such as <!--del_lnk--> humanism, <a href="../../wp/a/Atheism.htm" title="Atheism">atheism</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Agnosticism.htm" title="Agnosticism">agnosticism</a> and <!--del_lnk--> rationalism) and a further 12% declined to answer or did not give a response adequate for interpretation. As in many Western countries, the level of active participation in church worship is much lower than this; weekly attendance at church services is about 1.5 million, about 7.5% of the population.<p>School attendance is compulsory throughout Australia between the ages of 6&ndash;15 years (16 years in <!--del_lnk--> South Australia and <!--del_lnk--> Tasmania, and 17 years in <!--del_lnk--> Western Australia), contributing to an adult literacy rate that is assumed to be 99%. Government grants have supported the establishment of Australia&#39;s 38 universities, and although several private universities have been established, the majority receive government funding. There is a state-based system of vocational training colleges, known as <!--del_lnk--> TAFE Institutes, and many trades conduct <!--del_lnk--> apprenticeships for training new tradespeople. Approximately 58% of Australians between the ages of 25 and 64 have vocational or tertiary qualifications and the tertiary graduation rate of 49% is highest of OECD countries. The ratio of international to local students in tertiary education in Australia is the highest in OECD countries.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

      <p>The primary basis of Australian culture until the mid-20th century was <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Celtic, although distinctive Australian features had been evolving from the environment and <!--del_lnk--> indigenous culture. Over the past 50 years, Australian culture has been strongly influenced by American popular culture (particularly television and cinema), large-scale immigration from non-English-speaking countries, and Australia&#39;s Asian neighbours. The vigour and originality of the arts in Australia &mdash; films, opera, music, painting, theatre, dance, and crafts &mdash; achieve international recognition.<p>Australia has a long history of visual arts, starting with the <!--del_lnk--> cave and bark paintings of its indigenous peoples. From the time of European settlement, a common theme in <!--del_lnk--> Australian art has been the Australian landscape, seen in the works of <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Streeton, <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Boyd and <!--del_lnk--> Albert Namatjira, among others. The traditions of indigenous Australians are largely transmitted orally and are closely tied to ceremony and the telling of the stories of the <!--del_lnk--> Dreamtime. <!--del_lnk--> Australian Aboriginal music, dance and <!--del_lnk--> art have a palpable influence on contemporary Australian visual and performing arts. Australia has an active tradition of <a href="../../wp/m/Music.htm" title="Music">music</a>, <!--del_lnk--> ballet and <a href="../../wp/t/Theatre.htm" title="Theatre">theatre</a>; many of its performing arts companies receive public funding through the federal government&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Australia Council. There is a <!--del_lnk--> symphony orchestra in each capital city, and a national <a href="../../wp/o/Opera.htm" title="Opera">opera</a> company, <!--del_lnk--> Opera Australia, first made prominent by the renowned diva <!--del_lnk--> Dame Joan Sutherland; <!--del_lnk--> Australian music includes classical, jazz, and many popular music genres.<p><!--del_lnk--> Australian literature has also been influenced by the landscape; the works of writers such as <!--del_lnk--> Banjo Paterson and <!--del_lnk--> Henry Lawson, captured the experience of the Australian bush. The character of colonial Australia, as embodied in early literature, resonates with modern Australia and its perceived emphasis on <!--del_lnk--> egalitarianism, mateship, and anti-authoritarianism. In 1973, <!--del_lnk--> Patrick White was awarded the <!--del_lnk--> Nobel Prize in Literature, the only Australian to have achieved this; he is recognised as one of the great English-language writers of the twentieth century. <a href="../../wp/a/Australian_English.htm" title="Australian English">Australian English</a> is a major variety of the language; its grammar and spelling are largely based on those of British English, overlaid with a rich vernacular of unique lexical items and phrases, some of which have found their way into standard English.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Australia has two public broadcasters (the <!--del_lnk--> ABC and the multi-cultural <!--del_lnk--> SBS), three commercial <!--del_lnk--> television networks, several pay TV services, and numerous public, non-profit television and radio stations. <!--del_lnk--> Australia&#39;s film industry has achieved critical and commercial successes. Each major city has daily newspapers, and there are two national daily newspapers, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Australian</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Australian Financial Review</i>. According to <!--del_lnk--> Reporters Without Borders in 2006, Australia was in thirty fifth position on a list of countries ranked by <!--del_lnk--> press freedom, behind <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> (19th) and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> (27th) but ahead of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. This ranking is primarily because of the limited diversity of commercial media ownership in Australia. Most Australian <a href="../../wp/p/Publishing.htm" title="Publishing">print media</a> in particular is under the control of either <!--del_lnk--> News Corporation or <!--del_lnk--> John Fairfax Holdings.<p><a href="../../wp/s/Sport.htm" title="Sport">Sport</a> plays an important part in Australian culture, assisted by a climate that favours outdoor activities; 23.5% Australians over the age of 15 regularly participate in organised sporting activities. At an international level, Australia has particularly strong teams in <a href="../../wp/c/Cricket.htm" title="Cricket">cricket</a>, <!--del_lnk--> hockey, <a href="../../wp/n/Netball.htm" title="Netball">netball</a>, <!--del_lnk--> rugby league, <!--del_lnk--> rugby union, and performs well in <!--del_lnk--> cycling, <!--del_lnk--> rowing and <!--del_lnk--> swimming. Nationally, other popular sports include <a href="../../wp/a/Australian_rules_football.htm" title="Australian rules football">Australian rules football</a>, <!--del_lnk--> horse racing, <a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Football (soccer)">soccer</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Auto_racing.htm" title="Auto racing">motor racing</a>. Australia has participated in every summer <a href="../../wp/o/Olympic_Games.htm" title="Olympic Games">Olympic Games</a> of the modern era, and every <a href="../../wp/c/Commonwealth_Games.htm" title="Commonwealth Games">Commonwealth Games</a>. Australia has hosted the <!--del_lnk--> 1956 and <!--del_lnk--> 2000 Summer Olympics, and has ranked among the top five medal-takers since 2000. Australia has also hosted the <!--del_lnk--> 1938, <!--del_lnk--> 1962, <!--del_lnk--> 1982 and <!--del_lnk--> 2006 Commonwealth Games. Other major international events held regularly in Australia include the <a href="../../wp/a/Australian_Open.htm" title="Australian Open">Australian Open</a>, one of the four <a href="../../wp/g/Grand_Slam_%2528tennis%2529.htm" title="Grand Slam (tennis)">Grand Slam</a> tennis tournaments, annual international cricket matches and the Formula One <!--del_lnk--> Australian Grand Prix. Corporate and government sponsorship of many sports and elite athletes is common in Australia.
