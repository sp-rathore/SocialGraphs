      <p><b>Albrecht Rodenbach</b> (* <!--del_lnk--> 27 October <!--del_lnk--> 1856 in <!--del_lnk--> Roeselare, <a href="../../wp/b/Belgium.htm" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>; &dagger; <!--del_lnk--> 23 June <!--del_lnk--> 1880 in <!--del_lnk--> Roeselare) was a <a href="../../wp/f/Flemish_%2528linguistics%2529.htm" title="Flemish (linguistics)">Flemish</a> poet, and a leader in the <!--del_lnk--> revival of Flemish literature that occurred in the late 19th Century.<p>Rodenbach was born into a bourgeois family, the eldest of 10 children and cousin to the novelist <!--del_lnk--> Georges Rodenbach. Albrecht Rodenbach&rsquo;s father was Julius Rodenbach (1824-1915) from the Rhineland, and his mother was Silvia de la Houttre (1834-1899). Although his mother was a <!--del_lnk--> Walloon from <!--del_lnk--> Doornik, she had adopted the Dutch spoken in Roeselare.<p>Rodenbach attended the small catholic seminary in <!--del_lnk--> Roeselare where he was exposed to the ideas of the <!--del_lnk--> Flemish movement by <!--del_lnk--> Hugo Verriest and others. Rodenbach was also influenced at this time by <!--del_lnk--> Guido Gezelle. In the 1874-1875 school year, this led to a conflict between the Flemish students and the school&rsquo;s francophile director. At the annual songfest the students traditionally sang French songs, Rodenbach led the protest and the predominately Dutch speaking students sang a protest song in Dutch. This protest led to similar protests all over Belgium. Despite this and other activist activities, Rodenbach graduated with a first in rhetoric in 1876.<p>At the <!--del_lnk--> University of Leuven he met the poet Pol de Mont who was a year older. Together they sought to promote a Flemish artistic revival and equal rights for Flemish students as a student movement, creating the &ldquo;Algemene Vlaamse Studentenbond&rdquo; (All Flemish Student Association) in 1876. Among their objectives were to have classes in Dutch and to have classes include Flemish culture. The association&rsquo;s illustrated magazine <i>Het Pennoen</i> (<i>The Pennant</i>) published Rodenbach&rsquo;s essays anonymously. Rodenbach maintained his contacts in Roeselare through a committee of correspondence. Their ideology was a mixture of the philosophy <!--del_lnk--> Guido Gezelle, with the <!--del_lnk--> romantic nationalism of <!--del_lnk--> Hendrik Conscience, and the righteousness of <!--del_lnk--> true belief. Additionally Rodenbach made contacts with the Flemish liberals, poet <!--del_lnk--> Jan van Beers and author <!--del_lnk--> Max Rooses.<p>In 1876 Rodenbach published some essays under the pseudonym &ldquo;Harold&rdquo;. His book <i>Eerste Gedichten</i> (<i>First Poems</i>) was published in 1878. The rest of his work, including his verse play <i>Gudrun</i>, a dramatized epic of the Vikings, was not published until after his death.<p>Rodenbach died before his 24th birthday, and almost immediately became the pre-eminent symbol of the Flemish student movement. On Rodenbach&rsquo;s death, Pol de Mont took over the leadership of the &ldquo;Algemene Vlaamse Studentenbond&rdquo;.<p>Rodenbach was known at the time of his death for his songs, poems and tonal-works which have remained inspiring symbols for the <!--del_lnk--> Flemish movement. He was the inspiration for <!--del_lnk--> Hendrik Conscience&rsquo;s novel <i>Kerels van Vlaanderen</i>. Flandria Film made a film about him in 1930 entitled <i>Albrecht Rodenbach</i> and directed by Clemens De Landtsheer.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht_Rodenbach&quot;</div>
