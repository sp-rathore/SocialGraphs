      <p><b>Antarctica</b> is the southernmost <a href="../../wp/c/Continent.htm" title="Continent">continent</a> and includes the <!--del_lnk--> South Pole. Geographic sources disagree as to whether it is surrounded by the <a href="../../wp/s/Southern_Ocean.htm" title="Southern Ocean">Southern Ocean</a> or the South <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>, South <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, and <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Ocean.htm" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>. It is divided by the <!--del_lnk--> Transantarctic Mountains. On average, it is the coldest, driest, and windiest continent and has the highest average elevation of all the continents. At 14.425 million&nbsp;km&sup2;, Antarctica is the third-smallest continent after <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Australia; 98% of it is covered in <a href="../../wp/i/Ice.htm" title="Ice">ice</a>. Because there is little <!--del_lnk--> precipitation, except at the coasts, the interior of the continent is technically the largest <a href="../../wp/d/Desert.htm" title="Desert">desert</a> in the world. There are no permanent human residents and Antarctica has never had an indigenous population. Only cold-adapted plants and animals survive there, including <a href="../../wp/p/Penguin.htm" title="Penguin">penguins</a>, <!--del_lnk--> fur seals, <a href="../../wp/m/Moss.htm" title="Moss">mosses</a>, <!--del_lnk--> lichens, and many types of <!--del_lnk--> algae. The name &quot;Antarctica&quot; comes from the <!--del_lnk--> Greek <i>&alpha;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&kappa;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#x3CC;&sigmaf;</i> (<i>antarktikos</i>), meaning &quot;opposite the <a href="../../wp/a/Arctic.htm" title="Arctic">Arctic</a>.&quot;<p>Although myths and speculation about a <i><!--del_lnk--> Terra Australis</i> (&quot;Southern Land&quot;) date back to antiquity, the first confirmed sighting of the continent is commonly accepted to have occurred in 1820 by the <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russian</a> expedition of <!--del_lnk--> Mikhail Lazarev and <!--del_lnk--> Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen. However, the continent remained largely neglected for the rest of the 19th century because of its hostile environment, lack of resources, and isolated location.<p>The <a href="../../wp/a/Antarctic_Treaty_System.htm" title="Antarctic Treaty System">Antarctic Treaty</a> was signed in 1959 by 12 countries. The treaty prohibits military activities and mineral mining, supports scientific research, and protects the continent&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> ecozone. Ongoing experiments are conducted by more than 4,000 scientists of many nationalities and with different research interests.<p>

      <p>Belief in the existence of a <i>Terra Australis</i> &mdash; a vast continent located in the far south of the globe to &quot;balance&quot; the northern lands of Europe, Asia and north Africa &mdash; had existed since <a href="../../wp/p/Ptolemy.htm" title="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> suggested the idea in order to preserve <a href="../../wp/s/Symmetry.htm" title="Symmetry">symmetry</a> of <!--del_lnk--> landmass in the world. Depictions of a large southern landmass were common in maps such as the early 16th century Turkish <!--del_lnk--> Piri Reis map. Even in the late 17th century, after explorers had found that <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a> were not part of &quot;Antarctica,&quot; geographers believed that the continent was much larger than its actual size.<p>European maps continued to show this land until <!--del_lnk--> Captain <a href="../../wp/j/James_Cook.htm" title="James Cook">James Cook</a>&#39;s ships, <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Resolution</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Adventure</i>, crossed the <!--del_lnk--> Antarctic Circle on <!--del_lnk--> January 17, <!--del_lnk--> 1773 and again in 1774. The first confirmed sighting of Antarctica can be narrowed down to the crews of ships captained by three individuals. According to various organizations (the <!--del_lnk--> National Science Foundation, <!--del_lnk--> NASA, the <!--del_lnk--> University of California, San Diego, and other sources), ships captained by three men sighted Antarctica in 1820: <!--del_lnk--> Fabian von Bellingshausen (a captain in the Russian Imperial Navy), <!--del_lnk--> Edward Bransfield (a captain in the British Navy), and <!--del_lnk--> Nathaniel Palmer (an American sealer out of Stonington, Connecticut). Von Bellingshausen supposedly saw Antarctica on <!--del_lnk--> January 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1820, three days before Bransfield sighted land, and ten months before Palmer did so in November 1820. On that day the two ship expedition led by Von Bellingshausen and <!--del_lnk--> Mikhail Petrovich Lazarev reached a point within 32&nbsp;km (20&nbsp;miles) of the Antarctic mainland and saw ice fields there.<p>In 1841, explorer <!--del_lnk--> James Clark Ross passed through what is now known as the <!--del_lnk--> Ross Sea and discovered <!--del_lnk--> Ross Island. He sailed along a huge wall of ice that was later named the <!--del_lnk--> Ross Ice Shelf. <!--del_lnk--> Mount Erebus and <!--del_lnk--> Mount Terror are named after two ships from his expedition: <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Erebus</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Terror</i>.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>During an <!--del_lnk--> expedition led by <!--del_lnk--> Ernest Shackleton in 1907, parties led by <!--del_lnk--> T. W. Edgeworth David became the first to climb <!--del_lnk--> Mount Erebus and to reach the <!--del_lnk--> South Magnetic Pole. In addition, Shackleton himself and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in December 1908 - February 1909: first humans to traverse the <!--del_lnk--> Ross Ice Shelf, the first humans to traverse the Transantarctic Mountain Range (via the <!--del_lnk--> Beardmore Glacier), and the first humans to set foot on the South Polar Plateau. On <!--del_lnk--> December 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1911, a party led by Norwegian polar explorer <a href="../../wp/r/Roald_Amundsen.htm" title="Roald Amundsen">Roald Amundsen</a> from the ship <i><!--del_lnk--> Fram</i> became the first to reach the geographic <!--del_lnk--> South Pole, using a route from the <!--del_lnk--> Bay of Whales and up the <!--del_lnk--> Axel Heiberg Glacier. <p><!--del_lnk--> Richard Evelyn Byrd led several voyages to the Antarctic by plane in the 1930s and 1940s. He is credited with implementing mechanized land transport and conducting extensive geological and biological research. However, it was not until <!--del_lnk--> October 31, <!--del_lnk--> 1956 that anyone set foot on the South Pole again; on that day a U.S. Navy group led by Rear Admiral <!--del_lnk--> George Dufek successfully landed an aircraft there.<p>

      <p>Physically, it is divided in two by the <!--del_lnk--> Transantarctic Mountains close to the neck between the <!--del_lnk--> Ross Sea and the <!--del_lnk--> Weddell Sea. The portion west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called <!--del_lnk--> Western Antarctica and the remainder <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Antarctica, because they roughly correspond to the Western and Eastern Hemispheres relative to the <!--del_lnk--> Greenwich meridian.<p>About 98% of Antarctica is covered by the <!--del_lnk--> Antarctic ice sheet. The <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_sheet.htm" title="Ice sheet">ice sheet</a> is, on average, 2.5&nbsp;kilometers (1.6&nbsp;miles) thick. The continent has approximately 90% of the world&#39;s <a href="../../wp/f/Fresh_water.htm" title="Fresh water">fresh water</a>, in the form of ice. If all of this ice were melted sea levels would rise about 61m (200 feet).  In most of the interior of the continent <!--del_lnk--> precipitation is very low, down to 20 mm/yr; in a few &quot;<!--del_lnk--> blue ice&quot; areas precipitation is lower than mass loss by <!--del_lnk--> sublimation and so the local mass balance is negative. In the dry valleys the same effect occurs over a rock base, leading to a desiccated landscape.<p>Western Antarctica is covered by the <!--del_lnk--> West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The sheet has been of recent concern because of the real, if small, possibility of its collapse. If the sheet were to break down, <!--del_lnk--> ocean levels would rise by several meters in a relatively <!--del_lnk--> geologically short period of time, perhaps a matter of centuries. Several Antarctic <!--del_lnk--> ice streams, which account for about 10% of the ice sheet, flow to one of the many <!--del_lnk--> Antarctic ice shelves.<div class="thumb tleft">

Other dormant volcanoes may potentially be active. In 2004, an underwater volcano was found in the <!--del_lnk--> Antarctic Peninsula by American and Canadian researchers. Recent evidence shows this unnamed volcano may be active.<p>Antarctica is home to more than 70 <!--del_lnk--> lakes that lie thousands of meters under the surface of the continental ice sheet. <a href="../../wp/l/Lake_Vostok.htm" title="Lake Vostok">Lake Vostok</a>, discovered beneath <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Vostok Station in 1996, is the largest of these <!--del_lnk--> subglacial lakes. It is believed that the lake has been sealed off for 35 million years. There is some evidence that Vostok&#39;s waters may contain <!--del_lnk--> microbial life. The sealed, frozen surface of the lake shares similarities with <a href="../../wp/j/Jupiter.htm" title="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>&#39;s moon <!--del_lnk--> Europa.

      <p>More than 170 million years ago, Antarctica was part of the <!--del_lnk--> supercontinent <!--del_lnk--> Gondwana.

      <p>During the Cambrian period Gondwana had a mild climate. West Antarctica was partially in the northern hemisphere, and during this period large amounts of <!--del_lnk--> sandstones, <!--del_lnk--> limestones and <!--del_lnk--> shales were deposited. East Antarctica was at the equator, where sea-floor <a href="../../wp/i/Invertebrate.htm" title="Invertebrate">invertebrates</a> and <!--del_lnk--> trilobites flourished in the tropical seas. By the start of the Devonian period (416 Mya) Gondwana was in more southern latitudes and the climate was cooler, though fossils of land plants are known from this time. <a href="../../wp/s/Sand.htm" title="Sand">Sand</a> and <!--del_lnk--> silts were laid down in what is now the <!--del_lnk--> Ellsworth, <!--del_lnk--> Horlick and <!--del_lnk--> Pensacola Mountains. <!--del_lnk--> Glaciation began at the end of the Devonian period (360 Mya) as Gondwana became centered around the <!--del_lnk--> South Pole and the climate cooled, though flora remained. During the Permian period the plant life became dominated by fern-like plants such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Glossopteris</i>, which grew in swamps. Over time these swamps became deposits of coal in the <!--del_lnk--> Transantarctic Mountains. Towards the end of the Permian period, continued warming led to a dry, hot climate over much of Gondwana.<p><a id="Mesozoic_era_.28250-65_Mya.29" name="Mesozoic_era_.28250-65_Mya.29"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Mesozoic era (250-65 Mya)</span></h4>

      <p>As a result of continued warming, the polar ice caps melted and much of Gondwana became a desert. In East Antarctica the <!--del_lnk--> seed fern became established, and large amounts of sandstone and shale were laid down at this time. The Antarctic Peninsula began to form during the Jurassic period (206-146 Mya), and islands gradually rose out of the ocean. <!--del_lnk--> Ginkgo trees and <!--del_lnk--> cycads were plentiful during this period, as were reptiles such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Lystrosaurus</i>.

      <p>The geological study of Antarctica has been greatly hindered by the fact that nearly all of the continent is permanently covered with a thick layer of ice. However, new techniques such as <!--del_lnk--> remote sensing have begun to reveal the structures beneath the ice.<p>Geologically, West Antarctica closely resembles the <a href="../../wp/a/Andes.htm" title="Andes">Andes</a> of <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Antarctic Peninsula was formed by uplift and <!--del_lnk--> metamorphism of sea-bed sediments during the late Paleozoic and the early Mesozoic eras. This sediment uplift was accompanied by <!--del_lnk--> igneous intrusions and <!--del_lnk--> volcanism. The most common rocks in West Antarctica are <!--del_lnk--> andesite and <!--del_lnk--> rhyolite volcanics formed during the Jurassic Period. There is also evidence of volcanic activity, even after the ice sheet had formed, in <!--del_lnk--> Marie Byrd Land and <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Island. The only anomalous area of West Antarctica is the <!--del_lnk--> Ellsworth Mountains region, where the <!--del_lnk--> stratigraphy is more similar to the eastern part of the continent.<p>East Antarctica is geologically very old, dating from the <a href="../../wp/p/Precambrian.htm" title="Precambrian">Precambrian</a> era, with some rocks formed more than 3 billion years ago. It is composed of a <a href="../../wp/m/Metamorphic_rock.htm" title="Metamorphic rock">metamorphic</a> and <!--del_lnk--> igneous platform which is the basis of the <!--del_lnk--> continental shield. On top of this base are various more modern rocks, such as <!--del_lnk--> sandstones, <!--del_lnk--> limestones, coal and <!--del_lnk--> shales laid down during the Devonian and Jurassic periods to form the <!--del_lnk--> Transantarctic Mountains. In coastal areas such as <!--del_lnk--> Shackleton Range and <!--del_lnk--> Victoria Land some <!--del_lnk--> faulting has occurred.<p>The main <a href="../../wp/m/Mineral.htm" title="Mineral">mineral</a> resource known on the continent is <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a>. It was first recorded near the <!--del_lnk--> Beardmore Glacier by <!--del_lnk--> Frank Wild on the <!--del_lnk--> Nimrod Expedition, and now low-grade coal is known across many parts of the Transantarctic Mountains. The <!--del_lnk--> Prince Charles Mountains contain significant deposits of <!--del_lnk--> iron ore. The most valuable resources of Antarctica lie offshore, namely the <!--del_lnk--> oil and <!--del_lnk--> natural gas fields found in the <!--del_lnk--> Ross Sea in 1973. Exploitation of all mineral resources is banned until 2048 by the <!--del_lnk--> Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h2>

      <p>Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth. It is a frozen desert with little <!--del_lnk--> precipitation; the South Pole itself receives almost none. Temperatures reach a minimum of between -85 &deg;C and -90 &deg;C (-121 &deg;F and -130 &deg;F) in the winter and about 20 &deg;C (30 &deg;F) higher in the summer months. Sunburn is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects over 90% of the sunlight falling on it. Eastern Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of higher elevation. <!--del_lnk--> Weather fronts rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the centre cold and dry. Despite the lack of precipitation over the central portion of the continent, <a href="../../wp/i/Ice.htm" title="Ice">ice</a> there lasts for extended time periods. Heavy snowfalls are not uncommon on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to 1.22&nbsp;meters (48&nbsp;inches) in 48&nbsp;hours have been recorded.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>At the edge of the continent, strong <!--del_lnk--> katabatic winds off the polar plateau often blow at storm force. In the interior, however, wind speeds are typically moderate. During summer more <!--del_lnk--> solar radiation reaches the surface at the South Pole than is received at the <!--del_lnk--> equator in an equivalent period.<p>Antarctica is colder than the <a href="../../wp/a/Arctic.htm" title="Arctic">Arctic</a> for two reasons. First, much of the continent is more than 3&nbsp;km above sea level, and temperature decreases with elevation. Second, the <a href="../../wp/a/Arctic_Ocean.htm" title="Arctic Ocean">Arctic Ocean</a> covers the north polar zone: the ocean&#39;s relative warmth is transferred through the icepack and prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica.<p>Given the latitude, long periods of constant darkness or constant sunlight create climates unfamiliar to human beings in much of the rest of the world. The <!--del_lnk--> aurora australis, commonly known as the southern lights, is a glow observed in the night sky near the South Pole. Another unique spectacle is <!--del_lnk--> diamond dust, a ground-level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals. It generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies, so people sometimes also refer to it as clear-sky precipitation.

      <p>The first semi-permanent inhabitants of regions near Antarctica (areas situated south of the <!--del_lnk--> Antarctic Convergence) were English and American sealers who used to spend a year or more on <a href="../../wp/s/South_Georgia_and_the_South_Sandwich_Islands.htm" title="South Georgia Island">South Georgia</a>, from 1786 onward. During the whaling era, which lasted until 1966, the population of that island varied from over 1000 in the summer (over 2000 in some years) to some 200 in the winter. Most of the whalers were Norwegian, with an increasing proportion of Britons. The settlements included <!--del_lnk--> Grytviken, <!--del_lnk--> Leith Harbour, <!--del_lnk--> King Edward Point, <!--del_lnk--> Stromness, <!--del_lnk--> Husvik, <!--del_lnk--> Prince Olav Harbour, <!--del_lnk--> Ocean Harbour and <!--del_lnk--> Godthul.

      <p>The climate of Antarctica does not allow extensive vegetation.

      <p>As the only uninhabited continent, Antarctica has no government and belongs to no country. Various countries claim areas of it but these claims are typically not recognized by others. The area between 90&deg;W and 150&deg;W is the only part of Antarctica, indeed the only solid land on Earth, not claimed by any country.<p>Since 1959, claims on Antarctica have been suspended and the continent is considered politically neutral. Its status is regulated by the 1959 <!--del_lnk--> Antarctic Treaty and other related agreements, collectively called the <a href="../../wp/a/Antarctic_Treaty_System.htm" title="Antarctic Treaty System">Antarctic Treaty System</a>. For the purposes of the Treaty System, Antarctica is defined as all land and <!--del_lnk--> ice shelves south of 60&deg;S. The treaty was signed by 12 countries, including the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. It set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation, environmental protection, and banned military activity on that continent. This was the first <!--del_lnk--> arms control agreement established during the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>.<p>The Antarctic Treaty prohibits any military activity in Antarctica, such as the establishment of military bases and fortifications, the carrying out of military manoeuvres, or the testing of any type of weapon. Military personnel or equipment are only permitted for scientific research or for other peaceful purposes. The only documented large-scale land military maneuver was <!--del_lnk--> Operation NINETY, undertaken ten years before the Antarctic Treaty by the <!--del_lnk--> Argentine military.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> United States military issues the <!--del_lnk--> Antarctica Service Medal to military members or civilians who perform research duty on the Antarctica continent. The medal includes a &quot;wintered over&quot; bar issued to those who remain on the continent for two complete six-month seasons.Unlike other states, the United States has made no territorial claim in Antarctica nor does it recognize the claims of any other state.<p><a id="Antarctic_territories" name="Antarctic_territories"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Antarctic territories</span></h3>

      <p>Although coal, hydrocarbons, iron ore, platinum, copper, chromium, nickel, gold and other minerals have been found, they exist in quantities too small to exploit. The 1991 <!--del_lnk--> Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty also restricts a struggle for resources. In 1998 a compromise agreement was reached to add a 50-year ban on mining until the year 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation. The primary agricultural activity is the capture and offshore trading of fish. Antarctic fisheries in 2000-01 reported landing 112,934&nbsp;tonnes.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Small-scale <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">tourism</a> has existed since 1957 and is currently self-regulated by <!--del_lnk--> International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators (IAATO). However, not all vessels have joined the IAATO. Several <a href="../../wp/s/Ship.htm" title="Ship">ships</a> transport people into Antarctica for specific scenic locations. A total of 27,950 tourists visited in the 2004-05 Antarctic summer with nearly all of them coming from commercial ships. The number is predicted to increase to over 80,000 by 2010. There has been some recent concern over the adverse environmental and ecosystem affects caused by the influx of visitors. A call for stricter regulations for ships and a tourism quota have been made by both environmentalists and scientists. Antarctic sight seeing flights (which did not land) operated out of Australia and New Zealand until the fatal crash of <!--del_lnk--> Air New Zealand Flight 901 in 1979 on <!--del_lnk--> Mount Erebus, and resumed from Australia in the mid-1990s.<p><a id="Transport" name="Transport"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transport</span></h2>

      <p>Each year, scientists from 27 different nations conduct <!--del_lnk--> experiments not reproducible in any other place in the world. In the summer more than 4000 scientists operate <!--del_lnk--> research stations; this number decreases to nearly 1000 in the winter. The <!--del_lnk--> McMurdo Station is capable of housing more than 1000 scientists, visitors, and tourists.<p>Researchers include biologists, geologists, oceanographers, physicists, astronomers, glaciologists, and meteorologists. <!--del_lnk--> Geologists tend to study plate tectonics in the Arctic region, meteorites from <!--del_lnk--> outer space, and resources from the breakup of the supercontinent <!--del_lnk--> Gondwanaland. <!--del_lnk--> Glaciologists in Antarctica are concerned with the study of the history and dynamics of floating <a href="../../wp/i/Ice.htm" title="Ice">ice</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Snow.htm" title="Snow">seasonal snow</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Glacier.htm" title="Glacier">glaciers</a>, and <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_sheet.htm" title="Ice sheet">ice sheets</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Biologists, in addition to examining the wildlife, are interested in how harsh temperatures and the presence of people affect adaptation and survival strategies in a wide variety of organisms. Medical physicians have made discoveries concerning the spreading of viruses and the body&#39;s response to extreme seasonal temperatures. <!--del_lnk--> Astrophysicists in <!--del_lnk--> Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station are able to study the celestial dome and <a href="../../wp/c/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation.htm" title="Cosmic microwave background radiation">cosmic microwave background radiation</a> because of the polar&#39;s thin ozone layer due lack of sunlight and the location&#39;s dry, cold environment. Antarctic ice serves as both the shield and the detection medium for the largest <!--del_lnk--> neutrino telescope in the world, built 2&nbsp;km below Amundsen-Scott station.<p>Since the 1970s an important focus of study has been the <!--del_lnk--> ozone layer in the <!--del_lnk--> atmosphere above Antarctica. In 1985 3 British Scientists working on data they had gathered at <!--del_lnk--> Halley Station on the Brunt Ice Shelf discovered the existence of a hole in this layer. In 1998 <!--del_lnk--> NASA satellite data showed that the Antarctic <!--del_lnk--> ozone hole was the largest on record, covering 27&nbsp;million square kilometers. In 2002 significant areas of ice shelves disintegrated in response to regional warming.<p><a id="Meteorites" name="Meteorites"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Meteorites</span></h3>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Meteorites from Antarctica are an important area of study of material formed early in the <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_System.htm" title="Solar system">solar system</a>; most are thought to come from <a href="../../wp/a/Asteroid.htm" title="Asteroid">asteroids</a>, but some may have originated on larger <a href="../../wp/p/Planet.htm" title="Planet">planets</a>. The first meteorites found in Antarctica were in 1912. In 1969 the Japanese discovered nine meteorites in Antarctica. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_sheet.htm" title="Ice sheet">ice sheet</a> in the last million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall. Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are relatively well preserved.<p>This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these are pieces blasted off the moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, particularly <!--del_lnk--> ALH84001 discovered by <!--del_lnk--> ANSMET, are at the centre of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.<p>In 2006 a team of researchers from <!--del_lnk--> Ohio State University used gravity measurements by NASA&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> GRACE satellites to discover the 300-mile-wide <!--del_lnk--> Wilkes Land crater, which probably formed about 250 million years ago.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica&quot;</div>
