These two disciplines influenced the birth of <!--del_lnk--> Rosicrucianism, an important <!--del_lnk--> esoteric movement of the seventeenth century. In the course of the early modern period, mainstream alchemy evolved into modern chemistry.<p>Today, the discipline is of interest mainly to <a href="../../wp/h/History_of_science.htm" title="History of science">historians of science</a> and <!--del_lnk--> philosophy, and for its <!--del_lnk--> mystic, <!--del_lnk--> esoteric, and <!--del_lnk--> artistic aspects. Nevertheless, alchemy was one of the main precursors of modern <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">sciences</a>, and many substances and processes of ancient alchemy continue to be the mainstay of modern chemical and metallurgical industries.<p>Although alchemy takes on many forms, in <!--del_lnk--> pop culture it is most often cited in stories, films, shows, and games as the process used to change lead (or other elements) into <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a>.<p>

      <p>The common perception of alchemists is that they were <!--del_lnk--> pseudo-scientists, liars and <!--del_lnk--> charlatans, who attempted to turn <a href="../../wp/l/Lead.htm" title="Lead">lead</a> into <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a>, believing that the universe was composed of the <!--del_lnk--> four elements of earth, air, fire, and water, and spent most of their time concocting miraculous <!--del_lnk--> remedies, <!--del_lnk--> poisons, and <!--del_lnk--> magic <!--del_lnk--> potions.<p>Although some alchemists were indeed posers, liars and charlatans, most were well-meaning and intelligent scholars and distinguished scientists such as <a href="../../wp/i/Isaac_Newton.htm" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a> and <a href="../../wp/r/Robert_Boyle.htm" title="Robert Boyle">Robert Boyle</a>. These innovators attempted to explore the nature of chemical substances and processes. They had to rely on <!--del_lnk--> experimentation, traditional know-how, <!--del_lnk--> rules of thumb&mdash;and speculative thought in their attempts to uncover the mysteries of the physical universe.<p>At the same time, it was clear to the alchemists that &quot;something&quot; was generally being conserved in chemical processes, even in the most dramatic changes of physical state and appearance; that is, that substances contained some &quot;principles&quot; that could be hidden under many outer forms, and revealed by proper manipulation. Throughout the history of the discipline, alchemists struggled to understand the nature of these principles, and find some order and sense in the results of their chemical experiments&mdash;which were often undermined by impure or poorly characterized reagents, the lack of quantitative measurements, and confusing and inconsistent nomenclature.<p><a id="Goals_of_alchemy" name="Goals_of_alchemy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Goals of alchemy</span></h3>
      <p>1. The <!--del_lnk--> transmutation of metals<p>2. The creation of an elixir that would prolong life indefinitely<p>3. The transmutation of human life<p><a id="Alchemy_as_a_philosophical_and_spiritual_discipline" name="Alchemy_as_a_philosophical_and_spiritual_discipline"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Alchemy as a philosophical and spiritual discipline</span></h3>
      <p>The best known goals of the <!--del_lnk--> alchemists were the <!--del_lnk--> transmutation of common metals into <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a> or <a href="../../wp/s/Silver.htm" title="Silver">silver</a>, and the creation of a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> panacea,&quot; a remedy that supposedly would cure all diseases and prolong life indefinitely. Although these were not the only uses for the science, they were the ones most documented and well known. Starting with the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, European alchemists invested much effort on the search for the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> philosopher&#39;s stone&quot;, a legendary substance that was believed to be an essential ingredient for either or both of those goals. The philosopher&#39;s stone was believed to mystically amplify the user&#39;s knowledge of alchemy so much that anything was attainable. Alchemists enjoyed prestige and support through the centuries, though not for their pursuit of those goals, nor the mystic and philosophical speculation that dominates their literature. Rather it was for their mundane contributions to the &quot;chemical&quot; industries of the day&mdash;the invention of gunpowder, ore testing and refining, metalworking, production of ink, dyes, paints, and cosmetics, leather tanning, ceramics and glass manufacture, preparation of extracts and liquors, and so on (It seems that the preparation of <i><!--del_lnk--> aqua vitae</i>, the &quot;water of life&quot;, was a fairly popular &quot;experiment&quot; among European alchemists).<p>On the other hand, alchemists never had the inclination to separate the physical (chemical) aspects of their craft from the metaphysical interpretations. Indeed, from antiquity until well into the <!--del_lnk--> Modern Age, a physics devoid of metaphysical insight would have been as unsatisfying as a metaphysics devoid of physical manifestation. For one thing, the lack of common words for chemical concepts and processes, as well as the need for secrecy, led alchemists to borrow the terms and symbols of <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">biblical</a> and <!--del_lnk--> pagan <a href="../../wp/m/Mythology.htm" title="Mythology">mythology</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Astrology.htm" title="Astrology">astrology</a>, <!--del_lnk--> kabbalah, and other mystic and <!--del_lnk--> esoteric fields; so that even the plainest chemical recipe ended up reading like an abstruse magic incantation. Moreover, alchemists sought in those fields the theoretical frameworks into which they could fit their growing collection of disjointed experimental facts.<p>Starting with the middle ages, some alchemists increasingly came to view these metaphysical aspects as the true foundation of alchemy; and chemical substances, physical states, and material processes as mere metaphors for spiritual entities, states and transformations. Thus, both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea symbolized evolution from an imperfect, diseased, corruptible and ephemeral state towards a perfect, healthy, incorruptible and everlasting state; and the philosopher&#39;s stone then represented some mystic key that would make this evolution possible. Applied to the alchemist himself, the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment, and the stone represented some hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal. In texts that are written according to this view, the cryptic <!--del_lnk--> alchemical symbols, diagrams, and textual imagery of late alchemical works typically contain multiple layers of meanings, allegories, and references to other equally cryptic works; and must be laboriously &quot;decoded&quot; in order to discover their true meaning.<p><a id="Alchemy_and_astrology" name="Alchemy_and_astrology"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Alchemy and astrology</span></h3>
      <p>Since its earliest times, alchemy has been closely connected to <a href="../../wp/a/Astrology.htm" title="Astrology">astrology</a>&mdash;which, in the Islamic world and Europe, generally meant the traditional <!--del_lnk--> Babylonian-Greek school of astrology. Alchemical systems often postulated that each of the seven <a href="../../wp/p/Planet.htm" title="Planet">planets</a> known to the ancients &quot;<!--del_lnk--> ruled&quot; or was associated with a certain <a href="../../wp/m/Metal.htm" title="Metal">metal</a>. See the separate article on <!--del_lnk--> astrology and alchemy for further details. In <!--del_lnk--> Hermeticism it is linked with both astrology and <!--del_lnk--> theurgy. &quot;Everything that happens once will never happen again. But anything that happens twice will surely happen a third time.&quot; A quote from The Alchemist.<p><a id="Alchemy_in_the_age_of_science" name="Alchemy_in_the_age_of_science"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Alchemy in the age of science</span></h3>
      <p>Up to the 18th century, alchemy was actually considered serious science in Europe; for instance, <a href="../../wp/i/Isaac_Newton.htm" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a> devoted considerably more of his time and writing to the study of alchemy (see <!--del_lnk--> Isaac Newton&#39;s occult studies) than he did to either optics or physics, for which he is famous. Other eminent alchemists of the Western world are <!--del_lnk--> Roger Bacon, Saint <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Aquinas.htm" title="Thomas Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Tycho_Brahe.htm" title="Tycho Brahe">Tycho Brahe</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Browne, and <!--del_lnk--> Parmigianino. The decline of alchemy began in the 18th century with the birth of modern chemistry, which provided a more precise and reliable framework for matter transmutations and medicine, within a new grand design of the universe based on rational materialism.<p>In the first half of the nineteenth century, one established chemist, Baron <!--del_lnk--> Carl Reichenbach, worked on concepts similar to the old alchemy, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Odic force, but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion.<p>Matter transmutation, the old goal of alchemy, enjoyed a moment in the sun in the 20th century when physicists were able to convert lead atoms into gold atoms via a <!--del_lnk--> nuclear reaction. However, the new gold atoms, being unstable <!--del_lnk--> isotopes, lasted for under five seconds before they broke apart. More recently, reports of table-top element transmutation&mdash;by means of <!--del_lnk--> electrolysis or <!--del_lnk--> sonic cavitation&mdash;were the pivot of the <!--del_lnk--> cold fusion controversy of 1989. None of those claims have yet been reliably duplicated.<p>Alchemical symbolism has been occasionally used in the 20th century by <a href="../../wp/p/Psychology.htm" title="Psychology">psychologists</a> and philosophers. <a href="../../wp/c/Carl_Jung.htm" title="Carl Jung">Carl Jung</a> reexamined alchemical symbolism and theory and began to show the inner meaning of alchemical work as a <!--del_lnk--> spiritual path. Alchemical philosophy, symbols and methods have enjoyed something of a renaissance in <!--del_lnk--> post-modern contexts, such as the <!--del_lnk--> New Age movement.<p><a id="Alchemy_as_a_subject_of_historical_research" name="Alchemy_as_a_subject_of_historical_research"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Alchemy as a subject of historical research</span></h3>
      <p>The history of alchemy has become a vigorous academic field. As the obscure hermetic language of the alchemists is gradually being &quot;deciphered&quot;, historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of Western cultural history, such as the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities, <!--del_lnk--> kabbalism, <!--del_lnk--> spiritualism, <!--del_lnk--> Rosicrucianism, and other mystic movements, <a href="../../wp/c/Cryptography.htm" title="Cryptography">cryptography</a>, <!--del_lnk--> witchcraft, and the evolution of <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">science</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>.<p><a id="Etymology" name="Etymology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Etymology</span></h2>

      <p>The word <i>chemistry</i> comes from the earlier study of alchemy, which is basically the quest to make gold from earthen starting materials. As to the origin of the word &ldquo;alchemy&rdquo; the question is a debatable one, it certainly has Greek origins, and some, following E. Wallis Budge, have also asserted Egyptian origins. Alchemy, generally, derives from the old French <i>alkemie;</i> and the Arabic <i>al-kimia:</i> &quot;the art of transformation.&quot; The Arabs borrowed the word &ldquo;kimia&rdquo; from the Greeks when they conquered <!--del_lnk--> Alexandria in the year 642 AD. A tentative outline is as follows:<ol>
       <li>Egyptian alchemy [5,000 BC &ndash; 400 BC], Alexandria has the world&rsquo;s largest library<li>Greek alchemy [332 BC &ndash; 642 AD], the Greeks take over Alexandria<li>Arabian alchemy [642 AD &ndash; 1200], the Arabs take over Alexandria, e.g. <!--del_lnk--> Jabir is the main chemist.<li>European alchemy [1300 &ndash; Present], <!--del_lnk--> Gerber builds on Arabic chemistry<li>Chemistry [1661], <!--del_lnk--> Boyle writes his classic chemistry text <i>The Sceptical Chymist</i><li>Chemistry [1787], <!--del_lnk--> Lavoisier writes his classic <i>Elements of Chemistry</i><li>Chemistry [1803], <!--del_lnk--> Dalton publishes his <i>Atomic Theory</i></ol>
      <p>Thus, an alchemist was called a &#39;chemist&#39; in popular speech, and later the suffix &quot;-ry&quot; was added to this to describe the art of the chemist as &quot;chemistry&quot;.<p><a id="Alchemy_in_history" name="Alchemy_in_history"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Alchemy in history</span></h2>

      <p>Alchemy encompasses several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents. These traditions&#39; general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and &quot;genetic&quot; relationships.<p>One can distinguish at least two major strands, which appear to be largely independent, at least in their earlier stages: <!--del_lnk--> Chinese alchemy, centered in <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> and its zone of cultural influence; and <!--del_lnk--> Western alchemy, whose centre has shifted over the millennia between <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greece</a> and <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a>, the <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islamic</a> world, and finally back to <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>. Chinese alchemy was closely connected to <a href="../../wp/t/Taoism.htm" title="Taoism">Taoism</a>, whereas Western alchemy developed its own philosophical system, with only superficial connections to the major Western religions. It is still an open question whether these two strands share a common origin, or to what extent they influenced each other.<p><a id="Alchemy_in_ancient_Egypt" name="Alchemy_in_ancient_Egypt"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Alchemy in ancient Egypt</span></h3>
      <p>The origin of western alchemy may generally be traced to <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">ancient (pharaonic) Egypt</a>. <a href="../../wp/m/Metallurgy.htm" title="Metallurgy">Metallurgy</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Mysticism.htm" title="Mysticism">mysticism</a> were inexorably tied together in the ancient world. It is claimed therefore that Alchemy in ancient Egypt was the domain of the priestly class.<p>Egyptian alchemy is known mostly through the writings of ancient (Hellenic) <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greek</a> philosophers, which in turn have often survived only in Islamic translations. Practically no original Egyptian documents on alchemy have survived. Those writings, if they existed, were likely lost when the <!--del_lnk--> emperor <!--del_lnk--> Diocletian ordered the burning of alchemical books after suppressing a revolt in Alexandria (292), which had been a centre of Egyptian alchemy.<p>Nevertheless <!--del_lnk--> archaeological expeditions in recent times have unearthed evidence of chemical analysis during the <!--del_lnk--> Naqada periods. For example, a <a href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper">copper</a> tool dating to the <!--del_lnk--> Naqada era bears evidence of having been used in such a way (reference: artifact 5437 on display at <!--del_lnk--> ). Also, the process of <!--del_lnk--> tanning <a href="../../wp/a/Animal.htm" title="Animal">animal</a> <!--del_lnk--> skins was already known in <!--del_lnk--> Predynastic Egypt as early as the <!--del_lnk--> 6th millennium BC <!--del_lnk--> . Other evidence indicates early alchemists in <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">ancient Egypt</a> had invented <!--del_lnk--> mortar by 4000 BC and <a href="../../wp/g/Glass.htm" title="Glass">glass</a> by 1500 BC. The chemical reaction involved in the production of <!--del_lnk--> Calcium Oxide is one of the oldest known (references: <!--del_lnk--> Calcium Oxide, <!--del_lnk--> limekiln):<dl>
       <dd>CaCO<sub>3</sub> + heat &rarr; CaO + CO<sub>2</sub>.</dl>
      <p><a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a> additionally produced <!--del_lnk--> cosmetics, <!--del_lnk--> cement, <!--del_lnk--> faience and also <!--del_lnk--> pitch for <!--del_lnk--> shipbuilding. <!--del_lnk--> Papyrus had also been invented by 3000 BC.<p>Legend has it that the founder of Egyptian alchemy was the <a href="../../wp/d/Deity.htm" title="Deity">god</a> <!--del_lnk--> Thoth, called Hermes-Thoth or Thrice-Great Hermes (<i><!--del_lnk--> Hermes Trismegistus</i>) by the Greeks. According to legend, he wrote what were called the forty-two Books of Knowledge, covering all fields of knowledge&mdash;including alchemy. Hermes&#39;s symbol was the <!--del_lnk--> caduceus or serpent-staff, which became one of many of alchemy&#39;s principal symbols. The &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Emerald Tablet&quot; or <i><!--del_lnk--> Hermetica</i> of Thrice-Great Hermes, which is known only through Greek and <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> translations, is generally understood to form the basis for Western alchemical philosophy and practice, called the <!--del_lnk--> hermetic philosophy by its early practitioners.<p>The first point of the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; tells the purpose of hermetic science: &quot;in truth certainly and without doubt, whatever is below is like that which is above, and whatever is above is like that which is below, to accomplish the miracles of one thing.&quot; This is the <!--del_lnk--> macrocosm-microcosm belief central to the hermetic philosophy. In other words, the human body (the microcosm) is affected by the exterior world (the macrocosm), which includes the heavens through <a href="../../wp/a/Astrology.htm" title="Astrology">astrology</a>, and the earth through the <!--del_lnk--> elements. Though when one gains mastery over their inner world, they begin to be able to control the exterior world in unconventional ways.<p>It has been speculated that a riddle from the Emerald Tablet&mdash;&quot;it was carried in the womb by the wind&quot;&mdash;refers to the distillation of oxygen from <!--del_lnk--> saltpeter&mdash;a process that was unknown in Europe until its (re)discovery by Sendivogius in the 17th century.<p>In the 4th century BC, the Greek-speaking <a href="../../wp/m/Macedon.htm" title="Macedon">Macedonians</a> conquered Egypt and founded the city of Alexandria in 332. This brought them into contact with Egyptian ideas. See <a href="#Alchemy_in_the_Greek_world" title="">Alchemy in the Greek World</a> below.<p><a id="Chinese_alchemy" name="Chinese_alchemy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Chinese alchemy</span></h3>
      <p>Whereas Western alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble ones, <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">Chinese</a> alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine. The <!--del_lnk--> philosopher&#39;s stone of European alchemists can be compared to the <!--del_lnk--> Grand Elixir of Immortality sought by Chinese alchemists. However, in the hermetic view, these two goals were not unconnected, and the philosopher&#39;s stone was often equated with the <!--del_lnk--> universal panacea; therefore, the two traditions may have had more in common than it initially appears.<p><!--del_lnk--> Black powder may have been an important invention of Chinese alchemists. Described in 9th century texts and used in <!--del_lnk--> fireworks in <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> by the 10th century, it was used in <!--del_lnk--> cannons by 1290. From <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, the use of <a href="../../wp/g/Gunpowder.htm" title="Gunpowder">gunpowder</a> spread to <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Mongols, the Arab world and Europe. Gunpowder was used by the Mongols against the Hungarians in 1241, and in Europe by the 14th century.<p>Chinese alchemy was closely connected to <!--del_lnk--> Taoist forms of <!--del_lnk--> traditional Chinese medicine, such as <!--del_lnk--> Acupuncture and <!--del_lnk--> Moxibustion, and to <!--del_lnk--> martial arts such as <!--del_lnk--> Tai Chi Chuan and <!--del_lnk--> Kung Fu (although some Tai Chi schools believe that their art derives from the philosophical or hygienic branches of Taoism, not the Alchemical). In fact, in the early <!--del_lnk--> Song Dynasty, followers of this Daoist idea (chiefly the elite and upper class) would ingest mercuric sulfide, which, though tolerable in low levels, lead many to suicide. Thinking that this consequential death would lead to freedom and access to the Daoist heavens, the ensuing deaths encouraged people to eschew this method of alchemy in favour of external sources (the aforementioned Tai Chi Chuan, mastering of the <!--del_lnk--> Qi, etc.).<p><a id="Indian_alchemy" name="Indian_alchemy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Indian alchemy</span></h3>
      <p>Little is known in the West about the character and history of <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">Indian</a> alchemy. An 11th century <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Persian</a> alchemist named <!--del_lnk--> al-Biruni reported that they &quot;have a science similar to alchemy which is quite peculiar to them, which is called <!--del_lnk--> Rasay&#x101;na in persian <!--del_lnk--> Rasav&#x101;tam. It means the art of obtaining/manipulating <!--del_lnk--> Rasa, nectar, mercury, juice. This art was restricted to certain operations, metals, drugs, compounds, and medicines, most of which have mercury as their core element. Its principles restored the health of those who were ill beyond hope and gave back youth to fading old age.&quot; One thing is sure though, Indian alchemy like every other Indian science is focused on finding <!--del_lnk--> Moksha: perfection, immortality, liberation. As such it focuses its efforts on transumation of the human body: from mortal to immortal. Many are the traditional stories of alchemists still alive since time immemorial due to the effects of their experiments.<p>The texts of <!--del_lnk--> Ayurvedic Medicine and Science have aspects similar to alchemy: concepts of cures for all known diseases, and treatments that focus on anointing the body with oils.<p>Since alchemy eventually became engrained in the vast field of Indian erudition, influences from other metaphisical and philosophical doctrines such as <!--del_lnk--> Samkhya, <!--del_lnk--> Yoga, <!--del_lnk--> Vaisheshika and <!--del_lnk--> Ayurveda were inevitable. Nonetheless, most of the <!--del_lnk--> Rasay&#x101;na texts track their origins back to Kaula tantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of Matsyendranath.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Rasay&#x101;na was understood by very few people at the time. Two famous examples were <!--del_lnk--> Nagarjunacharya and Nityanadhiya. Nagarjunacharya was a buddhist monk who, in ancient times, ran the great university of Nagarjuna Sagar. His famous book, Rasaratanakaram, is a famous example of early Indian medicine. In traditional Indian medicinal terminology &#39;rasa&#39; translates as &#39;mercury&#39; and Nagarjunacharya was said to have developed a method to convert the mercury into gold. Much of his original writings are lost to us, but his teachings still have strong influence on traditional Indian medicine (Ayureveda) to this day.<p><a id="Alchemy_in_the_Greek_world" name="Alchemy_in_the_Greek_world"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Alchemy in the Greek world</span></h3>
      <p>The Greek city of <!--del_lnk--> Alexandria in Egypt was a centre of Greek alchemical knowledge, and retained its preeminence through most of the Greek and Roman periods. The Greeks appropriated the hermetical beliefs of the Egyptians and melded with them the philosophies of <a href="../../wp/p/Pythagoras.htm" title="Pythagoras">Pythagoreanism</a>, <!--del_lnk--> ionianism, and <!--del_lnk--> gnosticism. Pythagorean philosophy is, essentially, the belief that numbers rule the universe, originating from the observations of sound, stars, and geometric shapes like triangles, or anything from which a <!--del_lnk--> ratio could be derived. <!--del_lnk--> Ionian thought was based on the belief that the universe could be explained through concentration on <!--del_lnk--> natural phenomena; this philosophy is believed to have originated with <!--del_lnk--> Thales and his pupil <!--del_lnk--> Anaximander, and later developed by <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, whose works came to be an integral part of alchemy. According to this belief, the universe can be described by a few unified <!--del_lnk--> natural laws that can be determined only through careful, thorough, and exacting philosophical explorations. The third component introduced to hermetical philosophy by the Greeks was <!--del_lnk--> gnosticism, a belief prevalent in the Christian and early post-Christian <!--del_lnk--> Roman empire, that the world is imperfect because it was created in a flawed manner, and that learning about the nature of spiritual matter would lead to salvation. They further believed that <!--del_lnk--> God did not &quot;create&quot; the universe in the classic sense, but that the universe was created &quot;from&quot; him, but was corrupted in the process (rather than becoming corrupted by the transgressions of Adam and Eve, that is, <!--del_lnk--> original sin). Many Gnostic sects further held the Biblical deity to be evil and viewed him as a fallen emanation of the High God whom they sought to worship and unite with, however the aspect of the Abrahamic god as being evil really played no role in alchemy but the aspect of ascending to the high god probably had a great deal of influence. Platonic and neo-Platonic theories about universals and the omnipotence of God were also absorbed (their main beliefs see the physical aspect of the world as being imperfect and think of God as a transcendent cosmic mind).<p>One very important concept introduced at this time, originated by <!--del_lnk--> Empedocles and developed by Aristotle, was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements: <i>earth</i>, <i>air</i>, <i>water</i>, and <i>fire</i>. According to Aristotle, each element had a sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed. <p>The four elements of the Greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter, not quantitative, as our modern elements are. &quot;...True alchemy never regarded earth, air, water, and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the present-day sense of the word. The four elements are simply the primary, and most general, qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form.&quot;  Later alchemists extensively developed the mystical aspects of this concept.<p><a id="Alchemy_in_the_Roman_Empire" name="Alchemy_in_the_Roman_Empire"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Alchemy in the Roman Empire</span></h3>
      <p>The <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a> adopted Greek alchemy and metaphysics, just as they adopted much of Greek knowledge and philosophy. By the end of the <!--del_lnk--> Roman empire the Greek alchemical philosophy had been joined to the philosophies of the Egyptians to create the cult of Hermeticism. <p>However, the development of <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> in the Empire brought a contrary line of thinking, stemming from <a href="../../wp/a/Augustine_of_Hippo.htm" title="Augustine of Hippo">Augustine</a> (354-430 AD), an early Christian philosopher who wrote of his beliefs shortly before the <!--del_lnk--> fall of the Roman Empire. In essence, he felt that <!--del_lnk--> reason and <!--del_lnk--> faith could be used to understand God, but <!--del_lnk--> experimental philosophy was evil: &quot;There is also present in the soul, by means of these same bodily sense, a kind of empty longing and curiosity which aims not at taking pleasure in the flesh but at acquiring experience through the flesh, and this empty curiosity he is dignified by the names of learning and science.&quot; <p>Augustinian ideas were decidedly anti-experimental, yet when Aristotelian experimental techniques were made available to the West they were not shunned. Still, Augustinian thought was well ingrained in <!--del_lnk--> medieval society and was used to show alchemy as being un-Godly.<p>Much of the Roman knowledge of Alchemy, like that of the Greeks and Egyptians, is now lost. In Alexandria, the centre of alchemical studies in the Roman Empire, the art was mainly oral and in the interests of secrecy little was committed to paper. (Whence the use of &quot;hermetic&quot; to mean &quot;secretive&quot;.)  It is possible that some writing was done in Alexandria, and that it was subsequently lost or destroyed in fires and the turbulent periods that followed.<p><a id="Alchemy_in_the_Islamic_world" name="Alchemy_in_the_Islamic_world"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Alchemy in the Islamic world</span></h3>
      <p>After the fall of the Roman Empire, the focus of alchemical development moved to the Islamic World. Much more is known about <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islamic</a> alchemy because it was better documented: indeed, most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as Islamic translations. <p>The Islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy. <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Platonic</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotelian</a> thought, which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science, continued to be assimilated. Islamic alchemists such as <!--del_lnk--> al-Razi (Latin Rasis or Rhazes) and <!--del_lnk--> Jabir ibn Hayyan (Latin Geber) contributed key chemical discoveries of their own, such as the technique of <!--del_lnk--> distillation (the words <i><!--del_lnk--> alembic</i> and <i><a href="../../wp/a/Alcohol.htm" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a></i> are of <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> origin), the muriatic(<a href="../../wp/h/Hydrochloric_acid.htm" title="Hydrochloric acid">hydrochloric</a>), <a href="../../wp/s/Sulfuric_acid.htm" title="Sulfuric acid">sulfuric</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> nitric acids, <!--del_lnk--> soda, <!--del_lnk--> potash, and more. (From the Arabic names of the last two substances, <i>al-natrun</i> and <i>al-qal&#x12B;y</i>, Latinized into <i>Natrium</i> and <i>Kalium</i>, come the modern symbols for <a href="../../wp/s/Sodium.htm" title="Sodium">sodium</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Potassium.htm" title="Potassium">potassium</a>.) The discovery that <!--del_lnk--> aqua regia, a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids, could dissolve the noblest metal; gold, was to fuel the imagination of alchemists for the next millennium.<p>Islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism. The most influential author in this regard was arguably <!--del_lnk--> Jabir Ibn Hayyan (Arabic &#x62C;&#x627;&#x628;&#x631; &#x625;&#x628;&#x646; &#x62D;&#x64A;&#x627;&#x646;, Latin Geberus; usually rendered in English as Geber). Jabir&#39;s ultimate goal was <!--del_lnk--> takwin, the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory, up to and including human life. He analyzed each Aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of <i>hotness</i>, <i>coldness</i>, <i>dryness</i>, and <i>moistness</i>.  According to Geber, in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior. For example, lead was externally cold and dry, while gold was hot and moist. Thus, Jabir theorized, by rearranging the qualities of one metal, a different metal would result.  By this reasoning, the search for the <!--del_lnk--> philosopher&#39;s stone was introduced to Western alchemy. Jabir developed an elaborate <!--del_lnk--> numerology whereby the root letters of a substance&#39;s name in Arabic, when treated with various transformations, held correspondences to the element&#39;s physical properties.<p><a id="Alchemy_in_Medieval_Europe" name="Alchemy_in_Medieval_Europe"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Alchemy in Medieval Europe</span></h3>

      <p>Because of its strong connections to the Greek and Roman cultures, alchemy was rather easily accepted into Christian philosophy, and Medieval European alchemists extensively absorbed Islamic alchemical knowledge. <!--del_lnk--> Gerbert of Aurillac, who was later to become <!--del_lnk--> Pope Silvester II, (d. 1003) was among the first to bring Islamic science to Europe from <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>. Later men such as <!--del_lnk--> Adelard of Bath, who lived in the 12th century, brought additional learning. But until the 13th century the moves were mainly assimilative. <p>In this period there appeared some deviations from the <a href="../../wp/a/Augustine_of_Hippo.htm" title="Augustine of Hippo">Augustinian</a> principles of earlier Christian thinkers. <!--del_lnk--> Saint Anselm (1033&ndash;1109) was a Benedictine who believed faith must precede rationalism, as Augustine and most theologians prior to Anselm had believed, but Anselm put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a Christian context. His views set the stage for the philosophical explosion to occur. <!--del_lnk--> Peter Abelard followed Anselm&#39;s work, laying the foundation for acceptance of Aristotelian thought before the first works of Aristotle reached the West. His major influence on alchemy was his belief that Platonic universals did not have a separate existence outside of man&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> consciousness. Abelard also systematized the analysis of philosophical contradictions. <p><!--del_lnk--> Robert Grosseteste (1170&ndash;1253) was a pioneer of the scientific theory that would later be used and refined by the alchemists. He took Abelard&#39;s methods of analysis and added the use of observations, experimentation, and conclusions in making scientific evaluations. Grosseteste also did much work to bridge Platonic and Aristotelian thinking. <p><!--del_lnk--> Albertus Magnus (1193&ndash;1280) and <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Aquinas.htm" title="Thomas Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a> (1225&ndash;1274) were both <!--del_lnk--> Dominicans who studied Aristotle and worked at reconciling the differences between philosophy and Christianity. Aquinas also did a great deal of work in developing the <!--del_lnk--> scientific method. He even went as far as claiming that universals could be discovered only through <!--del_lnk--> logical reasoning, and, since <!--del_lnk--> reason could not run in opposition to God, reason must be compatible with <!--del_lnk--> theology. . This ran contrary to the commonly held Platonic belief that universals were found through <!--del_lnk--> divine illumination alone. Magnus and Aquinas were among the first to take up the examination of alchemical theory, and could be considered to be alchemists themselves, except that these two did little in the way of <!--del_lnk--> experimentation.<p>The first true alchemist in Medieval Europe was <!--del_lnk--> Roger Bacon. His work did as much for alchemy as <a href="../../wp/r/Robert_Boyle.htm" title="Robert Boyle">Robert Boyle</a>&#39;s was to do for <a href="../../wp/c/Chemistry.htm" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/Galileo_Galilei.htm" title="Galileo Galilei">Galileo&#39;s</a> for <a href="../../wp/a/Astronomy.htm" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physics</a>. Bacon (1214&ndash;1294) was an Oxford <!--del_lnk--> Franciscan who explored <!--del_lnk--> optics and <a href="../../wp/l/Linguistics.htm" title="Linguistics">languages</a> in addition to alchemy. The Franciscan ideals of taking on the world rather than rejecting the world led to his conviction that experimentation was more important than reasoning: &quot;Of the three ways in which men think that they acquire <!--del_lnk--> knowledge of things: authority, <!--del_lnk--> reasoning, and <!--del_lnk--> experience; only the last is effective and able to bring peace to the intellect.&quot; (Bacon p. 367) &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Experimental Science controls the conclusions of all other sciences. It reveals truths which reasoning from <!--del_lnk--> general principles would never have discovered.&quot;  Roger Bacon has also been attributed with originating the search for the philosopher&#39;s stone and the elixir of life: &quot;That medicine which will remove all impurities and corruptibilities from the lesser metals will also, in the opinion of the wise, take off so much of the corruptibility of the body that human life may be prolonged for many centuries.&quot; The idea of <!--del_lnk--> immortality was replaced with the notion of <!--del_lnk--> long life; after all, man&#39;s time on Earth was simply to wait and prepare for immortality in the world of God. Immortality on Earth did not mesh with Christian theology. <p>Bacon was not the only alchemist of the high middle ages, but he was the most significant. His works were used by countless alchemists of the fifteenth through nineteenth centuries. Other alchemists of Bacon&#39;s time shared several traits. First, and most obviously, nearly all were members of the clergy. This was simply because few people outside the parochial schools had the education to examine the Arabic-derived works. Also, alchemy at this time was sanctioned by the church as a good method of exploring and developing theology. Alchemy was interesting to the wide variety of churchmen because it offered a rationalistic view of the universe when men were just beginning to learn about rationalism. <p>So by the end of the thirteenth century, alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief. Adepts believed in the macrocosm-microcosm theories of Hermes, that is to say, they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body (for example, if one could learn the secret of purifying gold, one could use the technique to purify the <!--del_lnk--> human soul). They believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above, and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded <!--del_lnk--> jargon set with traps to mislead the uninitiated. Finally, the alchemists practiced their art: they actively experimented with chemicals and made <!--del_lnk--> observations and <!--del_lnk--> theories about how the universe operated. Their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man&#39;s soul was divided within himself after the fall of Adam. By purifying the two parts of man&#39;s soul, man could be reunited with God. <p>In the fourteenth century, these views underwent a major change. <!--del_lnk--> William of Ockham, an <a href="../../wp/o/Oxford.htm" title="Oxford">Oxford</a> Franciscan who died in 1349, attacked the <!--del_lnk--> Thomist view of compatibility between faith and reason. His view, widely accepted today, was that God must be accepted on faith alone; He could not be limited by human reason. Of course this view was not incorrect if one accepted the postulate of a limitless God versus limited human reasoning capability, but it virtually erased alchemy from practice in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.  <!--del_lnk--> Pope John XXII in the early 1300s issued an edict against alchemy, which effectively removed all church personnel from the practice of the Art.  The climate changes, <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Death.htm" title="Black Death">Black plague</a>, and increase in <a href="../../wp/w/War.htm" title="War">warfare</a> and <a href="../../wp/f/Famine.htm" title="Famine">famine</a> that characterized this century no doubt also served to hamper philosophical pursuits in general.<div class="thumb tright">

      </div>
      <p>Alchemy was kept alive by men such as <!--del_lnk--> Nicolas Flamel, who was noteworthy only because he was one of the few alchemists writing in those troubled times. Flamel lived from 1330 to 1417 and would serve as the <!--del_lnk--> archetype for the next phase of alchemy. He was not a religious scholar as were many of his predecessors, and his entire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the philosopher&#39;s stone, which he is reputed to have found; his work spends a great deal of time describing the processes and reactions, but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations. Most of his work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him, especially as regarded the philosophers&#39; stone. <p>Through the <!--del_lnk--> high middle ages (1300-1500) alchemists were much like Flamel: they concentrated on looking for the philosophers&#39; stone and the elixir of youth, now believed to be separate things. Their cryptic allusions and <!--del_lnk--> symbolism led to wide variations in interpretation of the art. For example, many alchemists during this period interpreted the purification of the soul to mean the <!--del_lnk--> transmutation of lead into gold (in which they believed elemental <a href="../../wp/m/Mercury_%2528element%2529.htm" title="Mercury (element)">mercury</a>, or &#39;quicksilver&#39;, played a crucial role). These men were viewed as <!--del_lnk--> magicians and sorcerers by many, and were often persecuted for their practices. <p>One of these men who emerged at the beginning of the sixteenth century was named <!--del_lnk--> Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa. This alchemist believed himself to be a wizard and was capable of summoning <!--del_lnk--> spirits. His influence was negligible, but like Flamel, he produced writings which were referred to by alchemists of later years. Again like Flamel, he did much to change alchemy from a mystical philosophy to an <!--del_lnk--> occultist magic. He did keep alive the philosophies of the earlier alchemists, including experimental science, numerology, etc., but he added magic theory, which reinforced the idea of alchemy as an occultist belief. In spite of all this, Agrippa still considered himself a Christian, though his views often came into conflict with the church. <p><a id="Alchemy_in_the_Modern_Age_and_Renaissance" name="Alchemy_in_the_Modern_Age_and_Renaissance"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Alchemy in the Modern Age and Renaissance</span></h3>
      <p>European alchemy continued in this way through the dawning of the <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>. The era also saw a flourishing of <!--del_lnk--> con artists who would use chemical tricks and sleight of hand to &quot;demonstrate&quot; the transmutation of common metals into gold, or claim to possess secret knowledge that&mdash;with a &quot;small&quot; initial investment&mdash;would surely lead to that goal.<p>The most important name in this period is Philippus Aureolus <!--del_lnk--> Paracelsus, (Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, 1493&ndash;1541) who cast alchemy into a new form, rejecting some of the occultism that had accumulated over the years and promoting the use of observations and experiments to learn about the human body. He rejected Gnostic traditions, but kept much of the Hermetical, neo-Platonic, and Pythagorean philosophies; however, Hermetical science had so much Aristotelian theory that his rejection of Gnosticism was practically meaningless. In particular, Paracelsus rejected the magic theories of Agrippa and Flamel. He did not think of himself as a magician, and scorned those who did. (Williams p.239-45)<p>Paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine, and wrote &quot;Many have said of Alchemy, that it is for the making of gold and silver. For me such is not the aim, but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines.&quot;  His hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man the microcosm and Nature the macrocosm. He took an approach different from those before him, using this analogy not in the manner of soul-purification but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies, and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them.  While his attempts of treating diseases with such remedies as Mercury might seem ill-advised from a modern point of view, his basic idea of chemically produced medicines has stood time surprisingly well.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>In <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, the topic of alchemy in that time frame is often associated with Doctor <a href="../../wp/j/John_Dee.htm" title="John Dee">John Dee</a> (<!--del_lnk--> 13 July <!--del_lnk--> 1527 &ndash; December, 1608), better known for his role as <!--del_lnk--> astrologer, cryptographer, and general &quot;scientific consultant&quot; to <a href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_I_of_England.htm" title="Elizabeth I of England">Queen Elizabeth I</a>. Dee was considered an authority on the works of <!--del_lnk--> Roger Bacon, and was interested enough in alchemy to write a book on that subject (<i>Monas Hieroglyphica</i>, 1564) influenced by the <!--del_lnk--> Kabbala. Dee&#39;s associate <!--del_lnk--> Edward Kelley &mdash; who claimed to converse with <!--del_lnk--> angels through a crystal ball and to own a powder that would turn <a href="../../wp/m/Mercury_%2528element%2529.htm" title="Mercury (element)">mercury</a> into <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a> &mdash; may have been the source of the popular image of the alchemist-charlatan.<p>Another lesser known alchemist was <!--del_lnk--> Michael Sendivogius (<i>Micha&#x142; S&#x119;dziw&oacute;j</i>, 1566 - 1636), a <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Polish</a> alchemist, philosopher, medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry. According to some accounts, he distilled <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> in a lab sometime around 1600, 170 years before <!--del_lnk--> Scheele and <!--del_lnk--> Priestley, by warming nitre (<a href="../../wp/p/Potassium_nitrate.htm" title="Saltpetre">saltpetre</a>). He thought of the gas given off as &quot;the elixir of life&quot;. Shortly after discovering this method, it is believed that Sendivogious taught his technique to <!--del_lnk--> Cornelius Drebbel.

      <p>The demise of Western alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for &quot;ancient wisdom&quot;. Although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the 17th century, alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years, and in fact may have reached its <!--del_lnk--> apogee in the 18th century.<p><a href="../../wp/r/Robert_Boyle.htm" title="Robert Boyle">Robert Boyle</a> (1627&ndash;1691), better known for his studies of gases (cf. <!--del_lnk--> Boyle&#39;s law) pioneered the scientific method in chemical investigations. He assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data; in a typical experiment, Boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out, the wind characteristics, the position of the Sun and Moon, and the barometer reading, all just in case they proved to be relevant.  This approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the 18th and 19th centuries, based on revolutionary discoveries of <a href="../../wp/a/Antoine_Lavoisier.htm" title="Antoine Lavoisier">Lavoisier</a> and <!--del_lnk--> John Dalton &mdash; which finally provided a logical, quantitative and reliable framework for understanding matter transmutations, and revealed the futility of longstanding alchemical goals such as the philosopher&#39;s stone.<p>Meanwhile, Paracelsian alchemy led to the development of modern medicine. Experimentalists gradually uncovered the workings of the human body, such as blood circulation (<a href="../../wp/w/William_Harvey.htm" title="William Harvey">Harvey</a>, 1616), and eventually traced many diseases to infections with germs (<!--del_lnk--> Koch and <a href="../../wp/l/Louis_Pasteur.htm" title="Louis Pasteur">Pasteur</a>, 19th century) or lack of <i>natural</i> nutrients and <a href="../../wp/v/Vitamin.htm" title="Vitamin">vitamins</a> (<!--del_lnk--> Lind, <!--del_lnk--> Eijkman, <!--del_lnk--> Funk, et al.). Supported by parallel developments in organic chemistry, the new science easily displaced alchemy from its medical roles, interpretive and prescriptive, while deflating its hopes of miraculous elixirs and exposing the ineffectiveness or even toxicity of its remedies.<p>Thus, as science steadily continued to uncover and rationalize the clockwork of the universe, founded on its own materialistic metaphysics, Alchemy was left deprived of its chemical and medical connections &mdash; but still incurably burdened by them. Reduced to an arcane philosophical system, poorly connected to the material world, it suffered the common fate of other <!--del_lnk--> esoteric disciplines such as <a href="../../wp/a/Astrology.htm" title="Astrology">astrology</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Kabbalah: excluded from <a href="../../wp/u/University.htm" title="University">university</a> curricula, shunned by its former patrons, <!--del_lnk--> ostracized by scientists, and commonly viewed as the epitome of <!--del_lnk--> charlatanism and <!--del_lnk--> superstition. Rosencrutzians and freemasons have, however, always been interested in alchemy and its symbolism. A large collection of books on alchemy is kept in the <!--del_lnk--> Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica in Amsterdam.<p>These developments could be interpreted as part of a broader reaction in European intellectualism against the <a href="../../wp/r/Romanticism.htm" title="Romanticism">Romantic</a> movement of the preceding century.<p><a id="Alchemy_in_the_Bah.C3.A1.27.C3.AD_Faith" name="Alchemy_in_the_Bah.C3.A1.27.C3.AD_Faith"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Alchemy in the Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; Faith</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h, founder of the <a href="../../wp/b/Bah%25C3%25A1%2527%25C3%25AD_Faith.htm" title="Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; Faith">Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; Faith</a>, promised the realisation of the discovery of a radical approach to the transmutation of elements as one of the signs of the coming of age of humanity. He prophesied, as well, that after this discovery a great calamity would overcome the world, unless mankind would accept his Faith. Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h also refers to the elixir and the philosopher&#39;s stone, but states that these are spiritual in nature, and refer to the <!--del_lnk--> Word of God.<p><a id="Modern_alchemy" name="Modern_alchemy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Modern alchemy</span></h2>
      <p>In modern times, progress has been made toward achieving the goals of alchemy using different means than those of traditional alchemy. These developments may on occasion be called &quot;alchemy&quot; for rhetorical reasons.<p>As of 2006, a universal panacea remains elusive, though <!--del_lnk--> futurists such as <!--del_lnk--> Ray Kurzweil believe sufficiently advanced <!--del_lnk--> nanotechnology may prolong life indefinitely. Some say the third goal of alchemy has been fulfilled by <!--del_lnk--> IVF and the <!--del_lnk--> cloning of a human embryo, although these technologies fall far short of creating a human life from scratch.<p>The aim of <!--del_lnk--> artificial intelligence research could be said to be creating a life from scratch, and those philosophically opposed to the possibility of AI have compared it with alchemy, such as Herbert and Stuart Dreyfus in their 1960 paper <i>Alchemy and AI</i>. However, because the specific aim of alchemy is human transmutation rather than creating life from scratch, genetic research, particularly splicing would be closer to this goal.<p><a id="Nuclear_transmutation" name="Nuclear_transmutation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Nuclear transmutation</span></h3>
      <p>In 1919, <a href="../../wp/e/Ernest_Rutherford.htm" title="Ernest Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a> used <!--del_lnk--> artificial disintegration to convert nitrogen into oxygen. This process or transmutation has subsequently been carried out on a <!--del_lnk--> commercial scale by bombarding atomic nuclei with high energy particles from modern <!--del_lnk--> particle accelerators and in <!--del_lnk--> nuclear reactors. Indeed, in 1980, <!--del_lnk--> Glenn Seaborg transmuted lead into gold, though the amount of energy used and the microscopic quantities created negated any possible financial benefit.<p><a id="Unduplicated_transmutation_claims" name="Unduplicated_transmutation_claims"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Unduplicated transmutation claims</span></h3>
      <p>In 1964, <!--del_lnk--> George Ohsawa and <!--del_lnk--> Michio Kushi, based on the claims of <!--del_lnk--> Corentin Louis Kervran, reportedly successfully transmutated <a href="../../wp/s/Sodium.htm" title="Sodium">sodium</a> into <a href="../../wp/p/Potassium.htm" title="Potassium">potassium</a>, by use of an electric arc, and later of <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon.htm" title="Carbon">carbon</a> and <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> into <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a>. In 1994, <!--del_lnk--> R. Sundaresan and <!--del_lnk--> J. Bockris reported that they had observed fusion reactions in electrical discharges between carbon rods immersed in water. However, none of these claims have been replicated by other scientists, and the idea is now thoroughly discredited.<p><a id="Psychology" name="Psychology"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Psychology</span></h3>
      <p><a href="../../wp/c/Carl_Jung.htm" title="Carl Jung">Carl Jung</a> saw alchemy as a Western proto-psychology dedicated to the achievement of <!--del_lnk--> individuation; in his interpretation, alchemy was the vessel by which <!--del_lnk--> Gnosticism survived its various purges into the <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>. In this sense, Jung viewed alchemy as comparable to a <!--del_lnk--> Yoga of the <!--del_lnk--> West. Jung also interpreted Chinese alchemical texts in terms of his <!--del_lnk--> analytical psychology as means to individuation.<p><a id="Alchemy_in_art_and_entertainment" name="Alchemy_in_art_and_entertainment"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Alchemy in art and entertainment</span></h2>
