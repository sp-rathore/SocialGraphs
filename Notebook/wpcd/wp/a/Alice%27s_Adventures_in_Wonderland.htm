      <p><i><b>Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland</b></i> is a work of <!--del_lnk--> children&#39;s literature by the <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a> mathematician and author, Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, written under the pseudonym <!--del_lnk--> Lewis Carroll. It tells the story of a girl named Alice who falls down a rabbit-hole into a <!--del_lnk--> fantasy realm populated by talking playing cards and <!--del_lnk--> anthropomorphic creatures.<p>The tale is fraught with <!--del_lnk--> satirical allusions to Dodgson&#39;s friends and to the lessons that British schoolchildren were expected to memorize. The Wonderland described in the tale plays with <a href="../../wp/l/Logic.htm" title="Logic">logic</a> in ways that has made the story of lasting popularity with children as well as adults.<p>The book is often referred to by the abbreviated title <i><b>Alice in Wonderland</b></i>. This alternate title was popularized by the numerous film and television adaptations of the story produced over the years. Some printings of this title contain both <i>Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland</i> and its sequel <i><!--del_lnk--> Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There</i>.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p><i>Alice</i> was first published on <!--del_lnk--> 4 July <!--del_lnk--> 1865, exactly three years after the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson and the Reverend <!--del_lnk--> Robinson Duckworth rowed in a boat up the <a href="../../wp/r/River_Thames.htm" title="River Thames">River Thames</a> with three little girls:<ul>
       <li>Lorina Charlotte Liddell (aged 13) (&quot;Prima&quot; in the book&#39;s prefatory verse)<li><!--del_lnk--> Alice Pleasance Liddell (aged 10) (&quot;Secunda&quot; in the prefatory verse)<li>Edith Mary Liddell (aged 8) (&quot;Tertia&quot; in the prefatory verse)</ul>
      <p>The journey had started at <!--del_lnk--> Folly Bridge near <a href="../../wp/o/Oxford.htm" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>, England and ended five miles away in a village of Godstow. To while away time the Reverend Dodgson told the girls a story that, not so coincidentally, featured a bored little girl named Alice who goes looking for an adventure.<p>The girls loved it, and Alice Liddell asked Dodgson to write it down for her. He eventually did so and on <!--del_lnk--> 26 November <!--del_lnk--> 1864 gave Alice the manuscript of <i>Alice&#39;s Adventures Under Ground</i>. Some, including Martin Gardner, speculate there was an earlier version that was destroyed later by Dodgson himself when he printed a more elaborate copy by hand (Gardner, 1965), but there is no real evidence to support this.<p>According to Dodgson&#39;s diaries, in the spring of 1863 he gave the unfinished manuscript of <i>Alice&#39;s Adventures Under Ground</i> to his friend and mentor <!--del_lnk--> George MacDonald, whose children loved it. On MacDonald&#39;s advice, Dodgson decided to submit <i>Alice</i> for publication. Before he had even finished the MS for Alice Liddell he was already expanding the 18,000-word original to 35,000 words, most notably adding the episodes about the Cheshire Cat and the Mad Tea-Party. In 1865, Dodgson&#39;s tale was published as <i>Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland</i> by &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Lewis Carroll&quot; with illustrations by <!--del_lnk--> John Tenniel. The first print run of 2,000 was shelved because Tenniel had objections over the print quality; a new edition, released in December of the same year but carrying an 1866 date, was quickly printed.<p>The entire print run sold out quickly. <i>Alice</i> was a publishing sensation, beloved by children and adults alike. Among its first avid readers were young <!--del_lnk--> Oscar Wilde and <a href="../../wp/v/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a>. The book has never been out of print since. <i>Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland</i> has been translated into over 50 languages, including <a href="../../wp/e/Esperanto.htm" title="Esperanto">Esperanto</a>. There have now been over a hundred editions of the book, as well as countless adaptations in other media, especially theatre and film (see below).<p><a id="Publishing_highlights" name="Publishing_highlights"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Publishing highlights</span></h3>

      <p>A girl named <!--del_lnk--> Alice is bored while on a picnic with her older sister. She finds interest in a passing <!--del_lnk--> white rabbit, dressed in a waistcoat and muttering &quot;I&#39;m late!&quot;, whom she follows down a rabbit-hole, floating down into a dream underworld. As she attempts to follow the rabbit, she has several adventures. She grows to gigantic size and shrinks to a fraction of her original height; meets a group of small animals stranded in a sea of her own previously shed tears; gets trapped in the rabbit&#39;s house when she enlarges herself again; meets a baby which changes into a pig, and a cat which disappears leaving only his smile behind; goes to a never-ending <!--del_lnk--> tea party; goes to the shore and meets a <!--del_lnk--> Gryphon and a <!--del_lnk--> Mock Turtle; and attends the trial of the Knave of Hearts, who has been accused of stealing tarts. Eventually Alice wakes up back with her sister.<p><a id="Major_themes" name="Major_themes"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Major themes</span></h3>

      <p>The members of the boating party that first heard Carroll&#39;s tale all show up in Chapter 3 (&quot;A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale&quot;) in one form or another. There is, of course, Alice herself, while Carroll, or Charles Dodgson, is caricatured as the Dodo. The Duck refers to Rev. Robinson Duckworth, the Lory to Lorina Liddell, and the Eaglet to Edith Liddell.<p>Bill the Lizard may be a play on the name of <a href="../../wp/b/Benjamin_Disraeli%252C_1st_Earl_of_Beaconsfield.htm" title="Benjamin Disraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a>. One of Tenniel&#39;s illustrations in <i>Through the Looking Glass</i> depicts a caricature of Disraeli, wearing a paper hat, as a passenger on a train. The illustrations of the Lion and the Unicorn also bear a striking resemblance to Tenniel&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Punch</i> illustrations of <a href="../../wp/w/William_Ewart_Gladstone.htm" title="William Ewart Gladstone">Gladstone</a> and Disraeli.<p>The Hatter is most likely a reference to Theophilus Carter, a furniture dealer known in <a href="../../wp/o/Oxford.htm" title="Oxford">Oxford</a> for his unorthodox inventions. Tenniel apparently drew the Hatter to resemble Carter, on a suggestion of Carroll&#39;s.<p>The Dormouse tells a story about three little sisters named Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie. These are the Liddell sisters: Elsie is L.C. (Lorina Charlotte), Tillie is Edith (her family nickname is Matilda), and Lacie is an <!--del_lnk--> anagram of Alice.<p>The Mock Turtle speaks of a Drawling-master, &quot;an old conger eel,&quot; that used to come once a week to teach &quot;Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.&quot; This is a reference to the art critic <!--del_lnk--> John Ruskin, who came once a week to the Liddell house to teach the children <i>drawing</i>, <i>sketching</i>, and <i>painting in oils</i>. (The children did, in fact, learn well; Alice Liddell, for one, produced a number of skilled watercolours.)<p>The Mock Turtle also sings &quot;Turtle Soup.&quot; This is a parody of a song called &quot;Star of the Evening, Beautiful Star,&quot; which was performed as a trio by Lorina, Alice and Edith Liddell for Lewis Carroll in the Liddell home during the same summer in which he first told the story of Alice&#39;s Adventures Under Ground (source: the diary of Lewis Carroll, August 1, 1862 entry).<p>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> John Tenniel&#39;s illustrations of Alice do not portray the real Alice Liddell, who had dark hair and a short fringe.

      <p>The term &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Wonderland,&quot; from the title, has entered the language and refers to a marvellous imaginary place, or else a real-world place that one sees as &quot;like a dream come true!&quot; It is widely referenced in popular culture&mdash; books and film (see below) and pop music. To note just one example, there is a book by the <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japanese</a> novelist <!--del_lnk--> Haruki Murakami entitled <i><!--del_lnk--> Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</i>.<p>&quot;Down the Rabbit-Hole,&quot; the Chapter 1 title, has become a popular term for going into an adventure to the unknown. In the film <i><!--del_lnk--> The Matrix</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Morpheus says to <!--del_lnk--> Neo: &quot;I imagine that right now you&#39;re feeling a bit like Alice. Tumbling down the rabbit hole?&quot; He also says, &quot;You take the red pill and you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.&quot; In <!--del_lnk--> computer gaming, a &quot;rabbit hole&quot; may refer to the initiating element that drives the player to enter the game.<p>In an <!--del_lnk--> Alternate Reality Game, the rabbit hole is the first puzzle, or first event signaling the beginning.<p>A &quot;<!--del_lnk--> white rabbit&quot; has similar connotations, as a signal to the start of an adventure. In <i>The Matrix</i>, Neo&#39;s adventure begins after a message on his computer urges him to &quot;Follow the white rabbit.&quot;<p>In Chapter 6, the Cheshire Cat&#39;s disappearance prompts Alice to say one of her most memorable lines: &quot;...a grin without a cat! It&#39;s the most curious thing I ever saw in all my life!&quot; There is a <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> film called <i><!--del_lnk--> A Grin Without a Cat</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1977), directed by <!--del_lnk--> Chris Marker.<p>In Chapter 7, the Hatter gives his famous <!--del_lnk--> riddle without an answer: &quot;Why is a <a href="../../wp/r/Raven.htm" title="Raven">raven</a> like a writing desk?&quot; Although Carroll intended the riddle to have no solution, in a new preface to the 1896 edition of <i>Alice</i>, he proposes several answers: &quot;Because it can produce a few notes, tho they are very flat; and it is nevar put with the wrong end in front!&quot; Note the spelling of &quot;never&quot; as &quot;nevar&quot;&mdash;turning it into &quot;raven&quot; when inverted. This spelling, however, was &quot;corrected&quot; in later editions to &quot;never&quot; and Carroll&#39;s pun was lost. Puzzle maven <!--del_lnk--> Sam Loyd offered these solutions: because the notes for which they are noted are not noted for being musical notes; <a href="../../wp/e/Edgar_Allan_Poe.htm" title="Edgar Allan Poe">Poe</a> wrote on both; bills and tales are among their characteristics; because they both stand on their legs, conceal their steels (steals), and ought to be made to shut up. Many other answers are listed in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Annotated Alice</i>.<p>Arguably the most famous quote is used when the Queen of Hearts screams &quot;Off with her head!&quot; at Alice (and everyone else she feels slightly annoyed with). Possibly Carroll here was echoing a scene in <a href="../../wp/w/William_Shakespeare.htm" title="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>&#39;s <i><a href="../../wp/r/Richard_III_%2528play%2529.htm" title="Richard III (play)">Richard III</a></i> (III, iv, 76) where Richard demands the execution of <!--del_lnk--> Lord Hastings, crying &quot;Off with his head!&quot;<p><a id="Cinematic_adaptations" name="Cinematic_adaptations"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Cinematic adaptations</span></h2>

       <li><!--del_lnk--> Disney&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Alice in Wonderland</i> animated feature, released in 1951, remains the most popular cinematic adaptation of the Alice books. It popularized the iconic image of Alice as a pretty blonde little girl in a white <!--del_lnk--> pinafore and blue dress. Other characters made icons by the film include the Cheshire Cat, the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, and the Caterpillar. The character designs owe much to the original Tenniel illustrations. The Disney feature combines story elements from both Alice books. It is notable for its distinctly psychedelic visual feel.</ul>

      <p>The book, although broadly and continually received in a positive light, has also caught a large amount of derision for its strange and random tone (which is also the reason so many others like it). One of the best-known critics is fantasy writer <!--del_lnk--> Terry Pratchett, who has openly stated that he dislikes the book <!--del_lnk--> .<p>The book was <!--del_lnk--> banned in China in 1931 because the talking animals were considered blasphemous to Chinese beliefs.<p><a id="Genre:_fantasy_or_horror.3F" name="Genre:_fantasy_or_horror.3F"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Genre: fantasy or horror?</span></h3>

       <dd>&quot;Children are put off by Alice&rsquo;s underground adventures not because they cannot understand them; in fact, they frequently understand them too well. Indeed they often find the book a terrifying experience, rarely relieved by the comic spirit they can clearly perceive.&quot;<br /> &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> Donald Rackin, <i>Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass Nonsense, Sense, and Meaning</i></dl>
      <p>The most common perspective on <i>Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland</i> is that it is a whimsical <!--del_lnk--> fantasy. However, there is disagreement with this perspective. To a number of people, the book does not characterize whim and fantasy, but rather <!--del_lnk--> horror and self-sustaining <!--del_lnk--> Kafkaesque <!--del_lnk--> insanity. The <!--del_lnk--> comedy of the book, while clearly visible, does not mitigate the fact, but rather causes it to stand out by perverse contrast.<p>Taken from this perspective, the novel (as well as <i><!--del_lnk--> Through the Looking-Glass</i>) is a sinister, pernicious world characterized by persons who exist fully by a self-sustaining logic that exists without reference to outside influence, including the influence of a sane, rational, and moral mind. By this perspective, at its essence, <i>Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland</i> is not a dream but a surreal nightmare involving loss of control, inability to communicate or <!--del_lnk--> reason, rampant uncontrolled change of one&#39;s self and everything around, and a total inability to gain any foundation in the world. Some scholars have pointed out, however, that many of these &#39;nightmarish&#39; incidents and feelings notably resemble the confusion and lack of control a young child experiences at the hands of adults (well-meaning or not).<p>It is noteworthy that in both novels, people suffer for no reason. The White Rabbit has an air of deposed aristocracy, the <!--del_lnk--> Queen of Hearts orders executions for no reason other than her own irritation and enjoyment, the <!--del_lnk--> Hatter exists in a never ending tea party because he got in a fight with Time and it imprisoned him in six o&#39;clock, etc. Many of these are parables for the society of the time. For instance, from <i>Through the Looking-Glass</i>, the parable of <i><!--del_lnk--> The Walrus and the Carpenter</i> appears to be a parable about the treatment of children and child-labor.<p>Thus, the very thing that produces appeal and wonder in the book for many people terrifies others. It is a world that exists in different cells, each with internally consistent rules that don&#39;t conform to any of the others, each continuing on its way with anything running from apathy to malice, and each able to persist in its state indefinitely. From a child&#39;s perspective, if one were to fall down a rabbit hole today one could easily encounter the very same terrifying Wonderland Alice did, changed in only the most vestigial of ways.<p><!--del_lnk--> American McGee, a video and computer <!--del_lnk--> game designer, released in the year 2000 a horror game entitled <!--del_lnk--> American McGee&#39;s Alice. In an interview, American McGee defended his dark interpretation of the novels, claiming that <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> is a very dark tale to begin with.<p><a id="Works_influenced" name="Works_influenced"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Works influenced</span></h2>

      <p>Alice and the rest of Wonderland continue to inspire or influence many other works of art to this day&mdash;sometimes indirectly; via the <!--del_lnk--> Disney movie, for example. The character of the plucky yet proper Alice has proven immensely popular and inspired similar heroines in literature and pop culture, many also named Alice in homage. it has also influenced many Japanese manga comics, most notable Miyuki-Chan in Wonderland, by CLAMP.<p><a id="Culture_and_collecting" name="Culture_and_collecting"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Culture and collecting</span></h2>
