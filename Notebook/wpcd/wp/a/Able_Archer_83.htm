      <p><b>Able Archer 83</b> was a ten-day <a href="../../wp/n/NATO.htm" title="NATO">NATO</a> <!--del_lnk--> exercise starting on <!--del_lnk--> November 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1983 that spanned the continent of Europe and simulated a coordinated <!--del_lnk--> nuclear release. It incorporated a new, unique format of coded communication, <!--del_lnk--> radio silences, participation by heads of state, and a simulated <!--del_lnk--> DEFCON 1 nuclear alert. The realistic nature of the exercise, coupled with deteriorating relations between the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> and the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> and the anticipated arrival of &quot;super-stealth&quot; <!--del_lnk--> Pershing II nuclear missiles in Europe, led some in the USSR to believe that Able Archer 83 was a genuine nuclear strike. In response, the Soviets readied their nuclear forces and placed air units in <!--del_lnk--> East Germany and <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Poland</a> on alert. This relatively obscure incident is considered by many historians to be the closest the world has come to <!--del_lnk--> nuclear war since the <!--del_lnk--> Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. The immediate threat of nuclear war abruptly ended with the conclusion of the Able Archer 83 exercise on <!--del_lnk--> November 11.<p>

      <p>The event that served as the single greatest catalyst to the Able Archer war scare occurred more than two years earlier, during a May 1981 closed-session meeting of <!--del_lnk--> KGB officers. At this meeting, <!--del_lnk--> General Secretary <!--del_lnk--> Leonid Brezhnev and KGB chairman <!--del_lnk--> Yuri Andropov bluntly announced that the United States was preparing a secret nuclear attack on the USSR. To combat this threat, Andropov announced, the KGB and <!--del_lnk--> GRU would begin <!--del_lnk--> Operation RYAN. RYAN (&#x420;&#x42F;&#x41D;) was a Russian acronym for &quot;Nuclear Missile Attack&quot; (&#x420;&#x430;&#x43A;&#x435;&#x442;&#x43D;&#x43E;&#x435; &#x42F;&#x434;&#x435;&#x440;&#x43D;&#x43E;&#x435; &#x41D;&#x430;&#x43F;&#x430;&#x434;&#x435;&#x43D;&#x438;&#x435;). Operation RYAN was the largest, most comprehensive peacetime <!--del_lnk--> intelligence gathering operation in Soviet history. Agents abroad were charged with monitoring the figures who would decide to launch a nuclear attack, the service and technical personnel who would implement the attack, and the facilities from which the attack would originate. In all probability, the unlikely goal of Operation RYAN was to discover the first <i>intent</i> of a nuclear attack and prevent it.<div class="thumb tleft">

      </div>
      <p>The impetus for the implementation of Operation RYAN is still largely unknown. <!--del_lnk--> Oleg Gordievsky, the highest-ranking KGB official ever to defect, suspected that it was born of the increased &quot;Soviet Paranoia&quot; coupled with &quot;Reaganite Rhetoric&quot;. Gordievsky conjectured that Brezhnev and Andropov, who &quot;were very, very old-fashioned and easily influenced ... by Communist dogmas,&quot; truly believed that an antagonistic Reagan would push the nuclear button and relegate the Soviet Union to the &quot;ash-heap of history&quot;. CIA historian <!--del_lnk--> Benjamin B. Fischer lists several concrete occurrences that likely led to the birth of RYAN. The first of these was the use of psychological operations or <!--del_lnk--> PSYOP that began soon after <a href="../../wp/p/President_of_the_United_States.htm" title="President of the United States">President</a> <a href="../../wp/r/Ronald_Reagan.htm" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> took office.<p><a id="PSYOP" name="PSYOP"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">PSYOP</span></h3>

American bombers also flew directly towards Soviet <!--del_lnk--> airspace, peeling off at the last moment, occasionally several times per week. These penetrations were designed to test Soviet radar vulnerability as well as demonstrate US capabilities in a nuclear war.<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>In contrast to the extremely secretive PSYOPs against the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union&#39;s attack on the <!--del_lnk--> Korean civilian airliner <!--del_lnk--> KAL 007, on September 1, 1983, brought relations between the two <!--del_lnk--> superpowers to a very public new low. In addition to illustrating the historically antagonistic relations between the USA and USSR in the early 1980s, the Soviet attack on KAL 007 lends several insights into Able Archer 83. First, the Soviet Union (perhaps due to PSYOP penetrations) guarded its territorial airspace strongly. Second, Soviet satellite systems were ineffective; they could not differentiate between a civilian and military aircraft, nor detect and prevent an American nuclear strike. Finally, the disaster demonstrated the hair-trigger mindset held by many in the Soviet Union. Reagan assessed in his memoirs, &quot;If, as some people speculated, the Soviet pilots simply mistook the airliner for a military plane, what kind of imagination did it take to think of a Soviet military man with his finger close to a nuclear push button making an even more tragic mistake?&quot;<p><a id="Weapons_buildup" name="Weapons_buildup"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Weapons buildup</span></h3>
      <p>On March 23, 1983, Reagan proposed the <!--del_lnk--> Strategic Defense Initiative, labeled by the media and critics as &quot;Star Wars&quot;. While Reagan viewed the initiative as a safety net against nuclear war, leaders in the Soviet Union viewed it as a definitive departure from the relative weapons parity of <!--del_lnk--> Detente and an <!--del_lnk--> escalation of the arms race into space. General Secretary Andropov lambasted Reagan for &quot;inventing new plans on how to unleash a nuclear war in the best way, with the hope of winning it.&quot;<div class="thumb tright">
       <div style="width:182px;"><a class="internal" href="../../images/231/23110.jpg.htm" title="The US Pershing II Missile"><img alt="The US Pershing II Missile" height="250" longdesc="/wiki/Image:Pershing_II.jpg" src="../../images/231/23110.jpg" width="180" /></a><div class="thumbcaption">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Despite the enormous Soviet outcry over the &quot;Star Wars&quot; program, the weapons plan that generated the most danger during Able Archer 83 was the 1979 NATO approval and subsequent deployment of intermediate-range <!--del_lnk--> Pershing II missiles in Western Europe. These missiles, deployed to counter Soviet <!--del_lnk--> SS-20 intermediate-range missiles on its own western border, represented a major threat to the Soviets. The Pershing II was capable of destroying Soviet &quot;hard targets&quot; such as underground missile silos and command and control bunkers. The missiles also possessed &quot;super sudden first strike capability&quot;; it was estimated that the missiles (deployed in <!--del_lnk--> West Germany) could reach targets in the Soviet Union within four to six minutes of their launch. These capabilities led Soviet leaders to believe that the only way to survive a Pershing II strike was to preempt it. This fear of an undetected Pershing II attack, according to CIA historian Benjamin B. Fischer, was explicitly linked to the mandate of Operation RYAN: to detect a decision by the United States to launch a nuclear attack and (it must be believed) to preempt it.<p><a id="Exercise_Able_Archer_83" name="Exercise_Able_Archer_83"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Exercise Able Archer 83</span></h2>
      <p>Thus, on 2 November 1983, as Soviet intelligence services were attempting to detect the signs of a nuclear strike, NATO began to simulate one. The exercise, codenamed Able Archer, spanned Europe and simulated European command and communications procedures during a nuclear war. It probably emulated the Pentagon&rsquo;s <!--del_lnk--> Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP), which, at the time, named 25,000 military targets, 15,000 industrial targets, and 500 targets associated with Soviet leadership. Some Soviet leadership, because of the preceding world events and the exercise&rsquo;s particularly realistic nature, believed &mdash; in accordance with Soviet military doctrine &mdash; that the exercise may have been a cover for an actual attack. Indeed, a KGB telegram of <!--del_lnk--> 17 February described one likely scenario as such:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> 17 February <!--del_lnk--> 1983 KGB Permanent Operational Assignment assigned its agents to monitor several possible indicators of a nuclear attack. These included actions by &quot;A cadre of people associated with preparing and implementing decision about RYAN, and also a group of people, including service and technical personnel ... those working in the operating services of installations connected with processing and implementing the decision about RYAN, and communication staff involved in the operation and interaction of these installations.&quot;<p>Because Able Archer 83 simulated an actual release, it is likely that the service and technical personnel mentioned in the memo were active in the exercise. More conspicuously, <!--del_lnk--> British Prime Minister <a href="../../wp/m/Margaret_Thatcher.htm" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> and <!--del_lnk--> German Chancellor <!--del_lnk--> Helmut Kohl participated (though not concurrently) in the nuclear drill. President Reagan, <!--del_lnk--> Vice President <!--del_lnk--> George H.W. Bush, and <!--del_lnk--> Secretary of Defense <!--del_lnk--> Casper Weinberger were also intended to participate. Fortunately, <!--del_lnk--> Robert McFarlane, who had assumed the position of <!--del_lnk--> National Security Advisor just two weeks earlier, realized the implications of such participation early in the exercise&rsquo;s planning and rejected it.<p>Another illusory indicator likely noticed by Soviet analysts was an influx of <!--del_lnk--> ciphered communications between Great Britain and the United States. Soviet intelligence was informed that &quot;so-called nuclear consultations in NATO are probably one of the stages of immediate preparation by the adversary for RYAN.&quot; To the Soviet analysts, this burst of secret communications between the United States and Great Britain one month before the beginning of Able Archer may have appeared to be this &quot;consultation&quot;. In reality, the burst of communication regarded the US <a href="../../wp/i/Invasion_of_Grenada.htm" title="Invasion of Grenada">invasion of Grenada</a>, which caused a great deal of diplomatic traffic as the nominal sovereign of the island was <a href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a>.<p>A further startling aspect reported by KGB agents regarded the NATO communications used during the exercise.

      <p>Soviet Intelligence appeared to substantiate these suspicions by reporting that NATO was, indeed, using unique, never-before-seen procedures as well as message formats more sophisticated than previous exercises that possibly indicated the proximity of nuclear attack.<p>Finally, during Able Archer 83 NATO forces simulated a move through all alert phases, from <!--del_lnk--> DEFCON 5 to DEFCON 1. While these phases were simulated, alarmist KGB agents mistakenly reported them as actual. According to Soviet intelligence, NATO doctrine stated, &quot;<i>Operational readiness No 1</i> is declared when there are obvious indications of preparation to begin military operations. It is considered that war is inevitable and may start at any moment.&quot;<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Upon learning that US nuclear activity mirrored its hypothesized first strike activity, the Moscow Centre sent its residencies a flash <!--del_lnk--> telegram on November 8 or 9 (Oleg Gordievsky cannot recall which), incorrectly reporting an alert on American bases and frantically asking for further information regarding an American first strike. The alert precisely coincided with the seven- to ten-day period estimated between NATO&rsquo;s preliminary decision and an actual strike. This was the peak of the War Scare.<p>The Soviet Union, believing its only chance of surviving a NATO strike was to preempt it, readied its nuclear arsenal. The CIA reported activity in the Baltic Military District in Czechoslovakia, and it determined that nuclear capable aircraft in Poland and Germany were placed &quot;on high alert status with readying of nuclear strike forces&quot;. Former CIA analyst Peter Vincent Pry went further, saying he suspects that the aircraft were merely the tip of the iceberg. He hypothesizes that &mdash; in accordance with Soviet military procedure and history &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> ICBM silos, easily readied and difficult for the United States to detect, were also prepared for a launch.<p>Soviet fears of the attack ended as the Able Archer exercise finished on 11 November. Upon learning of the Soviet reaction to Able Archer 83 by way of the <!--del_lnk--> double agent Oleg Gordievsky, a British <!--del_lnk--> MI6 asset, President Reagan commented, &quot;I don&rsquo;t see how they could believe that &mdash; but it&rsquo;s something to think about.&quot;<p><a id="Soviet_reaction" name="Soviet_reaction"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Soviet reaction</span></h2>

      <p>The double agent <!--del_lnk--> Oleg Gordievsky, whose highest rank was KGB resident in London, is the only Soviet source ever to have published an account of Able Archer 83. <!--del_lnk--> Oleg Kalugin and <!--del_lnk--> Yuri Shvets, who were KGB agents in 1983, have published accounts that acknowledge Operation RYAN, but they do not mention Able Archer 83. It is important to note that Gordievsky and other <!--del_lnk--> Warsaw Pact intelligence agents were extremely skeptical of a NATO first strike, perhaps because of their proximity and understanding of the West. Still, agents reported what they were ordered to observe, not their estimations of what their observations meant. This critical flaw in the Soviet intelligence system &mdash; coined by Gordievsky as the &quot;intelligence cycle&quot; &mdash; fed the fear of US nuclear aggression.<p>No Soviet political figure has publicly acknowledged Able Archer 83. Marshal <!--del_lnk--> Sergei Akhromeyev, who at the time was Chief of the main operations directorate of the Soviet General Staff, told Cold War historian Don Orbendorfer that he had never heard of Able Archer. The lack of public Soviet response over Able Archer 83 has led some historians, including <!--del_lnk--> Fritz W. Ermarth in his piece, &quot;Observations on the &#39;War Scare&#39; of 1983 From an Intelligence Perch&quot;, to conclude that Able Archer 83 posed no immediate threat to the United States.<p><a id="American_reaction" name="American_reaction"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">American reaction</span></h2>

Gates, Deputy Director for Intelligence during Able Archer 83, has published thoughts on the exercise that refute this conclusion:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

        <td>Information about the peculiar and remarkably skewed frame of mind of the Soviet leaders during those times that has emerged since the collapse of the Soviet Union makes me think there is a good chance &mdash; with all of the other events in 1983 &mdash; that they really felt a NATO attack was at least possible and that they took a number of measures to enhance their military readiness short of mobilization. After going through the experience at the time, then through the postmortems, and now through the documents, I don&rsquo;t think the Soviets were crying wolf. They may not have believed a NATO attack was imminent in November 1983, but they did seem to believe that the situation was very dangerous. And US intelligence [SNIE 11-9-84 and SNIE 11-10-84] had failed to grasp the true extent of their anxiety.</td>

      <p>A still-classified report written by Nina Steward for the President&rsquo;s Foreign Advisory Board concurs with Gates and refutes the previous CIA reports, concluding that further analysis shows that the Soviets were, in fact, genuinely fearful of US aggression.<p>Some historians, including Beth B. Fischer in her book <i>The Reagan Reversal</i>, pin Able Archer 83 as profoundly affecting President Reagan and his turn from a policy of Confrontation towards the Soviet Union to a policy of Rapprochement. While somewhat cryptic, the thoughts of Reagan and those around him provide important insight upon the nuclear scare and its subsequent ripples. On 10 October 1983, just over a month before Able Archer 83, President Reagan screened a film about <!--del_lnk--> Lawrence, <!--del_lnk--> Kansas being destroyed by a nuclear attack entitled <i><!--del_lnk--> The Day After.</i> In his diary, the president wrote that the film &quot;left me greatly depressed.&quot;<p>Later in October, Reagan attended a Pentagon briefing on nuclear war. During his first two years in office, he had refused to take part in such briefings, feeling it irreverent to rehearse a nuclear apocalypse; finally, he consented to the Pentagon official&rsquo;s requests. According to officials present, the briefing &quot;chastened&quot; Reagan. Weinberg said, &quot;[Reagan] had a very deep revulsion to the whole idea of nuclear weapons ... These war games brought home to anybody the fantastically horrible events that would surround such a scenario.&quot; Reagan described the briefing in his own words: &quot;A most sobering experience with Cap W and <!--del_lnk--> Gen. Vessey in the <!--del_lnk--> Situation room, a briefing on our complete plan in the event of a nuclear attack.&quot;<p>These two glimpses of nuclear war primed Reagan for Able Archer 83, giving him a very specific picture of what would occur had the situation further developed. After receiving intelligence reports from sources including Gordievsky, it was clear that the Soviets were unnerved. While officials were concerned with the Soviet panic, they were hesitant about believing the proximity of a Soviet attack. <!--del_lnk--> Secretary of State <!--del_lnk--> George P. Shultz thought it &quot;incredible, at least to us&quot; that the Soviets would believe the US would launch a genuine attack. In general, Reagan did not share the secretary&#39;s belief that cooler heads would prevail, writing:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>According to McFarlane, the president responded with &quot;genuine anxiety&quot;, in disbelief that his leadership could have led to an armed attack. A still-classified 1990 retroactive analysis shows the President&rsquo;s more alarmed reaction to be more correct than the more relaxed view of some of his staff. To the ailing <!--del_lnk--> Politburo &mdash; led from the deathbed of the terminally ill Andropov, a man with no firsthand knowledge of the United States, and the creator of Operation RYAN &mdash; it seemed &quot;that the United States was preparing to launch... a sudden nuclear attack on the Soviet Union.&quot; In his memoirs, Reagan, without specifically mentioning Able Archer 83 &mdash; he states earlier that he cannot mention classified information &mdash; wrote of a 1983 realization:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

         <p>Many people at the top of the Soviet hierarchy were genuinely afraid of America and Americans. Perhaps this shouldn&#39;t have surprised me, but it did...<br /> During my first years in Washington, I think many of us in the administration took it for granted that the Russians, like ourselves, considered it unthinkable that the United States would launch a first strike against them. But the more experience I had with Soviet leaders and other heads of state who knew them, the more I began to realize that many Soviet officials feared us not only as adversaries but as potential aggressors who might hurl nuclear weapons at them in a first strike...<br /> Well, if that was the case, I was even more anxious to get a top Soviet leader in a room alone and try to convince him we had no designs on the Soviet Union and Russians had nothing to fear from us.</td>
