      <p><b>Antlions</b> are a <!--del_lnk--> family of <a href="../../wp/i/Insect.htm" title="Insect">insects</a> in the order <!--del_lnk--> Neuroptera, classified as <b>Myrmeleontidae</b>, from the <!--del_lnk--> Greek &quot;myrmex&quot;, meaning &quot;ant&quot;, and &quot;leon&quot;, meaning &quot;lion&quot;. Strictly speaking the term antlion applies to the larval form of the members of this family. Antlions are worldwide in distribution, most common in arid and sandy habitats, and can be fairly small to very large (wingspan range of 2-15 cm). Antlions are <!--del_lnk--> omnivorous. The antlion <!--del_lnk--> larvae eat ants and other insects, while the adult antlion eats <!--del_lnk--> pollen and <!--del_lnk--> nectar.<p>The antlion larva is often called a &quot;&#39;doodlebug&quot;&#39;. One theory is that it gets this name from the odd winding, spiralling trails it leaves in the sand while looking for a good location to build its trap. These trails look like someone has <!--del_lnk--> doodled in the sand.<p>The adult antlion has two pairs of long, narrow, multi-veined <!--del_lnk--> wings in which the apical veins enclose regular oblong spaces, and a long, slender <!--del_lnk--> abdomen. Although they greatly resemble <!--del_lnk--> dragonflies or <!--del_lnk--> damselflies, they belong to an entirely different <!--del_lnk--> order of insects. Antlions are easily distinguished from damselflies by their longer, prominent, apically clubbed <!--del_lnk--> antennae and different pattern of wing venation. They also are very feeble fliers and are normally found fluttering about in the night, in search of a mate. The adult is rarely seen in the wild because it is typically active only in the evening.<p>

      <p>The life cycle of the antlion begins with <!--del_lnk--> egg-laying or &quot;oviposition&quot;. The female antlion repeatedly taps the sand surface with the tip of her abdomen. She then inserts the abdomen into the sand and lays an egg. The antlion larva is a ferocious-appearing creature with a robust, fusiform body bearing three pairs of walking legs and a prothorax forming a slender mobile neck for the large square head, which bears an enormous pair of sicklelike jaws (mandibles) with several sharp, hollow projections. Depending on species and where it lives, the larvae will either hide under leaves or pieces of wood, or dig pits in sandy areas.<div class="thumb tleft">
       <div style="width:182px;"><a class="internal" href="../../images/3/328.jpg.htm" title="Pupa in cocoon"><img alt="Pupa in cocoon" height="120" longdesc="/wiki/Image:Antlion2.jpg" src="../../images/3/328.jpg" width="180" /></a><div class="thumbcaption">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> pupal stage of the ant-lion is <!--del_lnk--> quiescent. The larva makes a globular <!--del_lnk--> cocoon of sand stuck together with fine <!--del_lnk--> silk spun, it is said, from a slender spinneret at the posterior end of the body. These cocoons may be buried several centimeters deep in the sand. It remains there for one month, until the completion of the transformation into the sexually mature insect, which then emerges from the case, leaving the pupal integument behind, and climbs to the surface. After about 20 minutes the adult&#39;s wings are fully opened and it will fly off in search of a mate. The adult is considerably larger than the larva; they exhibit the greatest disparity in size between larva and adult of any type of <!--del_lnk--> holometabolous insects, by virtue of the adults having an extremely thin, flimsy <!--del_lnk--> exoskeleton (in other words, they have extremely low mass per unit of volume). The adults are reported to live off of plant nectar, but some species retain strong chewing jaws similar to those of the dragonfly indicating that they also feed on insects. <a id="Pitfall_construction" name="Pitfall_construction"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Pitfall construction</span></h2>
      <p>Having marked out the chosen site by a circular groove, it starts to crawl backwards, using its abdomen as a plough to shovel up the soil. By the aid of one front leg it places consecutive heaps of loosened particles upon its head, then with a smart jerk throws each little pile clear of the scene of operations. Proceeding thus it gradually works its way from the circumference towards the centre. As it slowly moves round and round, the pit gradually gets deeper and deeper. When the pit is completed, the larva settles down at the bottom, buried in the soil with only the jaws projecting above the surface, often in a wide-opened position on either side of the very tip of the cone.<p><a id="Trapping_prey" name="Trapping_prey"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Trapping prey</span></h2>

       <div style="width:182px;"><a class="internal" href="../../images/3/329.jpg.htm" title="Sand pit trap of the antlion"><img alt="Sand pit trap of the antlion" height="135" longdesc="/wiki/Image:Antlion_trap.jpg" src="../../images/3/329.jpg" width="180" /></a><div class="thumbcaption">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Since the sides of the pit consist of loose sand they afford an insecure foothold to any small insects that inadvertently venture over the edge, such as <a href="../../wp/a/Ant.htm" title="Ant">ants</a>. Slipping to the bottom, the prey is immediately seized by the lurking ant-lion; or if it attempts to scramble again up the treacherous walls of the pit, it is speedily checked in its efforts and brought down by showers of loose sand which are jerked at it from below by the larva. Antlion larvae are capable of capturing and killing a variety of insects, and can even subdue small <a href="../../wp/s/Spider.htm" title="Spider">spiders</a>. The projections in the jaws of the insect are hollow and through this the larva will suck the fluids out of its victim. After consuming all the contents, the lifeless, dry carcass is flicked out of the pit, and the pit is readied once again. An average-sized larva digs a pit about 2 inches deep and 3 inches wide at the edge. Amazingly, this behaviour has also evolved in a family of <!--del_lnk--> flies, the <!--del_lnk--> Vermileonidae, whose larvae dig the exact same sort of pit and also feed on ants.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Antlions are especially abundant in soft sand beneath trees or under overhanging <!--del_lnk--> rocks. Apparently the larvae prefer dry places that are protected from the rain. Eventually the larva attains its maximum size and undergoes <!--del_lnk--> metamorphosis. The entire length of time from egg-laying to adulthood may take two or three years due to the uncertainty and irregular nature of its food supply. When it first hatches, the tiny larva specializes in very small insects, but as it grows larger, it constructs larger pits and thus catches larger prey.<p>Although antlion larvae have a ferocious appearance, they are completely harmless to humans. In fact, there are those who keep them as pets.<p>In certain species of Myrmeleontidae, such as <i>Dendroleon pantheormis</i>, the larva, although resembling that of <i>Myrmeleon</i> structurally, makes no pitfall, but seizes passing prey from any nook or crevice in which it shelters.<p><a id="Additional_information" name="Additional_information"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Additional information</span></h2>
      <p>The exact meaning of the name ant-lion (French <i>fourmilion</i>) is uncertain. It has been thought that it refers to the fact that ants form a large percentage of the prey of the insect, the suffix &quot;lion&quot; merely suggesting destroyer or eater. Perhaps, however, the name may only signify a large terrestrial biting apterous insect, surpassing the ant in size and predatory habits.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antlion&quot;</div>
