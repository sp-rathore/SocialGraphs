      <p><b>Atlantis</b> (<!--del_lnk--> Greek: <span class="polytonic" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#x1F08;&tau;&lambda;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&#x1F76;&sigmaf; &nu;&#x1FC6;&sigma;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, &quot;Island of Atlas&quot;) is the name of an island first mentioned and described by the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">classical Greek</a> <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosopher">philosopher</a> <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a>. According to him this island, lying &quot;beyond the <!--del_lnk--> pillars of Hercules&quot;, was a naval power, having conquered many parts of <!--del_lnk--> western Europe and <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>. Soon after a failed invasion of <a href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Athens">Athens</a>, Atlantis sank in the waves &quot;in a single day and night of misfortune&quot; due to a natural catastrophe which happened 9,000 years before Plato&#39;s time.<p>As a story embedded in Plato&#39;s dialogues, Atlantis is mostly seen as a myth created by Plato to back up a previously invented theory with real facts. Some scholars express the opinion that Plato intended to tell real history. Although the function of the story of Atlantis seems to be clear to most scholars, they dispute whether and how much Plato&#39;s account was inspired by older traditions. Some scholars argue Plato drew upon memories of past events such as the <!--del_lnk--> Thera eruption or the <a href="../../wp/t/Trojan_War.htm" title="Trojan War">Trojan War</a>, while others insist that he took inspiration of contemporary events like the destruction of <!--del_lnk--> Helike in <!--del_lnk--> 373 BC or the failed <!--del_lnk--> Athenian invasion of Sicily in 415&ndash;413 BC.<p>The possible existence of Atlantis was actively discussed throughout the <!--del_lnk--> classical antiquity, but it was usually rejected and occasionally parodied. While basically unknown during the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, the story of Atlantis was rediscovered by <!--del_lnk--> Humanists at the very beginning of modern times. Plato&#39;s description inspired the utopian works of several Renaissance writers, like <a href="../../wp/f/Francis_Bacon.htm" title="Francis Bacon">Francis Bacon&#39;s</a> &quot;<!--del_lnk--> New Atlantis&quot;. More than ever, Atlantis inspires today&#39;s literature, from <!--del_lnk--> science fiction to <!--del_lnk--> comic books and <a href="../../wp/f/Film.htm" title="Film">movies</a>.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Plato&#39;s account of Atlantis is written in the <!--del_lnk--> dialogues <i><!--del_lnk--> Timaeus</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Critias</i>, dated circa 360 BC. These works contain the earliest known references to Atlantis. The dialogue <i>Critias</i> was never completed by Plato for an unknown reason, however scholar <!--del_lnk--> Benjamin Jowett among others, argues that Plato originally planned a third dialogue titled <i><!--del_lnk--> Hermocrates</i>. <!--del_lnk--> John V. Luce assumes that Plato &mdash; after describing the origin of the world and mankind in <i>Timaeus</i> as well as the allegorical perfect society of ancient <a href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Athens">Athens</a> and its successful defense against an antagonistic Atlantis in <i>Critias</i> &mdash; would have made the strategy of the <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Hellas">Hellenic civilisation</a> during their conflict with the <!--del_lnk--> barbarians a subject of discussion in the phantom dialog.<p>The four persons appearing in those two dialogues are the politicians <!--del_lnk--> Critias and <!--del_lnk--> Hermocrates as well as the philosophers <a href="../../wp/s/Socrates.htm" title="Socrates">Socrates</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Timaeus, although only Critias speaks of Atlantis. While most likely all of these people actually lived, these dialogues as recorded may have been the invention of Plato. In his written works, Plato makes extensive use of the <!--del_lnk--> Socratic dialogues in order to discuss contrary positions within the context of a supposition.<p>The <i>Timaeus</i> begins with an introduction, followed by an account of the creations and structure of the universe and ancient civilizations. In the introduction, <a href="../../wp/s/Socrates.htm" title="Socrates">Socrates</a> muses about the perfect society, described in Plato&#39;s <i>Republic</i>, and wonders if he and his guests might recollect a story which exemplifies such a society. Critias mentions an allegedly historical tale that would make the perfect example, and follows by describing Atlantis as is recorded in the <i>Critias</i>. In his account, ancient Athens seems to represent the &quot;perfect society&quot; and Atlantis its opponent, representing the very antithesis of the &quot;perfect&quot; traits described in the <i>Republic</i>. Critias claims that his accounts of ancient Athens and Atlantis stem from a visit to <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">Egypt</a> by the Athenian lawgiver <!--del_lnk--> Solon in the 6th century BC. In <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, Solon met a priest of <!--del_lnk--> Sais, who translated the history of ancient Athens and Atlantis, recorded on papyri in Egyptian hieroglyphs, into <!--del_lnk--> Greek. According to <!--del_lnk--> Plutarch the priest was named Sonchis, but because of the temporal distance between Plutarch and the alleged event, this identification is unverified.<p>According to <!--del_lnk--> Critias, the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Hellenic</a> gods of old divided the land so that each god might own a lot; <!--del_lnk--> Poseidon was appropriately, and to his liking, bequeathed the island of Atlantis. The island was larger than <!--del_lnk--> Libya and <!--del_lnk--> Asia Minor combined, but has since been sunk by an earthquake and became an impassable mud shoal, inhibiting travel between the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> and the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>. The Egyptians described Atlantis as an island approximately 700&nbsp;kilometres (435&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mi) across, comprising mostly mountains in the northern portions and along the shore, and encompassing a great plain of an oblong shape in the south &quot;extending in one direction three thousand <i><!--del_lnk--> stadia</i> [about 600&nbsp;km; 375&nbsp;mi], but across the centre inland it was two thousand stadia [about 400&nbsp;km; 250&nbsp;mi].&quot;<p>Fifty stadia inland from the middle of the southern coast was a &quot;mountain not very high on any side.&quot; Here lived a native woman with whom Poseidon fell in love and who bore him five pairs of male <!--del_lnk--> twins. The eldest of these, <!--del_lnk--> Atlas, was made rightful king of the entire island and the ocean (now the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>), and was given the mountain of his birth and the surrounding area as his <!--del_lnk--> fiefdom. Atlas&#39;s twin <!--del_lnk--> Gadeirus or <!--del_lnk--> Eumelus in Greek, was given the easternmost portion of the island. The other four pairs of twins &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> Ampheres and <!--del_lnk--> Evaemon, <!--del_lnk--> Mneseus and <!--del_lnk--> Autochthon, <!--del_lnk--> Elasippus and <!--del_lnk--> Mestor, and <!--del_lnk--> Azaes and <!--del_lnk--> Diaprepes &mdash; &quot;were the inhabitants and rulers of divers islands in the open sea.&quot;<p>Poseidon carved the inland mountain where his love dwelt into a palace and enclosed it with three circular <!--del_lnk--> moats of increasing width, varying from one to three stadia and separated by rings of land proportional in size. The Atlanteans then built bridges northward from the mountain, making a route to the rest of the island. They dug a great canal to the sea, and alongside the bridges carved tunnels into the rings of rock so that ships could pass into the city around the mountain; they carved docks from the rock walls of the moats. Every passage to the city was guarded by gates and towers, and a wall surrounded each of the city&#39;s rings. The walls were constructed of red, white and black rock quarried from the moats, and were covered with <!--del_lnk--> brass, <a href="../../wp/t/Tin.htm" title="Tin">tin</a> and <!--del_lnk--> orichalcum, respectively.<p>According to Critias, 9,000 years before his lifetime a war took place between those outside the <!--del_lnk--> Pillars of Hercules- commonly considered to be the <!--del_lnk--> Strait of Gibraltar- and those who dwelt within them. The Atlanteans had conquered the Mediterranean as far east as Egypt and the continent into <!--del_lnk--> Tyrrhenia, and subjected its people to slavery. The Athenians led an alliance of resistors against the Atlantean empire and as the alliance disintegrated, prevailed alone against the empire, liberating the occupied lands. &quot;But afterwards there occurred violent earthquakes and floods; and in a single day and night of misfortune all your warlike men in a body sank into the earth, and the island of Atlantis in like manner disappeared in the depths of the sea.&quot;<p><a id="Receptions" name="Receptions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Receptions</span></h2>

      <p>Other than Plato&#39;s <i>Timaeus</i> and <i>Critias</i> there is no primary ancient account of Atlantis, which means every other account on Atlantis relies on Plato in one way or another. To this day, no proof for a non-Platonic tradition of Atlantis has been found. However, the Greek <!--del_lnk--> logographer <!--del_lnk--> Hellanicus of Lesbos wrote a work (now lost), named <i>Atlantis</i> (or <i>Atlantias</i>), about the daughters of the titan <!--del_lnk--> Atlas (not the Atlas mentioned by Plato). However, it is unlikely that this work was an inspiration to Plato, since he named Atlantis after the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> (ancient Greek: <span class="polytonic" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#x1F08;&tau;&lambda;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&#x1F76;&sigmaf; &theta;&#x3AC;&lambda;&alpha;&sigma;&sigma;&alpha;</span>, &quot;Sea of Atlas&quot;), which already had this name in the time of Herodotus.<p>Many ancient philosophers viewed Atlantis as fiction. The most popular might be <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, who is allegedly quoted by <!--del_lnk--> Strabo with the above mentioned commentary on Atlantis.<p>However, in antiquity, there were also philosophers, geographers, and historians who believed that Atlantis was real. For instance, the philosopher <!--del_lnk--> Crantor, a student of Plato&#39;s student <!--del_lnk--> Xenocrates, tried to find proof of Atlantis&#39; existence. His work, a comment on Plato&#39;s <i>Timaeus</i>, is lost, but another ancient historian, <!--del_lnk--> Proclus, reports that Crantor traveled to Egypt and actually found columns with the history of Atlantis written in <!--del_lnk--> hieroglyphic characters. However, Plato did not write that Solon saw the Atlantis story on a column but on a source that can be &quot;taken to hand&quot;. Proclus&#39; proof appears implausible.<p>Another passage from <!--del_lnk--> Proclus&#39; 5th century <!--del_lnk--> AD commentary on the <i><!--del_lnk--> Timaeus</i> gives a description of the geography of Atlantis: &quot;That an island of such nature and size once existed is evident from what is said by certain authors who investigated the things around the outer sea. For according to them, there were seven islands in that sea in their time, sacred to Persephone, and also three others of enormous size, one of which was sacred to Pluto, another to Ammon, and another one between them to Poseidon, the extent of which was a thousand stadia; and the inhabitants of it&mdash;they add&mdash;preserved the remembrance from their ancestors of the immeasurably large island of Atlantis which had really existed there and which for many ages had reigned over all islands in the Atlantic sea and which itself had like-wise been sacred to Poseidon. Now these things Marcellus has written in his <i>Aethiopica</i>&quot;. However, <!--del_lnk--> Heinz-G&uuml;nther Nesselrath argues that this Marcellus &mdash; who is otherwise unknown &mdash; is probably not a historian but a novelist.<p>Other ancient historians and philosophers believing in the existence of Atlantis were <!--del_lnk--> Strabo and <!--del_lnk--> Posidonius (cf. Strabo 2,3,6).<p>Plato&#39;s account of Atlantis may have also inspired <!--del_lnk--> parodic imitation: writing only a few decades after the <i>Timaeus</i> and <i>Critias</i>, the historian <!--del_lnk--> Theopompus of <!--del_lnk--> Chios wrote of a land beyond the ocean known as <!--del_lnk--> Meropis. This description was included in Book 8 of his voluminous <i>Philippica</i>, which contains a dialogue between King <!--del_lnk--> Midas and <!--del_lnk--> Silenus, a companion of <!--del_lnk--> Dionysus. Silenus describes the Meropids, a race of men who grow to twice normal size, and inhabit two cities on the island of Meropis: <i>Eusebes</i> (<span class="polytonic" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&Epsilon;&#x1F50;&sigma;&epsilon;&beta;&#x3AE;&sigmaf;</span>, &quot;Pious-town&quot;) and <i>Machimos</i> (<span class="polytonic" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&Mu;&#x3AC;&chi;&iota;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, &quot;Fighting-town&quot;). He also reports that an army of ten million soldiers crossed the ocean to conquer <!--del_lnk--> Hyperborea, but abandoned this proposal when they realized that the Hyperboreans were the luckiest people on earth. Heinz-G&uuml;nther Nesselrath has argued that these and other details of Silenus&#39; story are meant as imitation and exaggeration of the Atlantis story, for the purpose of exposing Plato&#39;s ideas to ridicule.<p>Somewhat similar is the story of <!--del_lnk--> Panchaea, written by philosopher <!--del_lnk--> Euhemerus. It mentions a perfect society on an island in the <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Ocean.htm" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>. Zoticus, a <!--del_lnk--> Neoplatonist philosopher of the 3rd century AD, wrote an epic poem based on Plato&#39;s account of Atlantis.<p>The 4th century AD historian <!--del_lnk--> Ammianus Marcellinus, relying on a lost work by Timagenes, a historian writing in the 1st century BC, writes that the <!--del_lnk--> Druids of <!--del_lnk--> Gaul said that part of the inhabitants of <!--del_lnk--> Gaul had migrated there from distant islands. Ammianus&#39; testimony has been understood by some as a claim that when Atlantis sunk into the sea, its inhabitants fled to western Europe; but Ammianus in fact says that &ldquo;the Drasidae (Druids) recall that a part of the population is indigenous but others also migrated in from islands and lands beyond the <a href="../../wp/r/Rhine.htm" title="Rhine">Rhine</a>&quot; (<i>Res Gestae</i> 15.9), an indication that the immigrants came to Gaul from the north and east, not from the Atlantic Ocean.<p><a id="Modern" name="Modern"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Modern</span></h3>

Donnelly took Plato&#39;s account of Atlantis seriously and attempted to establish that all known <!--del_lnk--> ancient civilizations were descended from its high <!--del_lnk--> neolithic culture.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>During the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, ideas about the legendary nature of Atlantis were combined with stories of other <!--del_lnk--> lost continents such as <!--del_lnk--> Mu and <!--del_lnk--> Lemuria by popular figures in the <!--del_lnk--> occult and the growing <!--del_lnk--> new age phenomenon. <!--del_lnk--> Helena Blavatsky, the &quot;Grandmother of the New Age movement,&quot; writes in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Secret Doctrine</i> that the Atlanteans were cultural heroes (contrary to Plato who describes them mainly as a military threat), and are the fourth &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Root Race&quot;, succeeded by the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Aryan race&quot;. <!--del_lnk--> Rudolf Steiner wrote of the cultural evolution of Mu or Atlantis. Famed psychic <!--del_lnk--> Edgar Cayce first mentioned Atlantis in a life reading given in 1923, and later gave its geographical location as the <!--del_lnk--> Caribbean, and proposed that <!--del_lnk--> Atlantis was an ancient, now-submerged, highly-evolved civilization which had ships and aircraft powered by a mysterious form of energy crystal. He also predicted that parts of Atlantis would rise in <!--del_lnk--> 1968 or <!--del_lnk--> 1969. The <!--del_lnk--> Bimini Road, a submarine geological formation just off <!--del_lnk--> North Bimini Island, discovered in 1968, has been claimed by some to be evidence of the lost civilization (among many other things) and is still being explored <!--del_lnk--> today.<p>Before the time of <!--del_lnk--> Eratosthenes about <!--del_lnk--> 250 BC, Greek writers located the <!--del_lnk--> Pillars of Hercules on the <!--del_lnk--> Strait of Sicily. This changed with <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>&rsquo;s eastward expansion and the Pillars were moved by Eratosthenes to Gibraltar. This evidence has been cited in some Atlantis <!--del_lnk--> theories, notably in <!--del_lnk--> Sergio Frau&#39;s work. His theory, supported by scholars and archaeologists, is still studied by the UNESCO<p><a id="Nationalist_and_Socialist_ideas_of_Atlantis" name="Nationalist_and_Socialist_ideas_of_Atlantis"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Nationalist and Socialist ideas of Atlantis</span></h4>
      <p>Plato&#39;s Atlantis has been considered by some <a href="../../wp/s/Socialism.htm" title="Socialism">socialists</a> as an early socialist <!--del_lnk--> utopia. <!--del_lnk--> British nationalists identified the British isles with Atlantis.<p>The concept of Atlantis also attracted <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">National Socialist</a> (Nazi) theorists. In <!--del_lnk--> 1938, <!--del_lnk--> Heinrich Himmler organized a search in <a href="../../wp/t/Tibet.htm" title="Tibet">Tibet</a> to find a remnant of the white Atlanteans. According to <!--del_lnk--> Julius Evola (<i><!--del_lnk--> Revolt Against the Modern World</i>, <!--del_lnk--> 1934), the Atlanteans were <!--del_lnk--> Hyperboreans -- Nordic <!--del_lnk--> supermen who originated on the <!--del_lnk--> North pole (see <!--del_lnk--> Thule). Similarly, <!--del_lnk--> Alfred Rosenberg (<i><!--del_lnk--> The Myth of the Twentieth Century</i>, <!--del_lnk--> 1930) spoke of a &quot;Nordic-Atlantean&quot; or &quot;Aryan-Nordic&quot; <!--del_lnk--> master race.<p><!--del_lnk--> Aleister Crowley has also written an esoteric history of Atlantis, although this may be intended more as <!--del_lnk--> metaphor than as fact.<p><a id="Recent_times" name="Recent_times"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Recent times</span></h4>

      <p>As <!--del_lnk--> continental drift became more widely accepted during the <!--del_lnk--> 1950s, most &quot;Lost Continent&quot; theories of Atlantis began to wane in popularity. In response, some recent theories propose that elements of Plato&#39;s story were derived from earlier myths.<p>Plato scholar Dr <!--del_lnk--> Julia Annas (<!--del_lnk--> Regents Professor of <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">Philosophy</a>, <!--del_lnk--> University of Arizona) has had this to say on the matter:<p>&quot;The continuing industry of discovering Atlantis illustrates the dangers of reading Plato. For he is clearly using what has become a standard device of fiction - stressing the historicity of an event (and the discovery of hitherto unknown authorities) as an indication that what follows is fiction. <i>The idea is that we should use the story to examine our ideas of government and power</i>. We have missed the point if instead of thinking about these issues we go off exploring the sea bed. The continuing misunderstanding of Plato as historian here enables us to see why his distrust of imaginative writing is sometimes justified.&quot;<p><a id="Location_hypotheses" name="Location_hypotheses"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Location hypotheses</span></h2>

      <p>Since Donnelly&#39;s day, there have been dozens&mdash;perhaps hundreds&mdash;of locations proposed for Atlantis. Some are scholarly or archaeological works whilst others have been made by <!--del_lnk--> psychic or other <!--del_lnk--> pseudoscientific means. Many of the proposed sites share some of the characteristics of the Atlantis story (water, catastrophic end, relevant time period), but none have been proven conclusively to be the historical Atlantis. Most of the historically proposed locations are in or near the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>, either islands such as <!--del_lnk--> Sardinia, <!--del_lnk--> Crete and <a href="../../wp/s/Santorini.htm" title="Santorini">Santorini</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Cyprus.htm" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Malta.htm" title="Malta">Malta</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Ponza or as land based cities or states such as <!--del_lnk--> Troy, <!--del_lnk--> Tartessos or Tantalus (in the province of <!--del_lnk--> Manisa), <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, and the new theory of <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israel</a>-<!--del_lnk--> Sinai or <!--del_lnk--> Canaan as possible locations. The massive <!--del_lnk--> Thera eruption, dated either to the <!--del_lnk--> 17th or the <!--del_lnk--> 15th century BC, caused a massive <a href="../../wp/t/Tsunami.htm" title="Tsunami">tsunami</a> that experts hypothesize devastated the <a href="../../wp/m/Minoan_civilization.htm" title="Minoan civilization">Minoan civilization</a> on the nearby island of <!--del_lnk--> Crete, further leading some to believe that this may have been the catastrophe which inspired the story.<p><a id="Outside_the_Mediterranean" name="Outside_the_Mediterranean"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Outside the Mediterranean</span></h3>
      <p>Locations as wide-ranging as <!--del_lnk--> Andalusia, <a href="../../wp/a/Antarctica.htm" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, underneath the <!--del_lnk--> Bermuda Triangle, and the <!--del_lnk--> Caribbean have been proposed as the true site of Atlantis. In the area of the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Sea.htm" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a> at least three locations have been proposed: <!--del_lnk--> Bosporus, <!--del_lnk--> Sinop and <!--del_lnk--> Ancomah (a legendary place near <!--del_lnk--> Trabzon). The nearby <!--del_lnk--> Sea of Azov was proposed as another site in <!--del_lnk--> 2003. In Northern <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> (by <!--del_lnk--> Olof Rudbeck in &quot;Atland&quot;, <!--del_lnk--> 1672-<!--del_lnk--> 1702), <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, and the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea.htm" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> have been proposed (the Swedish geographer Ulf Erlingsson combines the North Sea and Ireland in a comprehensive hypothesis). Areas in the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Ocean.htm" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> have also been proposed including <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Malaysia.htm" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> or both (i.e. <!--del_lnk--> Sundaland) and stories of a lost continent off <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> named &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Kumari Kandam&quot; have drawn parallels to Atlantis. Even <a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> and the <a href="../../wp/t/The_Bahamas.htm" title="Bahamas">Bahamas</a> have been suggested. Some believe that Atlantis stretched from the tip of Spain to <!--del_lnk--> Central America. According to <!--del_lnk--> Ignatius Donnelly in his book <i><!--del_lnk--> Atlantis: The Antediluvian World</i>, there is a connection between Atlantis and <!--del_lnk--> Aztlan (the ancestral home of the Aztecs). He claims that the Aztecs pointed east to the Caribbean as the former location of Aztlan.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Canary Islands have also been identified as a possible location, West of the Straits of Gibraltar but in close proximity to the Mediterranean Sea. Various islands or island groups in the Atlantic were also identified as possible locations, notably the <!--del_lnk--> Azores (Mid-Atlantic islands which are a territory of <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>), and even several <!--del_lnk--> Caribbean islands. The submerged island of <!--del_lnk--> Spartel near the Strait of Gibraltar would coincide with some elements of Plato&#39;s account, matching both the location and the date of submersion given in the <i>Critias</i>. Popular culture unceasingly places Atlantis in the Atlantic Ocean and perpetuates the original Platonic ideal.<p><a id="Atlantis_in_art.2C_literature_and_popular_culture" name="Atlantis_in_art.2C_literature_and_popular_culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Atlantis in art, literature and popular culture</span></h2>
