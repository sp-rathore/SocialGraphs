      <p>The <b>Auckland Metropolitan Area</b>, or <b>Greater Auckland</b>, in the <!--del_lnk--> North Island of <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, is the largest <!--del_lnk--> urban area in New Zealand. With over 1.2 million people it has over a quarter of the country&#39;s population, and demographics trends still cause it to grow faster than the rest of New Zealand.<p>It is a <!--del_lnk--> conurbation, made up of <!--del_lnk--> Auckland City (excluding the Hauraki Gulf islands), <!--del_lnk--> North Shore City, and the urban parts of <!--del_lnk--> Waitakere and <!--del_lnk--> Manukau cities, along with <!--del_lnk--> Papakura District and some nearby urban parts of <!--del_lnk--> Rodney and <!--del_lnk--> Franklin Districts. In <!--del_lnk--> M&#x101;ori it bears the traditional name <b>T&#x101;maki Makau Rau</b> or the transcribed version of Auckland, <b>&#x100;karana</b>.<p>Auckland lies between the <!--del_lnk--> Hauraki Gulf of the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> to the east, the low <!--del_lnk--> Hunua Ranges to the south-east, the <!--del_lnk--> Manukau Harbour to the south-west, and the <!--del_lnk--> Waitakere Ranges and smaller ranges to the west and north-west. The central part of the urban area occupies a narrow <!--del_lnk--> isthmus between the <!--del_lnk--> Manukau Harbour on the <!--del_lnk--> Tasman Sea and the <!--del_lnk--> Waitemata Harbour on the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. It is one of the few cities in the world to have harbours on two separate bodies of water.<p>

      <p>The isthmus was first settled around 1350 and was valued for its rich and fertile land. Many <i><!--del_lnk--> pa</i> (fortified villages) were created, mainly on the volcanic peaks. M&#x101;ori population is estimated to have peaked at 20,000 before the arrival of Europeans. This event - and the guns which they traded to local <!--del_lnk--> iwi - upset the local power balances. This resulted in extensive inter-tribal warfare, which together with some introduced plagues resulted in the area having relatively low numbers of M&#x101;ori when European settlement in New Zealand started in earnest (there is however no indication that this was the result of a deliberate European policy).<p><a id="Birth_of_the_city" name="Birth_of_the_city"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Birth of the city</span></h3>
      <p>After the signing of the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Waitangi in February 1840 the new Governor of New Zealand, <!--del_lnk--> William Hobson chose the area as his new capital. However, even in 1840, <!--del_lnk--> Port Nicholson (later <a href="../../wp/w/Wellington.htm" title="Wellington">Wellington</a>), was seen as a better choice for an administrative capital, due to its closeness to the <!--del_lnk--> South Island, which was being settled much faster.<p>Nonetheless, even after losing its status as capital in 1865, immigration to the new city stayed strong.<p><a id="Growth_up_to_today" name="Growth_up_to_today"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Growth up to today</span></h3>

      <p>Becoming a base against the <!--del_lnk--> M&#x101;ori King Movement in the early <!--del_lnk--> 1860s, and continued road building towards the south into the <!--del_lnk--> Waikato, enabled <!--del_lnk--> P&#x101;keh&#x101; (White New Zealanders) influence to spread out from Auckland. It also grew fairly rapidly, from 1,500 in 1841 to 12,423 by 1864. The growth occurred similarly to other <!--del_lnk--> mercantile-dominated cities, mainly around the port, and with many of the problems of overcrowding and pollution common to it.<p>Trams and railway lines shaped Aucklands rapid extension in the early first half of the 20th century, but soon after, the dominance of the motor vehicle emerged, and has not abated since, with aterial roads and motorways becoming a defining (and geographically dividing) feature of the urban landscape. They also allowed further massive expansion, resulting in the growth of associated urbanities like <!--del_lnk--> North Shore (especially after the construction of the <!--del_lnk--> Auckland Harbour Bridge, and <!--del_lnk--> Manukau City in the south.<p>To this day, a large percentage of Auckland is still dominated by a very <!--del_lnk--> suburban style of building, giving the city a very low <!--del_lnk--> population density: although it has not much more than a seventh of the population of London, it sprawls over a considerably larger area - a fact that serves to make public transport by Auckland&#39;s rail and bus systems unpopular and uneconomic (car usage costs fall slightly with decreasing urban density, while public transport costs rise sharply, even if less capital-intensive types like bus services are used in the less dense zones).<p><a id="Future_growth" name="Future_growth"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Future growth</span></h3>
      <p>Aucklands problems with <!--del_lnk--> urban sprawl, due to rapid population growth and its automobile-centred transportation system, are now slowly being addressed in planning. As Auckland is set to grow to an estimated 2 million inhabitants by the year 2050, a Regional Growth Strategy was adopted, which sees limits on further subdivision and intensification of existing use as its main <!--del_lnk--> sustainability measures. <p><a id="Geography_and_climate" name="Geography_and_climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography and climate</span></h2>

      <p>Auckland straddles the <a href="../../wp/v/Volcano.htm" title="Volcano">volcanoes</a> of the <!--del_lnk--> Auckland Volcanic Field. The 50 volcanic vents in the field take the form of cones, lakes, lagoons, islands and depressions, and several have produced extensive lava flows. Most of the cones have been partly or completely quarried away. The volcanoes are all individually extinct, although the volcanic field itself is merely dormant.<p>The most recent and by far the largest volcano, <!--del_lnk--> Rangitoto Island, was formed within the last 1000 years, and its eruptions destroyed the M&#x101;ori settlements on neighbouring <!--del_lnk--> Motutapu Island. Rangitoto&#39;s size, its symmetry, its position guarding the entrance to <!--del_lnk--> Waitemata Harbour and its visibility from many parts of the Auckland region make it Auckland&#39;s most iconic natural feature. It is eerily quiet as almost no birds and insects have settled on the island because of the rich acidic soil and type of flora that has adapted to grow out of the black broken rocky soil.<p><a id="Hauraki_Gulf_islands" name="Hauraki_Gulf_islands"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Hauraki Gulf islands</span></h3>

      <p>Auckland lies on and around an <!--del_lnk--> isthmus, less than 2 kilometres wide at its narrowest point, between <!--del_lnk--> Mangere Inlet and the <!--del_lnk--> Tamaki River. There are two harbours in the Auckland urban area surrounding this isthmus, <!--del_lnk--> Waitemata Harbour to the north, which opens east to the <!--del_lnk--> Hauraki Gulf, and <!--del_lnk--> Manukau Harbour to the south, which opens west to the <!--del_lnk--> Tasman Sea.<p>Bridges span parts of both these harbours, most notably the <!--del_lnk--> Auckland Harbour Bridge crossing the Waitemata Harbour west of the Auckland CBD. The upper reaches of the Manukau and Waitemata Harbours are spanned by <!--del_lnk--> Mangere Bridge and the <!--del_lnk--> Upper Harbour Bridge respectively. In earlier times, <!--del_lnk--> portage paths connected both sides of the sea at the narrowest sections of the isthmus.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>

      <p>Auckland has a warm-temperate climate, with warm, humid summers and mild, damp winters. January temperatures average 21-24&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> &deg;C. February can be warmer than January, but temperatures rarely exceed 30 &deg;C July maximum temperatures average 14-16&nbsp;&deg;C. High levels of rainfall occur almost year-round (an average of 1249&nbsp;mm per year), especially in winter. Climatic conditions vary in different parts of the city owing to geography such as hills, land cover and distance from the sea. On <!--del_lnk--> 27 July <!--del_lnk--> 1939 Auckland received its only snow fall in recorded history. This is unlike some <!--del_lnk--> South Island cities like <!--del_lnk--> Christchurch, which regularly gets snow down to sea level.<p>The unusual early morning calm on the isthmus during settled weather, before the sea breeze rises, was described as early as 1853: <i>&quot;In all seasons, the beauty of the day is in the early morning. At that time, generally, a solemn stillness holds, and a perfect calm prevails...&quot;</i> Many Aucklanders use this time of day to walk and run in parks. <p>As car ownership rates are very high, and emissions controls relatively weak in New Zealand, Auckland suffers from an elevated level of <!--del_lnk--> air pollution. This can sometimes be visible as <a href="../../wp/s/Smog.htm" title="Smog">smog</a>, especially on calm winter days. However, the maritime local climate ensures that most pollution is eventually dispersed, and thus the smog never reaches levels as seen, for example, in <!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles or <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico_City.htm" title="Mexico City">Mexico City</a>.<p><a id="People" name="People"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">People</span></h2>

      <p>Auckland serves as a home to many cultures. The majority of inhabitants claim European - predominantly British - descent, but substantial <!--del_lnk--> M&#x101;ori, <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Islander and <!--del_lnk--> Asian communities exist as well. Auckland has the largest <!--del_lnk--> Polynesian population of any city in the world.<p>A large proportion of the population is also made up of people of Asian origin (mainly <!--del_lnk--> East Asian and <!--del_lnk--> South Asian). This is due to New Zealand&#39;s world-leading level of immigration, which flows primarily into Auckland. Ethnic groups from all corners of the world have a presence in Auckland, making it by far the country&#39;s most <!--del_lnk--> cosmopolitan city. It is estimated that over 14 people from other countries immigrate to Auckland every day. This strong focus on Auckland has led the immigration services to award extra points towards immigration visa requirements for people intending to move to other parts of New Zealand.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>(These percentages do not add up to 100%, as some people belong to more than one ethnic group).<p><a id="Religion" name="Religion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h3>
      <p>Like the rest of the country, more than half of Aucklanders are nominally <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christian</a>, but fewer than 10% regularly attend church and almost 40% profess no religious affiliation (2001 census figures). The main denominations are <!--del_lnk--> Anglican, <!--del_lnk--> Presbyterian and <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic. <!--del_lnk--> Pentecostal and <!--del_lnk--> charismatic churches are the fastest growing. The charismatic and <!--del_lnk--> fundamentalist <!--del_lnk--> Destiny Church, headquartered in Auckland, has gained headlines because of its political activities. A higher percentage of <!--del_lnk--> Polynesian immigrants are regular churchgoers than other Aucklanders, although church attendance drops off in second- or third-generation Polynesian Aucklanders. Other immigrant cultures have added to the religious diversity of the city, adding faiths such as <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Sikhism.htm" title="Sikhism">Sikhism</a> to Auckland&#39;s religious landscape. There is also a small, long-established <a href="../../wp/j/Judaism.htm" title="Judaism">Jewish</a> community.

      <p>Positive aspects of Auckland life are its mild climate, plentiful employment and educational opportunities, as well as numerous leisure facilities. Meanwhile, traffic problems (compared to other New Zealand cities), the lack of good public transport, and increasing housing costs have been cited by many Aucklanders as among the strongest negative factors of living there , together with crime (which is still low for a city of its size ). Nonetheless, Auckland currently ranks 5th behind <!--del_lnk--> Zurich and <a href="../../wp/g/Geneva.htm" title="Geneva">Geneva</a> in a survey of the quality of life of the world&#39;s top 55 cities . In 2006, Auckland also placed 23rd on the UBS list of the world&#39;s richest cities.<p><a id="Leisure" name="Leisure"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Leisure</span></h3>

      <p>Auckland is popularly known as the &quot;City of Sails&quot; because the harbour is often dotted with hundreds of yachts and has more per capita than any other city in the world. <!--del_lnk--> Viaduct Basin hosted two <!--del_lnk--> America&#39;s Cup challenges, and its cafes, restaurants, and clubs add to Auckland&#39;s vibrant nightlife.<p>High Street, <!--del_lnk--> Queen Street, <!--del_lnk--> Ponsonby Road, and <!--del_lnk--> Karangahape Road are also very popular with urban socialites. <!--del_lnk--> Newmarket and Parnell are upmarket shopping centres. <!--del_lnk--> Otara&#39;s and <!--del_lnk--> Avondale&#39;s famous fleamarkets and <!--del_lnk--> Victoria Park Market are a colourful alternative shopping experience.

      <p>Every business day, many professional and other service workers commute from all points of the region to downtown Auckland, often enduring long commuting times, drawn by and making <!--del_lnk--> Auckland City one of the best-earning cities in New Zealand with a median personal income per year of NZ$ 22,300 (2001), behind only <!--del_lnk--> North Shore City (also part of the Greater Auckland area) and <a href="../../wp/w/Wellington.htm" title="Wellington">Wellington</a>. While office workers still account for a heavy part of the CBD commutes, large office developments in other parts of the city, for example in <!--del_lnk--> Takapuna, <!--del_lnk--> North Shore City, are becoming more common.<p>Most major international corporations have an Auckland office, as the city is seen as the economic capital of the nation - although many firms increasingly run their New Zealand operations from Australia. The most expensive office space is around lower Queen Street and the Viaduct Basin. A large proportion of the technical and trades workforce is based in the industrial zones of <!--del_lnk--> South Auckland.<p>The largest commercial and industrial areas of Greater Auckland are in the southeast of Auckland (City) as well as in the western parts of Manukau City, mostly in the areas oriented towards the <!--del_lnk--> Manukau Harbour and the <!--del_lnk--> Tamaki River estuary.<p><a id="Housing" name="Housing"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Housing</span></h3>
      <p>Housing varies considerably between some suburbs having state owned housing in the lower income neighbourhoods, to palatial waterfront estates. The most common residence of Aucklanders is a bungalow on a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> quarter acre&quot; (1,000 m&sup2;), with the resulting large urban sprawl and reliance on motor vehicles. The regional council is trying to curb this trend, with housing density strategies such as more townhouses and apartments, and prohibiting subdivision of properties on the city fringes.<p>In some areas, the Victorian <!--del_lnk--> villas are being increasingly torn down to make way for large plaster mansions with tennis courts and swimming pools. The rampant demolition of the older properties is being combatted by the Auckland City Council passing laws that cover heritage suburbs or streets.<p><a id="Transport" name="Transport"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transport</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Dominance_of_vehicle_transport" name="Dominance_of_vehicle_transport"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Dominance of vehicle transport</span></h3>
      <p>Auckland is highly dependent on private vehicles as the main form of transportation, to a level unusual for such a large city. This results in substantial traffic congestion during peak times, especially for New Zealand levels, though comparable to many other cities worldwide.<p>With public transport usage declining heavily during the second half of the 20th century, and increased spending on roading and motorways, New Zealand (and specifically Auckland) now has the second-highest vehicle ownership rate in the world, with around 578 vehicles per 1000 people.  This focus has been partly due to the low population density of the Auckland region (again, similar to New Zealand in general terms), making public transport less cost-effective when compared to denser urban centres in other parts of the world. Auckland thus suffers from associated problems such as chronic traffic congestion on the main routes, and vehicle-induced air pollution. Recent studies show that New Zealanders take less than 2% of all journeys by bus and only 1% of journeys by rail. <p><a id="Road_network" name="Road_network"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Road network</span></h3>
      <p>The State Highway network connects the cities located in the Auckland urban area. The most frequently travelled being the Northern, Southern, Northwestern and Southwestern Motorways. The <!--del_lnk--> Western Ring Route is currently under construction. The <!--del_lnk--> Auckland Harbour Bridge is the main connection to <!--del_lnk--> North Shore City.<p>The main arterial roads within Greater Auckland are <!--del_lnk--> Great North Road and <!--del_lnk--> Great South Road, the main connections in those directions before the construction of the State Highway network.<p><a id="Other_modes_of_travel" name="Other_modes_of_travel"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other modes of travel</span></h3>
      <p>Public transport use is still very light in terms of the <!--del_lnk--> modal share, and remains widely unpopular and expensive in spite of recent increases in ridership and funding.<ul>
       <li>Auckland has two main railway trunk lines, serving the general western and southern directions from the <!--del_lnk--> Britomart Transport Centre in downtown Auckland.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>An integrated bus network has resulted in increased patronage and service, but service is still limited in comparison to other cities of the same size (and higher density). The services are mostly <!--del_lnk--> spoke-, as opposed to <!--del_lnk--> ring-routes, due to the location of Auckland within the narrow sections of the isthmus. Services rarely run late into the night.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>Auckland CBD is connected to various outlying coastal suburbs and <!--del_lnk--> North Shore City via ferries. The same ferry terminal also services outlying islands for commuters and tourists.</ul>
      <p>Auckland has various small regional airports as well as <!--del_lnk--> Auckland International Airport, the busiest of the country.<p><a id="Attractions_and_landmarks" name="Attractions_and_landmarks"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Attractions and landmarks</span></h2>
