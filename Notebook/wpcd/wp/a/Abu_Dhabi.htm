      <p>Parts of Abu Dhabi were settled as far back as the <!--del_lnk--> 3rd millennium BC and its early history fits the nomadic herding and fishing pattern typical of the broader region. Modern Abu Dhabi traces its origins to the rise of an important tribal confederation the <!--del_lnk--> Bani Yas in the late <a href="../../wp/1/18th_century.htm" title="18th century">18<sup>th</sup> century</a>, who also assumed control of <a href="../../wp/d/Dubai.htm" title="Dubai">Dubai</a>. In the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19<sup>th</sup> century</a> the Dubai and Abu Dhabi branches parted ways.<p>Into the mid-<a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20<sup>th</sup> century</a>, the economy of Abu Dhabi continued to be sustained mainly by <a href="../../wp/c/Camel.htm" title="Camel">camel</a> herding, production of <!--del_lnk--> dates and vegetables at the inland <!--del_lnk--> oases of Al Ain and <!--del_lnk--> Liwa, and fishing and <a href="../../wp/p/Pearl.htm" title="Pearl">pearl</a> diving off the coast of Abu Dhabi city, which was occupied mainly during the summer months. Most dwellings in Abu Dhabi city were, at this time constructed of <a href="../../wp/a/Arecaceae.htm" title="Arecaceae">palm</a> fronds (<i>barasti</i>), with the wealthier families occupying <!--del_lnk--> mud <!--del_lnk--> huts. The growth of the cultured pearl industry in the first half of the twentieth century created hardship for residents of Abu Dhabi as pearls represented the largest export and main source of cash earnings.<p>In 1939, <!--del_lnk--> Sheikh <!--del_lnk--> Shakhbut Bin-Sultan Al Nahyan granted <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> concessions, and oil was first found in 1958. At first, oil money had a marginal impact. A few lowrise concrete buildings were erected, and the first paved road was completed in 1961, but Sheikh Shakbut, uncertain whether the new oil royalties would last, took a cautious approach, preferring to save the revenue rather than investing it in development. His brother, <!--del_lnk--> Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahayan, saw that oil wealth had the potential to transform Abu Dhabi. The ruling Al Nahayan family decided that Sheikh Zayed should replace his brother as ruler and carry out his vision of developing the country. On <!--del_lnk--> August 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1966, with the assistance of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a>, Sheikh Zayed became the new ruler. (See Al-Fahim, M, <i>From Rags to Riches: A Story of Abu Dhabi</i>, Chapter Six (London Centre of Arab Studies, 1995), <!--del_lnk--> ISBN 1-900404-00-1.)<p>With the announcement by the UK in 1968 that it would withdraw from the Gulf area by 1971, Sheikh Zayed became the main driving force behind the formation of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Arab_Emirates.htm" title="United Arab Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a>.<p>After the Emirates gained independence in 1971, oil wealth continued to flow to the area and traditional mud-brick huts were rapidly replaced with <!--del_lnk--> banks, boutiques and modern <!--del_lnk--> highrises.<p><a id="Location" name="Location"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Location</span></h2>

      <p>Abu Dhabi city is a modern city with broad boulevards, tall office and apartment buildings, and busy shops. Principal thoroughfares are The Corniche, Airport Road, Sheikh Zayed Street, Hamdan Street and Khalifa Street. Many streets are known for specialized businesses that tend to cluster on them. Hamdan Street is the main shopping street, Khalifa Street is lined with banks, Al Najdha Street is known for hardware stores, Defense St is filled with mobile telephone shops and Sheikh Zayed St (Also known as Electra Street) is the computer street.<p>Abu Dhabi city is known in the region for its greenery; the former desert strip today includes numerous parks and gardens. Key buildings include the <!--del_lnk--> Qasr al-Hosn (a.k.a. Old Fort or White Fort), Clock Tower (now demolished due to construction of the new Corniche), headquarters of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and its many operating-company subsiduaries and the Cultural Foundation. The Corniche, which was re-developed in 2005, is now one of the best sea front parks in the Gulf.<p>The current developments in Abu Dhabi, like its neighbour <a href="../../wp/d/Dubai.htm" title="Dubai">Dubai</a>, reflect a number of architectural masterpieces by, among others, <!--del_lnk--> Zaha Hadid and <!--del_lnk--> Frank Gehry.<p>Other urban centers in the Abu Dhabi emirate are <!--del_lnk--> Al &#39;Ain and <!--del_lnk--> Ruwais. Al Ain is an agglomeration of several villages scattered around a valuable desert oasis; today it is the site of the national university, UAEU. Al Ain is billed as the Garden City of the UAE. Other work includes the 1st prize international competition of the Abu Dhabi Library and Cultural Centre won by the Architects Collaborative, designed by <!--del_lnk--> Hisham N. Ashkouri of Boston, Massachusetts and New York, NY.<p><a id="Current_ruler" name="Current_ruler"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Current ruler</span></h2>

      <p>see: <!--del_lnk--> Postage stamps of Abu Dhabi<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h2>
      <p>Sunny/blue skies can be expected throughout the year. The months June through September are generally hot and humid with temperatures averaging above 40&ordm;C (110&ordm;F). During this time, sandstorms also occur intermittently, in some cases reducing visibility down to a few meters. The weather is usually pleasant from October to May. January to February is cooler and may require the use of a light jacket. This period also sees dense fog on some days. The oasis city of <!--del_lnk--> Al Ain, about 150 km away, bordering Oman, regularly records the highest summer temperatures in the country, however the dry desert air and cooler evenings make it a traditional retreat from the intense summer heat and year round humidity of the capital city.<p><a id="Transport" name="Transport"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transport</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Abu Dhabi International Airport- (AUH) serves this city. The local time is <!--del_lnk--> GMT + 4 hours. Private vehicles and taxis are the primary means of transportation in the city, although public buses, run by the Abu Dhabi Muncipality, are available, but mostly used by the lower-income population. There are bus routes to nearby towns such as Baniyas, Habashan and the garden city of UAE <!--del_lnk--> Al Ain, among others. There is a newer service started in 2005 between Abu Dhabi and the commercial city of Dubai (about 160 km away)<p><a id="City_Planning" name="City_Planning"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">City Planning</span></h2>
      <p>The city was planned in the 1970s (all that remains of the previous settlement is <!--del_lnk--> Al Hosn Fort) for an estimated maximum population of 600,000. In accordance with what was considered to be ideal urban planning at the time, the city has wide grid-pattern roads, and high-density tower blocks.<p>On the northerly end of the island, where the population density is highest, the main streets are lined with 20-story towers. Inside this rectangle of towers is a normal grid pattern of roads with lower density buildings (2 storey villas or 6 storey low-rise buildings).<p>Away from the high-density areas, land is primarily used for government buildings and private villas.<p>Mail is delivered to post-office boxes only; there is no door-to-door delivery. There are many parks (or &#39;public gardens&#39;) throughout the city. Entrance is usually free for children, however there is often an entry fee for adults.<p><a id="Planning_Problems" name="Planning_Problems"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Planning Problems</span></h2>
      <ul>
       <li>The city&#39;s population far surpasses the original estimated maximum population when it was designed. This causes traffic congestion, a shortage of car parking spaces, and over crowding.<li>Having Post Office mail delivery only, and no widely-usable address system thus far for buildings, causes problems in describing building locations. This means directions must often be given based on nearby landmarks.<li>The lack of a comprehensive, reliable, and frequent public transport system has led to a near complete dependence on private cars as a means of transport.<li>Grid-pattern roads mean a public transportation system is difficult to implement without requiring a moderate amount of walking, which would be a large deterrent to usage.<li>Closely positioned, high-rise towers often means accommodation is dark and claustrophobic.</ul>
      <p><a id="Future_Development" name="Future_Development"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Future Development</span></h2>
      <ul>
       <li>The city&#39;s exhibition centre (<!--del_lnk--> ADNEC) is currently experiencing huge development.<li>A metro, and improved bus services are planned to resolve traffic problems.<li><!--del_lnk--> Parking meters are currently being tried out as a solution to parking problems.</ul>
