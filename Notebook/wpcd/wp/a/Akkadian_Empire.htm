      <p>The <b>Akkadian Empire</b> usually refers to the <!--del_lnk--> Semitic speaking state that grew up around the city of <!--del_lnk--> Akkad north of <a href="../../wp/s/Sumer.htm" title="Sumer">Sumer</a>, and reached its greatest extent under <!--del_lnk--> Sargon of Akkad. Although ascertaining exact dates during this period is subject to significant disagreement, the Akkadian Empire lasted from <i>circa</i> <!--del_lnk--> 2350 BC to <!--del_lnk--> 2150 BC&mdash;approximately 200 years.<p>

      <p>Rulers with Semitic names had already established themselves at <!--del_lnk--> Kish. One of them, contemporary with the last Sumerian ruler, <!--del_lnk--> Lugal-Zage-Si, was Alusarsid (or Urumus) who &quot;subdued <!--del_lnk--> Elam and Barahs.&quot; But the fame of these early establishers of Semitic supremacy was far eclipsed by that of Sargon (<i>Sharru-kin</i>), who defeated and captured Lugal-Zage-Si, conquering his empire. A lengthy inscription of Sargon&#39;s son, <!--del_lnk--> Manishtushu, was discovered at <!--del_lnk--> Susa by J. de Morgan. The date of Sargon is placed by modern scholars around <!--del_lnk--> 2300 BC (although the later &quot;archaeologist king&quot; of Babylonia, <!--del_lnk--> Nabonidus, calculated it at <!--del_lnk--> 3800 BC).<p>Sargon was the son of La&#39;ibum or Itti-Bel, and one legend related how he had been born in concealment and set adrift in an ark of bulrushes on the waters of the <a href="../../wp/e/Euphrates.htm" title="Euphrates">Euphrates</a>. Here he was rescued and brought up by &quot;Akki the husbandman&quot;; but the day arrived at length when his true origin became known. Originally a cupbearer to a king of Kish with a Semitic name, Ur Zababa, the crown was set upon Sargon&#39;s head, and he entered upon a career of foreign conquest. Four times he invaded <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Canaan, and spent three years thoroughly subduing the countries of &quot;the west&quot; to unite them with Mesopotamia &quot;into a single empire.&quot;<p>Images of Sargon were erected on the shores of the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean</a> in token of his victories, and cities and palaces were built at home with the spoils of the conquered lands. <!--del_lnk--> Elam and the northern part of Mesopotamia were also subjugated, and rebellions were put down Sumer itself. <!--del_lnk--> Contract tablets have been found dated in the years of the campaigns against Canaan and Sarlak, king of <!--del_lnk--> Gutium nowadays North Iraq; and <a href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper">copper</a> is mentioned as being brought from <!--del_lnk--> Magan (probably modern <a href="../../wp/o/Oman.htm" title="Oman">Oman</a>).<p>Sargon&#39;s two sons and successors, Rimush and Manishtushu, were not so illustrious, and both were assassinated; but his grandson, <!--del_lnk--> Naram-Sin, followed up the earlier successes by marching into Magan, whose king he took captive. He assumed the imperial title of &quot;King Naram-Sin, of the four quarters&quot;, and, like his grandfather, was addressed as &quot;the god of Agade&quot; (Akkad), reminiscent of the divine honours claimed by the <!--del_lnk--> Pharaohs of <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Art" name="Art"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Art</span></h3>
      <p>A bas relief representing Naram-Sin, and bearing a striking resemblance to early <!--del_lnk--> Egyptian art in many of its features, has been found at <!--del_lnk--> Diarbekr, in modern <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Babylonian art, however, had already attained a high degree of excellence; two cylinder seals of the time of Sargon are among the most beautiful specimens of the gem-cutter&#39;s art ever discovered.<p><a id="Achievements" name="Achievements"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Achievements</span></h3>
      <p>The empire was bound together by roads, along which there was a regular <!--del_lnk--> postal service. Clay seals that took the place of stamps bear the names of Sargon and his son. A <!--del_lnk--> cadastral survey seems also to have been instituted, and one of the documents relating to it states that a certain Uru-Malik, whose name appears to indicate his <!--del_lnk--> Canaanite origin, was governor of the land of the <!--del_lnk--> Amorites, or <i>Amurru</i> as the semi-<!--del_lnk--> nomadic people of Syria and Canaan were called in Akkadian. It is probable that the first collection of <a href="../../wp/a/Astronomy.htm" title="Astronomy">astronomical</a> observations and terrestrial omens was made for a library established by Sargon.<p><a id="Collapse" name="Collapse"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Collapse</span></h2>
      <p>Naram-Sin recorded the Akkadian&#39;s wars against the Armani or Armeni people in <!--del_lnk--> Ararat. The Armeni is a reference to <!--del_lnk--> Armen who was the ruler of the Armenian tribe (Armen&#39;s followers, the Armenians [Ura&scaron;tu in Akkadian language], were referred to as Armeni or Armens at the time). It is also unknown if <!--del_lnk--> Sargon, grandfather of <!--del_lnk--> Naram-Sin, and <!--del_lnk--> Manishtushu, father of <!--del_lnk--> Naram-Sin, also fought against the Armeni people of <!--del_lnk--> Ararat during their rule of the Akkadian Empire. It is highly probable however considering that Naram-Sin recorded multiple wars with the Armeni people of <!--del_lnk--> Ararat.<p>It is still unknown at this time if the wars with the Armeni people of <!--del_lnk--> Ararat contributed to the collapse of the Akkadian kingdom. However, the Akkadian Empire was already starting to crumble during Shar-kali-sharri&#39;s reign, the son of Naram-Sin, and by the end of Shar-kali-sharri&#39;s reign, the Akkadian Empire collapsed outright from the invasion of barbarians of the <!--del_lnk--> Zagros known as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Gutians&quot;.<p><a id="After_the_Akkadian_Empire" name="After_the_Akkadian_Empire"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">After the Akkadian Empire</span></h2>
      <p>The fall of the empire established by Sargon seems to have been as sudden as its rise, and little is known about the <!--del_lnk--> Gutian period. From the fall of Akkad until around <!--del_lnk--> 2100 BC, there is much that is still dark. A relatively well known king from that period is <!--del_lnk--> Gudea, king of Lagash.<p>The period between ca. <!--del_lnk--> 2100 BC and <!--del_lnk--> 2000 BC is sometimes called the <!--del_lnk--> 3rd dynasty of Ur or &quot;Sumerian Renaissance&quot;, founded by <!--del_lnk--> Ur-Nammu (originally a general). Though documents again began to be written in Sumerian, this dynasty may actually have been Semitic; Sumerian was becoming a dead language, much as Latin later would be in <!--del_lnk--> Medieval <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>. The power of these kings extended to the Mediterranean.<p>After the fall of the Ur III dynasty owing to an Elamite invasion in <!--del_lnk--> 2004 BC, <a href="../../wp/m/Mesopotamia.htm" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> passed under foreign influence. This period is called Old <a href="../../wp/b/Babylonia.htm" title="Babylonia">Babylonian</a>, and lasted from ca. <!--del_lnk--> 2000 BC until <!--del_lnk--> 1595 BC. During the first centuries of this period, kings and people in high position often had <!--del_lnk--> Amorite names, and supreme power rested at <!--del_lnk--> Isin. The city of <!--del_lnk--> Babylon was given hegemony over Mesopotamia by king <b><a href="../../wp/h/Hammurabi.htm" title="Hammurabi">Hammurabi</a></b> <!--del_lnk--> 1792 BC - <!--del_lnk--> 1750 BC(dates highly uncertain).<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_Empire&quot;</div>
