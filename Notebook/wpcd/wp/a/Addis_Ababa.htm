As a <!--del_lnk--> chartered city (<i>ras gez astedader</i>), Addis Ababa has the status of both a city and a state. The city has as many as 80 nationalities speaking 80 languages, and Christian, Muslim, and Jewish communities.

      <p>Addis Ababa was founded by the Ethiopian emperor <!--del_lnk--> Menelik II. Menelik, as King of <!--del_lnk--> Shewa, had found <!--del_lnk--> Mount Entoto a useful base for military operations in the south of his realm, and in 1879 visited the reputed ruins of a medieval town, and an unfinished rock church that showed proof of an Ethiopian presence in the area prior to the campaigns of <!--del_lnk--> Ahmad Gragn. His interest in the area grew when his wife Taytu began work on a church on Entoto, and Menelik endowed a second church in the area. However the immediate area did not encourage the founding of a town due to the lack of <!--del_lnk--> firewood and <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a>, so settlement actually began in the valley south of the mountain in <!--del_lnk--> 1886. Initially, Taytu built a house for herself near the &quot;Filwoha&quot; hot <!--del_lnk--> mineral springs, known to the local <!--del_lnk--> Oromo people as <i>Finfinne</i>, where she and members of the Showan Royal Court liked to take mineral baths. Other nobility and their staffs and households settled the vicinity, and Menelik expanded his wife&#39;s house to become the <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Palace which remains the seat of government in Addis Ababa today. Addis Ababa became Ethiopia&#39;s capital when Menelik II became Emperor of Ethiopia. The town grew by leaps and bounds. One of Emperor Menelik&#39;s contributions that is still visible today is the planting of numerous <!--del_lnk--> eucalyptus trees along the city streets.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 5 May <!--del_lnk--> 1936, <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italian</a> troops occupied Addis Ababa during the <!--del_lnk--> Second Italo-Abyssinian War, making it the capital of <!--del_lnk--> Italian East Africa. Addis Ababa was governed by the <!--del_lnk--> Italian Governors of Addis Ababa from 1936 to 1939. After the Italian army in Ethiopia was frustrated by <!--del_lnk--> Ethiopian patriots, and hugely defeated with British help during the <!--del_lnk--> Liberation of Ethiopia, Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Haile Selassie returned to Addis Ababa on <!--del_lnk--> 5 May <!--del_lnk--> 1941&mdash;five years to the very day after he had departed&mdash;and immediately began the work of re-establishing his capital.<p>Emperor Haile Selassie helped form the <!--del_lnk--> Organization of African Unity in <!--del_lnk--> 1963, and invited the new organization to maintain its headquarters in the city. The OAU was dissolved in 2002 and replaced by the <a href="../../wp/a/African_Union.htm" title="African Union">African Union</a> (AU), also headquartered in Addis Ababa. The <!--del_lnk--> United Nations Economic Commission for Africa also has its headquarters in Addis Ababa. Addis Ababa was also the site of the <!--del_lnk--> Council of the Oriental Orthodox Churches in <!--del_lnk--> 1965.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>
      <p>Based on figures from the <!--del_lnk--> Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA) published in 2005, Addis Ababa has an estimated total population of 2,973,004, consisting of 1,428,001 men and 1,545,003 women. The CSA estimated that presently there are no rural parts to the city, so 100% of the inhabitants are considered urban dwellers; Addis Ababa contains 24% of all urban dwellers in Ethiopia. With an estimated area of 530.14 square kilometers, this chartered city has an estimated density of 5,607.96 people per square kilometer.<p>These estimates are based on the 1994 census, in which the population of Addis Ababa was reported to be 2.3 million of which 28,149 lived in the rural parts of the city. 51.6% were females, while 48.4% were male.<p>Almost all ethnic groups are represented in Addis Ababa due to its position as capital of the country. The major ethnic groups represented are the <!--del_lnk--> Amharas (48.3%), <!--del_lnk--> Oromo (19.2%), <!--del_lnk--> Gurage (17.5%), and <!--del_lnk--> Tigrean (7.6%), while others constitute 7.4% of the population.<p>82% of the population are <!--del_lnk--> Orthodox Christians, 12.7% <!--del_lnk--> Muslims, 3.9% <!--del_lnk--> Protestants, 0.8% <!--del_lnk--> Catholics, and 0.6% followers of other religions (<!--del_lnk--> Hindus, <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jew">Jews</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Bahais, <!--del_lnk--> Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses, <!--del_lnk--> Agnostics, etc.).<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>
      <p>The CSA of Ethiopia estimated in 2005 that farmers in Addis Ababa had a total 20,700 head of cattle (representing less than 0.1% of Ethiopia&#39;s total cattle), 7,900 sheep (less than 0.1%), 3,150 goats (less than 0.1%), 380 horses (less than 0.1%), 270 mules (0.18%), 4,780 donkeys (0.19%), 21,420 poultry of all species (less than 0.1%), and 170 beehives (less than 0.1%).<p><a id="Other_features" name="Other_features"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Other features</span></h2>
      <p>Addis Ababa is the headquarters of the <!--del_lnk--> United Nations Economic Commission for Africa and the <a href="../../wp/a/African_Union.htm" title="African Union">African Union</a>.

Near Holy Trinity Cathedral is the Parliament building, built during the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie, with its clock tower. It continues to serve as the seat of Parliament today. Across from the Parliament is the Shengo Hall, built by the <!--del_lnk--> Derg regime of <!--del_lnk--> Mengistu Haile Mariam as its new parliament hall. The Shengo Hall was the world&#39;s largest pre-fabricated building, which was constructed in <a href="../../wp/f/Finland.htm" title="Finland">Finland</a> before being assembled in Addis Ababa. It is used for large meetings and conventions. Near Bole International Airport is the new Medhane Alem (Savior of the World) Cathedral, which is the second largest in Africa.
