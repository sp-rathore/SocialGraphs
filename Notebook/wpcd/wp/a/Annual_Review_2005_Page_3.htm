<h2>Annual Review 2005</h2>
<img src="../../wp/s/SOS_Childrens_Villages_img_3.jpg" width="163" height="200" alt="a strong and caring relationship" class="right" /><p><strong>Our Vision</strong> </p><p>Our vision is that every child should grow with love, respect and security. </p><p><strong>Our Mission</strong> </p><p><em>We build families for children in need,</em><br />We give orphaned and abandoned children the opportunity to grow up with the love and security of an SOS Mother, together with brothers and sisters. </p><p><em>help them shape their own futures,</em><br />We enable children to live according to their own culture and religion. By helping them to recognise and express their individual abilities, interests and talents, they can become active members of the community. </p><p><em>and share in the development of their communities.</em><br />We work with local communities to establish support programmes and provide healthcare and education, strengthening families and community networks for the future.</p><h3>Who we are</h3>
<img src="../../wp/u/Untitled8.jpg" width="500" height="301" alt="An increase in the number of donations in 2005 means we are nearing our target of supporting 80,000" class="left" /><p>SOS Children pioneered a family-based approach to the long-term care of orphaned and abandoned children who had lost their families and homes as a result of the Second World War. </p><p>Traditionally, we provide our children with a home, a family and a new mother in a purpose-built local children&rsquo;s village.  However, the sheer number of orphans has led us to find new ways of supporting child-headed families.</p><p>We look after children who have lost their parents through war, famine, disease and poverty.  In total we care for over 60,000 children directly in children&rsquo;s villages and we support more than 900,000 in the community through SOS schools, vocational training centres, social support programmes and medical centres. </p><p>We help children who are orphaned, abandoned or whose families are unable to care for them. We give these children an opportunity to build lasting relationships within a family and ensure that they receive the education and skills training that they need to become successful and contributing members of society.</p><p><a href="../../wp/a/Annual_Review_2005_Page_2.htm">previous page of annual review</a> - <a href="../../wp/a/Annual_Review_2005_Page_4.htm">next page of annual review</a></p>
