      <p><b>Aesthetics</b> (also spelled <b>esthetics</b> or <b>&aelig;sthetics</b>) is a branch of <!--del_lnk--> value theory which studies <!--del_lnk--> sensory or sensori-emotional values, sometimes called <!--del_lnk--> judgments of <!--del_lnk--> sentiment or <!--del_lnk--> taste. Aesthetics is closely associated with the philosophy of <a href="../../wp/a/Art.htm" title="Art">art</a>.<p>

      <p>The term aesthetics comes from the <!--del_lnk--> Greek <i><span class="polytonic" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&alpha;&#x1F30;&sigma;&theta;&eta;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#x3AE;</span></i> &quot;aisthetike&quot; and was coined by the philosopher <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten in 1735 to mean &quot;the science of how things are known via the senses.&quot; The term aesthetics was used in <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a>, shortly after Baumgarten introduced its Latin form (<i>Aesthetica</i>), but was not widely used in <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> until the beginning of the 19th century. However, much the same study was called studying the &quot;standards of taste&quot; or &quot;judgments of taste&quot; in English, following the vocabulary set by <a href="../../wp/d/David_Hume.htm" title="David Hume">David Hume</a> prior to the introduction of the term &quot;aesthetics.&quot;<p><a id="What_is_an_aesthetic_judgment.3F" name="What_is_an_aesthetic_judgment.3F"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">What is an aesthetic judgment?</span></h2>

      <p>Judgments of aesthetic value clearly rely on our ability to discriminate at a sensory level. Aesthetics examines what makes something <!--del_lnk--> beautiful, <!--del_lnk--> sublime, <!--del_lnk--> disgusting, fun, <!--del_lnk--> cute, silly, <!--del_lnk--> entertaining, pretentious, <!--del_lnk--> discordant, <!--del_lnk--> harmonious, <!--del_lnk--> boring, <a href="../../wp/h/Humour.htm" title="Humor">humorous</a>, or <!--del_lnk--> tragic. A wine-drinker with an unrefined palate may miss much of the subtlety of a fine vintage.<p>Aesthetic judgments usually go beyond sensory discrimination. For <a href="../../wp/d/David_Hume.htm" title="David Hume">David Hume</a>, delicacy of taste is not merely &quot;the ability to detect all the ingredients in a composition&quot; but also our sensibility &quot;to pains as well as pleasures, which escape the rest of mankind.&quot; Thus, the sensory discrimination is linked to capacity to pleasure. For <a href="../../wp/i/Immanuel_Kant.htm" title="Immanuel Kant">Immanuel Kant</a> &quot;enjoyment&quot; is the result when pleasure arises from sensation, but judging something to be &quot;beautiful&quot; has a third requirement: sensation must give rise to pleasure by engaging our capacities of reflective contemplation. Judgments of beauty are sensory, emotional, and intellectual all at once.<p><a id="What_factors_go_into_an_aesthetic_judgment.3F" name="What_factors_go_into_an_aesthetic_judgment.3F"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">What factors go into an aesthetic judgment?</span></h3>

      <p>Judgments of aesthetic value seem to often involve many other kinds of issues as well. Responses such as disgust show that sensory detection is linked in instinctual ways to facial expressions, and even behaviors like the gag reflex. Yet disgust can often be a learned or cultural issue too; as Darwin pointed out, seeing a stripe of soup in a man&#39;s beard is disgusting even though soup is not itself disgusting. Aesthetic judgments may be linked to emotions or, like emotions, partially embodied in our physical reactions. Seeing a sublime view of a landscape may give us a reaction of awe, which might manifest physically as an increased heart rate or widened eyes. These subconscious reactions may even be partly constitutive of what makes our judgment a judgment that the landscape is sublime.<p>Likewise, aesthetic judgments may be culturally conditioned to some extent. Victorians in Britain often saw African sculpture as ugly, but just a few decades later, Edwardian audiences saw the same sculptures as being beautiful. Evaluations of beauty may well be linked to desirability, perhaps even to sexual desirability. Thus, judgments of aesthetic value can become linked to judgments of economic, political, or moral value. We might judge a <!--del_lnk--> Lamborghini to be beautiful partly because it is desirable as a status symbol, or we might judge it to be repulsive partly because it signifies for us over-consumption of gasoline and offends our political or moral values.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Aesthetic judgments can often be very fine-grained and internally contradictory. Likewise aesthetic judgments seem to often be at least partly intellectual and interpretative. It is what a thing means or symbolizes for us that is often what we are judging. Modern aestheticians have asserted that will and desire were almost dormant in aesthetic experience yet preference and choice have seemed important aesthetics to some 20th century thinkers. Thus aesthetic judgments might be seen to be based on the senses, emotions, intellectual opinions, will, desires, culture, preferences, values, subconscious behaviour, conscious decision, training, instinct, sociological institutions, or some complex combination of these, depending on exactly which theory one employs.<p><a id="Are_different_art_forms_beautiful.2C_disgusting.2C_or_boring_in_the_same_way.3F" name="Are_different_art_forms_beautiful.2C_disgusting.2C_or_boring_in_the_same_way.3F"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Are different art forms beautiful, disgusting, or boring in the same way?</span></h3>
      <p>A third major topic in the study of aesthetic judgment is how they are unified across art forms. We can call a person, a house, a symphony, a fragrance, and a mathematical proof beautiful. What characteristics do they share which give them that status? What possible feature could a proof and a fragrance both share in virtue of which they both count as beautiful? What makes a painting beautiful may be quite different from what makes music beautiful, which suggests that each art form has its own system for the judgement of aesthetics.<p>Or, perhaps the identification of beauty is a conditioned response, built into a culture or context. Is there some underlying unity to aesthetic judgment and is there some way to articulate the similarities of a beautiful house, beautiful proof, and beautiful sunset? Likewise there has been long debate on how perception of beauty in the natural world, especially including perceiving the human form as beautiful, is supposed to relate to perceiving beauty in <a href="../../wp/a/Art.htm" title="Art">art</a> or <!--del_lnk--> artifacts.<p><a id="Aesthetics_and_the_philosophy_of_art" name="Aesthetics_and_the_philosophy_of_art"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Aesthetics and the philosophy of art</span></h2>

      <p>It is not uncommon to find aesthetics used as a synonym for the philosophy of <a href="../../wp/a/Art.htm" title="Art">art</a>, although it is also not uncommon to find thinkers insisting that we distinguish these two closely related fields.<p><a id="What_counts_as_.22art.3F.22" name="What_counts_as_.22art.3F.22"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">What counts as &quot;art?&quot;</span></h3>
      <p>How best to define the term &ldquo;art&rdquo; is a subject of much contention; many books and journal articles have been published arguing over even the basics of what we mean by the term &ldquo;art&rdquo;. Theodor Adorno claimed in 1969 &ldquo;It is self-evident that nothing concerning art is self-evident any more.&rdquo; Indeed, it is not even clear anymore who has the right to define art. Artists, philosophers, anthropologists, psychologists and even programmers all use the notion of art in their respective fields, and give it operational definitions that are not very similar to each others. Further it is clear that even the basic meaning of the term &quot;<a href="../../wp/a/Art.htm" title="Art">art</a>&quot; has changed several times over the centuries, and has changed within the 20th century as well.<p>The main recent sense of the word &ldquo;art&rdquo; is roughly as an abbreviation for <i><b>creative art</b></i> or &ldquo;<a href="../../wp/f/Fine_art.htm" title="Fine art">fine art</a>.&rdquo; Here we mean that skill is being used to express the artist&rsquo;s creativity, or to engage the audience&rsquo;s aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of the &ldquo;finer&rdquo; things. Often, if the skill is being used in a lowbrow or practical way, people will consider it a <!--del_lnk--> craft instead of art, yet many thinkers have defended practical and lowbrow forms as being just as much art as the more lofty forms. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way it may be considered <!--del_lnk--> design instead of art, or contrariwise these may be defended as art forms, perhaps called <!--del_lnk--> applied art. Some thinkers, for instance, have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference.<p>Even as late as 1912 it was normal in the West to assume that all art aims at beauty, and thus that anything that wasn&#39;t trying to be beautiful couldn&#39;t count as art. The <a href="../../wp/c/Cubism.htm" title="Cubism">cubists</a>, <a href="../../wp/d/Dada.htm" title="Dada">dadaists</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Igor_Stravinsky.htm" title="Igor Stravinsky">Stravinsky</a>, and many later art movements struggled against this conception that beauty was central to the definition of art, with such success that, according to Danto, &ldquo;Beauty had disappeared not only from the advanced art of the 1960&rsquo;s but from the advanced philosophy of art of that decade as well.&rdquo; Perhaps some notion like &ldquo;expression&rdquo; (in <!--del_lnk--> Croce&rsquo;s theories) or &ldquo;counter-environment&rdquo; (in <!--del_lnk--> McLuhan&rsquo;s theory) can replace the previous role of beauty.<p>Perhaps (as in <!--del_lnk--> Kennick&#39;s theory) no definition of art is possible anymore. Perhaps art should be thought of as a cluster of related concepts in a <a href="../../wp/l/Ludwig_Wittgenstein.htm" title="Ludwig Wittgenstein">Wittgensteinian</a> fashion (as in <!--del_lnk--> Weitz or <!--del_lnk--> Beuys). Another approach is to say that &ldquo;art&rdquo; is basically a sociological category, that whatever art schools and museums and artists get away with is considered art regardless of formal definitions. This &quot;institutional definition of art&quot; has been championed by <!--del_lnk--> George Dickie. Most people did not consider the depiction of a <!--del_lnk--> Brillo Box or a store-bought <!--del_lnk--> urinal to be art until <a href="../../wp/a/Andy_Warhol.htm" title="Andy Warhol">Andy Warhol</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Marcel Duchamp (respectively) placed them in the context of art (i.e., the <!--del_lnk--> art gallery), which then provided the association of these objects with the values that define art.<p>Proceduralists often suggest that it is the process by which a work of art is created or viewed that makes it art, not any inherent feature of an object, or how well received it is by the institutions of the art world after its introduction to society at large. For <!--del_lnk--> John Dewey, for instance, if the writer intended a piece to be a poem, it is one whether other poets acknowledge it or not. Whereas if exactly the same set of words was written by a journalist, intending them as shorthand notes to help him write a longer article later, these would not be a poem. <a href="../../wp/l/Leo_Tolstoy.htm" title="Leo Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a>, on the other hand, claims that what makes something art or not is how it is experienced by its audience, not by the intention of its creator. Functionalists like <!--del_lnk--> Monroe Beardsley argue that whether or not a piece counts as art depends on what function it plays in a particular context; the same Greek vase may play a non-artistic function in one context (carrying wine), and an artistic function in another context (helping us to appreciate the beauty of the human figure). &#39;<p><a id="What_should_we_judge_when_we_judge_art.3F" name="What_should_we_judge_when_we_judge_art.3F"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">What should we judge when we judge art?</span></h3>
      <p>Art can be tricky at the metaphysical and ontological levels as well as at the value theory level. When we see a performance of <!--del_lnk--> Hamlet, how many works of art are we experiencing, and which should we judge? Perhaps there is only one relevant work of art, the whole performance, which many different people have contributed to, and which will exist briefly and then disappear. Perhaps the manuscript by Shakespeare is a distinct work of art from the play by the troupe, which is also distinct from the performance of the play by this troupe on this night, and all three can be judged, but are to be judged by different standards.<p>Perhaps every person involved should be judged separately on his or her own merits, and each costume or line is its own work of art (with perhaps the director having the job of unifying them all). Similar problems arise for music, film and even painting. Am I to judge the painting itself, the work of the painter, or perhaps the painting in its context of presentation by the museum workers?<p>These problems have been made even thornier by the rise of <!--del_lnk--> conceptual art since the 1960s. Warhol&rsquo;s famous <!--del_lnk--> Brillo Boxes are nearly indistinguishable from actual Brillo boxes at the time. It would be a mistake to praise Warhol for the design of his boxes (which were designed by James Harvey), yet the conceptual move of exhibiting these boxes as art in a museum together with other kinds of paintings is Warhol&#39;s. Are we judging Warhol&rsquo;s concept? His execution of the concept in the medium? The curator&rsquo;s insight in letting Warhol display the boxes? The overall result? Our experience or interpretation of the result? Ontologically, how are we to think of the work of art? Is it a physical object? Several objects? A class of objects? A mental object? A fictional object? An abstract object? An event?<p><a id="What_should_art_be_like.3F" name="What_should_art_be_like.3F"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">What should art be like?</span></h3>

      <p>Many goals have been argued for art, and aestheticians often argue that some goal or another is superior in some way. <!--del_lnk--> Clement Greenberg, for instance, argued in 1960 that each artistic medium should seek that which makes it unique among the possible mediums and then purify itself of anything other than expression of its own uniqueness as a form. The <a href="../../wp/d/Dada.htm" title="Dada">Dadaist</a> <!--del_lnk--> Tristan Tzara on the other hand saw the function of art in 1918 as the destruction of a mad social order. &ldquo;We must sweep and clean. Affirm the cleanliness of the individual after the state of madness, aggressive complete madness of a world abandoned to the hands of bandits.&rdquo; Formal goals, creative goals, self-expression, political goals, spiritual goals, philosophical goals, and even more perceptual or aesthetic goals have all been popular pictures of what art should be like.<p><a id="What_is_the_value_of_art.3F" name="What_is_the_value_of_art.3F"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">What is the value of art?</span></h3>
      <p>Closely related to the question of what art should be like is the question of what its value is. Is art a means of gaining knowledge of some special kind? Does it give insight into the human condition? How does art relate to <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">science</a> or <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religion</a>? Is art perhaps a tool of education, or indoctrination, or enculturation? Does art make us more moral? Can it uplift us spiritually? Is art perhaps politics by other means? Is there some value to sharing or expressing emotions? Might the value of art for the artist be quite different than it is for the audience?<p>Might the value of art to society be quite different than its value to individuals? Do the values of arts differ significantly from form to form? Working on the intended value of art tends to help define the relations between art and other endeavors. Art clearly does have spiritual goals in many settings, but then what exactly is the difference between religious art and religion <i>per se</i>? Is every religious ritual a piece of performance art, so that religious ritual is simply a subset of art?<p><a id="History_of_Aesthetics" name="History_of_Aesthetics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History of Aesthetics</span></h2>

      <p>We have examples of <!--del_lnk--> pre-historic art, but they are rare, and the context of their production and use is not very clear, so we can little more than guess at the aesthetic doctrines that guided their production and interpretation.<p><!--del_lnk--> Ancient art was largely, but not entirely, based on the six great ancient civilizations: <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Mesopotamia.htm" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Greece</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Rome</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Indus_Valley_Civilization.htm" title="Indus Valley Civilization">India</a>, and <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>. Each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art. Greece had the most influence on the development of aesthetics in the West. This period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of corresponding skills to show musculature, poise, beauty and anatomically correct proportions.<p><a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Greek</a> philosophers initially felt that aesthetically appealing objects were beautiful in and of themselves. <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a> felt that beautiful objects incorporated proportion, <!--del_lnk--> harmony, and unity among their parts. Similarly, in the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Metaphysics&quot; <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> found that the universal elements of beauty were order, <a href="../../wp/s/Symmetry.htm" title="Symmetry">symmetry</a>, and definiteness.<p><a id="Non-Western_aesthetics" name="Non-Western_aesthetics"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Non-Western aesthetics</span></h3>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> Islamic art early aesthetics rejected portrayal of Allah, human beings, or created beings (as these might tempt people into idolatry), although these <!--del_lnk--> aniconist strictures were gradually loosened and only the strictest of Muslims reject human portraiture today. Further, Allah was taken to be immune to representation via imagery. So Islamic aesthetics emphasized the decorative function of art, or its religious functions via non-representational forms. Geometric patterns, floral patterns, <!--del_lnk--> arabesques, and abstract forms were common, as was calligraphy. Order and unity were common themes.<p><!--del_lnk--> Indian art evolved with an emphasis on inducing special spiritual or philosophical states in the audience, or with representing them symbolically. According to <!--del_lnk--> Kapila Vatsyayan, &quot;Classical <!--del_lnk--> Indian architecture, <!--del_lnk--> sculpture, <!--del_lnk--> painting, <!--del_lnk--> literature (kaavya), <!--del_lnk--> music, and <!--del_lnk--> dancing evolved their own rules conditioned by their respective media, but they shared with one another not only the underlying spiritual beliefs of the Indian religio-philosophic mind, but also the procedures by which the relationships of the symbol and the spiritual states were worked out in detail.&quot;<p><!--del_lnk--> Chinese art has a long history of varied styles and emphases. In ancient times philosophers were already arguing about aesthetics. <a href="../../wp/c/Confucius.htm" title="Confucius">Confucius</a> emphasized the role of the arts and humanities (especially music and poetry) in broadening human nature and aiding &ldquo;li&rdquo; (etiquette, the rites) in bringing us back to what is essential about humanity. His opponent <!--del_lnk--> Mozi, however, argued that music and fine arts were classist and wasteful, benefiting the rich but not the common people.<p>By the 4th century CE, artists were debating in writing over the proper goals of art as well. <!--del_lnk--> Gu Kaizhi has 3 surviving books on this theory of painting, for example, and it&#39;s not uncommon to find later artist/scholars who both create art and write about the creating of art. Religious and philosophical influence on art was common (and diverse) but never universal; it is easy to find art that largely ignores philosophy and religion in almost every Chinese time period.<p>Sub-Saharan <!--del_lnk--> African art existed in many forms and styles prior to colonialization, and with fairly little influence from outside Africa. Most of it followed traditional forms and the aesthetic norms were handed down orally rather than being committed to writing. Sculpture and performance art are prominent, and abstract and partially abstracted forms are valued, and were valued long before influence from the Western tradition began in earnest.<p><a id="Western_medieval_aesthetics" name="Western_medieval_aesthetics"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Western medieval aesthetics</span></h3>

      <p>Surviving <!--del_lnk--> medieval art is highly religious in focus, and typically was funded by the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Church</a>, powerful ecclesiastical individuals, or wealthy secular patrons. Often the pieces have an intended liturgical function, such as altar pieces or statuary. Realism was typically not an important goal, but being religiously uplifting was.<p>Reflection on the nature and function of art and aesthetic experiences follows similar lines. St. <!--del_lnk--> Bonaventure&rsquo;s &ldquo;Retracing the Arts to Theology&rdquo; is typical and discusses the skills of the artisan as gifts given by God for the purpose of disclosing God to mankind via four &ldquo;lights&rdquo;: the light of skill in mechanical arts which discloses the world of artifacts, as guided by the light of sense perception which discloses the world of natural forms, as guided by the light of philosophy which discloses the world of intellectual truth, as guided by the light of divine wisdom which discloses the world of saving truth.<p>As the medieval world shifts into the <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> art again returns to focus on this world and on secular issues of human life. The philosophy of art of the ancient Greeks and Romans is re-appropriated.<p><a id="Modern_aesthetics" name="Modern_aesthetics"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Modern aesthetics</span></h3>
      <p>From the late 17th to the early 20th century Western aesthetics underwent a slow revolution into what is often called <!--del_lnk--> modernism. <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">German</a> and <!--del_lnk--> British thinkers emphasized <!--del_lnk--> beauty as the key component of art and of the aesthetic experience, and saw art as necessarily aiming at beauty.<p>For <!--del_lnk--> Baumgarten aesthetics is the science of the sense experiences, a younger sister of logic, and beauty is thus the most perfect kind of knowledge that sense experience can have. For <a href="../../wp/i/Immanuel_Kant.htm" title="Immanuel Kant">Kant</a> the aesthetic experience of beauty is a judgment of a subjective but universal truth, since all people should agree that &ldquo;this <!--del_lnk--> rose is beautiful&rdquo; if it in fact is. However, beauty cannot be reduced to any more basic set of features. For <!--del_lnk--> Schiller aesthetic appreciation of beauty is the most perfect reconciliation of the sensual and rational parts of human nature.<p>For <!--del_lnk--> Hegel all culture is a matter of &quot;absolute spirit&quot; coming to be manifest to itself, stage by stage. Art is the first stage in which the absolute spirit is manifest immediately to sense-perception, and is thus an objective rather than subjective revelation of beauty. For <!--del_lnk--> Schopenhauer aesthetic contemplation of beauty is the most free that the pure intellect can be from the dictates of will; here we contemplate perfection of form without any kind of worldly agenda, and thus any intrusion of utility or politics would ruin the point of the beauty.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The British were largely divided into intuitionist and analytic camps. The intuitionists believed that aesthetic experience was disclosed by a single mental faculty of some kind. For the <a href="../../wp/e/Earl_of_Shaftesbury.htm" title="Earl of Shaftesbury">Earl of Shaftesbury</a> this was identical to the moral sense, beauty just is the sensory version of moral goodness.<p>For <!--del_lnk--> Hutcheson beauty is disclosed by an inner mental sense, but is a subjective fact rather than an objective one. Analytic theorists like <!--del_lnk--> Lord Kames, <a href="../../wp/w/William_Hogarth.htm" title="William Hogarth">William Hogarth</a>, and <a href="../../wp/e/Edmund_Burke.htm" title="Edmund Burke">Edmund Burke</a> hoped to reduce beauty to some list of attributes. Hogarth, for example, thinks that beauty consists of (1) fitness of the parts to some design; (2) variety in as many ways as possible; (3) uniformity, regularity or symmetry, which is only beautiful when it helps to preserve the character of fitness; (4) simplicity or distinctness, which gives pleasure not in itself, but through its enabling the eye to enjoy variety with ease; (5) intricacy, which provides employment for our active energies, leading the eye &quot;a wanton kind of chase&quot;; and (6) quantity or magnitude, which draws our attention and produces admiration and awe. Later analytic aestheticians strove to link beauty to some scientific theory of psychology (such as <!--del_lnk--> James Mill) or biology (such as <!--del_lnk--> Herbert Spencer).<p><a id="Post-modern_aesthetics" name="Post-modern_aesthetics"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Post-modern aesthetics</span></h3>
      <p>As late as the <!--del_lnk--> Bloomsbury Group or <!--del_lnk--> Roger Fry&rsquo;s exhibitions of &ldquo;Post-Impressionist&rdquo; art in 1910 and 1912 there is a pervasive assumption in the West that all art does and should aim at beauty, although <!--del_lnk--> Matisse and others are beginning to challenge this. Over the 20th century there is a fairly steady revolt against beauty as the cornerstone of aesthetics or art. Often attempts to integrate the aesthetic sensibilities of Western and non-Western cultures are an important component of post-modern aesthetics. Various attempts have been made to replace the central role of beauty with some other notion that can hold art and aesthetics together.<p><!--del_lnk--> Croce suggested that &ldquo;expression&rdquo; is central in the way that beauty was once thought to be central. <!--del_lnk--> George Dickie suggested that the sociological institutions of the art world were the glue binding art and sensibility into unities. <!--del_lnk--> Marshall McLuhan suggested that art always functions as a &quot;counter-environment&quot; designed to make visible what is usually invisible about a society. <!--del_lnk--> Theodor Adorno felt that aesthetics could not proceed without confronting the role of the culture industry in the commodification of art and aesthetic experience.<p><a id="Aesthetics_in_particular_fields_and_art_forms" name="Aesthetics_in_particular_fields_and_art_forms"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Aesthetics in particular fields and art forms</span></h2>

      <p>Aesthetic considerations within the <a href="../../wp/v/Visual_arts.htm" title="Visual arts">visual arts</a> are usually associated with the sense of <!--del_lnk--> vision. A painting or sculpture, however, is also perceived spatially by recognized associations and context, and even to some extent by the senses of smell, hearing, and touch. The form of the work can be subject to an aesthetic as much as the content.<p>In painting, the aesthetic convention that we see a three-dimensional representation rather than a two-dimensional canvas is so well understood that most people do not realize that they are making an aesthetic interpretation. This notion is the basis of <!--del_lnk--> abstract impressionism. In the United States during the postwar period, the &quot;push-pull&quot; theories of <!--del_lnk--> Hans Hofmann, positing a relation between colour and perceived depth, strongly influenced a generation of prominent abstract painters, many of whom studied under Hofmann and were generally associated with <!--del_lnk--> abstract expressionism. Hofmann&#39;s general attitude toward abstraction as virtually a moral imperative for the serious painter was also extremely influential.<p>
       <br /> Some aesthetic effects available in visual arts include variation, juxtaposition, repetition, field effects, symmetry/asymmetry, perceived mass, subliminal structure, linear dynamics, tension and repose, pattern, contrast, perspective, 3 dimensionality, movement, rhythm, unity/Gestalt, matrixiality and proportion.<p><a id="Maps" name="Maps"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Maps</span></h3>

      <p>Aesthetics in cartography relates to the visual experience of map reading and can take two forms: responses to the map itself as an aesthetic object (e.g., through detail, colour, and form) and also the subject of the map symbolised, often the landscape (e.g., a particular expression of terrain which forms an imagined visual experience of the aesthetic).<p>Cartographers make aesthetic judgments when designing maps to ensure that the content forms a clear expression of the theme(s). Antique maps are perhaps especially revered due to their aesthetic value, which may seem to be derived from their styles of ornamentation. As such, aesthetics are often wrongly considered to be a by-product of design. If it is taken that aesthetic judgments are produced within a certain social context, they are fundamental to the cartographer&#39;s symbolisation and as such are integral to the function of maps.<p><a id="Music" name="Music"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Music</span></h3>

      <p>Beyond providing functional characteristics, designers heed many aesthetic qualities to improve the marketability of manufactured products: smoothness, shininess/reflectivity, texture, pattern, curviness, colour, simplicity, usability, velocity, symmetry, naturalness, and modernism. The staff of the Design Aesthetics section focuses on design, appearance and the way people perceive products. Design aesthetics is interested in the appearance of products; the explanation and meaning of this appearance is studied mainly in terms of social and cultural factors. The distinctive focus of the section is research and education in the field of sensory modalities in relation to product design. These fields of attention generate design baggage that enables engineers to design products, systems, and services, and match them to the correct field of use.<p><a id="Architecture_and_interior_design" name="Architecture_and_interior_design"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Architecture and interior design</span></h3>
