<h2>MOZAMBIQUE</h2>
<p>HIV/AIDS is one of the greatest challenges facing Mozambique.  The HIV/AIDS prevalence rate continues to increase.  According to UNICEF, 12% of 15- to 49-year-olds are estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS, as are more than 90,000 children under age 15. Less than 3% of eligible children are receiving antiretroviral treatment.  470,000 children are so-called AIDS orphans, nearly a third of all orphans.  The problems are not helped by the fact that less than 40% of the people has access to basic health services, largely due to a shortage of trained medical personnel.</p><p>SOS Children has been working in Mozambique since 1987 in three locations - Maputo, Pemba and Tete.  Since 2002, there has been an extra focus on strengthening families and preventing abandonment, especially among families of orphaned and vulnerable children affected by HIV/AIDS.  SOS Children works in partnership with a number of organisations including the Ministry of Health, the HIV/AIDS control commission and Medicine Sans Frontieres.</p><h3>MAPUTO</h3>
<p>In 2002, the SOS Social Centre in Maputo began working specifically to help families in the local community affected by HIV/AIDS.  The aim is to support families so they are strengthened and to help children to grow up with their biological families. The care is home-based and aims to improve the living conditions of the families and to give them psycho-social support.  The SOS Social Centre also supports two community kindergartens for between 100 and 120 children in each.  Children are given a proper meal based on the doctor&rsquo;s recommendations.  2,000 children and their families receive support through this outreach programme.  </p><p>The HIV/AIDS programme focuses on prevention and awareness through public education involving the local community.   The social centre through community volunteers gives out information at health centres and schools where both old and young are able to get HIV/AIDS information and counselling.  Awareness events are held in public places such as the social centre and markets and draw large crowds of both young and old. </p><p>The programme also provides practical care and support to families living with HIV/AIDS.  This support includes a monthly food parcel consisting of rice, maize meal, sugar, cooking oil and beans.  20 volunteers from the local community run counselling sessions during the weekly home visits.</p><h3>PEMBA</h3>
<p>The SOS Social Centre opened in 2002.  Like the SOS Social Centre, Maputo, the SOS Social Centre in Pemba helps families in the local community affected by HIV/AIDS.  The aim is to support families so they are strengthened and to help children to grow up with their biological families. The care is home-based and aims to improve the living conditions of the families and to give them psycho-social support.  The SOS Social Centre also supports two community kindergartens for between 100 and 120 children in each.  Children are given a proper meal based on the doctor&rsquo;s recommendations.  2,000 children and their families receive support through this outreach programme.</p><h3>TETE</h3>
<p>In 2004 the SOS Social Centre, Tete opened, giving help to families in the local community affected by HIV/AIDS.   The aim is to support families so they are strengthened and to help children to grow up with their biological families.  The care is primarily home-based.  It also supports a number of community kindergartens, provides meals for between 100 and 120 children at each and supports a school placement programme. In addition families are supported in income generating activities.  Up to 2,000 children and their families receive support through this outreach programme.</p>
