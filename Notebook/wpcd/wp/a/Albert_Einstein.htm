      <p><b>Einstein</b> was born on <!--del_lnk--> March 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1879, around 11:30 AM <!--del_lnk--> LMT, to a <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> family, in the city of <!--del_lnk--> Ulm in <!--del_lnk--> W&uuml;rttemberg, <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>, about 100 km east of <a href="../../wp/s/Stuttgart.htm" title="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a>. His father was Hermann Einstein, a salesman who later ran an <!--del_lnk--> electrochemical works, and his mother was Pauline <i>n&eacute;e</i> Koch. They were married in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt.<p>At his birth, Albert&#39;s mother was reputedly frightened that her infant&#39;s head was so large and oddly shaped. Though the size of his head appeared to be less remarkable as he grew older, it&#39;s evident from photographs of Einstein that his head was disproportionately large for his body throughout his life, a trait regarded as &quot;benign <!--del_lnk--> macrocephaly&quot; in large-headed individuals with no related disease or cognitive deficits.<p>Another more famous aspect of Einstein&#39;s childhood is the fact that he spoke much later than the average child. Einstein claimed that he did not begin speaking until the age of three and only did so hesitantly, even beyond the age of nine (see &quot;Speculation and controversy&quot; section). Because of Einstein&#39;s late speech development and his later childhood tendency to ignore any subject in school that bored him &mdash; instead focusing intensely only on what interested him &mdash; some observers at the time suggested that he might be &quot;retarded&quot;, such as one of the Einstein family&#39;s housekeepers. This latter observation was not the only time in his life that controversial labels and <!--del_lnk--> pathology would be applied to Einstein. (See again, &quot;Speculation and controversy&quot;.)<p>Albert&#39;s family members were all non-observant <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jew">Jews</a> and he attended a <!--del_lnk--> Catholic elementary school. At the insistence of his mother, he was given <!--del_lnk--> violin lessons. Though he initially disliked the lessons, and eventually discontinued them, he would later take great solace in <a href="../../wp/w/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart.htm" title="Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart">Mozart</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> violin sonatas.<p>When Einstein was five, his father showed him a small pocket <!--del_lnk--> compass, and Einstein realized that something in &quot;empty&quot; space acted upon the needle; he would later describe the experience as one of the most revelatory events of his life. He built <!--del_lnk--> models and <!--del_lnk--> mechanical devices for fun and showed great mathematical ability early on.<p>In 1889, a medical student named Max Talmud (later: Talmey), who visited the Einsteins on Thursday nights for six years, introduced Einstein to key science and philosophy texts, including <a href="../../wp/i/Immanuel_Kant.htm" title="Immanuel Kant">Kant&#39;s</a> <i><!--del_lnk--> Critique of Pure Reason</i>. Two of his uncles would further foster his intellectual interests during his late childhood and early adolescence by recommending and providing books on science, mathematics and philosophy.<p>Einstein attended the <!--del_lnk--> Luitpold Gymnasium, where he received a relatively progressive education. He began to learn <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> around age twelve; in 1891, he taught himself <a href="../../wp/e/Euclidean_geometry.htm" title="Euclidean geometry">Euclidean plane geometry</a> from a school booklet and began to study <a href="../../wp/c/Calculus.htm" title="Calculus">calculus</a>; Einstein realized the power of axiomatic <!--del_lnk--> deductive reasoning from <a href="../../wp/e/Euclid.htm" title="Euclid">Euclid</a>&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Elements</i>, which Einstein called the &quot;holy little geometry book&quot; (given by Max Talmud). While at the Gymnasium, Einstein clashed with authority and resented the school regimen, believing that the spirit of learning and creative thought were lost in such endeavors as strict <!--del_lnk--> memorization.<p>In 1894, following the failure of Hermann Einstein&#39;s electrochemical business, the Einsteins moved from <a href="../../wp/m/Munich.htm" title="Munich">Munich</a> to <!--del_lnk--> Pavia, a city in <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> near <a href="../../wp/m/Milan.htm" title="Milan">Milan</a>. Einstein&#39;s first scientific work, called &quot;<i>The Investigation of the State of <!--del_lnk--> Aether in <!--del_lnk--> Magnetic Fields</i>&quot;, was written contemporaneously for one of his uncles. Albert remained behind in Munich lodgings to finish school, completing only one term before leaving the <!--del_lnk--> gymnasium in the spring of 1895 to rejoin his family in Pavia. He quit a year and a half prior to final examinations without telling his parents, convincing the school to let him go with a medical note from a friendly doctor, but this meant that he had no <!--del_lnk--> secondary-school certificate. That year, at the age of 16, he performed the <!--del_lnk--> thought experiment known as &quot;Albert Einstein&#39;s mirror&quot;. After gazing into a mirror, he examined what would happen to his image if he were moving at the <a href="../../wp/s/Speed_of_light.htm" title="Speed of light">speed of light</a>; his conclusion, that the speed of light is independent of the observer, would later become one of the two <!--del_lnk--> postulates of special relativity.<p>Although he excelled in the mathematics and science part of entrance examinations for the <!--del_lnk--> Federal Polytechnic Institute in <a href="../../wp/z/Z%25C3%25BCrich.htm" title="Z&uuml;rich">Z&uuml;rich</a>, today the <!--del_lnk--> ETH Z&uuml;rich, his failure of the liberal arts portion was a setback; his family sent him to <!--del_lnk--> Aarau, <a href="../../wp/s/Switzerland.htm" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> to finish secondary school, and it became clear that he was not going to be an <a href="../../wp/e/Electrical_engineering.htm" title="Electrical engineering">electrical engineer</a> as his father intended for him. There, he studied the seldom-taught <a href="../../wp/j/James_Clerk_Maxwell.htm" title="James Clerk Maxwell">Maxwell&#39;s</a> <!--del_lnk--> electromagnetic theory and received his diploma in September 1896. During this time, he lodged with Professor Jost Winteler&#39;s family and became enamoured with Sofia Marie-Jeanne Amanda Winteler, commonly referred to as Sofie or Marie, their daughter and his first sweetheart. Einstein&#39;s sister, Maja, who was perhaps his closest confidant, was to later marry their son, Paul, and his friend, <!--del_lnk--> Michele Besso, married their other daughter, Anna. Einstein subsequently enrolled at the <!--del_lnk--> Federal Polytechnic Institute in October and moved to <a href="../../wp/z/Z%25C3%25BCrich.htm" title="Z&uuml;rich">Z&uuml;rich</a>, while Marie moved to <!--del_lnk--> Olsberg, Switzerland for a teaching post. The same year, he renounced his <!--del_lnk--> W&uuml;rttemberg citizenship.<p>In the spring of 1896, the <a href="../../wp/s/Serbia.htm" title="Serbia">Serbian</a> <!--del_lnk--> Mileva Mari&#x107; started initially as a medical student at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Z&uuml;rich, but after a term switched to the <!--del_lnk--> Federal Polytechnic Institute to study as the only woman that year for the same diploma as Einstein. Mari&#x107;&#39;s relationship with Einstein developed into romance over the next few years, though his mother would cry that she was too old, not Jewish, and physically defective.<p>In 1900, Einstein was granted a teaching diploma by the <!--del_lnk--> Federal Polytechnic Institute. Einstein then submitted his first paper to be published, on the <!--del_lnk--> capillary forces of a drinking straw, titled &quot;<i>Folgerungen aus den Capillarit&auml;tserscheinungen</i>&quot;, which translated is &quot;<i>Consequences of the observations of capillarity phenomena</i>&quot; (found in &quot;<i>Annalen der Physik</i>&quot; volume 4, page 513). In it, he tried to unify the <!--del_lnk--> laws of physics, an attempt he would continually make throughout his life. Through his friend <!--del_lnk--> Michele Besso, an <!--del_lnk--> engineer, Einstein was presented with the works of <!--del_lnk--> Ernst Mach, and would later consider him &quot;the best sounding board in Europe&quot; for physical ideas. During this time, Einstein discussed his scientific interests with a group of close friends, including Besso and Mari&#x107;. The men referred to themselves as the &quot;Olympia Academy&quot;. Einstein and Mari&#x107; had a daughter out of wedlock, <!--del_lnk--> Lieserl Einstein, born in January 1902. Her fate is unknown; some believe she died in infancy, while others believe she was given out for adoption.<p><a id="Works_and_doctorate" name="Works_and_doctorate"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Works and doctorate</span></h3>
      <p>Einstein could not find a teaching post upon graduation, mostly because his brashness as a young man had apparently irritated most of his professors. The father of a classmate helped him obtain employment as a technical assistant <!--del_lnk--> examiner at the Swiss Patent Office in 1902. There, Einstein judged the worth of <!--del_lnk--> inventors&#39; <!--del_lnk--> patent applications for devices that required a knowledge of physics to understand &mdash; in particular he was chiefly charged to evaluate <!--del_lnk--> patents relating to electromagnetic devices. He also learned how to discern the essence of applications despite sometimes poor descriptions, and was taught by the director how &quot;to express [him]self correctly&quot;. He occasionally rectified their design errors while evaluating the practicality of their work.<p>Einstein married <!--del_lnk--> Mileva Mari&#x107; on <!--del_lnk--> January 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1903. Einstein&#39;s marriage to Mari&#x107;, who was a mathematician, was both a personal and intellectual partnership: Einstein referred to Mileva as &quot;a creature who is my equal and who is as strong and independent as I am&quot;. <!--del_lnk--> Ronald W. Clark, a biographer of Einstein, claimed that Einstein depended on the distance that existed in his marriage to Mileva in order to have the solitude necessary to accomplish his work; he required intellectual isolation. <!--del_lnk--> Abram Joffe, a Soviet physicist who knew Einstein, wrote in an obituary of him, &quot;The author of [the papers of 1905] was&hellip; a bureaucrat at the Patent Office in Bern, Einstein-Mari&#x107;&quot; and this has recently been taken as evidence of a collaborative relationship. However, according to Alberto A. Mart&iacute;nez of the Centre for Einstein Studies at <!--del_lnk--> Boston University, Joffe only ascribed authorship to Einstein, as he believed that it was a Swiss custom at the time to append the spouse&#39;s last name to the husband&#39;s name. The extent of her influence on Einstein&#39;s work is a controversial and debated question.<p>In 1903, Einstein&#39;s position at the Swiss Patent Office had been made permanent, though he was passed over for promotion until he had &quot;fully mastered machine technology&quot;. He obtained his <!--del_lnk--> doctorate under <!--del_lnk--> Alfred Kleiner at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Z&uuml;rich after submitting his thesis &quot;<i>A new determination of molecular dimensions</i>&quot; (&quot;<i>Eine neue Bestimmung der Molek&uuml;ldimensionen</i>&quot;) in 1905.<p><a id="Annus_Mirabilis_Papers" name="Annus_Mirabilis_Papers"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Annus Mirabilis Papers</span></h4>
      <p>During 1905, in his spare time, he wrote four articles that participated in the foundation of <!--del_lnk--> modern physics, without much <!--del_lnk--> scientific literature to which he could refer or many scientific colleagues with whom he could discuss the theories. Most physicists agree that three of those papers (on <!--del_lnk--> Brownian motion, the <!--del_lnk--> photoelectric effect, and <a href="../../wp/s/Special_relativity.htm" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a>) deserved <!--del_lnk--> Nobel Prizes. Only the paper on the photoelectric effect would be mentioned by the Nobel committee in the award; at the time of the award, it had the most unchallenged experimental evidence behind it, although the Nobel committee expressed the opinion that Einstein&#39;s other work would be confirmed in due course.<p>Some might regard the award for the photoelectric effect ironic, not only because Einstein is far better-known for relativity, but also because the photoelectric effect is a quantum phenomenon, and Einstein became somewhat disenchanted with the path <a href="../../wp/q/Quantum_mechanics.htm" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum theory</a> would take.<p>Einstein submitted this series of papers to the &quot;<i>Annalen der Physik</i>&quot;. They are commonly referred to as the &quot;<i><!--del_lnk--> Annus Mirabilis Papers</i>&quot; (from <!--del_lnk--> <i>Annus mirabilis</i>, <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> for &#39;year of wonders&#39;). The International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (<!--del_lnk--> IUPAP) commemorated the 100th year of the publication of Einstein&#39;s extensive work in 1905 as the &#39;<!--del_lnk--> World Year of Physics 2005&#39;.<p>The first paper, named &quot;<i>On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light</i>&quot;, (&quot;<i>&Uuml;ber einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt</i>&quot;) was specifically cited for his Nobel Prize. In this paper, Einstein extends <a href="../../wp/m/Max_Planck.htm" title="Max Planck">Planck&#39;s</a> hypothesis (<span class="texhtml"><i>E</i> = <i>h</i>&nu;</span>) of discrete energy elements to his own hypothesis that electromagnetic <a href="../../wp/e/Energy.htm" title="Energy">energy</a> is absorbed or emitted by <a href="../../wp/m/Matter.htm" title="Matter">matter</a> in <!--del_lnk--> quanta of <span class="texhtml"><i>h</i>&nu;</span> (where <i>h</i> is <!--del_lnk--> Planck&#39;s constant and <span class="texhtml">&nu;</span> is the <!--del_lnk--> frequency of the <a href="../../wp/l/Light.htm" title="Light">light</a>), proposing a new law<dl>
       <dd><img alt="E_{\mathrm{max}}  = h\nu - P\," class="tex" src="../../images/88/8816.png" /></dl>
      <p>to account for the <!--del_lnk--> photoelectric effect, as well as other properties of <!--del_lnk--> photoluminescence and <!--del_lnk--> photoionization. In later papers, Einstein used this law to describe the <!--del_lnk--> Volta effect (1906), the production of secondary <!--del_lnk--> cathode rays (1909) and the high-frequency limit of <!--del_lnk--> Bremsstrahlung (1911). Einstein&#39;s key contribution is his assertion that energy quantization is a general, intrinsic property of <a href="../../wp/l/Light.htm" title="Light">light</a>, rather than a particular constraint of the interaction between matter and light, as <a href="../../wp/m/Max_Planck.htm" title="Max Planck">Planck</a> believed. Another, often overlooked result of this paper was Einstein&#39;s excellent estimate (6.17 <img alt="\times" class="tex" src="../../images/88/8827.png" /> 10<sup>23</sup>) of <!--del_lnk--> Avogadro&#39;s number (6.02 <img alt="\times" class="tex" src="../../images/88/8827.png" /> 10<sup>23</sup>). However, Einstein does <i>not</i> propose that light is a particle in this paper; the &quot;photon&quot; concept was not proposed until 1909 (see below).<p>His second article in 1905, named &quot;<i>On the Motion&mdash;Required by the Molecular Kinetic Theory of Heat&mdash;of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid</i>&quot;, (&quot;<i><!--del_lnk--> &Uuml;ber die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der W&auml;rme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Fl&uuml;ssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen</i>&quot;) covered his study of <!--del_lnk--> Brownian motion, and provided empirical evidence for the existence of atoms. Before this paper, <a href="../../wp/a/Atom.htm" title="Atom">atoms</a> were recognized as a useful concept, but <!--del_lnk--> physicists and <!--del_lnk--> chemists hotly debated whether atoms were real entities. Einstein&#39;s statistical discussion of atomic behaviour gave <!--del_lnk--> experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary <a href="../../wp/m/Microscope.htm" title="Microscope">microscope</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Wilhelm Ostwald, one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told <!--del_lnk--> Arnold Sommerfeld that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein&#39;s complete explanation of Brownian motion. Brownian motion was also explained by <!--del_lnk--> Louis Bachelier in 1900.<p>Einstein&#39;s third paper that year, &quot;<i>On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies</i>&quot; (&quot;<i>Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter K&ouml;rper</i>&quot;), was published in June 1905. This paper introduced the <a href="../../wp/s/Special_relativity.htm" title="Special relativity">special theory of relativity</a>, a theory of <a href="../../wp/t/Time.htm" title="Time">time</a>, <!--del_lnk--> distance, mass and energy which was consistent with <!--del_lnk--> electromagnetism, but omitted the force of <a href="../../wp/g/Gravitation.htm" title="Gravity">gravity</a>. While developing this paper, Einstein wrote to Mileva about &quot;our work on relative motion&quot;, and this has led some to speculate that Mileva played a part in its development.<p>A few historians of science believe that Einstein and his wife were both aware that the famous French mathematical physicist <!--del_lnk--> Henri Poincar&eacute; had already published the equations of relativity, a few weeks before Einstein submitted his paper. Most believe their work was independent and varied in many crucial ways, namely, regarding the &quot;ether&quot; (Einstein denied ether, Poincar&eacute; considered it superfluous). Similarly, it is debatable if he knew the 1904 paper of <!--del_lnk--> Hendrik Antoon Lorentz which contained most of the theory and to which Poincar&eacute; referred. Most historians, however, believe that Einsteinian relativity varied in many key ways from other theories of relativity which were circulating at the time, and that many of the questions about priority stem from the misleading trope of portraying Einstein as a genius working in total isolation. Although Einstein discussed physics with Mileva, there is no solid evidence that she made any significant contribution to his work.<p>In a fourth paper, &quot;<i>Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?</i>&quot;, (&quot;<i>Ist die Tr&auml;gheit eines K&ouml;rpers von seinem Energieinhalt abh&auml;ngig?</i>&quot;), published late in 1905, he showed that from relativity&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> axioms, it is possible to deduce the famous equation which shows the equivalence between matter and energy. The <a href="../../wp/e/Energy.htm" title="Energy">energy</a> equivalence (<i>E</i>) of some amount of mass (<i>m</i>) is that mass times the speed of light (<i>c</i>) squared: <!--del_lnk--> <i>E</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>mc</i><sup>2</sup>. However, it was Poincar&eacute; who in 1900 first published the &quot;energy equation&quot; in slightly different form, namely as: <i>m</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>E</i>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<i>c</i><sup>2</sup> &mdash; see also <!--del_lnk--> relativity priority dispute.<p><a id="Middle_years" name="Middle_years"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Middle years</span></h3>

      <p>In 1906, Einstein was promoted to technical examiner second class. In 1908, Einstein was licensed in <!--del_lnk--> Bern, Switzerland, as a <!--del_lnk--> Privatdozent (unsalaried teacher at a university). During this time, Einstein described why the sky is blue in his paper on the phenomenon of <!--del_lnk--> critical opalescence, which shows the cumulative effect of <!--del_lnk--> scattering of light by individual molecules in the atmosphere. In 1911, Einstein became first associate <!--del_lnk--> professor at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Z&uuml;rich, and shortly afterwards full professor at the German language-section of the <!--del_lnk--> Charles University of Prague. While at <a href="../../wp/p/Prague.htm" title="Prague">Prague</a>, Einstein published a paper calling on astronomers to test two predictions of his developing theory of relativity: a bending of light in a gravitational field, measurable at a solar eclipse; and a redshift of solar spectral lines relative to spectral lines produced on Earth&#39;s surface. A young German astronomer, Erwin Freundlich, began collaborating with Einstein and alerted other astronomers around the world about Einstein&#39;s astronomical tests. In 1912, Einstein returned to <a href="../../wp/z/Z%25C3%25BCrich.htm" title="Z&uuml;rich">Z&uuml;rich</a> in order to become full professor at the <!--del_lnk--> ETH Z&uuml;rich. At that time, he worked closely with the <!--del_lnk--> mathematician <!--del_lnk--> Marcel Grossmann, who introduced him to Riemannian geometry. In 1912, Einstein started to refer to <a href="../../wp/t/Time.htm" title="Time">time</a> as the <!--del_lnk--> fourth dimension (although <!--del_lnk--> H.G. Wells had done this earlier, in 1895 in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Time Machine</i>).<p>In 1914, just before the start of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, Einstein settled in <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin.htm" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> as professor at the local <!--del_lnk--> university and became a member of the <!--del_lnk--> Prussian Academy of Sciences. He took <!--del_lnk--> Prussian citizenship. From 1914 to 1933, he served as director of the <!--del_lnk--> Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin. He also held the position of <!--del_lnk--> extraordinary professor at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Leiden from 1920 until 1946, where he regularly gave guest lectures.<p>In 1917, Einstein published <i>&quot;On the Quantum Mechanics of Radiation&quot;</i> (<i>&quot;Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung,&quot;</i> Physkalische Zeitschrift 18, 121&ndash;128). This article introduced the concept of <!--del_lnk--> stimulated emission, the physical principle that allows light amplification in the <!--del_lnk--> laser. He also published a paper that year that used the general theory of relativity to model the behaviour of the entire universe, setting the stage for modern <!--del_lnk--> cosmology. In this work Einstein created the <!--del_lnk--> cosmological constant, which he later considered his &quot;biggest blunder&quot;.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> May 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1904, Albert and Mileva&#39;s first son, <!--del_lnk--> Hans Albert Einstein, was born. Their second son, <!--del_lnk--> Eduard Einstein, was born on <!--del_lnk--> July 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1910. Hans Albert became a professor of <!--del_lnk--> hydraulic engineering at the <!--del_lnk--> University of California, Berkeley, having little interaction with his father, but sharing his love for sailing and music. Eduard, the younger brother, intended to practice as a <!--del_lnk--> Freudian analyst but was institutionalized for <a href="../../wp/s/Schizophrenia.htm" title="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a> and died in an asylum. Einstein divorced Mileva on <!--del_lnk--> February 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1919, and married his cousin Elsa L&ouml;wenthal (born Einstein: L&ouml;wenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on <!--del_lnk--> June 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1919. Elsa was Albert&#39;s first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally). She was three years older than Albert, and had nursed him to health after he had suffered a partial nervous breakdown combined with a severe stomach ailment; there were no children from this marriage.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>In November 1915, Einstein presented a series of lectures before the Prussian Academy of Sciences in which he described a new theory of <a href="../../wp/g/Gravitation.htm" title="Gravity">gravity</a>, known as <!--del_lnk--> general relativity. The final lecture ended with his introduction of an equation that replaced <!--del_lnk--> Newton&#39;s law of gravity, the <!--del_lnk--> Einstein field equation. This theory considered all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it is in Newton&#39;s law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of <!--del_lnk--> space-time.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Einstein&#39;s published papers on general relativity were not available outside of Germany due to the war. News of Einstein&#39;s new theory reached English-speaking astronomers in England and America via Dutch physicists <!--del_lnk--> Hendrik Antoon Lorentz and <!--del_lnk--> Paul Ehrenfest and their colleague <!--del_lnk--> Willem de Sitter, Director of Leiden Observatory. <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Stanley Eddington in England, who was Secretary of the Royal Astronomical Society, asked de Sitter to write a series of articles in English for the benefit of astronomers. He was fascinated with the new theory and became a leading proponent and popularizer of relativity. Most astronomers did not like Einstein&#39;s geometrization of gravity and believed that his light bending and gravitational redshift predictions would not be correct. In 1917, astronomers at Mt. Wilson Observatory in southern California published results of spectroscopic analysis of the solar spectrum that seemed to indicate that there was no gravitational redshift in the Sun. In 1918, astronomers at Lick Observatory in northern California obtained photographs at a solar eclipse visible in the United States. After the war ended, they announced results claiming that Einstein&#39;s general relativity prediction of light bending was wrong; but they never published their results due to large probable errors.<p>In May, 1919 during British <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_eclipse.htm" title="Solar eclipse">solar-eclipse</a> expeditions (carried out in <!--del_lnk--> Sobral, Cear&aacute;, <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, as well as on the island of <!--del_lnk--> Principe, at the west coast of <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>) <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Eddington supervised measurements of the <!--del_lnk--> bending of star light as it passed close to the Sun, resulting in star positions appearing further away from the Sun. This effect is called <!--del_lnk--> gravitational lensing and the positions of the stars observed were twice that which would be predicted by Newtonian physics.  These observations match that predicted by the <!--del_lnk--> Field Equation of <!--del_lnk--> general relativity. Eddington announced that the results confirmed Einstein&#39;s prediction and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Times</i> reported that confirmation on <!--del_lnk--> November 7 of that year, with the headline: &quot;<i>Revolution in science &ndash; New theory of the Universe &ndash; Newtonian ideas overthrown</i>&quot;. Nobel laureate <!--del_lnk--> Max Born viewed <!--del_lnk--> General Relativity as the &quot;greatest feat of human thinking about nature&quot;; fellow laureate <a href="../../wp/p/Paul_Dirac.htm" title="Paul Dirac">Paul Dirac</a> called it &quot;probably the greatest scientific discovery ever made&quot;. These comments and resulting publicity cemented Einstein&#39;s fame. He became world-famous &ndash; an unusual achievement for a scientist.<p>Many scientists were still unconvinced for various reasons ranging from the scientific (disagreement with Einstein&#39;s interpretation of the experiments, belief in the ether or that an absolute frame of reference was necessary) to the psycho-social (conservatism, anti-Semitism). In Einstein&#39;s view, most of the objections were from experimentalists with very little understanding of the theory involved. Einstein&#39;s public fame which followed the 1919 article created resentment among these scientists, some of which lasted well into the 1930s.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> March 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1921, Einstein went to <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York</a> to give a lecture on his new Theory of Relativity, the same year he was awarded the Nobel Prize. Though he is now most famous for his work on relativity, it was for his earlier work on the <!--del_lnk--> photoelectric effect that he was given the Prize, as his work on general relativity was still disputed. The Nobel committee decided that citing his less-contested theory in the Prize would gain more acceptance from the scientific community.<p><a id="Copenhagen_interpretation" name="Copenhagen_interpretation"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Copenhagen interpretation</span></h4>

      <p>In 1909, Einstein presented a paper (<i>&Uuml;ber die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen &uuml;ber das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung</i>, available in its English translation <!--del_lnk--> The Development of Our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation) to a gathering of physicists on the history of <a href="../../wp/l/Luminiferous_aether.htm" title="Luminiferous aether">aether theories</a> and, more importantly, on the quantization of light. In this and an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that the <i><a href="../../wp/e/Energy.htm" title="Energy">energy</a></i> <!--del_lnk--> quanta introduced by <a href="../../wp/m/Max_Planck.htm" title="Max Planck">Max Planck</a> also carried a well-defined <i><a href="../../wp/m/Momentum.htm" title="Momentum">momentum</a></i> and acted in many respects as if they were independent, <!--del_lnk--> point-like particles. This paper marks the introduction of the modern &quot;photon&quot; concept (although the term itself was introduced much later, in a 1926 paper by <!--del_lnk--> Gilbert N. Lewis). Even more importantly, Einstein showed that light must be <i>simultaneously</i> a <a href="../../wp/w/Wave.htm" title="Wave">wave</a> and a <!--del_lnk--> particle, and foretold correctly that physics stood on the brink of a revolution that would require them to unite these <!--del_lnk--> dual natures of light. However, his own proposal for a solution &mdash; that <!--del_lnk--> Maxwell&#39;s equations for electromagnetic fields be modified to allow wave solutions that are bound to singularities of the field &mdash; was never developed, although it may have influenced <!--del_lnk--> Louis de Broglie&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> pilot wave hypothesis for <a href="../../wp/q/Quantum_mechanics.htm" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>.<p><a id="Determinism" name="Determinism"></a><h5><span class="mw-headline">Determinism</span></h5>
      <p>Beginning in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new theory of <a href="../../wp/q/Quantum_mechanics.htm" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>, Einstein voiced his objections to the <!--del_lnk--> Copenhagen interpretation of the new equations. His opposition in this regard would continue all his life. The majority see the reason for his objection in terms of the view that he was a rigid determinist (see <!--del_lnk--> determinism). They would cite a 1926 letter to <!--del_lnk--> Max Born, where Einstein made the remark which history recalls the most:<blockquote>
       <p>Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.</blockquote>
      <p>To this, <a href="../../wp/n/Niels_Bohr.htm" title="Niels Bohr">Bohr</a>, who sparred with Einstein on quantum theory, retorted, &quot;Stop telling God what He must do!&quot; The <!--del_lnk--> Bohr-Einstein debates on foundational aspects of quantum mechanics happened during the <!--del_lnk--> Solvay Conferences. Another important part of Einstein&#39;s viewpoint is the famous 1935 <!--del_lnk--> paper written by Einstein, <!--del_lnk--> Podolsky, and <!--del_lnk--> Rosen. Some physicists see this work as further supporting the notion that Einstein was a determinist.<p>There is a case to be made, however, for a quite different view of Einstein&#39;s objections to quantum orthodoxy. Einstein himself made further statements beyond that just given, and an emphatic comment on the matter was made by his contemporary Wolfgang Pauli. The above &#39;God does not play dice&#39; quotation was something stated quite early, and Einstein&#39;s later statements were concerned with other issues. The Wolfgang Pauli quotation is as follows:<blockquote>
       <p>&hellip;I was unable to recognize Einstein whenever you talked about him in either your letter or your manuscript. It seemed to me as if you had erected some dummy Einstein for yourself, which you then knocked down with great pomp. In particular Einstein does not consider the concept of `determinism&#39; to be as fundamental as it is frequently held to be (as he told me emphatically many times) &hellip;he <i>disputes</i> that he uses as a criterion for the admissibility of a theory the question &quot;Is it rigorously deterministic?&quot;&hellip; he was not at all annoyed with you, but only said that you were a person who will not listen.<br /> (emphasis due to Pauli)</blockquote>

      <p>Many of Einstein&#39;s comments indicate his belief that quantum mechanics is &#39;incomplete&#39;. This was first asserted in the famous 1935 Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen (<!--del_lnk--> EPR paradox) paper, and it appears again in the 1949 book <i>Albert Einstein, Philosopher-Scientist</i>. The &quot;EPR&quot; paper &mdash; entitled &quot;Can Quantum Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?&quot; &mdash; concluded: &quot;While we have thus shown that the wave function does not provide a complete description of the physical reality, we left open the question of whether or not such a description exists. We believe, however, that such a theory is possible.&quot;<p>In the Schilpp book, Einstein sets up a fascinating experimental proposal somewhat similar to <!--del_lnk--> Schr&ouml;dinger&#39;s cat. He begins by addressing the problem of the radioactive decay of an atom. If one begins with an undecayed atom and one waits a certain time interval, then quantum theory gives the probability that the atom has undergone the transformation of radioactive decay. Einstein then imagines the following system as a means to detect the decay:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

        <td>Rather than considering a system which comprises only a radioactive atom (and its process of transformation), one considers a system which includes also the means for ascertaining the radioactive transformation &mdash; for example, a Geiger-counter with automatic registration mechanism. Let this include a registration-strip, moved by a clockwork, upon which a mark is made by tripping the counter. True, from the point of view of quantum mechanics this total system is very complex and its configuration space is of very high dimension. But there is in principle no objection to treating this entire system from the standpoint of quantum mechanics. Here too the theory determines the probability of each configuration of all coordinates for every time instant. If one considers all configurations of the coordinates, for a time large compared with the average decay time of the radioactive atom, there will be (at most) one such registration-mark on the paper strip. To each co-ordinate- configuration must correspond a definite position of the mark on the paper strip. But, inasmuch as the theory yields only the relative probability of the thinkable coordinate-configurations, it also offers only relative probabilities for the positions of the mark on the paperstrip, but no definite location for this mark.</td>

      <p>Einstein never rejected probabilistic techniques and thinking, in and of themselves. Einstein himself was a great statistician, using statistical analysis in his works on Brownian motion and photoelectricity and in papers published before 1905; Einstein had even discovered <!--del_lnk--> Gibbs ensembles. According to the majority of physicists, however, he believed that indeterminism constituted a criteria for strong objection to a physical theory. Pauli&#39;s testimony contradicts this, and Einstein&#39;s own statements indicate a focus on incompleteness, as his major concern.<p>More recent times have given us another twist to this business. <!--del_lnk--> John Stewart Bell discovered further interesting results (<!--del_lnk--> Bell&#39;s Theorem and <!--del_lnk--> Bell&#39;s inequality) in his researches on the Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen paper. There is a divergence in thinking as to the conclusions derivable from this, in conjunction with the EPR analysis. According to Bell, quantum nonlocality has been established, while others see the death of determinism.<p><a id="Summary" name="Summary"></a><h5><span class="mw-headline">Summary</span></h5>
      <p>Whatever his inner convictions, Einstein agreed that the quantum theory was the best available, but he looked for a more &quot;complete&quot; explanation, i.e., either more deterministic or one that could more fundamentally explain the reason for probabilities in a logical way. He could not abandon the belief that physics described the laws that govern &quot;real things&quot;, nor could he abandon the belief that there are no explanations that contain contradictions, which had driven him to his successes explaining photons, relativity, atoms, and gravity.<p><a id="Bose-Einstein_statistics" name="Bose-Einstein_statistics"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Bose-Einstein statistics</span></h4>
      <p>In 1924, Einstein received a short paper from a young <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">Indian</a> physicist named <!--del_lnk--> Satyendra Nath Bose describing light as a gas of photons and asking for Einstein&#39;s assistance in publication. Einstein realized that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a> (then the <!--del_lnk--> lingua franca of physics) which described Bose&#39;s model and explained its implications. <!--del_lnk--> Bose-Einstein statistics now describe any assembly of these <!--del_lnk--> indistinguishable particles known as <!--del_lnk--> bosons. The <!--del_lnk--> Bose-Einstein condensate phenomenon was predicted in the 1920s by Bose and Einstein, based on Bose&#39;s work on the statistical mechanics of photons, which was then formalized and generalized by Einstein. The first such condensate in alkali gases was produced by <!--del_lnk--> Eric Cornell and <!--del_lnk--> Carl Wieman in 1995 at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Colorado at Boulder, though Bose-Einstein Condensation has been observed in superfluid <!--del_lnk--> Helium-4 since the 1930s. Einstein&#39;s original sketches on this theory were recovered in August 2005 in the library of <!--del_lnk--> Leiden University.<p>Einstein also assisted <!--del_lnk--> Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger in the development of the <!--del_lnk--> quantum Boltzmann distribution, a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model although he realized that this was less significant than the Bose-Einstein model and declined to have his name included on the paper.<p><a id="Einstein_refrigerator" name="Einstein_refrigerator"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Einstein refrigerator</span></h4>

      <p>When <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> came to power in January 1933, Einstein was a guest professor at <a href="../../wp/p/Princeton_University.htm" title="Princeton University">Princeton University</a>, a position which he took in December 1932, after an invitation from the American educator, <!--del_lnk--> Abraham Flexner. In 1933, the <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">Nazis</a> passed &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The Law of the Restoration of the Civil Service,&quot; which forced all Jewish university professors out of their jobs. Throughout the 1930s, a campaign to label Einstein&#39;s work as &quot;Jewish physics&quot;&mdash;in contrast with &quot;German&quot; or &quot;Aryan physics&quot;&mdash;was led by <!--del_lnk--> Nobel laureates <!--del_lnk--> Philipp Lenard and <!--del_lnk--> Johannes Stark. With the assistance of the <!--del_lnk--> SS, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Deutsche Physik</i> supporters worked to publish pamphlets and textbooks denigrating Einstein&#39;s theories and attempted to politically <!--del_lnk--> blacklist German physicists who taught them, notably <!--del_lnk--> Werner Heisenberg. Einstein renounced his <!--del_lnk--> Prussian citizenship and stayed in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, where he was given permanent residency. He accepted a position at the newly founded <!--del_lnk--> Institute for Advanced Study in <!--del_lnk--> Princeton, New Jersey, where he concentrated on developing a <i><!--del_lnk--> unified field theory</i> (see below). Einstein became an American citizen in 1940, though he still retained Swiss citizenship.<p>In 1939, under the encouragement of Szil&aacute;rd, Einstein <!--del_lnk--> sent a letter to President <!--del_lnk--> Franklin Delano Roosevelt urging the study of <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_fission.htm" title="Nuclear fission">nuclear fission</a> for military purposes, under fears that the Nazi government would be first to develop <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_weapon.htm" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapons</a>. Roosevelt started a small investigation into the matter which eventually became the massive <!--del_lnk--> Manhattan Project. Einstein himself did not work on the bomb project, however, and, according to <a href="../../wp/l/Linus_Pauling.htm" title="Linus Pauling">Linus Pauling</a>, he later regretted having signed this letter.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> International Rescue Committee was founded in 1933 at the request of Albert Einstein to assist opponents of Adolf Hitler.<p>For more information, see the section below on Einstein&#39;s <a href="#Political_views" title="">political views</a>.<p><a id="Unified_field_theory" name="Unified_field_theory"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Unified field theory</span></h4>

      <p>Einstein&#39;s research efforts after developing the theory of general relativity consisted primarily of a long series of attempts to generalize his theory of gravitation in order to unify and simplify the fundamental <!--del_lnk--> laws of physics, particularly gravitation and electromagnetism. In 1950, he described this work, which he referred to as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Unified Field Theory</i>, in a <i><!--del_lnk--> Scientific American</i> article. Einstein was guided by a belief in a single origin for the entire set of physical laws.<p>Einstein became increasingly isolated in his research on a generalized theory of gravitation and his attempts were ultimately unsuccessful. In particular, his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces ignored work in the physics community at large (and vice versa), most notably the discovery of the <!--del_lnk--> strong and <!--del_lnk--> weak nuclear forces, which were not understood independently until around 1970, fifteen years after Einstein&#39;s death. Einstein&#39;s goal of unifying the laws of physics under a single model survives in the current drive for <!--del_lnk--> unification of the forces.<p><a id="Final_years" name="Final_years"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Final years</span></h3>
      <p>In 1948, Einstein served on the original committee which resulted in the founding of <!--del_lnk--> Brandeis University. A portrait of Einstein was taken by <!--del_lnk--> Yousuf Karsh on <!--del_lnk--> February 11 of that same year. In 1952, the <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israeli</a> government proposed to Einstein that he take the post of second president. He declined the offer, and is believed to be the only United States citizen ever to have been offered a position as a foreign head of state. Einstein&#39;s refusal might have stemmed from his disapproval of some of the Israeli policies during the war of independence.<p>He died at 1:15 AM in Princeton hospital in <!--del_lnk--> Princeton, New Jersey, on <!--del_lnk--> April 18, <!--del_lnk--> 1955 at the age of 76 from internal bleeding, which was caused by the rupture of an <!--del_lnk--> aortic aneurism, leaving the <!--del_lnk--> Generalized Theory of Gravitation unsolved. The only person present at his deathbed, a hospital nurse, said that just before his death he mumbled several words in <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a> that she did not understand. He was <!--del_lnk--> cremated without ceremony on the same day he died at <!--del_lnk--> Trenton, New Jersey, in accordance with his wishes. His ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location.<p>An autopsy was performed on Einstein by Dr. <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Stoltz Harvey, who removed and preserved <!--del_lnk--> his brain. Harvey found nothing unusual with his brain, but in 1999 further analysis by a team at <!--del_lnk--> McMaster University revealed that his parietal <!--del_lnk--> operculum region was missing and, to compensate, his inferior <!--del_lnk--> parietal lobe was 15% wider than normal. The inferior parietal region is responsible for mathematical thought, visuospatial cognition, and imagery of movement. Einstein&#39;s brain also contained 73% more <!--del_lnk--> glial cells than the average brain.<p><a id="Beliefs" name="Beliefs"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Beliefs</span></h2>

If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.</i></dl>
      <p>As an adult, he called his religion a &quot;cosmic religious sense&quot;.<p>In <i>The World As I See It</i> he wrote:<dl>
       <dd><i>You will hardly find one among the profounder sort of scientific minds without a peculiar religious feeling of his own. But it is different from the religion of the naive man.</i></dl>
      <dl>
       <dd><i>For the latter God is a being from whose care one hopes to benefit and whose punishment one fears; a sublimation of a feeling similar to that of a child for its father, a being to whom one stands to some extent in a personal relation, however deeply it may be tinged with awe.</i></dl>
      <dl>
       <dd><i>But the scientist is possessed by the sense of universal causation. The future, to him, is every whit as necessary and determined as the past. There is nothing divine about morality, it is a purely human affair. His religious feeling takes the form of a rapturous amazement at the harmony of natural law, which reveals an intelligence of such superiority that, compared with it, all the systematic thinking and acting of human beings is an utterly insignificant reflection.</i></dl>
      <p>In response to the telegrammed question of New York&#39;s Rabbi Herbert S. Goldstein in 1929: &quot;Do you believe in God? Stop. Answer paid 50 words.&quot; Einstein replied &quot;I believe in <!--del_lnk--> Spinoza&#39;s God, Who reveals Himself in the lawful harmony of the world, not in a God Who concerns Himself with the fate and the doings of mankind.&quot; Note that Einstein replied in only 25 (German) words. Spinoza was a <!--del_lnk--> naturalistic pantheist.<p><a id="Scientific_philosophy" name="Scientific_philosophy"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Scientific philosophy</span></h3>
      <p>In the &quot;Copenhagen Interpretation&quot; section (1.3.2) above, reference was made to the disagreement regarding Einstein&#39;s actual position regarding the quantum theory. The famous quotation &quot;<i>God does not play dice</i>&quot; is often used to support the majority view that he disliked the theory due to its indeterminism.<p>Others make the case for a different view. They note that the 1926 &quot;Dice&quot; quotation occurred when the quantum theory was just in its first year of discovery and in the subsequent 30 years of his life, one would be hard pressed to find a similar comment from the man. Instead Einstein focused on the conceptually independent subject of &#39;incompleteness&#39;. This attention is shown both in his 1935 &quot;EPR&quot; paper, and in his 1949 Geiger counter registration strip thought-experiment (see section 1.3.2.2). Further evidence against the &quot;Einstein-determinist&quot; view is W. Pauli&#39;s quotation: &quot;he (Einstein) <i>disputes</i> that he uses as a criterion for the admissibility of a theory the question &#39;Is it rigorously deterministic?&#39;&quot;.<p>The following general assessment was given by his colleague Nathan Rosen:<dl>
       <dd><i>I think that the things which impressed me most were the simplicity of his thinking and his faith in the ability of the human mind to understand the workings of nature. Throughout his life, Einstein believed the human reason was capable of leading to theories that would provide correct descriptions of physical phenomena. In building a theory, his approach had something in common with that of an artist; he would aim for simplicity and beauty (and beauty for him was, after all, essentially simplicity). The crucial question that he would ask, when weighing an element of a theory was: &quot;Is it reasonable?&quot; No matter how successful a theory appeared to be, if it seemed to him not to be reasonable (the German word that he used was &quot;</i>vernunftig<i>&quot;), he was convinced that the theory could not provide a really fundamental understanding of nature.</i></dl>

      <p>Einstein considered himself a <!--del_lnk--> pacifist and <!--del_lnk--> humanitarian, and in later years, a committed <!--del_lnk--> democratic socialist. He once said, <i>&quot;I believe <a href="../../wp/m/Mahatma_Gandhi.htm" title="Mahatma Gandhi">Gandhi&#39;s</a> views were the most enlightened of all the political men of our time. We should strive to do things in his spirit: not to use violence for fighting for our cause, but by non-participation of anything you believe is evil.&quot;</i> Deeply influenced by Gandhi, Einstein once said of Gandhi, &quot;Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth.&quot; Einstein&#39;s views were sometimes controversial. In a 1949 article entitled &quot;Why Socialism?&quot;, Albert Einstein described the &quot;predatory phase of human development&quot;, exemplified by a chaotic <a href="../../wp/c/Capitalism.htm" title="Capitalism">capitalist</a> society, as a source of evil to be overcome. He disapproved of the <!--del_lnk--> totalitarian regimes in the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> and elsewhere, and argued in favour of a <!--del_lnk--> democratic socialist system which would combine a <!--del_lnk--> planned economy with a deep respect for <a href="../../wp/h/Human_rights.htm" title="Human rights">human rights</a>. Einstein was a co-founder of the liberal <!--del_lnk--> German Democratic Party and a member of the <!--del_lnk--> AFL-CIO-affiliated union the <!--del_lnk--> American Federation of Teachers.<p>Einstein was very much involved in the <!--del_lnk--> Civil Rights movement. He was a close friend of <!--del_lnk--> Paul Robeson for over 20 years. Einstein was a member of several civil rights groups (including the Princeton chapter of the <!--del_lnk--> NAACP) many of which were headed by Paul Robeson. He served as co-chair with <!--del_lnk--> Paul Robeson of the <i>American Crusade to End Lynching</i>. When <!--del_lnk--> W.E.B. DuBois was frivolously charged with being a communist spy during the McCarthy era while he was in his 80s, Einstein volunteered as a character witness in the case. The case was dismissed shortly after it was announced that he was to appear in that capacity. Einstein was quoted as saying that &quot;racism is America&#39;s greatest disease&quot;.<p>The U.S. <a href="../../wp/f/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation.htm" title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">FBI</a> kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the <!--del_lnk--> Alien Exclusion Act, alleging that Einstein <i>&quot;believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, &#39;would allow <a href="../../wp/a/Anarchism.htm" title="Anarchism">anarchy</a> to stalk in unmolested&#39; and result in &#39;government in name only&#39;&quot;</i>, among other charges. They also alleged that Einstein <i>&quot;was a member, sponsor, or affiliated with thirty-four <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">communist</a> fronts between 1937 and 1954&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;also served as honorary chairman for three communist organizations&quot;</i>. Many of the documents in the file were submitted to the FBI, mainly by civilian political groups, and not written by the FBI.<p>Einstein opposed tyrannical forms of government, and for this reason (and his Jewish background), opposed the Nazi regime and fled Germany shortly after it came to power. Einstein initially favored construction of the <!--del_lnk--> atomic bomb, in order to ensure that <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Adolf Hitler">Hitler</a> did not do so first, and even <!--del_lnk--> sent a letter to President <a href="../../wp/f/Franklin_D._Roosevelt.htm" title="Franklin D.

      <p>While Einstein was a supporter of <a href="../../wp/z/Zionism.htm" title="Zionism">Zionism</a> in the cultural sense, he often expressed reservations regarding its application in terms of nationalism.

I am afraid of the inner damage Judaism will sustain.&quot; He also signed an <!--del_lnk--> open letter published in the New York Times condemning <!--del_lnk--> Menachem Begin and his nationalistic <!--del_lnk--> Herut party, especially for the treatment of the indigenous Arabs at <!--del_lnk--> Deir Yassin by Herut&rsquo;s predecessor <!--del_lnk--> Irgun.<p>Despite these reservations, he was active in the establishment of the <!--del_lnk--> Hebrew University in <a href="../../wp/j/Jerusalem.htm" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, which published (1930) a volume titled <i>About Zionism: Speeches and Lectures by Professor Albert Einstein</i>, and to which Einstein bequeathed his papers.

      <p>The recurring rumor that Einstein failed in mathematics during his education is untrue. On the contrary, Einstein always showed great talent at mathematics; when he obtained his <!--del_lnk--> matura, he obtained the best mark (6/6) in algebra, geometry, physics and history, among all of the classes that he took. The grading system of Switzerland, where <i>6</i> is the best mark, may have been confused with the German system, in which <i>1</i> is the best mark. As can be seen from his Matura grades, indicated in the graphic to the right (also found in &quot;Einstein: A Hundred Years of Relativity&quot; by <!--del_lnk--> W. Andrew Robinson, p.27), Albert Einstein failed French (3/6) and received poor grades (4/6) in drawing, (both artistic- and technical) and <a href="../../wp/g/Geography.htm" title="Geography">geography</a>. His performance (5/6) in all other subjects studied in high school, namely <!--del_lnk--> Natural history, <!--del_lnk--> German literature and <!--del_lnk--> Italian literature as well as <a href="../../wp/c/Chemistry.htm" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a>, was significantly above average. Furthermore, Robinson states on pages 33 through to 35 that Einstein&#39;s interests mainly spanned in science and mathematics and that he disliked &quot;games and physical training&quot;. Einstein also had problems with the heavy emphasis on the <a href="../../wp/h/Humanities.htm" title="Humanities">humanities</a>; that is on <!--del_lnk--> classical studies and to a &quot;lesser extent <!--del_lnk--> German history and literature, to the detriment of modern foreign languages.&quot; Robinson states that this explains Einstein&#39;s lack of competence in <!--del_lnk--> French literature and <!--del_lnk--> English studies, for instance. In 1920 Einstein told a Berlin interviewer that the school of <!--del_lnk--> matriculation exam should be abolished. &quot;Let us return to <a href="../../wp/n/Nature.htm" title="Nature">Nature</a>, which upholds the principle of getting the maximum amount of effect from the minimum effort, whereas the matriculation test does exactly the opposite.&quot;<p>As for Einstein&#39;s childhood trait of delayed speech development, a few have speculated that Einstein had <!--del_lnk--> elective mutism and may have refused to speak until he could do so in complete sentences. Though this concept fits with a profile of a sensitive perfectionist (when Einstein did begin to speak, he would often softly &quot;rehearse&quot; what he meant to say before uttering the statement outright), it is somewhat dated insofar as <!--del_lnk--> selective mutism- as it is now known- is no longer considered to be a matter of willful silence: it presently refers to individuals with verbal ability who cannot speak in certain social circumstances. This would not apply to Einstein, who could not speak at all until the time that he did.<p>According to neuroscientist <!--del_lnk--> Steven Pinker, the autopsy of Einstein&#39;s brain exhibited a more likely possibility that Einstein, as a child, had been displaying a lesser known type of <!--del_lnk--> language delay relating to extraordinary and rapid prenatal development of areas of the brain responsible for spatial and analytical reasoning which, in competing for &quot;brain real estate&quot;, had temporarily robbed resources from functions of the brain responsible for speech development.  Pinker and others have extended this speculation to explain the asynchronous development of other famously <!--del_lnk--> gifted late-talkers, such as mathematician <!--del_lnk--> Julia Robinson, pianists <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Rubinstein and <!--del_lnk--> Clara Schumann, and physicists <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_Feynman.htm" title="Richard Feynman">Richard Feynman</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_Teller.htm" title="Edward Teller">Edward Teller</a>, to name a few, who were also said to have shared several of Einstein&#39;s other childhood peculiarities, such as monumental tantrums, rugged individualism and highly selective interests. A <!--del_lnk--> syndrome &mdash; the &quot;Einstein syndrome&quot; &mdash; was even coined by journalist and economist <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Sowell as a non-pathologizing means to describe this series of traits seen in a small percentage (though how small is debatable) of late-talking children who go on to develop into analytically advanced and socially conscious adults without (or in spite of) intense therapeutic intervention.<p><a id="Personal_relations" name="Personal_relations"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Personal relations</span></h3>
      <p>Letters written by Einstein to his relatives and kept at the <!--del_lnk--> Hebrew University of Jerusalem, have revealed that during the course of his life, he had a dozen lovers, two of whom he married. Barbara Wolff of the <!--del_lnk--> Hebrew University&#39;s Albert Einstein Archives has made public about 3,500 pages of correspondence including letters to his first and second wives and children between the years 1912&ndash;1955. In letters to his second wife Elsa and her daughter Margot he claimed that he had been showered with unwanted attention from women. One of his lovers, a Berlin socialite Ethel Michanowski, &quot;followed me [to England], and her chasing me is getting out of control.&quot; His son Eduard&#39;s <a href="../../wp/s/Schizophrenia.htm" title="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a> troubled Einstein greatly, and he often expressed the idea that it would have been better if Eduard had not been born. He adored his stepdaughter and in a letter to Elsa in 1924, he writes: &quot;I love her [Margot] as much as if she were my own daughter, perhaps even more so, since who knows what kind of brat she would have become [had I fathered her].&quot; The letters have been claimed as evidence to dispel myths that Einstein was cold toward his family.<p><a id="Licensing" name="Licensing"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Licensing</span></h3>
      <p>Einstein bequeathed his estate, as well as the use of his image (see <!--del_lnk--> personality rights), to the <!--del_lnk--> Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Einstein actively supported the university during his life and this support continues with the <!--del_lnk--> royalties received from licensing activities. <!--del_lnk--> The Roger Richman Agency <!--del_lnk--> licences the commercial use of the name &quot;Albert Einstein&quot; and associated imagery and likenesses of Einstein, as <!--del_lnk--> agent for the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. As head licensee the agency can control commercial usage of Einstein&#39;s name which does not comply with certain standards (e.g., when Einstein&#39;s name is used as a <!--del_lnk--> trademark, the &trade; symbol must be used). As of May, 2005, the Roger Richman Agency was acquired by <!--del_lnk--> Corbis.<p><a id="Honors" name="Honors"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Honours</span></h3>
