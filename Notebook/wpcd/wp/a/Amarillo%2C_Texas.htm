      <p><b>Amarillo</b> is the 14th-largest city in the <a href="../../wp/u/U.S._state.htm" title="U.S. state">U.S. state</a> of <!--del_lnk--> Texas and the <!--del_lnk--> county seat of <!--del_lnk--> Potter County. A portion of the city extends into <!--del_lnk--> Randall County. As of the 2000 <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Census, the city had a total population of 173,627 (though a July 1, 2005 estimate placed the city&#39;s population at 183,021). The <!--del_lnk--> Amarillo metropolitan area, however, has an estimated population of 236,113 in four counties.<p>The city was once <!--del_lnk--> self-proclaimed as the &quot;<a href="../../wp/h/Helium.htm" title="Helium">Helium</a> Capital of the World&quot; for having one of the country&#39;s most productive helium fields. The city is also known as &quot;The Yellow Rose of Texas&quot; and most recently &quot;Rotor City, USA&quot; for its <!--del_lnk--> V-22 Osprey hybrid aircraft assembly plant. Amarillo operates one of the largest <!--del_lnk--> meat packing areas in the United States. <!--del_lnk--> Pantex, the only <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_weapon.htm" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapons</a> assembly and disassembly facility in the country, is also a major employer. The attractions, <!--del_lnk--> Cadillac Ranch and <!--del_lnk--> Big Texan Steak Ranch, were located on old <a href="../../wp/u/U.S._Route_66.htm" title="U.S. Route 66">U.S. Route 66</a>, which passes through the city.<p>

      <p>In April 1887, J. T. Berry established a site for a town after he chose a well-watered section along the way of the <!--del_lnk--> Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad, which had begun building across the <!--del_lnk--> Texas Panhandle. Berry and <!--del_lnk--> Colorado City, Texas merchants wanted to make their new town site the region&#39;s main trading centre. On <!--del_lnk--> August 30, 1887, Berry&#39;s town site won the <!--del_lnk--> county seat election and was established in Potter County. Availability of the <!--del_lnk--> railroad and <!--del_lnk--> freight service after the county seat election made the town a fast growing <a href="../../wp/c/Cattle.htm" title="Cattle">cattle</a> marketing centre.<p>The settlement originally was called Oneida, it would later change its name to Amarillo. Amarillo&#39;s name probably derives from the nearby Amarillo Lake and Amarillo Creek, named in turn for the yellow soil along their banks and shores (<i>Amarillo</i> is the <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_language.htm" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a> word for the <a href="../../wp/c/Color.htm" title="Color">colour</a> <i><!--del_lnk--> yellow</i>) or the yellow wildflowers that were plentiful during the spring and summer. Despite having a Spanish origin name, the City of Amarillo is pronounced in <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> as &quot;Am-ah-RILL-ow&quot; rather than &quot;Ah-mah-REE-yoh&quot;. Early residents pronounced it according to the Spanish pronunciation, but within a year, the English pronunciation prevailed. Charles F. Rudolph, editor of the <i>Tascosa Pioneer</i>, predicted the pronunciation change after blaming Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad employees for ignoring the word&#39;s Spanish pronunciation.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> June 19, <!--del_lnk--> 1888, Henry B. Sanborn, who is given credit as the &quot;Father of Amarillo,&quot; and his business partner <!--del_lnk--> Joseph F. Glidden began buying land to the east to move Amarillo after arguing that Berry&#39;s site was on low ground and would flood during rainstorms. Sanborn also offered to trade lots in the new location to businesses in the original city&rsquo;s site and help the expense of moving buildings. His incentives gradually won over people, who moved their businesses to Polk Street in the new commercial district. It rained heavily and almost flooded Berry&rsquo;s part of the town in 1889, prompting more people to move to Sanborn&#39;s location. This eventually led to another county seat election making Sanborn&#39;s town the new county seat in 1893.<p>By the late 1890s, Amarillo had emerged as one of the world&#39;s busiest cattle shipping points, and its population grew significantly. The city became an elevator, milling, and feed-manufacturing centre after an increasing production of wheat and small grains during the early 1900s. Discovery of <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_gas.htm" title="Natural gas">gas</a> in 1918 and <!--del_lnk--> oil three years later brought oil and gas companies to the Amarillo area. The United States government bought the Cliffside Gas Field with high <a href="../../wp/h/Helium.htm" title="Helium">helium</a> content in 1927 and the Federal Bureau of Mines began operating the Amarillo Helium Plant two years later. The plant would be the sole producer of commercial helium in the world for a number of years. The <!--del_lnk--> U.S. National Helium Reserve is stored in the Bush Dome Reservoir at the Cliffside facility.<p>Following the lead of the Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad, the <!--del_lnk--> Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and <!--del_lnk--> Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad established services to and from Amarillo. Each of these three carriers maintained substantial freight and passenger depots and repair facilities in the city through most of the 20th century and were major employers within the community.<p>During the 1930s, the city was hit by the <!--del_lnk--> Dust Bowl and entered into an <!--del_lnk--> economic depression. The <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Routes 60, 87, 287, and 66 merged at Amarillo, making it a major tourist stop with numerous motels, restaurants, and <!--del_lnk--> curio shops. <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> led the establishment of Amarillo Army Air Field in east Amarillo and the nearby Pantex Army Ordnance Plant, which produced bombs and ammunition. After the end of the war, both of the facilities were closed. The Pantex Plant was reopened in 1950 and produced <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_weapon.htm" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapons</a> throughout the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>. The following year, the army air base was reactivated as <!--del_lnk--> Amarillo Air Force Base and expanded to accommodate a <!--del_lnk--> Strategic Air Command <!--del_lnk--> B-52 Stratofortress wing. The arrival of servicemen and their families ended the city&#39;s depression. Between 1950 and 1960, Amarillo&#39;s population grew from 74,443 to 137,969. However, the closure of the Amarillo Air Force Base on <!--del_lnk--> December 31, <!--del_lnk--> 1968, contributed to a decrease in population to 127,010 by 1970. In the 1970s, <!--del_lnk--> ASARCO, <!--del_lnk--> Iowa Beef Processors, <!--del_lnk--> Owens-Corning and <!--del_lnk--> Weyerhaeuser built plants at Amarillo. The following decade, Amarillo&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> city limits encompassed 60 square miles in Potter and Randall counties. The intrastate <!--del_lnk--> interstate highway <!--del_lnk--> I-27 connecting <!--del_lnk--> Lubbock to Amarillo was built mostly during the 1980s.<p><a id="Geography_and_climate" name="Geography_and_climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography and climate</span></h2>

      <p>Amarillo is located near the middle of the Texas Panhandle and is part of the <!--del_lnk--> Llano Estacado or Staked Plains region which has a surface that is relatively flat and has little drainage in the soil. Due to the lack of developed drainage, much of the rainfall either evaporates, infiltrates into the ground, or accumulates in <!--del_lnk--> playa lakes. According to the <!--del_lnk--> United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 90.3 <!--del_lnk--> mi&sup2; (233.9 <!--del_lnk--> km&sup2;). 89.9 mi&sup2; (232.7 km&sup2;) of it is land and 0.4 mi&sup2; (1.2 km&sup2;) of it (0.50%) is water. The Amarillo <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan area is the <!--del_lnk--> 180th-largest in the United States with a population of 236,113 in four counties: <!--del_lnk--> Armstrong, <!--del_lnk--> Carson, Potter, and Randall.<p>About 40 mi (64 km) northeast of Amarillo is the <!--del_lnk--> Canadian River, which divides the southern part of the <!--del_lnk--> High Plains to form the Llano Estacado. The river is <a href="../../wp/d/Dam.htm" title="Dam">dammed</a> to form <!--del_lnk--> Lake Meredith, a major source of drinking water in the Texas Panhandle region. The city is situated near the Panhandle Field, in a productive gas and <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">oil</a> area, covering 200,000 surface acres in <!--del_lnk--> Hartley, Potter, <!--del_lnk--> Moore, <!--del_lnk--> Hutchinson, Carson, <!--del_lnk--> Gray, <!--del_lnk--> Wheeler, and <!--del_lnk--> Collingsworth counties. The Potter County portion had the nation&#39;s largest <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_gas.htm" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a> reserve. Approximately 25 mi (40 km) south of Amarillo is the <!--del_lnk--> canyon system, <!--del_lnk--> Palo Duro Canyon.<p><a id="Cityscape" name="Cityscape"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cityscape</span></h3>
      <p>Most of Amarillo&rsquo;s population growth and commercial development are occurring in the southern and northwestern parts of the city. Similar to many towns in the Texas Panhandle, the city&rsquo;s downtown has suffered economic deterioration throughout the years. In order to try to help revitalize it, the organization Centre City of Amarillo was formed to establish partnerships with groups who have a huge presence in the city to support the downtown. Since its conception in the 1990s, Centre City created archways over two streets, sponsors public art projects such as murals, and started block parties in the downtown area.<p>The 31-story <!--del_lnk--> Chase Tower, the tallest building between <a href="../../wp/d/Dallas%252C_Texas.htm" title="Dallas, Texas">Dallas</a> and <a href="../../wp/d/Denver%252C_Colorado.htm" title="Denver, Colorado">Denver</a>, was opened in Amarillo&#39;s downtown in 1971. It is an office building and had two prior names: SPS Tower and Bank One Centre. Completed in the same year as the Chase Tower, the Amarillo National Bank Plaza One building houses the headquarters of <!--del_lnk--> Amarillo National Bank, the city&#39;s largest financial institution. The <!--del_lnk--> Santa Fe Building, completed in 1930, was the regional offices of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway company but was vacant for several years until Potter County bought the building for <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">US$</a>426,000 in 1995 to gain new office spaces.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Amarillo&#39;s historic homes and buildings listed on the <!--del_lnk--> National Register of Historic Places reflect the economic growth from around 1900 to the start of World War II. Polk Street contains many of the city&#39;s historic downtown buildings and homes. The large historic homes on this street were built close to downtown, and homes were located on the west side of the street as a symbol of status because they would be greeted with the <!--del_lnk--> sunrise every morning. A local newspaper article in 1914 promoted the planting of trees as a sanitary asset due to the author cited studies by the New York County Medical Society and the New York City Park Commission which claims areas with trees have less bacteria and fewer dust particles. The trees that lasted the Texas Panhandle environment line the streets in Amarillo&#39;s older neighborhoods.<p>The City of Amarillo&#39;s Parks and Recreation Department operates over 50 municipal parks including a <!--del_lnk--> skatepark, west of the city. Amarillo&#39;s largest parks are Medical Park, Thompson Memorial Park, and Memorial Park, near Amarillo College&#39;s Washington Street Campus. From 1978 to 2002, the <!--del_lnk--> Junior League of Amarillo and the City of Amarillo&#39;s Parks and Recreation Department co-sponsored Funfest, a family entertainment festival, benefiting the city parks and the league&#39;s Community Chest Trust Fund. Funfest was held in Thompson Memorial Park during <!--del_lnk--> Memorial Day weekend. Completed in 2000, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Park adjoins with a shallow playa lake which located south of it was the original town site of Amarillo.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>
      <p>Amarillo and along with the Texas Panhandle&#39;s climate is classified as subhumid to <!--del_lnk--> semiarid. It is characterized by a rush of cold air from the north or northwest into a warmer area and occasionally, by <!--del_lnk--> blizzards during the <a href="../../wp/w/Winter.htm" title="Winter">winter</a> season and a hot <a href="../../wp/s/Summer.htm" title="Summer">summer</a>. The normal annual rainfall for Amarillo is approximately 20 inches (508 mm). Most of the region&#39;s precipitation occurs in the late spring and summer months, and the least occurs from November through March. The January&#39;s average high in the city is 49 &deg;F (9 &deg;C) and average low is 22 &deg;F (-6 &deg;C); July&#39;s average high is 91 &deg;F (33 &deg;C) and average low is 65 &deg;F (18 &deg;C). The highest temperature ever recorded in Amarillo was 108 &deg;F (42 &deg;C); the lowest was -16 &deg;F (-27 &deg;C). Amarillo is in an area of the United States which <a href="../../wp/t/Tornado.htm" title="Tornado">tornadoes</a> are most frequent called the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Tornado Alley.&quot;<table class="wikitable" style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto 0 auto;">

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport is located on the east side of Amarillo, north of Interstate 40. A portion of the former Amarillo Air Force Base was converted to civilian use and became part of the airport.

      <p>Local transit services in the city have been available since 1925 and have been provided through the City of Amarillo&#39;s Amarillo City Transit (ACT) department since 1966; prior to that time the system was privately owned. ACT operates bus services that include fixed route transit and demand response <!--del_lnk--> paratransit which are designed for people with disabilities. The ACT transports approximately 350,000 passengers per year on the fixed route and 30,000 paratransit passengers, but it is a declining ridership. ACT has no plans to scale back any of their transit routes or services.<p>Amarillo has no passenger rail service but remains an important part of the rail freight system. The <!--del_lnk--> BNSF Railway complex in Amarillo continues to serve a heavy daily traffic load, approximately 100-110 trains per day. The <!--del_lnk--> Union Pacific Railroad also sends substantial shipments to or through Amarillo. In addition to intermodal and general goods, a big portion of rail shipments involve grains and coal.<p>The streets in Amarillo&#39;s downtown area conform to a <!--del_lnk--> grid pattern. The city&#39;s original street layout was set up by William H. Bush, beginning at the west end of the town moving to the east. Bush named the north to south streets for past <a href="../../wp/p/President_of_the_United_States.htm" title="President of the United States">United States presidents</a>, in chronological order except for <!--del_lnk--> John Quincy Adams because the surname was taken with the second president, <a href="../../wp/j/John_Adams.htm" title="John Adams">John Adams</a>. (The last president so honored was <a href="../../wp/g/Grover_Cleveland.htm" title="Grover Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a>; though the city has expanded eastward the pattern was not continued.)<p>In 1910, the Amarillo voters approved to pay for street paving and the materials used to pave the streets were <!--del_lnk--> bricks. As of 2003, the city still has 16.2 mi (26.1 km) of brick streets in some parts of the downtown area. The city spent $200,000 in 2002 to restore one block of brick street on Ninth Avenue between Polk and Tyler streets.<p>Less than one mile of intrastate <!--del_lnk--> interstate highway <!--del_lnk--> I-27 is located in Potter County. The highway terminates at the city&#39;s main west-east highway <!--del_lnk--> I-40 near the Potter-Randall County line. The roadway continues northward into downtown Amarillo via U.S. <!--del_lnk--> 60, <!--del_lnk--> 87, and <!--del_lnk--> 287, a series of four one-way streets. North of downtown the highway becomes U.S. 87 and continues northward to <!--del_lnk--> Dumas, Texas.<p><a id="Medical_centers_and_hospitals" name="Medical_centers_and_hospitals"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Medical centers and hospitals</span></h3>
