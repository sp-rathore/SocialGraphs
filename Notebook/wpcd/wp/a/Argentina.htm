      <p>&quot;<i>Argentina</i>&quot; derives from the <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>argentum</i> (<a href="../../wp/s/Silver.htm" title="Silver">silver</a>). When the first <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spanish</a> <!--del_lnk--> conquistadors discovered the <!--del_lnk--> R&iacute;o de la Plata, they named the estuary <i>Mar Dulce</i> (&#39;Sweet Sea&#39;, as in a fresh water sea). <!--del_lnk--> Indigenous people gave gifts of silver to the survivors of the shipwrecked expedition, who were led by <!--del_lnk--> Juan D&iacute;az de Sol&iacute;s. The legend of <!--del_lnk--> Sierra del Plata &mdash; a mountain rich in silver &mdash; reached Spain around <!--del_lnk--> 1524, and the name was first seen in print on a <!--del_lnk--> Venice map from 1536. The source of the silver was the area where the city of <!--del_lnk--> Potos&iacute; was to be founded in 1546. An expedition that followed the trail of the silver up the <!--del_lnk--> Paran&aacute; and <!--del_lnk--> Pilcomayo rivers finally reached the source only to find it already claimed by explorers who reached it from <a href="../../wp/l/Lima.htm" title="Lima">Lima</a>, the capital of the Viceroyalty.<p>The name Argentina was first used extensively in <!--del_lnk--> Ruy D&iacute;az de Guzm&aacute;n&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> 1612 book <i>Historia del descubrimiento, poblaci&oacute;n, y conquista del R&iacute;o de la Plata</i> (History of the discovery, population, and conquest of the R&iacute;o de la Plata), naming the territory <i>Tierra Argentina</i> (Land of Silver).<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>The first signs of human presence in Argentina are located in the <!--del_lnk--> Patagonia ( <!--del_lnk--> Piedra Museo, Santa Cruz), and date from 11,000 BC. Around 1 AD, several corn-based civilizations developed in the western <!--del_lnk--> Andean region (Santa Mar&iacute;a, Huarpes, Diaguitas, Sanavirones, among others). In 1480 the <a href="../../wp/i/Inca_Empire.htm" title="Inca Empire">Inca Empire</a>, under the rule of emperor Pachacutec, launched an offensive and conquered present-day northwestern Argentina, integrating it into a region called <!--del_lnk--> Collasuyu. In the northeastern area, the <!--del_lnk--> Guaran&iacute; developed a culture based on <!--del_lnk--> yuca and <!--del_lnk--> sweet potato. The central and southern areas (<!--del_lnk--> Pampas and Patagonia) were dominated by nomadic cultures, unified in the 17th century by the <!--del_lnk--> Mapuches.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Europeans arrived in 1502. <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> established a permanent colony on the site of <a href="../../wp/b/Buenos_Aires.htm" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a> in 1580; the <!--del_lnk--> Viceroyalty of the R&iacute;o de la Plata was created in 1776. In 1806 and 1807 the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> <!--del_lnk--> launched two invasions to Buenos Aires, but the creole population repelled both attempts. On <!--del_lnk--> May 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1810, after confirmation of the rumors about the overthrow of <!--del_lnk--> King Ferdinand VII by Napoleon, citizens of <a href="../../wp/b/Buenos_Aires.htm" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a> took advantage of the situation and created the <!--del_lnk--> First Government Junta (<!--del_lnk--> May Revolution). Formal <!--del_lnk--> independence from Spain was declared on <!--del_lnk--> July 9, <!--del_lnk--> 1816 in <!--del_lnk--> Tucum&aacute;n. In 1817, General <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; de San Mart&iacute;n <!--del_lnk--> crossed the Andes to free <a href="../../wp/c/Chile.htm" title="Chile">Chile</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Peru.htm" title="Peru">Peru</a>, thus eliminating the Spanish threat. Centralist and federalist groups (Spanish: <i>Unitarios</i> and <i>Federales</i>) were in conflict until national unity was established and the <!--del_lnk--> constitution promulgated in 1853.<p>Foreign <!--del_lnk--> investment and <!--del_lnk--> immigration from Europe led to the adoption of modern agricultural techniques. In the 1880s, the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Conquest of the Desert&quot; subdued or exterminated the remaining indigenous tribes throughout the southern <!--del_lnk--> Pampas and <!--del_lnk--> Patagonia.<p>From 1880 to 1930, Argentina enjoyed increasing prosperity and prominence through an export-led economy, and the population of the country swelled sevenfold. Conservative forces dominated Argentine politics until 1916, when their traditional rivals, the <!--del_lnk--> Radicals, won control of the government. The military forced <!--del_lnk--> Hip&oacute;lito Yrigoyen from power in 1930, leading to another decade of Conservative rule. Political change led to the presidency of <!--del_lnk--> Juan Per&oacute;n in 1946, who tried to empower the working class and greatly expanded the number of unionized workers. The <!--del_lnk--> Revoluci&oacute;n Libertadora of <!--del_lnk--> 1955 deposed him.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>From the 1950s to 1970s, soft military and weak civilian administrations traded power. During those years the economy grew strongly and poverty declined (less than 7% in 1975), but became increasingly protectionist. At the same time political violence continued to escalate. In 1973, Per&oacute;n returned to the presidency, but he died within a year of assuming power. His third wife <!--del_lnk--> Isabel, the Vice President, succeeded him in office, but the military coup of <!--del_lnk--> March 24, <!--del_lnk--> 1976 removed her from office.<p>The armed forces took power through a <a href="../../wp/m/Military_dictatorship.htm" title="Military dictatorship">junta</a> in charge of the self-appointed <!--del_lnk--> National Reorganization Process until 1983. The military government repressed opposition and terrorist leftist groups using harsh illegal measures (the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Dirty War&quot;); thousands of dissidents &quot;<!--del_lnk--> disappeared&quot;, while the <!--del_lnk--> SIDE cooperated with <!--del_lnk--> DINA and other South American intelligence agencies, and with the <!--del_lnk--> CIA in <!--del_lnk--> Operation Condor. Many of the military leaders that took part in the Dirty War were trained in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">U.S.</a>-financed <!--del_lnk--> School of the Americas, among them Argentine dictators <!--del_lnk--> Leopoldo Galtieri and <!--del_lnk--> Roberto Viola. Economic problems, charges of corruption, public revulsion in the face of <a href="../../wp/h/Human_rights.htm" title="Human rights">human rights</a> abuses and, finally, the country&#39;s 1982 defeat by the British in the <!--del_lnk--> Falklands War discredited the Argentine military regime.<p>Democracy was restored in 1983. <!--del_lnk--> Ra&uacute;l Alfons&iacute;n&#39;s Radical government took steps to account for the &quot;disappeared&quot;, established civilian control of the armed forces, and consolidated democratic institutions. The members of the three military juntas were prosecuted and sentenced to life terms. Failure to resolve endemic economic problems and an inability to maintain public confidence led to Alfons&iacute;n&#39;s early departure six months before his term was to be completed.<p>President <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Menem imposed a <!--del_lnk--> peso-<a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">dollar</a> <!--del_lnk--> fixed exchange rate in 1991 to stop <!--del_lnk--> hyperinflation and adopted far-reaching market-based policies, dismantling <!--del_lnk--> protectionist barriers and business <!--del_lnk--> regulations, and implementing a <!--del_lnk--> privatization program. These reforms contributed to significant increases in investment and growth with stable prices through most of the 1990s.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The Menem and <!--del_lnk--> de la R&uacute;a administrations faced diminished competitiveness of exports, massive imports which damaged national industry and reduced employment, chronic fiscal and trade deficits, and the contagion of several economic crises. The <!--del_lnk--> Asian financial crisis in 1998 precipitated an <!--del_lnk--> outflow of capital that mushroomed into a <!--del_lnk--> recession, and culminated in a <!--del_lnk--> financial panic in November of 2001. The next month, amidst <!--del_lnk--> bloody riots, President de la R&uacute;a finally resigned.<p>In two weeks, several presidents followed in quick succession, culminating in <!--del_lnk--> Eduardo Duhalde being appointed interim <!--del_lnk--> President of Argentina by the Legislative Assembly on <!--del_lnk--> 2 January 2002. Argentina <!--del_lnk--> defaulted on its international debt obligations. The peso&#39;s almost 11-year-old linkage to the U.S. dollar was abandoned, resulting in major <!--del_lnk--> depreciation of the peso and a spike in <!--del_lnk--> inflation.<p>With a more competitive and flexible exchange rate, the country started implementing new policies based on re-industrialization, <!--del_lnk--> import substitution, increased exports, and consistent fiscal and trade surpluses. By the end of 2002, the economy began to stabilize. In 2003, <!--del_lnk--> N&eacute;stor Kirchner was elected president. During Kirchner&#39;s presidency, Argentina <!--del_lnk--> restructured its defaulted debt with a steep discount (about 75 percent) on most bonds, paid off outstanding debts with the <!--del_lnk--> International Monetary Fund, renegotiated contracts with utilities, and nationalized some previously privatized industries. Currently, Argentina is enjoying a period of high economic growth and increased political stability.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>

      <p>Argentina&#39;s political framework is a <!--del_lnk--> federal <!--del_lnk--> presidential <!--del_lnk--> representative democratic <!--del_lnk--> republic, in which the <!--del_lnk--> President of Argentina is both <!--del_lnk--> head of state and <!--del_lnk--> head of government, complemented by a pluriform <!--del_lnk--> multi-party system.

The <!--del_lnk--> Argentine Constitution of 1853 mandates a <!--del_lnk--> separation of powers into <!--del_lnk--> executive, <!--del_lnk--> legislative, and <!--del_lnk--> judicial branches at the national and provincial level.<p><!--del_lnk--> Executive power resides in the <!--del_lnk--> President and his cabinet. The <!--del_lnk--> President and Vice President are directly elected to 4-year terms, limited to two consecutive terms, and the <!--del_lnk--> cabinet ministers are appointed by the president.<p><!--del_lnk--> Legislative power is vested in the bicameral <!--del_lnk--> National Congress or <i><!--del_lnk--> Congreso de la Naci&oacute;n</i>, consisting of a <!--del_lnk--> Senate (<i><!--del_lnk--> Senado</i>) of 72 seats, and a <!--del_lnk--> Chamber of Deputies (<i><!--del_lnk--> C&aacute;mara de Diputados</i>) of 257 members. Senators serve 6-year terms, with one-third standing for reelection every 2 years. Members of the Chamber of Deputies are directly elected to 4-year term via a system of <!--del_lnk--> proportional representation, with half of the members of the <!--del_lnk--> lower house being elected every 2 years. A third of the candidates presented by the parties must be women.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. The <!--del_lnk--> Argentine Supreme Court of Justice has 9 members who are appointed by the President in consultation with the Senate.

      <p>Argentina is nearly 3,700 km long from north to south, and 1,400 km from east to west (maximum values). It can roughly be divided into four parts: the fertile plains of the <!--del_lnk--> Pampas in the centre the country, the source of Argentina&#39;s <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agricultural</a> wealth; the flat to rolling, oil-rich plateau of <!--del_lnk--> Patagonia in the southern half down to <!--del_lnk--> Tierra del Fuego; the subtropical flats of the <!--del_lnk--> Gran Chaco in the north, and the rugged <a href="../../wp/a/Andes.htm" title="Andes">Andes</a> <!--del_lnk--> mountain range along the western border with <a href="../../wp/c/Chile.htm" title="Chile">Chile</a>.<p>The highest point above <!--del_lnk--> sea level in Argentina is located in <!--del_lnk--> Mendoza. Cerro <!--del_lnk--> Aconcagua, at 6,962 <!--del_lnk--> meters (22,834 <!--del_lnk--> feet), is the highest mountain in the <!--del_lnk--> Americas, the <!--del_lnk--> Southern, and <!--del_lnk--> Western Hemisphere. The lowest point is <!--del_lnk--> Laguna del Carb&oacute;n in <!--del_lnk--> Santa Cruz, &minus;105 meters (&minus;344 feet) below sea level. This is also the lowest point on the South American <a href="../../wp/c/Continent.htm" title="Continent">continent</a>. The geographic centre of the country is located in south-central <!--del_lnk--> La Pampa province.<p>The country has a territorial claim over a portion of <!--del_lnk--> Antarctica, where it has maintained a constant occupied presence for more than a <!--del_lnk--> century, starting in 1904.<p><a id="Geographic_regions" name="Geographic_regions"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Geographic regions</span></h3>
      <p>The country is traditionally divided into several major geographically distinct regions:<ul>
       <li>Pampas: The plains west and south from <a href="../../wp/b/Buenos_Aires.htm" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a> are some of the most fertile in the world. Called the Humid Pampa, they cover most of the provinces of <!--del_lnk--> Buenos Aires and <!--del_lnk--> C&oacute;rdoba, and big portions of the provinces of <!--del_lnk--> Santa Fe and <!--del_lnk--> La Pampa. The western part of <!--del_lnk--> La Pampa and the province <!--del_lnk--> San Luis also have plains (the Dry Pampa), but they are drier and used mainly for grazing. The <!--del_lnk--> Sierra de C&oacute;rdoba in the homonymous province (extending into San Luis), is the most important geographical feature of the pampas.<li>Gran Chaco: The <!--del_lnk--> Gran Chaco region in the north of the country is seasonal dry/wet, mainly cotton growing and livestock raising. It covers the provinces of <!--del_lnk--> Chaco and <!--del_lnk--> Formosa. It is dotted with subtropical forests, scrubland, and some wetlands, home to a large number of plant and animal species. The province of <!--del_lnk--> Santiago del Estero lies in the drier region of the Gran Chaco.<li>Mesopotamia: The land between the <!--del_lnk--> Paran&aacute; and <!--del_lnk--> Uruguay rivers is called <!--del_lnk--> Mesopotamia and it is shared by the provinces of <!--del_lnk--> Corrientes and <!--del_lnk--> Entre R&iacute;os. It features flatland apt for grazing and plant growing, and the <!--del_lnk--> Iber&aacute; Wetlands in central Corrientes. <!--del_lnk--> Misiones province is more tropical and belongs within the <!--del_lnk--> Brazilian Highlands geographic feature. It features subtropical rainforests and the <!--del_lnk--> Iguaz&uacute; Falls.<li>Patagonia: The <!--del_lnk--> steppes of <!--del_lnk--> Patagonia, in the provinces of <!--del_lnk--> Neuqu&eacute;n, <!--del_lnk--> R&iacute;o Negro, <!--del_lnk--> Chubut and <!--del_lnk--> Santa Cruz, are of <!--del_lnk--> Tertiary origin. Most of the region is semiarid in the north to cold and arid in the far south, but forests grow in its western fringes which are dotted with several large lakes. <!--del_lnk--> Tierra del Fuego is cool and wet, moderated by oceanic influences. Northern Patagonia (roughly R&iacute;o Negro south of the homonymous river, and Neuqu&eacute;n) can also be referred as the <b>Comahue</b> <!--del_lnk--> region (not commonly in use).<li>Cuyo: West-central Argentina is dominated by the imposing <a href="../../wp/a/Andes.htm" title="Andes">Andes</a> Mountains. To their east is the arid region known as <!--del_lnk--> Cuyo. Melting waters from high in the mountains form the backbone of irrigated lowland oasis, at the centre of a rich fruit and <a href="../../wp/w/Wine.htm" title="Wine">wine</a> growing region in <!--del_lnk--> Mendoza and <!--del_lnk--> San Juan provinces. Further north the region gets hotter and drier with more geographical accidents in <!--del_lnk--> La Rioja province.<li>NOA or Noroeste: This region is the highest in average elevation. Several parallel mountain ranges, several of which have peaks higher than 20,000 feet, dominate the area. These ranges grow wider in geographic extent towards the north. They are cut by fertile river valleys, the most important being the <!--del_lnk--> Calchaqu&iacute; Valleys in the provinces of <!--del_lnk--> Catamarca, <!--del_lnk--> Tucum&aacute;n, and <!--del_lnk--> Salta. Farther north the province of <!--del_lnk--> Jujuy near <a href="../../wp/b/Bolivia.htm" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a> lies mainly within the <!--del_lnk--> Altiplano plateau of the Central Andes. The <!--del_lnk--> Tropic of Capricorn goes through the far north of the region.</ul>

      <p>Argentina has 2,665 kilometers (1,656mi) of <!--del_lnk--> coastline. The continental platform is unusually wide; in Argentina this shallow area of the <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic <a href="../../wp/o/Ocean.htm" title="Ocean">Ocean</a> is called <!--del_lnk--> Mar Argentino. The waters are rich in fisheries and suspected of holding important <!--del_lnk--> hydrocarbon energy resources.

The two major <!--del_lnk--> ocean currents affecting the coast are the warm <!--del_lnk--> Brazil Current and the cold <!--del_lnk--> Falkland Current (Spanish: <i>corriente Ant&aacute;rtica</i>). Because of the uneveness of the coastal landmass, the two currents alternate in their influence on climate and do not allow temperatures to fall evenly with higher latitude.

      <p>Because of longitudinal and elevation amplitudes, Argentina is subject to a variety of climates. As a rule, the <a href="../../wp/c/Climate.htm" title="Climate">climate</a> is predominantly <!--del_lnk--> temperate with extremes ranging from <!--del_lnk--> subtropical in the north to subpolar in the far south. The north of the country is characterized by very hot, humid summers with mild drier winters, and is subject to periodic droughts. Central Argentina has hot summers with thunderstorms (in western Argentina producing some of the world&#39;s largest <!--del_lnk--> hail), and cool winters. The southern regions have warm summers and cold winters with heavy snowfall, specially in mountainous zones. Higher elevations at all latitudes experience cooler conditions.<p>The hottest and coldest <!--del_lnk--> temperature extremes recorded in South America have occurred in Argentina. A record high temperature of 48.8&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> &deg;C (120&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> &deg;F), was recorded at Rivadavia, <!--del_lnk--> Salta on <!--del_lnk--> December 11, <!--del_lnk--> 1905. The lowest temperature recorded was &minus;32.7 &deg;C (&minus;27&nbsp;&deg;F) at Sarmiento, <!--del_lnk--> Chubut, June 1st, 1907.<p>Major winds in Argentina include the cool <!--del_lnk--> Pampero blowing on the flat plains of Patagonia and the <i>Pampas</i> after a <!--del_lnk--> cold front; the <!--del_lnk--> Viento Norte, a warm wind that can blow from the north in mid and late winter creating mild conditions; and the <!--del_lnk--> Zonda, a hot and dry wind (<!--del_lnk--> <i>see</i> F&ouml;hn wind), affecting west-central Argentina. Squeezed of all moisture during the 6,000 meter descent from the Andes, Zonda winds can blow for hours with gusts up to 120 <!--del_lnk--> km/h, fueling <!--del_lnk--> wildfires and causing damage. When the Zonda blows (June-November), snowstorms and <!--del_lnk--> blizzard (<i>viento blanco</i>) conditions usually affect the higher elevations.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Sudestada (literally &quot;southeaster&quot;) could be considered similar to the <!--del_lnk--> Noreaster, though snowfall is rarely involved (but is not unprecedented). Both are associated with a deep winter low pressure system. The <i>sudestada</i> usually moderates cold temperatures but brings very heavy rains, rough seas, and coastal flooding. It is most common in late autumn and winter along the coasts of central Argentina and in the R&iacute;o de la Plata <!--del_lnk--> estuary.<p>The southern regions, particularly the far south, experience long periods of daylight from November to February (up to 19 hours), and extended nights from May to August. All of Argentina uses <!--del_lnk--> UTC-3 time zone. The country does not observe <!--del_lnk--> daylight savings.<p><a id="Extreme_points" name="Extreme_points"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Extreme points</span></h3>
      <p>Argentina&#39;s eastermost continental point is northeast of the town of <!--del_lnk--> Bernardo de Irigoyen, <!--del_lnk--> Misiones (<span class="plainlinksneverexpand"><!--del_lnk--> 26&deg;15&prime;S 53&deg;38&prime;W</span>), the westernmost in the Mariano Moreno Range in <!--del_lnk--> Santa Cruz (<span class="plainlinksneverexpand"><!--del_lnk--> 49&deg;33&prime;S 73&deg;35&prime;W</span>).

      <p>There is one Argentine <!--del_lnk--> exclave, the <!--del_lnk--> Mart&iacute;n Garc&iacute;a Island (co-ordinates <span class="plainlinksneverexpand"><!--del_lnk--> 34&deg;11&prime;S 58&deg;15&prime;W</span>). It is near the confluence of the Paran&aacute; and Uruguay rivers, a kilometre (0.62&nbsp;mi) inside <a href="../../wp/u/Uruguay.htm" title="Uruguay">Uruguayan</a> waters, and 3.5 kilometres (2.1 mi) from the Uruguayan coastline near the small town of <!--del_lnk--> Mart&iacute;n Chico (itself halfway between <!--del_lnk--> Nueva Palmira and <!--del_lnk--> Colonia del Sacramento).<p>An agreement reached by Argentina and Uruguay in 1973 reaffirmed Argentine jurisdiction over the island, ending a century-old dispute. Under the terms of the agreement, Mart&iacute;n Garc&iacute;a is to be devoted exclusively as a natural preserve. Its area is about 2 square kilometres (500&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> acres), and its population is about 200 people.<p><a id="Flora_and_fauna" name="Flora_and_fauna"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Flora and fauna</span></h2>

      <p>Subtropical plants dominate the north, part of the <!--del_lnk--> Gran Chaco region of South America. The <!--del_lnk--> genus <!--del_lnk--> Dalbergia of trees is well disseminated with representatives like the <i><!--del_lnk--> Brazilian Rosewood</i> and the <i><!--del_lnk--> quebracho</i> tree; also predominant are white and black <i><!--del_lnk--> algarrobo</i> trees (<!--del_lnk--> prosopis alba and <!--del_lnk--> prosopis nigra). <i>Savannah</i>-like areas exist in the drier regions nearer the <a href="../../wp/a/Andes.htm" title="Andes">Andes</a>. Acquatic plants thrive in the wetlands dotting the region.<p>In central Argentina the <i>humid <!--del_lnk--> pampas</i> are a true <!--del_lnk--> tallgrass prairie <!--del_lnk--> ecosystem. The original <i>pampa</i> had virtually no <!--del_lnk--> trees; today along roads or in towns and country estates (<i>estancias</i>), some imported species like the <!--del_lnk--> American sycamore or <!--del_lnk--> eucalyptus are present. The only tree-like plant native to the <i>pampa</i> is the <!--del_lnk--> omb&uacute;, an evergreen. The surface soils of the <i>pampa</i> are a deep black colour, primarily <i>humus</i>, known commonly as <!--del_lnk--> compost. It is this which makes the region one of the most agriculturaly productive on Earth. However, this is also responsible for decimating much of the original ecosystem, to make way for commercial <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>. The western <i>pampas</i> receive less rainfall, this <i>dry pampa</i> is a plain of short grasses or <!--del_lnk--> steppe.<p>Most of <!--del_lnk--> Patagonia in the south lies within a <i>rain shade</i> of the <a href="../../wp/a/Andes.htm" title="Andes">Andes</a>. The plantlife, shrubby bushes and plants, is well suited to withstand dry conditions. The soil is hard and rocky making large-scale <!--del_lnk--> farming impossible except along <!--del_lnk--> river valleys. <!--del_lnk--> Coniferous forests grow in far western Patagonia and on the island of <!--del_lnk--> Tierra del Fuego. Conifers native to the region include <!--del_lnk--> alerce (<i>Fitzroya cupressoides</i>), <!--del_lnk--> cipr&eacute;s de la cordillera (<i>Austrocedrus chilensis</i>), <!--del_lnk--> cipr&eacute;s de las guaitecas (<i>Pilgerodendron uviferum</i>), <!--del_lnk--> huililahu&aacute;n (<i>Podocarpus nubigenus</i>), <!--del_lnk--> lleuque (<i>Prumnopitys andina</i>), <!--del_lnk--> ma&ntilde;&iacute;o hembra (<i>Saxegothaea conspicua</i>), and <!--del_lnk--> pehu&eacute;n (<i>Araucaria araucana</i>), while native broadleaf trees include several species of <i><!--del_lnk--> Nothofagus</i> including coig&uuml;e or <!--del_lnk--> coihue, <!--del_lnk--> lenga (<i>Nothofagus pumilio</i>), <!--del_lnk--> &ntilde;ire (<i>Nothofagus antarctica</i>). Other introduced trees present in <!--del_lnk--> forestry <!--del_lnk--> plantations include <!--del_lnk--> spruce, <!--del_lnk--> cypress, and <!--del_lnk--> pine. Common plants are the <!--del_lnk--> copihue and colihue (<i><!--del_lnk--> Chusquea coleou</i>).<p>In <!--del_lnk--> Cuyo, semiarid thorny bushes and other <!--del_lnk--> xerophile plants abound. Along the many river <!--del_lnk--> oasis, grasses and trees grow in significant numbers. The area presents optimal conditions for the large scale growth of <!--del_lnk--> grape vines. In the northwest of Argentina there are many species of <a href="../../wp/c/Cactus.htm" title="Cactus">cactii</a>. In the highest elevations (often above 4,000mts), no vegetation grows due to the extreme altitude, and the soils are virtually devoid of any plant life.<p>The <i>ceibo</i> flower (belonging to the tree <!--del_lnk--> Erythrina crista-galli), is the national flower of Argentina.<p><a id="Animal_life" name="Animal_life"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Animal life</span></h3>
      <p>Many species live in the subtropical north.

      <p>Argentina benefits from rich <!--del_lnk--> natural resources, a highly <!--del_lnk--> literate population, an export-oriented <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agricultural</a> sector, and a diversified <a href="../../wp/i/Industry.htm" title="Industry">industrial</a> base. The country historically had a large middle class compared to other Latin American countries, but this segment of the population was decimated by a succession of economic crises. Today, while a significant segment of the population is still financially well-off, they stand in sharp contrast with millions who have seen their purchasing power drastically reduced. Since 2002, there has been an improvement in the situation of the poorer sectors and a strong rebound of the middle class.<p>Since the late 1970s, the country piled up public debt and was plagued by bouts of high <!--del_lnk--> inflation. In 1991, the government <!--del_lnk--> pegged the peso to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">U.S. dollar</a> and limited the growth in the <!--del_lnk--> monetary base. The government then embarked on a path of <!--del_lnk--> trade liberalization, <!--del_lnk--> deregulation, and <!--del_lnk--> privatization. Inflation dropped and the <!--del_lnk--> gross domestic product grew, but external economic shocks and failures of the system diluted its benefits, causing it to crumble in slow motion, from 1995 and up to the <!--del_lnk--> collapse in 2001.<p>By 2002, Argentina had <!--del_lnk--> defaulted on its debt, its GDP had shrunk, <!--del_lnk--> unemployment was more than 25%, and the peso had <!--del_lnk--> depreciated 75% after being <!--del_lnk--> devalued and <!--del_lnk--> floated. However, careful spending control and heavy <!--del_lnk--> taxes on now-soaring exports gave the state the tools to regain resources and conduct <!--del_lnk--> monetary policy.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>In 2003, <!--del_lnk--> import substitution policies and soaring <!--del_lnk--> exports coupled with lower inflation and expansive economic measures, triggered a surge in the GDP. It was repeated in 2004 and 2005, creating millions of jobs and encouraging internal consumption. <!--del_lnk--> Capital flight decreased, and <!--del_lnk--> foreign investment slowly returned. The influx of foreign currency from exports created a huge <!--del_lnk--> trade surplus. The Central Bank was forced to buy dollars from the market, and continues to do a various times today to be accumulated as <!--del_lnk--> reserves. It does this to prevent the argentine peso from appreciating significantly and cutting competitiveness.<p>The situation by 2006 was further improved, the year is on track to match the large GDP growth of the last three (predictions are between 8.5% and 9.0%), though inflation, estimated at around 10 to 12%, has become an issue again, and <!--del_lnk--> income distribution is still considerably unequal. In a variety of reports, internationals organizations criticize Argentina for remaining a somewhat closed economy.<p>Even as the effects of the crisis have abated but not disappeared, Argentina remains one of the most developed countries in Latin America. Even though the income distribution is an important pending problem, it boasts the highest <!--del_lnk--> GDP per capita based on <!--del_lnk--> purchasing power parity, and the 3rd highest in US$ (nominal) GDP. The country enjoys the highest levels of education measured by university attendance, and a reasonable infrastructure that in many aspects equals that found in fully industrialized nations.<p>In 2002, 57,5% of the population was below the <a href="../../wp/p/Poverty.htm" title="Poverty">poverty</a> line, but the last report of August 2006 showed a 31,4% poverty level. Similarly, unemployment was more than 25 percent, by July 2006 it was 10.2 percent. GDP per capita has surpassed the previous pre-recession peak of 1998 in PPP, but still lags in nominal GDP, mostly due to an undervalued currency. The economy grew 8.9 percent in 2003, 9.0 percent in 2004, and 9.2 percent in 2005. As of 2006 foreign debt stands at 68 percent of GDP and is slowly decreasing.<p><a id="Sectors" name="Sectors"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Sectors</span></h3>

      <p>Argentina&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> highway system is well developed and paved roads reach all corners of the country. There are nearly 640,000 kilometers of highways and roads. Multilane highways now connect several main cities and more are now under construction.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> railway network was one of the largest in the world, at over 40,000 kilometers of tracks. After decades of decaying service and lack of maintenance, most passenger services shut down in 1992 when the rail company was privatized, and thousands of kilometers of track are now in disrepair. Currently, railway services are being reactivated between several cities, along with upgrades in the system. A <!--del_lnk--> high-speed train project between Buenos Aires and Rosario is due to break ground in 2007.<p>The country has around 3,000 kilometers of <!--del_lnk--> waterways, most significant among these the <!--del_lnk--> R&iacute;o de la Plata, <!--del_lnk--> Paran&aacute;, <!--del_lnk--> Uruguay, and <!--del_lnk--> Paraguay rivers.<p><a id="Population" name="Population"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Population</span></h2>

      <p>More than any other Latin American country, Argentina&#39;s population is of European origin.

      <p>After the regimented Spanish colonists, waves of European <!--del_lnk--> immigrants settled in Argentina from the late 19th to mid 20th centuries. Major contributors include <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> (notably <!--del_lnk--> Campania, <!--del_lnk--> Piedmont, <!--del_lnk--> Calabria, <!--del_lnk--> Veneto, <!--del_lnk--> Lombardy), <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> (foremost among them ethnic <!--del_lnk--> Galicians and <!--del_lnk--> Basques), and <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> (mostly to Buenos Aires and Mendoza).

There is a large <!--del_lnk--> Armenian community, and the patagonian Chubut Valley has a significant <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Welsh</a>-descended population. The majority of Argentina&#39;s Jewish community (the largest in Latin America and fifth worldwide) derives from immigrants of north and eastern European origin (<!--del_lnk--> Ashkenazi Jews), and about 15-20% from <!--del_lnk--> Sephardic groups from Spain or <!--del_lnk--> Muslim nations. Many <!--del_lnk--> Syrians and <!--del_lnk--> Lebanese chose to emigrate to Argentina, which prior to 1924 were recorded as arrivals from the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>.<p><a id="Minorities" name="Minorities"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Minorities</span></h3>

      <p>Small but growing numbers of people from East Asia have also settled Argentina, mainly in Buenos Aires.

The <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">Chinese</a> population alone has risen dramatically, now at over 60,000. Argentina is home to a significant <!--del_lnk--> refugee population from <a href="../../wp/l/Laos.htm" title="Laos">Laos</a>.<p>Argentina has a large <!--del_lnk--> Arabic community, made up mostly of immigrants from <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a> and <a href="../../wp/l/Lebanon.htm" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>. Many have gained prominent status in national business and politics, including former president <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Menem, the son of <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syrian</a> settlers from the province of La Rioja. Most of the Arab Argentines are <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christian</a> of the <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Orthodox and <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Catholic Churches, other than Muslims who represent a small portion of Arab Argentines.<p>The officially recognized <!--del_lnk--> indigenous population in the country, according to the <!--del_lnk--> 2005 Complementary Survey of Indigenous Peoples, stands at approximately 318,700 people (0.8 percent of the total population), who are either members or first-generation descendants of a recognized indigenous community.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Illegal immigration has been a relatively important population factor in recent Argentine demographics. Most illegal immigrants come from <a href="../../wp/b/Bolivia.htm" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Paraguay.htm" title="Paraguay">Paraguay</a>, countries which border Argentina to the north.

The number of stowaways inside incoming ships from <!--del_lnk--> West Africa have increased in recent times. The Argentine government estimates 750,000 are undocumented and has launched a program called <i>Patria Grande</i> (&quot;Greater Homeland&quot;), to encourage illegal immigrants to regularize their status; so far some 200,000 applications have been processed under the program. Other unofficial estimates suggest that over one million people reside in Argentina illegally.<p><a id="Urbanization" name="Urbanization"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Urbanization</span></h3>

      <p>Argentina&#39;s population is very highly urbanized. About 2.7 million people live in the autonomous city of <a href="../../wp/b/Buenos_Aires.htm" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, and 11.5 million in <!--del_lnk--> Greater Buenos Aires (2001), making it one of the largest urban conglomerates in the world. Together with their respective <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan areas, the second- and third-largest cities in Argentina, <!--del_lnk--> C&oacute;rdoba and <!--del_lnk--> Rosario, comprise about 1.3 and 1.1 million inhabitants respectively.<p>Most European <!--del_lnk--> immigrants to Argentina settled in the cities, which offered jobs, education, and other opportunities that enabled newcomers to enter the <!--del_lnk--> middle class. Many also settled in the growing small towns along the expanding railway system. Since the 1930s, many rural workers have moved to the big cities.<p>The 1990s saw many rural towns become <!--del_lnk--> ghost towns when train services ceased and local products manufactured on a small scale were replaced by massive amounts of cheap imported goods. Many slums (<i><!--del_lnk--> villas miseria</i>) sprouted in the outskirts of the largest cities, inhabited by impoverished lower-class urban dwellers, migrants from smaller towns in the interior, and also a large number of immigrants from neighbouring countries that came during the time of the convertibility and did not leave after the 2001 crisis.<p>Argentina&#39;s urban areas have a European look, reflecting the influence of European settlers. Many cities are built in a Spanish-grid style around a main square called a <i>plaza</i>. A cathedral and important government buildings often face the <i>plaza</i>. The general layout of the cities is called a <i>damero</i>, or checkerboard, since it is based on a pattern of square blocks, though modern developments sometimes depart from it (the city of La Plata, built at the end of the 19th century, is organized as a checkerboard plus diagonal avenues at fixed intervals). The El Faro Towers, show the modern architecture for urbanization.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

The struggle between the Unitarians (who favored a loose <!--del_lnk--> confederation of provinces based on rural conservatism) and the Federalists (pro-<a href="../../wp/l/Liberalism.htm" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a> and advocates of a strong federal government that would encourage European immigration), set the tone for Argentine literature of the time.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The ideological divide between <!--del_lnk--> gaucho epic <i><!--del_lnk--> Mart&iacute;n Fierro</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; Hern&aacute;ndez, and <i>Facundo</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, is a great example. Hern&aacute;ndez favored the pastoral lifestyle of early Argentina and vehemently opposed European immigration. Sarmiento wrote immigration was the only way to save Argentina from becoming subject to the rule of a small number of dictatorial <i><!--del_lnk--> caudillo</i> families, arguing such immigrants would make Argentina more modern and enlightened to Western European thought, and therefore a more prosperous society.<p>Argentine literature of that period was fiercely nationalist. It was followed by the <!--del_lnk--> modernist movement, which emerged in <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> in the late 19th century, and this period in turn was followed by vanguardism, with <!--del_lnk--> Ricardo G&uuml;iraldes as an important reference. <a href="../../wp/j/Jorge_Luis_Borges.htm" title="Jorge Luis Borges">Jorge Luis Borges</a> is Argentina&#39;s most acclaimed writer. Borges found new ways of looking at the modern world in metaphor and philosophical debate, and his influence has extended to writers all over the globe. Borges is most famous for his works in short stories such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Ficciones</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Aleph</i>.<p>Argentina has produced many more internationally noted writers, poets, and intellectuals: <!--del_lnk--> Juan Bautista Alberdi, <!--del_lnk--> Roberto Arlt, <!--del_lnk--> Enrique Banchs, <!--del_lnk--> Adolfo Bioy C&aacute;sares, <!--del_lnk--> Eugenio Cambaceres, <!--del_lnk--> Julio Cort&aacute;zar, <!--del_lnk--> Esteban Echeverria, <!--del_lnk--> Leopoldo Lugones, <!--del_lnk--> Eduardo Mallea, <!--del_lnk--> Ezequiel Mart&iacute;nez Estrada, <!--del_lnk--> Tom&aacute;s Eloy Mart&iacute;nez, <!--del_lnk--> Victoria Ocampo, <!--del_lnk--> Manuel Puig, <!--del_lnk--> Ernesto Sabato, <!--del_lnk--> Osvaldo Soriano, <!--del_lnk--> Alfonsina Storni, and <!--del_lnk--> Mar&iacute;a Elena Walsh.

      <p>Argentina is a major producer of <a href="../../wp/f/Film.htm" title="Motion pictures">motion pictures</a>. The world&#39;s first animated films were made and released in Argentina, by cartoonist <!--del_lnk--> Quirino Cristiani. <!--del_lnk--> Argentine cinema enjoyed a &#39;golden age&#39; in the 1930s through the 1950s with scores of productions, many now considered classics of Spanish-language film. More recent films have achieved worldwide recognition, such as <i><!--del_lnk--> The Official Story (La Historia Oficial)</i> , <i><!--del_lnk--> Nine Queens (Nueve Reinas)</i> , <i><!--del_lnk--> Man Facing Southeast</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Son of the Bride</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Motorcycle Diaries (Diarios de Motocicleta)</i> , or <i><!--del_lnk--> Iluminados por el Fuego</i>. Although rarely rivaling <!--del_lnk--> Hollywood-type movies in popularity, local films are released weekly and widely followed in Argentina and internationally. Even low-budget films have earned prizes in cinema festivals (such as <!--del_lnk--> Cannes). The city of <!--del_lnk--> Mar del Plata organizes its <!--del_lnk--> own film festival, while Buenos Aires has its <!--del_lnk--> independent cinema counterpart. The per capita number of screens is one of the highest in Latin America, and viewing per capita is the highest in the region. A new generation of Argentine directors has caught the attention of critics worldwide.<p>Buenos Aires is one of the great capitals of <!--del_lnk--> theatre. Besides the <i>Teatro Col&oacute;n</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Col&oacute;n Theatre, one of the great <!--del_lnk--> opera houses of the world), with its program of national and international caliber, <i>Calle Corrientes</i>, or <!--del_lnk--> Corrientes Avenue, is synonymous with the art. It is dubbed &#39;the street that never sleeps&#39;, and sometimes referred to as the <!--del_lnk--> Broadway of Buenos Aires. Many great careers in acting, music, and film have begun in its many theaters. The <i>Teatro General San Mart&iacute;n</i> is one of the most prestigious along Corrientes Avenue; the <i>Teatro Nacional Cervantes</i> is designated the national theater of Argentina. Another important theatre is the <i>Independencia</i> in <!--del_lnk--> Mendoza.

      <p>The major genres of popular music in Argentina are <i>folclore</i> (<a href="../../wp/f/Folk_music.htm" title="Folk music">folk music</a>), <!--del_lnk--> tango, <!--del_lnk--> rock, <i>tropical</i> music (<!--del_lnk--> cumbia), and <!--del_lnk--> dance-<!--del_lnk--> electronica.<p><i>Tango</i>, the music <i>and</i> lyrics (often sung in a form of slang called <!--del_lnk--> lunfardo), is Argentina&#39;s musical symbol. The <!--del_lnk--> Milonga dance was a predecessor, slowly evolving into mordern <i>tango</i>. By the 1930s, <i>tango</i> had changed from a dance focused music to one of lyric and poetry, with singers like <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Gardel, <!--del_lnk--> Roberto Goyeneche, <!--del_lnk--> Hugo del Carril, <!--del_lnk--> Tita Merello, and <!--del_lnk--> Edmundo Rivero. The golden age of <i>tango</i> (1930 to mid-1950s) mirrored that of <a href="../../wp/j/Jazz.htm" title="Jazz">Jazz</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Swing in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, featuring large orchestral groups too, like the bands of <!--del_lnk--> Osvaldo Pugliese, <!--del_lnk--> Anibal Troilo, <!--del_lnk--> Francisco Canaro, and <!--del_lnk--> Juan D&#39;Arienzo. After 1955 <i>tango</i> turned more intellectual and listener-oriented, led by <!--del_lnk--> Astor Piazzolla. Today tango has worldwide popularity, and the rise of <!--del_lnk--> <i>neo-tango</i> is a global phenomenon with groups like <!--del_lnk--> Tanghetto, <!--del_lnk--> Bajofondo and <!--del_lnk--> Gotan Project.<p><!--del_lnk--> Argentine rock is the most popular music among youth. Arguably the most listened form of <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_language.htm" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>-language rock, its influence and success internationally owes to a rich, uninterrupted evolution. Bands such as <!--del_lnk--> Soda Stereo or <!--del_lnk--> Sumo, and composers like <!--del_lnk--> Charly Garc&iacute;a, <!--del_lnk--> Luis Alberto Spinetta, and <!--del_lnk--> Fito P&aacute;ez are referents of national culture. Mid 1960s <a href="../../wp/b/Buenos_Aires.htm" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Rosario were craddles of the music, and by 1970 argentine rock was established among middle class youth (see <!--del_lnk--> Almendra, <!--del_lnk--> Sui Generis, <!--del_lnk--> Pappo, <!--del_lnk--> Crucis). <!--del_lnk--> Seru Giran bridged the gap into the 1980s, when Argentine bands became popular across Latin America and elsewhere (<!--del_lnk--> Enanitos Verdes, <!--del_lnk--> Fabulosos Cadillacs, <!--del_lnk--> Virus, <!--del_lnk--> Andres Calamaro). There are many sub-genres: underground, pop oriented, and some associated with the working class (<!--del_lnk--> La Renga, <!--del_lnk--> Attaque 77, <!--del_lnk--> Divididos, <!--del_lnk--> Los Redonditos). Current popular bands include: <!--del_lnk--> Babasonicos, <!--del_lnk--> Rata Blanca, <!--del_lnk--> El Otro Yo, <!--del_lnk--> Attaque 77, <!--del_lnk--> Bersuit, <!--del_lnk--> Los Piojos, <!--del_lnk--> Intoxicados, and <!--del_lnk--> Miranda!.<p>&quot;Tropical&quot; music, a mixture of <!--del_lnk--> cumbia, local folk, and <!--del_lnk--> Caribbean syles, made it to Buenos Aires with South American migrants. This along with <!--del_lnk--> Cuarteto (<!--del_lnk--> C&oacute;rdoba, where artist <!--del_lnk--> La Mona Jim&eacute;nez has inmense popularity) and <!--del_lnk--> chamam&eacute; (<!--del_lnk--> Corrientes), gave rise to <!--del_lnk--> cumbia villera. The preferred musical style in the <!--del_lnk--> villa miseria (slums), its lyrics can parallel those of U.S. <!--del_lnk--> gangsta rap (<a href="../../wp/p/Poverty.htm" title="Poverty">poverty</a>, <!--del_lnk--> drugs and <a href="../../wp/c/Crime.htm" title="Crime">crime</a>). Cumbia villera is increasingly accepted within the middle class, particularly bands with ties to <a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Football (soccer)">football</a> idols (popular bands: <i>Yerba Brava, Pibes Chorros, <!--del_lnk--> Damas Gratis, Nestor en Bloque</i>). <!--del_lnk--> Rodrigo Bueno, simply known as <i>Rodrigo</i>, was a surging <!--del_lnk--> cuarteto star until his untimely death in 2000.<p><a href="../../wp/b/Buenos_Aires.htm" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a> has a major <!--del_lnk--> techno and <!--del_lnk--> electronica scene in Latin America, hosting a variety of events like local raves, the South American Music Conference, and <!--del_lnk--> Creamfields (which has the world record of 65,000 people). European <!--del_lnk--> DJs tour Buenos Aires to perform at clubs or in festivals. The city has its own form of <!--del_lnk--> house music, and is home to many successful electronic tango groups. Famous DJs from Argentina include <!--del_lnk--> Hernan Cattaneo and <!--del_lnk--> DJ Dero. <!--del_lnk--> Mar del Plata and <!--del_lnk--> Bariloche are other important dance and club-oriented cities.<p><!--del_lnk--> European classical music is well represented in Argentina. Buenos Aires is home to the world-renowned <!--del_lnk--> Col&oacute;n Theatre. Classical musicians, such as <!--del_lnk--> Martha Argerich, <!--del_lnk--> Lalo Schiffrin, <!--del_lnk--> Daniel Barenboim, Eduardo Alonso-Crespo, and classical composers like <!--del_lnk--> Alberto Ginastera are internationally acclaimed. All major cities in Argentina have impressive theaters or opera houses, and provincial or city orchestras.<p>Argentine folk music is uniquely vast. Beyond dozens of regional dances, a national folk style emerged in the 1930s. <!--del_lnk--> Per&oacute;n&#39;s Argentina would give rise to <!--del_lnk--> Nueva Canci&oacute;n, as artists began expressing in their music objections to political themes. <!--del_lnk--> Atahualpa Yupanqui, the greatest argentine <!--del_lnk--> folk musician, and <!--del_lnk--> Mercedes Sosa would be defining figures in shaping Nueva Canci&oacute;n, gaining worldwide popularity in the process. The style found a huge reception in <a href="../../wp/c/Chile.htm" title="Chile">Chile</a>, where it took off in the 1970s and went on to influence the entirety of <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin American</a> music. Today, <!--del_lnk--> Chango Spasiuk and <!--del_lnk--> Soledad Pastorutti have brought folk back to younger generations. <!--del_lnk--> Leon Gieco&#39;s <i>folk-rock</i> bridged the gap between <!--del_lnk--> argentine folklore and <!--del_lnk--> argentine rock, introducing both styles to millions overseas in successive tours.<p>Other notable musicians include <!--del_lnk--> Gato Barbieri with his seductive <a href="../../wp/s/Saxophone.htm" title="Saxophone">saxophone</a> and <!--del_lnk--> free jazz compositions, and <!--del_lnk--> Jaime Torres and his spacious <!--del_lnk--> andean music.<p><a id="Religion" name="Religion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h3>

The most prevalent dialect is <!--del_lnk--> Rioplatense, whose speakers are primarily located in the basin of the <!--del_lnk--> R&iacute;o de la Plata.<p>A phonetic study conducted by the Laboratory for Sensory Investigations of <!--del_lnk--> CONICET and the University of Toronto showed that the accent of the inhabitants of Buenos Aires (known as <!--del_lnk--> Porte&ntilde;os) is closer to the Neapolitan dialect of Italian than any other spoken language. This immigration of Italians had a profound influence on <!--del_lnk--> Lunfardo, the famous slang spoken in Buenos Aires and elsewhere in the R&iacute;o de la Plata region, permeating the vernacular vocabulary of other regions as well.<dl>

      <p>School attendance is compulsory between the ages of 6 and 14. The Argentine school system consists of a primary or lower school level lasting six or seven years, and a secondary or high school level of between 3-5 years. In the 1990s, the system was split into different types of high school instruction, called <i>Educacion Secundaria</i> and the <i>Polimodal</i>. Some provinces adopted the <i>Polimodal</i> while others did not. There is a project in the Executive to repeal this measure and return to a more classic secondary level system of five years. President <!--del_lnk--> Domingo Faustino Sarmiento is overwhelmingly credited in pushing and implementing a free, modern education system in Argentina. The <!--del_lnk--> 1918 University reform shaped the current tripartite representation of most public Universities.<p>Education is free at all levels except for <!--del_lnk--> graduate studies. There are many private school institutions in the primary, secondary and university levels. Around 11.1 million people were enrolled in formal education of some kind:<ul>
       <li>9,551,728 people attended either kindergarten, primary (lower school), or secondary (high school) establishements<li>494,461 people attended non-university level establishements (such as training or technical schools)<li>1,125,257 people attended colleges or universities</ul>
      <p>There are 35 public <!--del_lnk--> universities across the contry, as well as several private. The Universities of <!--del_lnk--> Buenos Aires, <!--del_lnk--> C&oacute;rdoba, <!--del_lnk--> La Plata, <!--del_lnk--> UTN (Technology University) , and <!--del_lnk--> Cuyo (Mendoza), are among the most important. Terciary (university) attendance is very high for global standards. Public universities faced cutbacks in spending during the 1980s and 1990s, which led to a decline in overall quality.<p><a id="Holidays" name="Holidays"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Holidays</span></h3>

      <p>Argentina was a pioneering nation in radio broadcasting. At 9 PM on <!--del_lnk--> August 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1920, <i>Sociedad Radio Argentina</i> announced: <i>&quot;We now bring to your homes a live performance of <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_Wagner.htm" title="Richard Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>&#39;s Parsifal opera from the <!--del_lnk--> Coliseo Theatre in downtown Buenos Aires&quot;</i>; only about twenty homes in the city had a receiver to tune in. The world&#39;s first radio station was the only one in the country until 1922, when <i>Radio Cultura</i> went on the air. By 1925, there were twelve stations in Buenos Aires and ten in other cities. The 1930s were the &quot;golden age&quot; of radio in Argentina, with live variety, news, soap opera, and sport shows.<p>At present there are more than 1,500 radio stations licensed in Argentina; 260 are <!--del_lnk--> AM broadcasting and 1150 <!--del_lnk--> FM broadcasting. Radio remains an important medium in Argentina. Music and youth variety programs dominate FM formats; news, debate, and sports are AM radio&#39;s primary broadcasts. <!--del_lnk--> Amateur radio is widespread in the country. Radio still serves a vital service of information, entertainment and even life saving in the most remote communities.<p>The Argentine television industry is large and diverse, widely viewed in Latin America, and its productions seen around the world. Many local programs are broadcast by networks in other countries, and others have their rights purchased by foreign producers for adaptations in their own markets. Argentina has five major networks. All provincial capitals and other large cities have at least one local station. Argentina boasts the highest penetration of cable and satellite television in Latin America, similar to percentages in North America. Many cable networks operate from Argentina and serve the Spanish-speaking world, including <!--del_lnk--> Util&iacute;sima Satelital, <!--del_lnk--> TyC Sports, <!--del_lnk--> Fox Sports en Espa&ntilde;ol (with the United States and M&eacute;xico), MTV Argentina, Cosmopolitan TV, and the news network Todo Noticias.<p><a id="Trivia_on_Argentina" name="Trivia_on_Argentina"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Trivia on Argentina</span></h3>
