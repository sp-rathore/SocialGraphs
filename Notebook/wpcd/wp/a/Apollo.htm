      <p>In <a href="../../wp/g/Greek_mythology.htm" title="Greek mythology">Greek</a> and <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_mythology.htm" title="Roman mythology">Roman mythology</a>, <b>Apollo</b> (<!--del_lnk--> Ancient Greek <span class="polytonic" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#x1F08;&pi;&#x3CC;&lambda;&lambda;&omega;&nu;</span>, <i>Ap&oacute;ll&#x14D;n</i>; or &#x1F08;&pi;&#x3AD;&lambda;&lambda;&omega;&nu;, <i>Apell&#x14D;n</i>), the ideal of the <i><!--del_lnk--> kouros</i>, was the archer-god of medicine and healing, light, truth, archery and also a bringer of death-dealing plague; as the leader of the <!--del_lnk--> Muses (<i><b>Apollon Musagetes</b></i>) and director of their choir, he is a god of music and poetry. Hymns sung to Apollo were called <!--del_lnk--> Paeans.<p>As the patron of <!--del_lnk--> Delphi (&quot;Pythian Apollo&quot;) Apollo is an oracular god; in <!--del_lnk--> Classical times he took the place of <!--del_lnk--> Helios as god of the sun. Apollo was also considered to have dominion over <!--del_lnk--> colonists, over <a href="../../wp/m/Medicine.htm" title="Medicine">medicine</a>, mediated through his son <!--del_lnk--> Asclepius, and was the patron defender of herds and flocks.<p>Apollo is the son of <a href="../../wp/z/Zeus.htm" title="Zeus">Zeus</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Leto, and the twin brother of the chaste huntress <!--del_lnk--> Artemis, who took the place of <!--del_lnk--> Selene as goddess of the moon. As the prophetic deity of the <!--del_lnk--> Delphic oracle, Apollo was one of the most important and many-sided of the <!--del_lnk--> Olympian deities. Apollo is known in Greek-influenced <!--del_lnk--> Etruscan mythology as <b>Apulu</b>. In Roman mythology he is known as <b>Apollo</b> and increasingly, especially during the <!--del_lnk--> third century BC, as <i>Apollo Helios</i> he became identified with <!--del_lnk--> Sol, the Sun.<p>

</script><a id="Cult_sites" name="Cult_sites"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Cult sites</span></h2>
      <p>Unusual among the Olympic deities, Apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence: <!--del_lnk--> Delos and <!--del_lnk--> Delphi. In cult practice, Delian Apollo and Pythian Apollo (the Apollo of Delphi) were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality. <!--del_lnk--> Theophoric names such as <i>Apollodorus</i> or <i>Apollonios</i> and cities named <!--del_lnk--> Apollonia are met with throughout the Greek world. Apollo&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> cult was already fully established when written sources commence, ca <!--del_lnk--> 700 BCE.<p><a id="Oracular_shrines" name="Oracular_shrines"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Oracular shrines</span></h3>
      <p>Apollo had a famous <!--del_lnk--> oracle in <!--del_lnk--> Delphi, and other notable ones in <!--del_lnk--> Clarus and <!--del_lnk--> Branchidae. His oracular shrine in Abea in <!--del_lnk--> Phocis, was important enough to be consulted by <!--del_lnk--> Croesus (<a href="../../wp/h/Herodotus.htm" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>, 1.46). Looking at the ancient oracular shrines to Apollo from the oldest to the youngest we find:<ul>
       <li>In <!--del_lnk--> Didyma, an oracle on the coast of <!--del_lnk--> Anatolia, south west of <!--del_lnk--> Lydian (<!--del_lnk--> Luwian) <!--del_lnk--> Sardis, in which priests from the lineage of the Branchidae received inspiration by drinking from a healing spring located in the temple.<li>In <!--del_lnk--> Hieropolis, Asia Minor, priests breathed in vapors that for small animals were highly poisonous. Small animals and birds were cast into the Plutonium, named after <a href="../../wp/p/Pluto.htm" title="Pluto">Pluto</a>&mdash;the god of death and the underworld&mdash;as a demonstration of their power. Prophecy was by movements of an archaic aniconic wooden <i><!--del_lnk--> xoanon</i> of Apollo.<li>In <!--del_lnk--> Delos, there was an oracle to the Delian Apollo, during summer. The <!--del_lnk--> Heiron (Sanctuary) of Apollo adjacent to the Sacred Lake, was the place where the god was born.<li>In <!--del_lnk--> Corinth, the Oracle of Corinth came from the town of <!--del_lnk--> Tenea, from prisoners supposedly taken in the Trojan War<li>In <!--del_lnk--> Bassae in the <!--del_lnk--> Peloponnese<li>In <!--del_lnk--> Abae, near Delphi<li>In <!--del_lnk--> Delphi, the <!--del_lnk--> Pythia became filled with the <i><!--del_lnk--> pneuma</i> of Apollo, said to come from a spring inside the <!--del_lnk--> Adyton. Apollo took this temple from <!--del_lnk--> Gaia.<li>At <!--del_lnk--> Patara, in <!--del_lnk--> Lycia, there was a seasonal winter oracle of Apollo, said to have been the place where the god went from Delos. As at Delphi the oracle at Patara was a woman.<li>At <!--del_lnk--> Clarus, on the west coast of <!--del_lnk--> Asia Minor; as at Delphi a holy spring which gave off a <i>pneuma</i>, from which the priests drank.<li>In <!--del_lnk--> Segesta in <!--del_lnk--> Sicily, the latest of the series, another oracle of Apollo was seized originally from <!--del_lnk--> Gaia.</ul>
      <p>Oracles were also given by sons of Apollo.<ul>
       <li>In <!--del_lnk--> Oropus, north of <a href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Athens">Athens</a>, the oracle <!--del_lnk--> Amphiaraus, was said to be the son of Apollo; Oropus also had a sacred spring.<li>in <!--del_lnk--> Labadea, 20 miles east of Delphi, <!--del_lnk--> Trophonius, another son of Apollo, killed his brother and fled to the cave where he was also afterwards consulted as an oracle.</ul>
      <p><a id="Festivals" name="Festivals"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Festivals</span></h2>
      <p>The chief Apollonian festivals were the <!--del_lnk--> Carneia, <!--del_lnk--> Carpiae, <!--del_lnk--> Daphnephoria, <!--del_lnk--> Delia, <!--del_lnk--> Hyacinthia, <!--del_lnk--> Pyanepsia, <!--del_lnk--> Pythia and <!--del_lnk--> Thargelia.<p><a id="Attributes_and_symbols" name="Attributes_and_symbols"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Attributes and symbols</span></h2>
      <p>Apollo&#39;s most common attributes were the lyre and the bow. Other attributes of his included the <!--del_lnk--> kithara (an advanced version of the common <!--del_lnk--> lyre) and <!--del_lnk--> plectrum. Another common emblem was the <!--del_lnk--> sacrificial tripod, representing his prophetic powers. The <!--del_lnk--> Pythian Games were held in Apollo&#39;s honour every four years at <!--del_lnk--> Delphi. The <!--del_lnk--> laurel bay plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the crown of victory at these games. The palm was also sacred to Apollo because he had been born under one in <!--del_lnk--> Delos. Animals sacred to Apollo included wolves, dolphins and roe, swans and grasshoppers (symbolizing music and song), hawks, ravens, crows and snakes (referencing Apollo&#39;s function as the god of prophecy), mice, laurel and <!--del_lnk--> griffins, mythical eagle-lion hybrids of Eastern origin.<p>As god of colonization, Apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies, especially during the height of colonization, <!--del_lnk--> 750&ndash;550 BC. According to Greek tradition, he helped <!--del_lnk--> Cretan or <!--del_lnk--> Arcadian colonists found the city of <!--del_lnk--> Troy. However, this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction: <!--del_lnk--> Hittite <!--del_lnk--> cuneiform texts mention a Minor Asian god called <i>Appaliunas</i> or <i>Apalunas</i> in connection with the city of <i>Wilusa</i>, which is now regarded as being identical with the Greek <!--del_lnk--> Illios by most scholars. In this interpretation, Apollo&rsquo;s title of <i>Lykegenes</i> can simply be read as &quot;born in Lycia&quot;, which effectively severs the god&#39;s supposed link with wolves (possibly a <!--del_lnk--> folk etymology).<p>In literary contexts Apollo represents harmony, order, and reasons&mdash;characteristics contrasted with those of <!--del_lnk--> Dionysus, god of wine, who represents ecstasy and disorder. The contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives <i><!--del_lnk--> Apollonian</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Dionysian</i>. However, the Greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary: the two gods are brothers, and when Apollo at winter left for <!--del_lnk--> Hyperborea, he would leave the Delphi Oracle to Dionysus. This contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the <!--del_lnk--> Borghese Vase.<p><a id="Roman_Apollo" name="Roman_Apollo"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Roman Apollo</span></h2>
      <p>The Roman worship of Apollo was adopted from the Greeks. Roman name of Apollo was <!--del_lnk--> Phoebus. There is a tradition that the Delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the <!--del_lnk--> kings of Rome during the reign of <!--del_lnk--> Tarquinius Superbus. In <!--del_lnk--> 430 BCE, a temple was dedicated to Apollo on the occasion of a pestilence. During the <!--del_lnk--> Second Punic War in <!--del_lnk--> 212 BCE, the <i>Ludi Apollinares</i> (&quot;Apollonian Games&quot;) were instituted in his honour. In the time of <a href="../../wp/a/Augustus.htm" title="Augustus">Augustus</a>, who considered himself under the special protection of Apollo and was even said to be his son, his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of Rome. After the <!--del_lnk--> battle of Actium, Augustus enlarged his old temple, dedicated a portion of the spoils to him, and instituted <!--del_lnk--> quinquennial games in his honour. He also erected a new temple on the <!--del_lnk--> Palatine hill and transferred the <!--del_lnk--> secular games, for which Horace composed his <i>Carmen Saeculare</i>, to Apollo and <!--del_lnk--> Diana.<p><a id="Origins_of_the_cult_of_Apollo" name="Origins_of_the_cult_of_Apollo"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Origins of the cult of Apollo</span></h2>
      <p>It appears that both <a href="../../wp/g/Greek_mythology.htm" title="Greek mythology">Greek</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Etruscan Apollos came to the <!--del_lnk--> Aegean during the <!--del_lnk--> Archaic Period (from <!--del_lnk--> 1,100 BCE till <!--del_lnk--> 800 BCE) from <!--del_lnk--> Anatolia. Homer pictures him on the side of the Trojans, not the Achaeans, in the <a href="../../wp/t/Trojan_War.htm" title="Trojan War">Trojan War</a> and he has close affiliations with <!--del_lnk--> Luwian <!--del_lnk--> Apaliuna, who in turn seems to have traveled west from further east. <!--del_lnk--> Late Bronze Age (from <!--del_lnk--> 1,700 BCE - <!--del_lnk--> 1,200 BCE) <!--del_lnk--> Hittite and <!--del_lnk--> Hurrian &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Aplu&quot;, like Homeric Apollo, was a God of the <!--del_lnk--> Plague, and resembles the mouse god <i>Apollo Smintheus</i>. Here we have an apotropaic situation, where a god originally bringing the plague was invoked to end illness, merging over time through fusion with the <!--del_lnk--> Mycenaean &quot;doctor&quot; god Paieon (PA-JA-WO in <!--del_lnk--> Linear B); <!--del_lnk--> Paean, in Homer, was the Greek physician of the gods. In other writers the word is a mere epithet of Apollo in his capacity as a god of healing, but it is now known from Linear B that Paean was originally a separate deity.<div class="thumb tleft">

      </div>
      <p>Homer left the question unanswered, whilst Hesiod separated the two, and in later poetry Paean was invoked independently as a god of healing. It is equally difficult to separate Paean or Paeon in the sense of &quot;healer&quot; from Paean in the sense of &quot;song.&quot; It was believed to refer to the ancient association between the <!--del_lnk--> healing craft and the singing of <!--del_lnk--> spells, but here we see a shift from the concerns to the original sense of &quot;healer&quot; gradually giving way to that of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> hymn,&quot; from the phrase &Iota;&#x3AE; &Pi;&alpha;&iota;&#x3AC;&nu;.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Such songs were originally addressed to Apollo, and afterwards to other gods, <!--del_lnk--> Dionysus, <!--del_lnk--> Helios, <!--del_lnk--> Asclepius, gods associated with Apollo. About the <!--del_lnk--> fourth century BC the paean became merely a formula of adulation; its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune, or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered. It was in this way that Apollo became recognised as the God of Music. Apollo&#39;s role as the slayer of the Python led to his association with battle and victory; hence it became the Roman custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle, when a fleet left the harbour, and also after a victory had been won.<p>Hurrian Aplu itself seems to be derived from the Babylonian &quot;Aplu&quot; meaning a &quot;son of&quot;&mdash;a title that was given to the Babylonian plague god, <!--del_lnk--> Nergal (son of <!--del_lnk--> Enlil). Apollo&#39;s links with oracles again seem to be associated with wishing to know the outcome of an illness.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Apollo killed the Python of Delphi and took over that oracle, so he is vanquisher of unconscious terrors. He is golden-haired like the sun; he is an archer who shoots arrows of insight  and/or death; he is a god of music and the lyre. Healing belongs to his realm: he was the father of Asclepius, the god of medicine. The Muses are part of his retinue, so that music, history, dreams, poetry, dance, all belong to him. The Muses are those we call on when we evoke creative imagination to give us helpful images&hellip;<p><a id="Apollo_in_art" name="Apollo_in_art"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Apollo in art</span></h2>
      <p>In art, Apollo is depicted as a handsome beardless young man, often with a lyre or bow in hand. In the late <a href="../../wp/2/2nd_century.htm" title="2nd century">second century</a> floor mosaic from <!--del_lnk--> El Djem, Roman Thysdrus, (<i>illustration, right</i>), he is identifiable as <!--del_lnk--> Apollo Helios by his effulgent halo, though now even a god&#39;s divine nakedness is concealed by his cloak, a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later Empire. Another haloed Apollo in mosaic, from Hadrumentum, is in the museum at Sousse <!--del_lnk--> . The conventions of this representation, head tilted, lips slightly parted, large-eyed, curling <!--del_lnk--> hair cut in locks grazing the neck, were developed in the 3rd century BCE to depict <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a> (Bieber 1964, Yalouris 1980). Some time after this mosaic was executed, the earliest depictions of Christ will be beardless and haloed.<p><a id="Mythology" name="Mythology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Mythology</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Birth" name="Birth"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Birth</span></h3>
      <p>When <!--del_lnk--> Hera discovered that <!--del_lnk--> Leto was pregnant and that Zeus was the father, she banned Leto from giving birth on &quot;terra-firma&quot;, or the mainland, or any island at sea. In her wanderings, Leto found the newly created floating island of <!--del_lnk--> Delos, which was neither mainland nor a real island, and she gave birth there. The island was surrounded by swans. Afterwards, Zeus secured Delos to the bottom of the ocean. This island later became sacred to Apollo.<p>It is also stated that Hera kidnapped <!--del_lnk--> Ilithyia, the goddess of childbirth, to prevent Leto from going into labor. The other gods tricked Hera into letting her go by offering her a necklace, nine yards long, of amber. Mythographers agree that Artemis was born first and then assisted with the birth of Apollo, or that Artemis was born one day before Apollo, on the island of <!--del_lnk--> Ortygia and that she helped Leto cross the sea to Delos the next day to give birth to Apollo. Apollo was born on the seventh day (&#x1F21;&beta;&delta;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;&gamma;&epsilon;&nu;&eta;&sigmaf;) of the month Thargelion &mdash;according to Delian tradition&mdash; or of the month Bysios&mdash; according to Delphian tradition. The seventh and twentieth, the days of the new and <a href="../../wp/f/Full_moon.htm" title="Full moon">full moon</a>, were ever afterwards held sacred to him.<p><a id="Youth" name="Youth"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Youth</span></h3>
      <p>In his youth, Apollo killed the chthonic dragon <!--del_lnk--> Python, which lived in <!--del_lnk--> Delphi beside the <!--del_lnk--> Castalian Spring because Python had attempted to rape Leto while she was pregnant with Apollo and Artemis. This was the spring which emitted vapors that caused the oracle at Delphi to give her prophesies. Apollo killed Python but had to be punished for it, since Python was a child of <!--del_lnk--> Gaia.<p>Apollo has his ominous aspects, too. Marsyas, who dared challenge him to a music contest, was flayed after he lost. His arrows can bring death: the <i>Iliad</i> begins with a terrible pestilence that Apollo brought down upon the Greeks because they dishonored his priest <!--del_lnk--> Chryses. Apollo&#39;s arrows of death struck Niobe, who, excessively proud of her seven sons and seven daughters, had disparaged Apollo&#39;s mother, Leto, for having only two children (Apollo and Artemis).<p><a id="Apollo_and_Admetus" name="Apollo_and_Admetus"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Apollo and Admetus</span></h3>
      <p>When Zeus struck down Apollo&#39;s son, <!--del_lnk--> Asclepius, with a lightning bolt for resurrecting the dead (transgressing <!--del_lnk--> Themis by stealing <!--del_lnk--> Hades&#39;s subjects), Apollo in revenge killed the <a href="../../wp/c/Cyclops.htm" title="Cyclops">Cyclops</a>, who had fashioned the bolt for Zeus. Apollo would have been banished to <!--del_lnk--> Tartarus forever, but was instead sentenced to one year of <!--del_lnk--> hard labor as punishment, thanks to the intercession of his mother, <!--del_lnk--> Leto. During this time he served as shepherd for <!--del_lnk--> King Admetus of <!--del_lnk--> Pherae in <!--del_lnk--> Thessaly. Admetus treated Apollo well, and, in return, the god conferred great benefits on Admetus.<p>Apollo helped Admetus win <!--del_lnk--> Alcestis, the daughter of <!--del_lnk--> King Pelias and later convinced the <!--del_lnk--> Fates to let Admetus live past his time, if another took his place. But when it came time for Admetus to die, his elderly parents, whom he had assumed would gladly die for him, refused to cooperate. Instead, Alcestis took his place, but <a href="../../wp/h/Heracles.htm" title="Heracles">Heracles</a> managed to &quot;persuade&quot; <!--del_lnk--> Thanatos, the god of death, to return her to the world of the living.<p><a id="Apollo_during_the_Trojan_War" name="Apollo_during_the_Trojan_War"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Apollo during the Trojan War</span></h3>
      <p>Apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the Greek encampment during the <a href="../../wp/t/Trojan_War.htm" title="Trojan War">Trojan War</a> in retribution for <a href="../../wp/a/Agamemnon.htm" title="Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>&#39;s insult to <!--del_lnk--> Chryses, a priest of Apollo whose daughter <!--del_lnk--> Chryseis had been captured. He demanded her return, and the Achaeans complied, indirectly causing the anger of Achilles, which is the theme of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Iliad</i>.<p>When <!--del_lnk--> Diomedes injured <!--del_lnk--> Aeneas, (<i>Iliad</i>), Apollo rescued him. First, <!--del_lnk--> Aphrodite tried to rescue Aeneas but Diomedes injured her as well. Aeneas was then enveloped in a cloud by <!--del_lnk--> Apollo, who took him to <!--del_lnk--> Pergamos, a sacred spot in <!--del_lnk--> Troy.<p>Apollo aided Paris in the killing of <a href="../../wp/a/Achilles.htm" title="Achilles">Achilles</a> by guiding the arrow of his bow into <a href="../../wp/a/Achilles.htm" title="Achilles">Achilles</a>&#39; heel. One interpretation of his motive is that it was in revenge for Achilles&#39; sacrilege in murdering <!--del_lnk--> Troilus, the god&#39;s own son by <!--del_lnk--> Hecuba, on the very altar of the god&#39;s own temple.<p><a id="Niobe" name="Niobe"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Niobe</span></h3>
      <p>A queen of <!--del_lnk--> Thebes and wife of <!--del_lnk--> Amphion, <!--del_lnk--> Niobe boasted of her superiority to Leto because she had fourteen children (<!--del_lnk--> Niobids), seven male and seven female, while Leto had only two. Apollo killed her sons as they practiced athletics, with the last begging for his life, and Artemis her daughters. Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions of the myth, a number of the Niobids were spared (<!--del_lnk--> Chloris, usually). Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, either killed himself or was killed by Apollo after swearing revenge. A devastated Niobe fled to <!--del_lnk--> Mt. Siplyon in <!--del_lnk--> Asia Minor and turned into stone as she wept. Her tears formed the river <!--del_lnk--> Achelous.

      <p>Apollo chased the nymph <!--del_lnk--> Daphne, daughter of <!--del_lnk--> Peneus, who had scorned him. His infatuation was caused by an arrow from <!--del_lnk--> Eros, who was jealous because Apollo had made fun of his archery skills. Eros also claimed to be irritated by Apollo&#39;s singing. Simultaneously, however, Eros had shot a hate arrow into Daphne, causing her to be repulsed by Apollo. Following a spirited chase by Apollo, Daphne prayed to Mother Earth, or, alternatively, her father - a river god - to help her and he changed her into a <!--del_lnk--> Laurel tree, which became sacred to Apollo: see <!--del_lnk--> Apollo and Daphne.<p>Apollo had an affair with a human princess named <!--del_lnk--> Leucothea, daughter of <!--del_lnk--> Orchamus and sister of <!--del_lnk--> Clytia. Leucothea loved Apollo who disguised himself as Leucothea&#39;s mother to gain entrance to her chambers. Clytia, jealous of her sister because she wanted Apollo for herself, told Orchamus the truth, betraying her sister&#39;s trust and confidence in her. Enraged, Orchamus ordered Leucothea to be buried alive. Apollo refused to forgive Clytia for betraying his beloved, and a grieving Clytia wilted and slowly died. Apollo changed her into an incense plant, either heliotrope or sunflower, which follows the sun every day.<p><!--del_lnk--> Marpessa was kidnapped by <!--del_lnk--> Idas but was loved by Apollo as well. <a href="../../wp/z/Zeus.htm" title="Zeus">Zeus</a> made her choose between them, and she chose Idas on the grounds that Apollo, being immortal, would tire of her when she grew old.<p><!--del_lnk--> Castalia was a <!--del_lnk--> nymph whom Apollo loved. She fled from him and dived into the spring at Delphi, at the base of <!--del_lnk--> Mt. Parnassos, which was then named after her. Water from this spring was sacred; it was used to clean the Delphian temples and inspire poets.<p>By <!--del_lnk--> Cyrene, Apollo had a son named <!--del_lnk--> Aristaeus, who became the patron god of cattle, <!--del_lnk--> fruit trees, hunting, husbandry and <!--del_lnk--> bee-keeping. He was also a <!--del_lnk--> culture-hero and taught humanity dairy skills and the use of nets and traps in hunting, as well as how to cultivate olives.<p>With <!--del_lnk--> Hecuba, wife of King <!--del_lnk--> Priam of <!--del_lnk--> Troy, Apollo had a son named <!--del_lnk--> Troilius. An <!--del_lnk--> oracle prophesied that Troy would not be defeated as long as Troilius reached the age of twenty alive. He and his sister, <!--del_lnk--> Polyxena were ambushed and killed by <a href="../../wp/a/Achilles.htm" title="Achilles">Achilles</a>.<p>Apollo also fell in love with <!--del_lnk--> Cassandra, daughter of Hecuba and Priam, and Troilius&#39; half-sister. He promised Cassandra the gift of prophecy to seduce her, but she rejected him afterwards. Enraged, Apollo indeed gifted her with the ability to know the future, with a curse that no one would ever believe her.<p><!--del_lnk--> Coronis, daughter of <!--del_lnk--> Phlegyas, King of the <!--del_lnk--> Lapiths, was another of Apollo&#39;s liaisons. Pregnant with <!--del_lnk--> Asclepius, Coronis fell in love with <!--del_lnk--> Ischys, son of <!--del_lnk--> Elatus. A crow informed Apollo of the affair. When first informed he disbelieved the crow and turned all crows black (where they were previously white) as a punishment for spreading untruths. When he found out the truth he sent his sister, Artemis, to kill Coronis. As a result he also made the crow sacred and gave them the task of announcing important deaths. Apollo rescued the baby and gave it to the <!--del_lnk--> centaur <!--del_lnk--> Chiron to raise. Phlegyas was irate after the death of his daughter and burned the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. Apollo then killed him for what he did.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> Euripides&#39; play <i><!--del_lnk--> Ion</i>, Apollo fathered <!--del_lnk--> Ion by <!--del_lnk--> Creusa, wife of <!--del_lnk--> Xuthus. Creusa left Ion to die in the wild, but Apollo asked <!--del_lnk--> Hermes to save the child and bring him to the oracle at <!--del_lnk--> Delphi, where he was raised by a priestess.<p><a id="Male_lovers" name="Male_lovers"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Male lovers</span></h4>

      <p>Apollo, the eternal beardless <!--del_lnk--> kouros himself, had the most prominent male relationships of all the <!--del_lnk--> Greek Gods. That was to be expected from a god who was god of the <!--del_lnk--> palaestra, the athletic gathering place for youth who all competed <!--del_lnk--> in the nude, a god said to represent the ideal educator and therefore the ideal <!--del_lnk--> erastes, or lover of a boy (Sergent, p.102). All his lovers were younger than him, in the style of the <!--del_lnk--> Greek pederastic relationships of the time. Many of Apollo&#39;s young beloveds died &quot;accidentally&quot;, a reflection on the function of these myths as part of <!--del_lnk--> rites of passage, in which the youth died in order to be reborn as an adult.<p><!--del_lnk--> Hyacinth was one of his male lovers. Hyacinthus was a <!--del_lnk--> Spartan prince, beautiful and athletic. The pair were practicing throwing the <!--del_lnk--> discus when Hyacinthus was struck in the head by a discus blown off course by <!--del_lnk--> Zephyrus, who was jealous of Apollo and loved Hyacinthus as well. When Hyacinthus died, Apollo is said in some accounts to have been so filled with grief that he cursed his own immortality, wishing to join his lover in mortal death. Out of the blood of his slain lover Apollo created the <!--del_lnk--> hyacinth flower as a memorial to his death, and his tears stained the flower petals with <i>&#x3AC;&#x3AF;</i> <i>&#x3AC;&#x3AF;</i>, meaning alas. The Festival of Hyacinthus was a celebration of Sparta.<p>One of his other liaisons was with <!--del_lnk--> Acantha, the spirit of the <!--del_lnk--> acanthus tree. Upon his death, he was transformed into a sun-loving herb by Apollo, and his bereaved sister, Acanthis, was turned into a <a href="../../wp/e/European_Goldfinch.htm" title="European Goldfinch">thistle finch</a> by the other gods.<p>Another male lover was <!--del_lnk--> Cyparissus, a descendant of <a href="../../wp/h/Heracles.htm" title="Heracles">Heracles</a>. Apollo gave the boy a tame deer as a companion but Cyparissus accidentally killed it with a <!--del_lnk--> javelin as it lay asleep in the undergrowth. Cyparissus asked Apollo to let his tears fall forever. Apollo turned the sad boy into a <!--del_lnk--> cypress tree, which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk.<p><a id="Apollo_and_the_birth_of_Hermes" name="Apollo_and_the_birth_of_Hermes"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Apollo and the birth of Hermes</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Hermes was born on <!--del_lnk--> Mount Cyllene in Arcadia. The story is told in the <!--del_lnk--> Homeric Hymn to <!--del_lnk--> Hermes. His mother, <!--del_lnk--> Maia, had been secretly impregnated by <a href="../../wp/z/Zeus.htm" title="Zeus">Zeus</a>, in a secret affair. Maia wrapped the infant in blankets but Hermes escaped while she was asleep. Hermes ran to <!--del_lnk--> Thessaly, where Apollo was grazing his cattle. The infant Hermes stole a number of his cows and took them to a cave in the woods near <!--del_lnk--> Pylos, covering their tracks. In the cave, he found a <!--del_lnk--> tortoise and killed it, then removed the insides. He used one of the cow&#39;s intestines and the tortoise shell and made the first <!--del_lnk--> lyre. Apollo complained to Maia that her son had stolen his cattle, but Hermes had already replaced himself in the blankets she had wrapped him in, so Maia refused to believe Apollo&#39;s claim. Zeus intervened and, claiming to have seen the events, sided with Apollo. Hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented. Apollo, a god of music, fell in love with the instrument and offered to allow exchange of the cattle for the lyre. Hence, Apollo became a master of the lyre and Hermes invented a kind of pipes-instrument called a <!--del_lnk--> syrinx.<p>Later, Apollo exchanged a <!--del_lnk--> caduceus for a <!--del_lnk--> syrinx from Hermes.<p><a id="Other_stories" name="Other_stories"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other stories</span></h3>
      <p>Apollo gave the order, through the Oracle at Delphi, for <!--del_lnk--> Orestes to kill his mother, <!--del_lnk--> Clytemnestra, and her lover, <!--del_lnk--> Aegisthus. Orestes was punished fiercely by the <!--del_lnk--> Erinyes (<!--del_lnk--> female personifications of <!--del_lnk--> vengeance) for this crime.<p>In the <a href="../../wp/o/Odyssey.htm" title="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>, <a href="../../wp/o/Odysseus.htm" title="Odysseus">Odysseus</a> and his surviving crew landed on an island sacred to Helios the sun god, where he kept sacred cattle.

Then Apollo struck the strings of his lyre. Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo, and all but Midas agreed with the judgment. He dissented, and questioned the justice of the award.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Marsyas was a <!--del_lnk--> satyr who challenged Apollo to a contest of music. He had found an <!--del_lnk--> aulos on the ground, tossed away after being invented by <a href="../../wp/a/Athena.htm" title="Athena">Athena</a> because it made her cheeks puffy. Marsyas lost and was <!--del_lnk--> flayed alive in a cave near <!--del_lnk--> Calaenae in <!--del_lnk--> Phrygia for his <!--del_lnk--> hubris to challenge a god. His blood turned into the river Marsyas.<p>Another variation is that Apollo played his instrument (the lyre) upside down. Marsyas could not do this with his instrument (the <a href="../../wp/f/Flute.htm" title="Flute">flute</a>), and so Apollo hung him from a tree and flayed him alive.

      <p>Apollo, like other Greek deities, had a number of <!--del_lnk--> epithets applied to him, reflecting the variety of roles, duties, and aspects ascribed to the god. However, while Apollo has a great number of appellations in Greek myth, only a few occur in <!--del_lnk--> Latin literature, chief among them <b><!--del_lnk--> Phoebus</b> (&quot;shining one&quot;), which was very commonly used by both the Greeks and Romans in Apollo&#39;s role as the god of light.<p>In Apollo&#39;s role as healer, his appellations included <b>Akesios</b> and <b>Iatros</b>, meaning &quot;healer&quot;. He was also called <b>Alexikakos</b> (&quot;restrainer of evil&quot;) and <b>Apotropaeus</b> (&quot;he who averts evil&quot;), and was referred to by the Romans as <b>Averruncus</b> (&quot;averter of evils&quot;). As a plague god and defender against rats and locusts, Apollo was known as <b>Smintheus</b> (&quot;mouse-catcher&quot;) and <b>Parnopius</b> (&quot;grasshopper&quot;). The Romans also called Apollo <b>Culicarius</b> (&quot;driving away <!--del_lnk--> midges&quot;). In his healing aspect, the Romans referred to Apollo as <b>Medicus</b> (&quot;the Physician&quot;), and a <!--del_lnk--> temple was dedicated to <i>Apollo Medicus</i> at Rome, probably next to the temple of <!--del_lnk--> Bellona.<p>As a god of archery, Apollo was known as <b>Aphetoros</b> (&quot;god of the bow&quot;) and <b>Argurotoxos</b> (&quot;with the silver bow&quot;). The Romans referred to Apollo as <b>Articenens</b> (&quot;carrying the bow&quot;) as well. As a pastoral shepherd-god, Apollo was known as <b>Nomios</b> (&quot;wandering&quot;).<p>Apollo was also known as <b>Archegetes</b> (&quot;director of the foundation&quot;), who oversaw colonies. He was known as <b>Klarios</b>, from the Doric <i>klaros</i> (&quot;allotment of land&quot;), for his supervision over cities and colonies.<p>He was known as <b>Delphinios</b> (&quot;Delphinian&quot;), meaning &quot;of the womb&quot;, in his association with <i>Delphoi</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Delphi). At Delphi, he was also known as <b>Pythios</b> (&quot;Pythian&quot;). An <!--del_lnk--> aitiology in the <!--del_lnk--> Homeric hymns connects the epitheton to <a href="../../wp/d/Dolphin.htm" title="Dolphin">dolphins</a>. <b>Kynthios</b>, another common epithet, stemmed from his birth on Mt. <!--del_lnk--> Cynthus. He was also known as <b>Lyceios</b> or <b>Lykegenes</b>, which either meant &quot;wolfish&quot; or &quot;of <!--del_lnk--> Lycia&quot;, Lycia being the place where some postulate that his cult originated.<p>Specifically as god of prophecy, Apollo was known as <b>Loxias</b> (&quot;the obscure&quot;). He was also known as <b>Coelispex</b> (&quot;he who watches the heavens&quot;) to the Romans. Apollo was attributed the epithet <b>Musagetes</b> as the leader of the <!--del_lnk--> muses, and <b>Nymphegetes</b> as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> nymph-leader&quot;.<p><b>Acesius</b> was a surname of Apollo, under which he was worshipped in <!--del_lnk--> Elis, where he had a temple in the <!--del_lnk--> agora. This surname, which has the same meaning as <i>akestor</i> and <i>alezikakos</i>, characterized the god as the averter of evil.<p><a id="Etymology" name="Etymology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Etymology</span></h2>
      <p>The name <i>Apollo</i> might have been derived from a Pre-Hellenic compound <i>Apo-ollon</i>, likely related to an archaic verb <i>Apo-ell-</i> and literally meaning &quot;he who elbows off&quot;, and thus &quot;the Dispelling One&quot;. Indeed, he seems to have personified the power to dispel and ward off evil, which was related to his association with the darkness-dispelling power of the morning sun and the conceived power of reason and prophecy to dispel doubt and ignorance. In addition, Apollo&#39;s dispelling aspect made him associated with:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> city walls and doorways, which served as bulwarks to guard against trespassers;<li>disembarkations and <!--del_lnk--> expatriations to colonies, which served to carry people away;<li>like his son <!--del_lnk--> Asclepius, healing, which dispelled disease and illness;<li>shepherds tending their flocks, who warded off pests and predators;<li>music and the arts, which dispelled discord and <!--del_lnk--> barbarism;<li>fit and skilled young men, with their highly important ability to dispel intruders and invading armies;<li>the ability of foresight into the future.</ul>
      <p>An explanation given by <!--del_lnk--> Plutarch in <i><!--del_lnk--> Moralia</i> is that <i>Apollon</i> signified <!--del_lnk--> unity, since <i>pollon</i> meant &quot;many&quot;, and the <!--del_lnk--> prefix <i>a-</i> was a negative. Thus, Apollon could be read as meaning &quot;deprived of multitude&quot;. Apollo was consequently associated with the <!--del_lnk--> monad.<p><!--del_lnk--> Hesychius connects the name Apollo with the Doric &alpha;&pi;&epsilon;&lambda;&lambda;&alpha;, which means assembly, so that Apollo would be the god of political life, and he also gives the explanation &sigma;&eta;&kappa;&omicron;&sigmaf; (&quot;fold&quot;), in which case Apollo would be the god of flocks and herds.<p><a id="Spoken-word_myths_-_audio_files" name="Spoken-word_myths_-_audio_files"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">In popular culture</span></h2>
