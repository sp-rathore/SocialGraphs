      <p>Nocioni&#39;s professional career began in the <!--del_lnk--> Argentine basketball league (LNB) in the 1995/96 season, and in 1998/99 he was already named <i>Best Sixth Man</i>. A year later, he was called up to the national team that won the silver medal at the <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South American</a> basketball championship.<p>In 2001, Nocioni played on the Argentina national team that won the 2001 South American Title. In 2002, Nocioni was part of a team that made basketball history, when Argentina became the first team to beat the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> team at the <!--del_lnk--> Basketball World Championship, held that year in <!--del_lnk--> Indianapolis, Indiana. His team once again earned the silver medal, losing to <a href="../../wp/y/Yugoslavia.htm" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> in a controversial final. In 2003, Nocioni went to Europe, where he spent two seasons as a <i>refuerzo</i> (reinforcement player) with <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> TAU Cer&aacute;mica of the <!--del_lnk--> ACB Spanish professional league. He was the league&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> 2004 <!--del_lnk--> Most Valuable Player. In 2004, Nocioni was a key factor when Argentina became the first South American team, as well as the first <!--del_lnk--> Latin American one, in <a href="../../wp/o/Olympic_Games.htm" title="Olympic Games">Olympic</a> basketball history (and the fourth team ever, after the United States, <a href="../../wp/y/Yugoslavia.htm" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>, and the <!--del_lnk--> USSR) to win the <!--del_lnk--> Olympic Gold medal.<p>The Argentine national team has 4 NBA players among which is Nocioni, who is currently starting for Argentina, in the <!--del_lnk--> FIBA World Championship. In a game against <!--del_lnk--> Venezuela, Nocioni landed on an opponent&#39;s foot and looked to have injured his ankle, though he was cleared to play in Argentina&#39;s next game against <!--del_lnk--> Nigeria.  In Argentina&rsquo;s game against Nigeria, Nocioni led the team in scoring with 23 points playing 18 minutes, while not missing a single shot. Nocioni was 9-9 from the field including 5-5 from the 3-point line. &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever played a game where I didn&#39;t miss a shot - at least not for the national team.&quot;  Argentina secured winning group A of the tournament, going a perfect 5-0 in the first round of play. <p>Argentina lost to <!--del_lnk--> Spain&#39;s national team in the FIBA 2006 world championships semi-final, with a final score of 75-74. Nocioni had a chance to win the game for Argentina, but his three pointer at the end of the game missed, giving Spain the win, and the chance to win the championship. Nocioni&#39;s Argentine team next played the <!--del_lnk--> US team in the bronze medal game, which Argentina lost 96-81. Nocioni scored 18 points in this game, in which he played against NBA teammate <!--del_lnk--> Kirk Hinrich.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>After winning the gold medal in the Olympics, Nocioni was signed as a undrafted rookie free-agent by the Bulls. He joined <a href="../../wp/p/Puerto_Rico.htm" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Arroyo and <!--del_lnk--> Daniel Santiago, <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Leandro Barbosa and <!--del_lnk--> Nen&ecirc;, <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Eduardo N&aacute;jera, Hispanic-American <!--del_lnk--> Gilbert Arenas and his countrymen <!--del_lnk--> Manu Ginobili and <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Delfino, as NBA players.<p>He played in 81 games during his rookie campaign and posted averages of 8.3 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 1.5 apg and 23.4 mpg. Nocioni&#39;s physical style of defense created controversy around the league, and he was suspended for one game after a hard foul to Detroit&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Tayshaun Prince. Nocioni had previously committed a hard foul on the Miami Heat&rsquo;s <!--del_lnk--> Dwyane Wade and then was shoved past photographers and into the first row of spectators by <!--del_lnk--> Udonis Haslem. A spectator tossed a drink at Nocioni, which was similar to the incident that triggered a massive brawl at <!--del_lnk--> The Palace of Auburn Hills. The fan was ejected by security. For the insident Nocioni received a flagrant-one foul (which is a foul involving excessive or unjustified contact) and a <!--del_lnk--> technical. Haslem received a technical and a <!--del_lnk--> ejection.<p>While giving a <!--del_lnk--> teleconference interview with <!--del_lnk--> NBA.com, Nocioni spoke about the hard fouls and his suspension, &quot;First, the one with Wade was completely my fault. It was a bad reaction on my part. If I had received any penalties because of it, it would be a fair sanction, but it was not given. However, the sanction set after the game against the Pistons is totally unfair. I see it as a totally real play taken out of context in the game &mdash; absolutely nothing happened. It was an accidental blow. Without purposely trying to, I hit him. I apologized on the court. I also asked Carlos Delfino to give my apologies to him, so I don&rsquo;t understand why there is a sanction for something totally normal in a game.&quot;<p>In Nocioni&#39;s first NBA playoff game, he scored 25 points and grabbed 18 rebounds, the most by a rookie in a playoff game in NBA history, while playing all 48 minutes.<p>In Nocioni&#39;s second season with the Chicago Bulls, he averaged 13.0 ppg, 6.1 rpg,and 1.4 apg, while playing in all 82 games, 43 of them starts. Nocioni was named the Chicago Bulls <!--del_lnk--> CDW/<!--del_lnk--> Lenovo Player of the Year for the <!--del_lnk--> 2005-06 NBA season . In the playoffs Nocioni averaged 22.8 points, 9.6 rebounds, 1.6 assists including two <!--del_lnk--> double doubles. In game two against the <!--del_lnk--> Miami Heat he scored 30 points shooting 10-12 overall from the field (83.3%), including 3-3 in from the three point line and 1-1 in free throws, with 6 rebounds and one steal in almost 40 minutes played. Nocioni got to score 30 points again on November 19, during the 82-72 defeat against L.A. Lakers<p><a id="Titles" name="Titles"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Titles</span></h2>
