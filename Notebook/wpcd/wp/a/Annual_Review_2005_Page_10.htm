<h2>Annual Review 2005</h2>
<h3>OUR THANKS</h3>
<p>Our unique work, caring for orphaned and abandoned children, would not be possible without our supporters. SOS Children has been fortunate enough to work with a number of different companies, trusts, organisations, schools, groups and individuals, to whom we extend our warmest thanks for your assistance, encouragement and commitment. These partnerships allow us to continue helping some of the world&rsquo;s most vulnerable children.</p><h3>Schools</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;We became involved with SOS Children because we feel it is a charity that our pupils can take to their hearts, learn from and develop a commitment to. This is a really positive way to get them thinking about who they are, where they fit into the &lsquo;bigger picture&rsquo; and how they can make a difference.&rdquo;</em></p><p>Sarah Humphreys - Head Teacher, Kettlefields Primary School, Cambridgeshire</p><h3>EVENTS</h3>
<h3>Classic Response</h3>
<p>Event organiser Ed O'Driscoll said of Classic Response: <em>&quot;There has been a tremendous response to this concert throughout the classical music industry; everybody wants to help by offering their services. Our sole objective is to raise as much money as possible for the orphans of the tsunami and SOS Children.&quot;</em></p><p>Amici Forever, performers at Classic Response and child sponsors added: <em>&quot;We are delighted to be involved and really want to do anything we can to help raise funds for the appeal. We just hope that everyone continues to give over the next months and years!&quot;</em> David Elliott, Chief Executive of The Royal Albert Hall added his support to the event: <em>&quot;The concert will raise vital funds for the work of the SOS Children charity which in turn will help the tens of thousands of children whose lives have been devastated by the Asian Tsunami.&quot;</em></p><p>With the agreement of the Trustees of the Royal Albert Hall, the venue and its services were provided free of charge.</p><h3>World Orphan Week</h3>
<p>This unique event was launched in October to support our general work caring for orphaned and abandoned children. With the support of schools, companies, trusts and groups, World Orphan Week has become a key part of our fundraising year.</p><h3>PARTNERSHIPS</h3>
<h3>'6 villages for 2006' - the FIFA World CupTM charity campaign</h3>
<p>SOS Children&rsquo;s Villages deepened its partnership with FIFA to create the World Cup campaign 6 villages for 2006, which will provide hundreds of orphaned and abandoned children around the world with a new family home.</p><p>Support for the campaign has been impressive, with Wayne Rooney, Gordon Strachan, The FA and Celtic Football Club all joining the team and supporting the construction of the new village being built in Rustenburg, South Africa as part of 6 villages for 2006. </p><p>Celtic Manager Strachan commented: <em>&ldquo;I am very honoured and proud to be asked to be the FIFA/SOS Ambassador for Scotland. I will be delighted to offer whatever help I can either as a figurehead or in a practical way.&rdquo;</em> Peter Lawwell, Celtic Chief Executive added, <em>&ldquo;Celtic is proud to work with FIFA and SOS Children on this campaign and believes that this work is fully in line with the rich charitable history of Celtic FC.&rdquo;</em></p><p>England and Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney became an official FIFA/SOS Ambassador in October 2005, pledging his support for 6 villages for 2006, saying: <em>&ldquo;I was made up when SOS Children asked me if I would get involved.  I know how much it means to have a family that supports you, so I am delighted I can give my support to these kids.&rdquo;</em></p><h3>Individuals and Groups</h3>
<p>Supporters across the UK have been growing in their support for SOS Children&rsquo;s Villages. We have had an increase in the number of schools and groups supporting our work and linking to our work, as well as individuals raising awareness through our growing network of Volunteer Regional Co-ordinators.</p><p>If you would like more details about working in partnership with SOS Children, please contact us on <strong>01223 365589</strong> or via email at <a href="mailto:info@soschildren.org">info@soschildren.org</a></p><p><a href="../../wp/a/Annual_Review_2005_Page_9.htm">previous page of annual review</a> - <a href="../../wp/a/Annual_Review_2005_Page_11.htm ">next page of annual review</a></p>
