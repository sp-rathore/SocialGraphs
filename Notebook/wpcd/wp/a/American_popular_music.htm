      <p>Even before the birth of recorded music, <b>American popular music</b> had a profound effect on music across the world. The country has seen the rise of popular styles that have had a significant influence on global culture, including <a href="../../wp/r/Ragtime.htm" title="Ragtime">ragtime</a>, <!--del_lnk--> blues, <a href="../../wp/j/Jazz.htm" title="Jazz">jazz</a>, <!--del_lnk--> rock, <a href="../../wp/r/Rhythm_and_blues.htm" title="R&amp;B">R&amp;B</a>, <!--del_lnk--> doo wop, <!--del_lnk--> gospel, <!--del_lnk--> soul, <!--del_lnk--> funk, <!--del_lnk--> heavy metal, <!--del_lnk--> punk, <!--del_lnk--> disco, <!--del_lnk--> house, <!--del_lnk--> techno, <a href="../../wp/s/Salsa_music.htm" title="Salsa music">salsa</a>, <!--del_lnk--> grunge and <a href="../../wp/h/Hip_hop_music.htm" title="Hip hop music">hip hop</a>. In addition, the American music industry is quite diverse, supporting a number of regional styles like <!--del_lnk--> zydeco, <!--del_lnk--> klezmer and <!--del_lnk--> slack-key. The appeal of these styles lies in their supple, energetic rhythms, their appealing vocal lines, and in many cases their symbolic associations with the plight of the underprivileged.<p>Distinctive styles of American popular music began to emerge early in the 19th century, and in the 20th century the American <!--del_lnk--> music industry developed a series of new forms of music, using elements of blues and other genres of <!--del_lnk--> American folk music. These popular styles included country, R&amp;B, jazz and rock. The 1960s and &#39;70s saw a number of important changes in American popular music, including the development of a number of new styles, including heavy metal, punk, soul, and hip hop. Though these styles were not <i>popular</i> in the sense of <i>mainstream</i>, they were commercially recorded and are thus examples of <i>popular music</i> as opposed to <a href="../../wp/f/Folk_music.htm" title="Folk music">folk</a> or <!--del_lnk--> classical music.<p>

      <p>The earliest songs that could be considered <i>American popular music</i>, as opposed to the popular music of a particular region or ethnicity, were sentimental <!--del_lnk--> parlor songs by Stephen Foster and his peers, and songs meant for use in <a href="../../wp/m/Minstrel_show.htm" title="Minstrel show">minstrel shows</a>, theatrical productions that featured singing, dancing and comic performances. Minstrel shows generally used <!--del_lnk--> African American musical instruments and <!--del_lnk--> dance, and featured performers with their faces blackened, a technique called <!--del_lnk--> blackface&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Ewen"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. By the middle of the 19th century, touring companies had taken this music not only to every part of the United States, but also to England, Western Europe, and even to Africa and Asia. Minstrel shows were generally advertised as though the music of the shows was in an <!--del_lnk--> African American style, though this was often not true.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Black people had taken part in American popular culture prior to the Civil War era, at least dating back to the <!--del_lnk--> African Grove Theatre in New York in the 1820s and the publication of the first music by a black composer, <!--del_lnk--> Francis Johnson, in 1818. However, these important milestones still occurred entirely within the conventions of European music. The first extremely popular minstrel song was &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Jump Jim Crow&quot; by <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Rice, which was first performed in 1832 and was a sensation in London when Rice performed it there in 1836. Rice used a dance that he copied from a stableboy with a tune adopted from an Irish <!--del_lnk--> jig. The African elements included the use of the <!--del_lnk--> banjo, believed to derive from West African string instruments, and accented and additive rhythms <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Clarke"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. Many of the songs of the minstrel shows are still remembered today, especially those by <!--del_lnk--> Daniel Emmett and <!--del_lnk--> Stephen Foster, the latter being, according to David Ewen, &quot;America&#39;s first major composer, and one of the world&#39;s outstanding writers of songs&quot;&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Fostergreat"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. Foster&#39;s songs were typical of the minstrel era in their unabashed sentimentality, and in their acceptance of slavery. Nevertheless, Foster did more than most songwriters of the period to humanize the blacks he composed about, such as in &quot;Nelly Was a Lady&quot;, a plaintive, melancholy song about a black man mourning the loss of his wife <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Nelly"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>.<p>The minstrel show marked the beginning of a long tradition of African American music being appropriated for popular audiences, and was the first distinctly American form of music to find international acclaim, in the mid-19th century. As Donald Clarke has noted, minstrel shows contained &quot;essentially black music, while the most successful acts were white, so that songs and dances of black origin were imitated by white performers and then taken up by black performers, who thus to some extent ended up imitating themselves&quot;. Clarke attributes the use of blackface to a desire for white Americans to glorify the brutal existence of both free and slave blacks by depicting them as happy and carefree individuals, best suited to plantation life and the performance of simple, joyous songs that easily appealed to white audiences <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Clarke"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>.<p>Blackface minstrel shows remained popular throughout the last part of the 19th century, only gradually dying out near the beginning of the 20th century. During that time, a form of lavish and elaborate theatre called the <!--del_lnk--> extravaganza arose, beginning with <!--del_lnk--> Charles M. Barras&#39; <i><!--del_lnk--> The Black Crook</i>&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Ewen"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. Extravaganzas were criticized by the newspapers and <!--del_lnk--> churches of the day because the shows were considered sexually titillating, with women singing bawdy songs dressed in nearly transparent clothing. David Ewen described this as the beginning of the &quot;long and active careers in sex exploitation&quot; of American musical theatre and popular song&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_sexexploitation"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. Later, extravaganzas took elements of <!--del_lnk--> burlesque performances, which were satiric and parodic productions that were very popular at the end of the 19th century&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Ewen"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>.<p>Like the extravaganza and the burlesque, the <!--del_lnk--> variety show was a comic and ribald production, popular from the middle to the end of the 19th century, at which time it had evolved into <!--del_lnk--> vaudeville. This form was innovated by producers like <!--del_lnk--> Tony Pastor who tried to encourage women and children to attend his shows; they were hesitant because the theatre had long been the domain of a rough and disorderly crowd&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Ewen"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. By the early 20th century, vaudeville was a respected entertainment for women and children, and songwriters like <!--del_lnk--> Gus Edwards wrote songs that were popular across the country&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Ewen"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. The most popular vaudeville shows were, like the <i><!--del_lnk--> Ziegfeld Follies</i>, a series of songs and skits that had a profound effect on the subsequent development of <!--del_lnk--> Broadway musical theatre and the songs of <!--del_lnk--> Tin Pan Alley.<div class="medialist listenlist">

      <p><a id="Tin_Pan_Alley" name="Tin_Pan_Alley"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Tin Pan Alley</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Tin Pan Alley was an area called <!--del_lnk--> Union Square in New York City, which became the major centre for music publishing by the mid-1890s. The songwriters of this era wrote formulaic songs, many of them sentimental ballads&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_formulaicandballads"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. During this era, a sense of national consciousness was developing, as the United States became a formidable world power, especially after the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish-American War. The increased availability and efficiency of railroads and the postal service helped disseminate ideas, including popular songs.<p>Some of the most notable publishers of Tin Pan Alley included <!--del_lnk--> Willis Woodward, the <!--del_lnk--> Witmark house of publishing, <!--del_lnk--> Charles K. Harris, and <!--del_lnk--> Edward B. Marks and <!--del_lnk--> Joseph W. Stern. Stern and Marks were among the more well-known Tin Pan Alley songwriters; they began writing together as amateurs in 1894&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Ewen"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. In addition to the popular, mainstream ballads and other clean-cut songs, some Tin Pan Alley publishers focused on rough and risqu&eacute;. <!--del_lnk--> Coon songs were another important part of Tin Pan Alley, derived from the watered-down songs of the minstrel show with the &quot;verve and electricity&quot; brought by the &quot;assimilation of the ragtime rhythm&quot;&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_coonsong"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. The first popular coon song was &quot;New Coon in Town&quot;, introduced in 1883, and followed by a wave of <i>coon shouters</i> like <!--del_lnk--> Ernest Hogan and <!--del_lnk--> May Irwin&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Allen"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>.<p><a id="Broadway" name="Broadway"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Broadway</span></h3>
      <p>The early 20th century also saw the growth of <!--del_lnk--> Broadway, a group of theatres specializing in <!--del_lnk--> musicals. Broadway became one of the preeminent locations for musical theatre in the world, and produced a body of songs that led Donald Clarke to call the era, the <i>golden age of songwriting</i>. The need to adapt enjoyable songs to the constraints of a theatre and a plot enabled and encouraged a growth in songwriting and the rise of composers like <!--del_lnk--> George Gershwin, <!--del_lnk--> Vincent Youmans, <!--del_lnk--> Irving Berlin and <!--del_lnk--> Jerome Kern&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_goldenage"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>.<p>Foreign operas were popular among the upper-class throughout the 19th century, while other styles of musical theatre included <!--del_lnk--> operettas, <!--del_lnk--> ballad operas and the <!--del_lnk--> opera bouffe. The English operettas of <!--del_lnk--> Gilbert and Sullivan were particularly popular, while American compositions had trouble finding an audience. <!--del_lnk--> George M. Cohan was the first notable American composer of musical theater, and the first to move away from the operetta, and is also notable for using the language of the vernacular in his work. By the beginning of the 20th century, however, black playwrights, composers and musicians were having a profound effect on musical theatre, beginning with the works of <!--del_lnk--> Will Marion Cook, <!--del_lnk--> James Reese Europe and <!--del_lnk--> James P. Johnson; the first major hit black musical was <i><!--del_lnk--> Shuffle Along</i> in 1921 <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Clarke"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>.<p>Imported operettas and domestic productions by both whites like Cohan and blacks like Cook, Europe and Johnson all had a formative influence on Broadway. Composers like Gershwin, Porter and Kern made comedic musical theatre into a national pastime, with a feel that was distinctly American and not dependent on European models. Most of these individuals were Jewish, with <!--del_lnk--> Cole Porter the only major exception; they were the descendants of 19th century immigrants fleeing persecution in the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Empire, settled most influentially in various neighborhoods in New York City <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Clarke"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. Many of the early musicals were influenced by black music, showing elements of early jazz, such as <i><!--del_lnk--> In Dahomey</i>; the Jewish composers of these works may have seen connections between the traditional black <!--del_lnk--> blue notes and their own folk <!--del_lnk--> Jewish music.<p>Broadway songs were recorded around the turn of the century, but did not become widely popular outside their theatrical context until much later. Jerome Kern&#39;s &quot;They Didn&#39;t Believe Me&quot; was an early song that became popular nationwide. Kern&#39;s later innovations included a more believable plot than the rather shapeless stories built around songs of earlier works, beginning with <i><!--del_lnk--> Show Boat</i> in 1927. George Gershwin was perhaps the most influential composer on Broadway, beginning with &quot;Swanee&quot; in 1919 and later works for jazz and orchestras. His most enduring composition may be the opera <i><a href="../../wp/p/Porgy_and_Bess.htm" title="Porgy and Bess">Porgy and Bess</a></i>, a story about two blacks, which Gershwin intended as a sort of &quot;folk opera&quot;, a creation of a new style of American musical theatre based on American idioms <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Clarke"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>.<p><a id="Ragtime" name="Ragtime"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Ragtime</span></h3>
      <p>Ragtime was a style of <!--del_lnk--> dance music based around the piano, using syncopated rhythms and <!--del_lnk--> chromaticisms&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_ragtime"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>; the genre&#39;s most well-known performer and composer was undoubtedly <!--del_lnk--> Scott Joplin. The ragged rhythms of ragtime are documented to at least as far back as 1886, at <!--del_lnk--> Congo Square in New Orleans, where African American and Caribbean dances mixed in wild celebrations. Author Gunther Schuller sees ragtime as a mixture of African elements with the 2/4 pattern of European marches&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Schuller"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>, while others point to the importance of <!--del_lnk--> jigs and other dance styles among the music of large African American bands in many northern cities during the end of the 19th century. Donald Clarke considers ragtime the culmination of <!--del_lnk--> coon songs, used first in <a href="../../wp/m/Minstrel_show.htm" title="Minstrel show">minstrel shows</a> and then <!--del_lnk--> vaudeville, and the result of the rhythms of minstrelsy percolating into the mainstream; he also suggests that ragtime&#39;s distinctive sound may have come from an attempt to imitate the African American banjo using the keyboard&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_banjoimitate"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>.<p>Due to the essentially African American nature of ragtime, it is most commonly considered the first style of American popular music to be truly black music; certainly, it was also strongly influenced by European elements, but ragtime brought syncopation and a more authentic black sound to popular music. Popular ragtime songs were notated and sold as sheet music, but the general style was played more informally across the nation; these amateur performers played a more free-flowing form of ragtime that eventually became a major formative influence on <a href="../../wp/j/Jazz.htm" title="Jazz">jazz</a> <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Clarke"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>.<p><a id="Early_recorded_popular_music" name="Early_recorded_popular_music"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Early recorded popular music</span></h2>
      <p><a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Edison.htm" title="Thomas Edison">Thomas Edison</a>&#39;s invention of the <a href="../../wp/p/Phonograph_cylinder.htm" title="Phonograph cylinder">phonograph cylinder</a> kicked off the birth of recorded music. The first cylinder to be released was &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Semper Fidelis&quot; by the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Marine Band. At first, cylinders were released sparingly, but as their sales grew more profitable, distribution increased. These early recorded songs were a mix of vaudeville, <!--del_lnk--> barbershop quartets, marches, opera, novelty songs, and other popular tunes. Many popular standards, such as &quot;The Good Old Summertime&quot;, &quot;Shine on Harvest Moon&quot;, and &quot;Over There&quot; come from this time. There were also a few early hits in the field of jazz, beginning with the <!--del_lnk--> Original Dixieland Jazz Band&#39;s 1917 recordings, and followed by <!--del_lnk--> King Oliver&#39;s Creole Jazz Band, who played in a more authentic New Orleans jazz style <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Clarke"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>.<p><!--del_lnk--> Blues had been <!--del_lnk--> around a long time before it became a part of the first explosion of recorded popular music in American history. This came in the 1920s, when <a href="../../wp/c/Classic_female_blues.htm" title="Classic female blues">classic female blues</a> singers like <!--del_lnk--> Ma Rainey, <!--del_lnk--> Bessie Smith and <!--del_lnk--> Mamie Smith grew very popular; the first hit of this field was Mamie Smith&#39;s &quot;Crazy Blues&quot;. These urban blues singers changed the idea of <i>popular music</i> from being simple songs that could be easily performed by anyone to works primarily associated with an individual singer. Performers like <!--del_lnk--> Sophie Tucker, known for &quot;Some of These Days&quot;, became closely associated with their hits, making their individualized interpretations just as important as the song itself <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Clarke"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>.<p>At the same time, record companies like <!--del_lnk--> Paramount Records and <!--del_lnk--> OKeh Records launched the field of <i>race music</i>, which was mostly blues targeted at African American audiences.

      <p><a href="../../wp/j/Jazz.htm" title="Jazz">Jazz</a> is a kind of music characterized by <!--del_lnk--> blue notes, <!--del_lnk--> syncopation, <!--del_lnk--> swing, <!--del_lnk--> call and response, <!--del_lnk--> polyrhythms, and <!--del_lnk--> improvisation. Though originally a kind of <!--del_lnk--> dance music, jazz has now been &quot;long considered a kind of popular or vernacular music (and has also) become a sophisticated art form that has interacted in significant ways with the <!--del_lnk--> music of the concert hall&quot;&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_artjazz"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. Jazz&#39;s development occurred at around the same time as modern ragtime, blues, gospel and country music, all of which can be seen as part of a continuum with no clear demarcation between them; jazz specifically was most closely related to ragtime, with which it could be distinguished by the use of more intricate rhythmic improvisation, often placing notes far from the implied beat. The earliest jazz bands adopted much of the vocabulary of the blues, including bent and blue notes and instrumental &quot;growls&quot; and smears.<p><!--del_lnk--> Paul Whiteman was the most popular bandleader of the 1920s, and claimed for himself the title &quot;The King of Jazz.&quot; Despite his hiring <!--del_lnk--> Bix Beiderbecke and many of the other best white jazz musicians of the era, later generations of jazz lovers have often judged Whiteman&#39;s music to have little to do with real jazz. Nonetheless, his notion of combining jazz with elaborate orchestrations has been returned to repeatedly by composers and arrangers of later decades.<p>Whiteman commissioned Gershwin&#39;s &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, which was debuted by Whiteman&#39;s Orchestra. <!--del_lnk--> Ted Lewis&#39;s band was second only to the Paul Whiteman in popularity during the 1920s, and arguably played more real jazz with less pretension than Whiteman, especially in his recordings of the late 1920s. Some of the other &quot;jazz&quot; bands of the decade included those of: <!--del_lnk--> Harry Reser, <!--del_lnk--> Leo Reisman, <!--del_lnk--> Abe Lyman, <!--del_lnk--> Nat Shilkret, <!--del_lnk--> George Olsen, <!--del_lnk--> Ben Bernie, <!--del_lnk--> Bob Haring, <!--del_lnk--> Ben Selvin, <!--del_lnk--> Earl Burtnett, <!--del_lnk--> Gus Arnheim, <!--del_lnk--> Rudy Vallee, <!--del_lnk--> Jean Goldkette, <!--del_lnk--> Isham Jones, <!--del_lnk--> Roger Wolfe Kahn, <!--del_lnk--> Sam Lanin, <!--del_lnk--> Vincent Lopez, <!--del_lnk--> Ben Pollack and <!--del_lnk--> Fred Waring.<p>In the 1920&#39;s, the music performed by these artists was extremely popular with the public and was typically labelled as jazz. Today, however, this music is disparaged and labelled as &quot;sweet music&quot; by jazz purists. The music that people consider today as &quot;jazz&quot; tended to be played by minorities. In the 1920&#39;s and early 1930&#39;s, however, the majority of people listened to what we would call today &quot;sweet music&quot; and hardcore jazz was categorized as &quot;hot music&quot; or &quot;race music.&quot;<p>In 1935, <!--del_lnk--> swing music became popular with the public and quickly replaced jazz as the most popular type of music (although their was some resistance to it at first). Swing music is characterized by a strong rhythm section, usually consisting of a <a href="../../wp/d/Double_bass.htm" title="Double bass">double bass</a> and drums, playing in a medium to fast <!--del_lnk--> tempo, and rhythmic devices like the <!--del_lnk--> swung note. Swing is primarily a kind of 1930s jazz fused with elements of the blues and the pop sensibility of Tin Pan Alley&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Garofalo"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. Swing used <!--del_lnk--> bigger bands than other kinds of jazz had and was headed by bandleaders that tightly arranged the material, discouraging the improvisation that had been an integral part of jazz. David Clarke called swing the first &quot;jazz-oriented style (to be) at the centre of popular music... as opposed to merely giving it backbone&quot;&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_swing"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. By the end of the 1930s, vocalists became more and more prominent, eventually taking centre stage following the <!--del_lnk--> American Federation of Musicians strike, which made recording with a large band prohibitively expensive&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Garofalo"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. Swing came to be accompanied by a popular dance called the <!--del_lnk--> swing dance, which was very popular across the United States, among both white and black audiences, especially youth.<div class="medialist listenlist">

      <p>In addition to the popular jazz and swing music listened to by mainstrean America, there were a number of other genres that were popular among certain groups of people, e.g. minorities or rural audiences. Beginning in the 1920s and accelerating greatly in the 1940s, the blues began rapidly diversifying into a broad spectrum of new styles. These included an uptempo, energetic style called <a href="../../wp/r/Rhythm_and_blues.htm" title="Rhythm and blues">rhythm and blues</a> (R&amp;B), a merger of blues and Anglo-Celtic song called <!--del_lnk--> country music and the fusion of <!--del_lnk--> hymns and <!--del_lnk--> spirituals with blues structures called <!--del_lnk--> gospel music. Later than these other styles, in the 1940s, a blues, R&amp;B and country fusion eventually called <!--del_lnk--> rock and roll developed, eventually coming to dominate American popular by the beginning of the 1960s.<p>Country music is primarily a fusion of African American blues and spirituals with <!--del_lnk--> Appalachian folk music, adapted for pop audiences and popularized beginning in the 1920s. Of particular importance was Irish and Scottish tunes, dance music, balladry and vocal styles <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Sawyers"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>, as well as <!--del_lnk--> Native American, <a href="../../wp/m/Music_of_Spain.htm" title="Music of Spain">Spanish</a>, <!--del_lnk--> German, <!--del_lnk--> French and <!--del_lnk--> Mexican music. The instrumentation of early country revolved around the European-derived <!--del_lnk--> fiddle and the African-derived <!--del_lnk--> banjo, with the guitar added later. Country music instrumentation used African elements like a call-and-response format, improvised music and <!--del_lnk--> syncopated rhythms. Later still, string instruments like the <a href="../../wp/u/Ukulele.htm" title="Ukulele">ukulele</a> and <!--del_lnk--> steel guitar became commonplace due to the popularity of <a href="../../wp/m/Music_of_Hawaii.htm" title="Music of Hawaii">Hawaiian musical</a> groups in the early 20th century&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_ukulele"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. The roots of modern country music are generally traced to 1927, when music talent scout <!--del_lnk--> Ralph Peer recorded <!--del_lnk--> Jimmie Rodgers and <!--del_lnk--> The Carter Family. Their recordings are considered the foundation for modern country music. There had been popular music prior to 1927 that could be considered country, but, as Ace Collins points out, these recordings had &quot;only marginal and very inconsistent&quot; effects on the national music markets, and were only superficially similar to what was then known as <i>hillbilly music</i>&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_RodgersCarter"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. In addition to Rodgers and the Carters, a musician named <!--del_lnk--> Bob Wills was an influential early performer known for a style called <!--del_lnk--> Western swing, which was very popular in the 1920s and 30s, and was responsible for bringing a prominent jazz influence to country music.<p>Rhythm and blues (R&amp;B) is a style that arose in the 1930s and &#39;40s, a rhythmic and uptempo form of blues with more complex instrumentation. Author Amiri Baraka described early R&amp;B as &quot;huge rhythm units smashing away behind screaming blues singers (who) had to shout to be heard above the clanging and strumming of the various electrified instruments and the churning rhythm sections&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Baraka"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. R&amp;B was recorded during this period, but not extensively and was not widely promoted by record companies, who felt it was not suited for most audiences, especially middle-class whites, because of the suggestive lyrics and driving rhythms&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Garofalo"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. Bandleaders like <a href="../../wp/l/Louis_Jordan.htm" title="Louis Jordan">Louis Jordan</a> innovated the sound of early R&amp;B. Jordan&#39;s band featured a small horn section and prominent rhythm instrumentation and used songs with bluesy lyrical themes. By the end of the 1940s, he had produced nineteen major hits, and helped pave the way for contemporaries like <!--del_lnk--> Wynonie Harris, <!--del_lnk--> John Lee Hooker and <!--del_lnk--> Roy Milton.<p>Christian spirituals and rural blues music were the origin of what is now known as gospel music. Beginning in about the 1920s, African American churches featured early gospel in the form of worshipers proclaiming their religious devotion (<i>testifying</i>) in an improvised, often musical manner. Modern gospel began with the work of composers, most importantly <!--del_lnk--> Thomas A. Dorsey, who &quot;(composed) songs based on familiar spirituals and hymns, fused to blues and jazz rhythms&quot;&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Dorsey"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. From these early 20th-century churches, gospel music spread across the country. It remained associated almost entirely with African American churches, and usually featured a choir along with one or more virtuoso soloists.<p>Rock and roll is a kind of popular music, developed primarily out of country, blues and R&amp;B. Easily the single most popular style of music worldwide, <!--del_lnk--> rock&#39;s exact origins and early development have been hotly debated. Music historian Robert Palmer has noted that the style&#39;s influences are quite diverse, and include the <!--del_lnk--> Afro-Caribbean &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Bo Diddley beat&quot;, elements of &quot;big band swing&quot; and <!--del_lnk--> Latin music like the <a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuba">Cuban</a> <!--del_lnk--> son and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Mexican rhythms&quot;&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Palmer"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. Another author, George Lipsitz claims that rock arose in America&#39;s urban areas, where there formed a &quot;polyglot, working-class culture (where the) social meanings previously conveyed in isolation by blues, country, <!--del_lnk--> polka, <!--del_lnk--> zydeco and Latin musics found new expression as they blended in an urban environment&quot;&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Lipsitz"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>.<p><a name="1950s_and_60s"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">1950s and 60s</span></h2>
      <p>The middle of the 20th century saw a number of very important changes in American popular music. The field of <!--del_lnk--> pop music developed tremendously during this period, as the increasingly low price of recorded music stimulated demand and greater profits for the record industry. As a result, music <!--del_lnk--> marketing became more and more prominent, resulting in a number of mainstream pop stars whose popularity was previously unheard of. Many of the first such stars were Italian-American crooners like <!--del_lnk--> Dean Martin, <!--del_lnk--> Rudy Vallee, <!--del_lnk--> Tony Bennett, <!--del_lnk--> Perry Como, <!--del_lnk--> Frankie Laine and, most famously, the &quot;first pop vocalist to engender hysteria among his fans&quot; <!--del_lnk--> Frank Sinatra <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Sinatra"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. The era of the modern teen pop star, however, began in the 1960s. <!--del_lnk--> Bubblegum pop groups like <!--del_lnk--> The Monkees were chosen entirely for their appearance and ability to sell records, with no regard to musical ability. The same period, however, also saw the rise of new forms of pop music that achieved a more permanent presence in the field of American popular music, including rock, soul and pop-folk. By the end of the 1960s, two developments had completely changed popular music: the birth of a <!--del_lnk--> counterculture, which explicitly opposed mainstream music, often in tandem with political and social activism, and the shift from professional composers to performers who were both <!--del_lnk--> singers and songwriters.<p>Rock and roll first entered mainstream popular music through a style called <i><!--del_lnk--> rockabilly</i>, which fused the nascent rock sound with elements of country music. Black-performed rock and roll had previously had limited mainstream success, and some observers at the time believed that a white performer who could credibly sing in an R&amp;B and country style would be a success. <!--del_lnk--> Sam Phillips, of <!--del_lnk--> Memphis, Tennessee&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Sun Records, was the one who found such a performer, in <a href="../../wp/e/Elvis_Presley.htm" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a>, who became one of the best-selling musicians in history, and brought rock and roll to audiences across the world&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Garofalo"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. Presley&#39;s success was preceded by <!--del_lnk--> Bill Haley, a white performer whose &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Rock Around the Clock&quot; is sometimes pointed to as the start of the rock era. However, Haley&#39;s music was &quot;more arranged&quot; and &quot;more calculated&quot; than the &quot;looser rhythms&quot; of rockabilly, which also, unlike Haley, did not use saxophones or chorus singing&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Gillett"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>.<div class="medialist listenlist">

      <p>R&amp;B remained extremely popular during the 1950s among black audiences, but the style was not considered appropriate for whites, or respectable middle-class blacks because of its suggestive nature. Many popular R&amp;B songs were instead performed by white musicians like <!--del_lnk--> Pat Boone, in a more palatable, mainstream style, and turned into pop hits&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_covers"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. By the end of the 1950s, however, there was a wave of popular black blues-rock and country-influenced R&amp;B performers gaining unprecedented fame among white listeners; these included <!--del_lnk--> Bo Diddley and <!--del_lnk--> Chuck Berry&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_DiddleyBerry"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. Over time, producers in the R&amp;B field turned to gradually more rock-based acts like <!--del_lnk--> Little Richard and <!--del_lnk--> Fats Domino.<p>Doo wop is a kind of vocal harmony music performed by groups who became popular in the 1950s. Though sometimes considered a kind of rock, doo wop is more precisely a fusion of vocal R&amp;B, gospel and jazz with the blues and pop structures&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Garofalo"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>, though until the 1960s, the lines separating rock from doo wop, R&amp;B and other related styles was very blurry. Doo wop became the first style of R&amp;B-derived music &quot;to take shape, to define itself as something people recognized as new, different, strange, <i>theirs</i>&quot; (emphasis in original) &nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Marcus"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. As doo wop grew more popular, more innovations were added, including the use of a bass lead vocalist, a practice which began with <!--del_lnk--> Jimmy Ricks of <!--del_lnk--> The Ravens&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Garofalo"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. Doo wop performers were originally almost all black, but a few white and integrated groups soon became popular. These included a number of <!--del_lnk--> Italian-American groups like <!--del_lnk--> Dion &amp; the Belmonts and <!--del_lnk--> Frankie Valli &amp; the Four Seasons, while others added female vocalists and even formed all-female groups in the nearly universally male field; these included <!--del_lnk--> The Queens and <!--del_lnk--> The Chantels&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Garofalo"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>.<p>The 1950s saw a number of brief fads that went on to have a great impact on future styles of music. Performers like <!--del_lnk--> Pete Seeger and <!--del_lnk--> The Weavers popularized a form of <!--del_lnk--> old-time revival of <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-American music. This field eventually became associated with the political leftwing and <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">Communism</a>, leading to a decline in acceptability as artists were increasingly <!--del_lnk--> blacklisted and criticized. Nevertheless, this form of pop-folk exerted a profound influence in the form of 1950s <!--del_lnk--> folk-rock and related styles. Alongside the rather sporadic success of popularized Anglo folk music came a series of <!--del_lnk--> Latin dance fads, including <!--del_lnk--> mambo, <!--del_lnk--> rumba, <!--del_lnk--> chachach&aacute; and <!--del_lnk--> boogaloo. Though their success was again sporadic and brief, Latin music continued to exert a continuous influence on rock, soul and other styles, as well as eventually evolving into <a href="../../wp/s/Salsa_music.htm" title="Salsa music">salsa music</a> in the 1970s.<p><a id="Country:_Nashville_Sound" name="Country:_Nashville_Sound"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Country: Nashville Sound</span></h3>
      <p>Beginning in the late 1920s, a distinctive style first called &quot;old-timey&quot; or &quot;hillbilly&quot; music began to be broadcast and recorded in the rural South and Midwest; early artists included the Carter Family, Charlie Poole and his North Carolina Ramblers, and Jimmie Rodgers. The performance and dissemination of this music was regional at first, but the population shifts caused by World War II spread it more widely. After the war, there was increased interest in specialty styles, including what had been known as <i>race</i> and <i>hillbilly</i> music; these styles were renamed to <i>rhythm and blues</i> and <i>country and western</i>, respectively&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Garofalo"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. Major labels had had some success promoting two kinds of country acts: Southern <!--del_lnk--> novelty performers like <!--del_lnk--> Tex Williams and singers like <!--del_lnk--> Frankie Laine, who mixed pop and country in a conventionally sentimental style&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_popcountry"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. This period also saw the rise of <!--del_lnk--> Hank Williams, a white country singer who had learned the blues from a black street musician named Tee-Tot, in northwest Alabama&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Werner"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>.

The popular success of Hank Williams&#39; recordings had convinced record labels that country music could find mainstream audiences. Record companies then tried to strip the rough, honky-tonk elements from country music, removing the unapologetically rural sound that had made Williams famous. Nashville&#39;s industry was reacting to the rise of <!--del_lnk--> rockabilly performer Elvis Presley by marketing performers that crossed the divide between country and pop; &nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_PBS"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. <!--del_lnk--> Chet Atkins, head of <!--del_lnk--> RCA&#39;s country music division, did the most to innovate the Nashville sound by abandoning the rougher elements of country, while <!--del_lnk--> Owen Bradley used sophisticated production techniques and smooth instrumentation that eventually became standard in the Nashville Sound, which also grew to incorporate strings and vocal choirs&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_allmusic"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>.

      <p>Soul music is a combination of R&amp;B and gospel which began in the late 1950s in the United States. Soul music is characterized by its use of gospel techniques with a greater emphasis on vocalists, and the use of secular themes. The 1950s recordings of <!--del_lnk--> Sam Cooke, <!--del_lnk--> Ray Charles and <!--del_lnk--> James Brown are commonly considered the beginnings of soul music. <!--del_lnk--> Solomon Burke&#39;s early recordings for Atlantic Records codified the style, and as Peter Guralnick writes, &quot;it was only with the coming together of Burke and Atlantic Records that you could see anything resembling a movement&quot;&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Guralnick"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Motown Record Corporation in [[{Detroit Michigan]] became successful with a string of heavily pop-influenced soul records, which were palatable enough to white listeners so as to allow R&amp;B and soul to crossover to mainstream audiences. An important centre of soul music recording was <!--del_lnk--> Florence, Alabama, where the <!--del_lnk--> Fame Studios operated. <!--del_lnk--> Jimmy Hughes, <!--del_lnk--> Percy Sledge and <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Alexander recorded at Fame; later in the 1960s, <!--del_lnk--> Aretha Franklin would also record in the area. Fame Studios, often referred to as <i><!--del_lnk--> Muscle Shoals</i>, after a town neighboring Florence, enjoyed a close relationship with Stax, and many of the musicians and producers who worked in Memphis also contributed to recordings done in Alabama.<p>In Memphis, <!--del_lnk--> Stax Records produced recordings by soul pioneers <!--del_lnk--> Otis Redding, <!--del_lnk--> Wilson Pickett and <!--del_lnk--> Don Covay. Other Stax artists such as <!--del_lnk--> Eddie Floyd and <!--del_lnk--> Johnnie Taylor also made significant contributions to soul music. By 1968, the soul music movement had begun to splinter, as James Brown and <!--del_lnk--> Sly &amp; the Family Stone began to expand upon and abstract both soul and rhythm and blues into other forms. Guralnick wrote that more &quot;than anything else... what seems to me to have brought the era of soul to a grinding, unsettling halt was the death of Martin Luther King in April of 1968&quot;&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Guralnick"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>.<p><a name="1960s_rock"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1960s rock</span></h3>
      <p>The first of the major new rock genres of the 1960s was <!--del_lnk--> surf, pioneered by Californian <!--del_lnk--> Dick Dale. Surf was largely instrumental and guitar-based rock with a distorted and twanging sound, and was associated with the <!--del_lnk--> Southern California <!--del_lnk--> surfing-based <!--del_lnk--> youth culture. Dale had worked with <!--del_lnk--> Leo Fender, developing the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Showman amplifier and... the reverberation unit that would give surf music its distinctively fuzzy sound&quot;&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_surf"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>.<p>Inspired by the lyrical focus of surf, if not the musical basis, <!--del_lnk--> The Beach Boys began their career in 1961 with a string of hits like &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Surfin&#39; USA&quot;.

The Beach Boys&#39; songwriter <!--del_lnk--> Brian Wilson grew gradually more eccentric, experimenting with new studio techniques as he became associated with the burgeoning <!--del_lnk--> counterculture.<p>The counterculture was a youth movement that included political activism, especially in opposition to the Vietnam War, and the promotion of various <!--del_lnk--> hippie ideals. The hippies were associated primarily with two kinds of music: the <!--del_lnk--> folk-rock and <!--del_lnk--> country rock of people like <a href="../../wp/b/Bob_Dylan.htm" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Gram Parsons, and the <!--del_lnk--> psychedelic rock of bands like <!--del_lnk--> Jefferson Airplane and <!--del_lnk--> The Doors.

      <p>Following the turbulent political, social and musical changes of the 1960s and early 1970s, rock music diversified. What was formerly known as <i>rock and roll</i>, a reasonably discrete style of music, had evolved into a catchall category called simply <i><!--del_lnk--> rock music</i>, an umbrella term which would eventually include diverse styles like <!--del_lnk--> heavy metal music, <!--del_lnk--> punk rock and, sometimes even <a href="../../wp/h/Hip_hop_music.htm" title="Hip hop music">hip hop music</a>. During the &#39;70s, however, most of these styles were not part of mainstream music, and were evolving in the underground music scene.<p>The early 1970s saw a wave of <!--del_lnk--> singer-songwriters who drew on the introspective, deeply emotional and personal lyrics of 1960s folk-rock.

      <p>In the early 1970s, soul music was influenced by psychedelic rock and other styles. The social and political ferment of the times inspired artists like <a href="../../wp/m/Marvin_Gaye.htm" title="Marvin Gaye">Marvin Gaye</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Curtis Mayfield to release album-length statements with hard-hitting social commentary. Artists like James Brown led soul towards more dance-oriented music, which eventually evolved into <!--del_lnk--> funk.

During the &#39;70s, some highly slick and commercial <!--del_lnk--> blue-eyed soul acts like Philadelphia&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Hall &amp; Oates achieved mainstream success, as well as a new generation of street-corner harmony or city-soul groups like <!--del_lnk--> The Delfonics and Howard University&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Unifics.<p>By the end of the &#39;70s, Philly soul, funk, rock and most other genres were dominated by disco-inflected tracks. During this period, funk bands like <!--del_lnk--> The O&#39;Jays and <!--del_lnk--> The Spinners continued to turn out hits. After the death of disco in 1980, soul music survived for a short time before going through yet another metamorphosis. With the introduction of influences from <!--del_lnk--> electro music and funk, soul music became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a genre of music that was again called <i>R&amp;B</i>, usually distinguished from the earlier rhythm and blues by identifying it as <i>contemporary R&amp;B</i>.<p><a name="80s_pop"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">80s pop</span></h3>

Contemporary R&amp;B arose when sultry funk singers like <!--del_lnk--> Prince became very popular, alongside dance-oriented pop stars like <!--del_lnk--> Michael Jackson and female vocalists like <!--del_lnk--> Tina Turner and <!--del_lnk--> Whitney Houston&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Garofalo"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>.<p>By the end of the 1980s, pop-rock largely consisted of the radio-friendly <!--del_lnk--> hair metal bands, who used images derived from the British <!--del_lnk--> glam movement with macho lyrics and attitudes, accompanied by <!--del_lnk--> hard rock music and heavy metal virtuosic soloing.

      <p>Heavy metal is a form of music characterized by aggressive, driving rhythms and highly amplified distorted guitars, generally with grandiose lyrics and virtuosic instrumentation. Heavy metal is a development of blues, <!--del_lnk--> blues rock, rock and prog rock. Its origins lie in the British hard rock bands who between 1967 and 1974 took blues and rock and created a hybrid with a heavy, guitar-and-drums-centered sound.

      <p>In the early 1970s, the first major American bands began appearing, like <!--del_lnk--> Blue &Ouml;yster Cult and <!--del_lnk--> Aerosmith, and musicians like <!--del_lnk--> Eddie Van Halen began their career. Heavy metal remained, however, a largely underground phenomenon. During the 1980s, a pop-based form of hard rock, with a party-hearty spirit and a glam-influenced visual aesthetic (sometimes referred to as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> hair metal&quot;) dominated the music charts, led by superstars like <!--del_lnk--> Poison, <!--del_lnk--> Bon Jovi, <!--del_lnk--> M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e, and <!--del_lnk--> Ratt. The 1987 debut of <!--del_lnk--> Guns N&#39; Roses, a hard rock band whose image reflected the grittier underbelly of the Sunset Strip, was at least in part a reaction against the overly polished image of hair metal, but that band&#39;s wild success was in many ways the last gasp of the hard-rock and metal scene. By the mid-1980s, as the term &quot;heavy metal&quot; became the subject of much contestation, the style had branched out in so many different directions that new classifications were created by fans, record companies, and fanzines, although sometimes the differences between various subgenres were unclear, even to the artists purportedly belonging to a given style. The most notable of the 1980s metal subgenres in the United States was the swift and aggressive <!--del_lnk--> thrash metal style, pioneered by bands like <!--del_lnk--> Anthrax, <!--del_lnk--> Megadeth, <!--del_lnk--> Metallica and <!--del_lnk--> Slayer.<p><a name="1990s_to_the_present"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">1990s to the present</span></h2>

This was previously an explicitly anti-mainstream grouping of genres that rose to great fame beginning in the early 1990s. The genre in its early stages was largely situated on <!--del_lnk--> Sub Pop Records, a company founded by <!--del_lnk--> Kim Thayil of <!--del_lnk--> Soundgarden. Significant grunge bands signed to the label were <!--del_lnk--> Green River (half of the members from this band would later become founding members of <!--del_lnk--> Pearl Jam), <!--del_lnk--> Sonic Youth (although not a grunge band they were influential on grunge bands and in fact it was upon the insistance of <!--del_lnk--> Kim Gordon that the <!--del_lnk--> David Geffen company signed <a href="../../wp/n/Nirvana_%2528band%2529.htm" title="Nirvana (band)">Nirvana</a>) and Nirvana.

This includes many of the best-selling artists of the 1990s, like <!--del_lnk--> Clint Black, <!--del_lnk--> Shania Twain, <!--del_lnk--> Faith Hill and the first of these crossover stars, <!--del_lnk--> Garth Brooks&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Garofalo"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>.<div class="medialist listenlist">

      <p>American popular music has become extremely popular internationally. Rock, hip hop, jazz, country and other styles have fans across the globe. <!--del_lnk--> BBC Radio <!--del_lnk--> DJ <!--del_lnk--> Andy Kershaw, for example, has noted that country music is popular across virtually the entire world&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Kershaw"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. Indeed, out of &quot;all the contributions made by Americans to world culture... (American popular music) has been taken (most) to heart by the entire world&quot;&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Americanpop"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. Other styles of American popular music have also had a formative effect internationally, including funk, the basis for West African <!--del_lnk--> Afrobeat, R&amp;B, a major source for Jamaican <a href="../../wp/r/Reggae.htm" title="Reggae">reggae</a>, and rock, which has profoundly influenced most every genre of popular music worldwide. Rock, country, jazz and hip hop have become an entrenched part of many countries, leading to local varieties like <!--del_lnk--> Australian country music, Tanzanian <!--del_lnk--> Bongo Flava and <!--del_lnk--> Russian rock.<p>Rock has had a formative influence on popular music, which had the effect of transforming &quot;the very concept of what popular music&quot; is&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_trasnformed"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> while Charlie Gillett has argued that rock and roll &quot;was the first popular genre to incorporate the relentless pulse and sheer volume of urban life into the music itself&quot;&nbsp;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_urbanrock"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>.<p>The social impacts of American popular music have been felt both within the United States and in foreign countries. Beginning as early as the <!--del_lnk--> extravaganzas of the late 19th century, American popular music has been criticized for being too sexually titillating and for encouraging violence, drug abuse and generally immoral behaviour. Criticisms have been especially targeted at African American styles of music as they began attracting white, generally youthful audiences; blues, jazz, rock and hip hop all fall into this category <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Garofalo"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_popular_music&quot;</div>
