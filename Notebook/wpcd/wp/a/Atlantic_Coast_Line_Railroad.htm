      <p>The <b>Atlantic Coast Line Railroad</b> (<!--del_lnk--> AAR <!--del_lnk--> reporting mark <b>ACL</b>) was an <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">American</a> railroad that existed between 1898 and <!--del_lnk--> July 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1967, when it merged with the <!--del_lnk--> Seaboard Air Line Railroad, its long-time rival, to form the <!--del_lnk--> Seaboard Coast Line Railroad. The company was headquartered in <!--del_lnk--> Jacksonville, Florida (<!--del_lnk--> Wilmington, North Carolina before 1961). After several more mergers and consolidations, the former ACL is now part of <!--del_lnk--> CSX Transportation, also headquartered in Jacksonville.<p>

      <p>The <b>Atlantic Coast Line Company</b> was organized on <!--del_lnk--> May 29, <!--del_lnk--> 1889 as a <!--del_lnk--> holding company for a system of railroads from <!--del_lnk--> Richmond and <!--del_lnk--> Norfolk, Virginia south and southwest to <!--del_lnk--> Augusta, Georgia.<p><a id="North_Carolina" name="North_Carolina"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">North Carolina</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Wilmington and Raleigh Railroad was chartered in 1835, opening in 1840 from <!--del_lnk--> Wilmington, North Carolina north to <!--del_lnk--> Weldon, where the <!--del_lnk--> Petersburg Railroad continued to <!--del_lnk--> Petersburg, Virginia. The name was changed in 1855 to the <!--del_lnk--> Wilmington and Weldon Railroad.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Wilmington and Manchester Railroad was chartered in 1846 and opened in 1853 from Wilmington west to <!--del_lnk--> Camden Crossing, South Carolina on the <!--del_lnk--> South Carolina Railroad&#39;s branch to <!--del_lnk--> Camden. After the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>, the company was reorganized in 1870 as the <!--del_lnk--> Wilmington, Columbia and Augusta Railroad, opening an extension west to <!--del_lnk--> Columbia in 1873 but never reaching <!--del_lnk--> Augusta, Georgia.<p>In 1872 the <!--del_lnk--> Wilmington, Columbia and Augusta Railroad leased the <!--del_lnk--> Wilmington and Weldon Railroad, forming a continuous line through Wilmington, which was advertised as the <b>Atlantic Coast Line</b>. That lease was cancelled in 1878 due to the Wilmington, Columbia and Augusta&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> bankruptcy; that company was sold in 1879 and reorganized in 1880 under the same name.<p>Over the years, the Wilmington and Weldon bought many other lines. Most notable among those was the <!--del_lnk--> Wilson and Fayetteville Railroad, built as a cutoff from near <!--del_lnk--> Wilson to the Wilmington, Columbia and Augusta at <!--del_lnk--> Pee Dee, South Carolina. This was chartered in South Carolina as the <!--del_lnk--> Florence Railroad.<p><a id="South_Carolina" name="South_Carolina"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">South Carolina</span></h3>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Northeastern Railroad was chartered in 1851 and opened in 1856 from <!--del_lnk--> Charleston north to the <!--del_lnk--> Wilmington and Manchester Railroad at <!--del_lnk--> Florence. The <!--del_lnk--> Central Railroad, connecting this line at <!--del_lnk--> Lane northwest to the <!--del_lnk--> Wilmington, Columbia and Augusta Railroad at <!--del_lnk--> Sumter, was chartered in 1881 and opened in 1882. From opening it was leased by both railroads in connected to.<p>The <b>Atlantic Coast Line Railroad of South Carolina</b> was formed on <!--del_lnk--> July 18, <!--del_lnk--> 1898 as a consolidation of the <!--del_lnk--> Wilmington, Columbia and Augusta Railroad and <!--del_lnk--> Northeastern Railroad with several other lines:<ul>
       <li>The <!--del_lnk--> Florence Railroad was chartered in 1882, continuing the <!--del_lnk--> Wilson and Fayetteville Railroad from the <!--del_lnk--> North Carolina state line south-southwest to the Wilmington, Columbia and Augusta at <!--del_lnk--> Pee Dee. This was part of a shorter route avoiding <!--del_lnk--> Wilmington, North Carolina.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Cheraw and Darlington Railroad was chartered in 1849 and opened in 1853, running from <!--del_lnk--> Florence north via <!--del_lnk--> Darlington to <!--del_lnk--> Cheraw. The Cheraw and Darlington acquired the <!--del_lnk--> Cheraw and Salisbury Railroad, an extension north to <!--del_lnk--> Wadesboro, North Carolina, in 1892.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Manchester and Augusta Railroad was chartered in 1875, and built a line from <!--del_lnk--> Sumter southwest to <!--del_lnk--> Denmark. On <!--del_lnk--> June 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1899, the ACL opened a continuation west-southwest to the <!--del_lnk--> Charleston and Western Carolina Railway at <!--del_lnk--> Robbins.</ul>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Central Railroad stayed separate, leased but not merged.<p>Also involved in this was the <!--del_lnk--> Charleston, Sumter and Northern Railroad, a failed plan to build a main line from <!--del_lnk--> Charleston through <!--del_lnk--> Sumter into <!--del_lnk--> North Carolina. That company went <!--del_lnk--> bankrupt in 1892, and the bridge over the <!--del_lnk--> Santee River burned down. In 1895 the ACL bought and reorganized it as the <!--del_lnk--> Charleston and Northern Railroad to prevent it from being used by a competitor. The short <!--del_lnk--> Wilson and Summerton Railroad acquired a section south of Sumter, the <!--del_lnk--> Manchester and Augusta Railroad obtained the southernmost section (cut from the rest by the burned bridge) and the line from Sumter northeast to <!--del_lnk--> Darlington, extending the M&amp;A&#39;s line to Darlington, and the <!--del_lnk--> Cheraw and Darlington Railroad was assigned the rest of the line, from Darlington north to <!--del_lnk--> Gibson, North Carolina. All but the Wilson and Summerton became part of the ACL in 1898. That company was renamed to the <!--del_lnk--> Northwestern Railroad in 1899, and with help from the ACL built an extension northwest from Sumter to <!--del_lnk--> Camden, opened in 1901.<p>In August 1899 the ACL acquired a half interest in the <!--del_lnk--> Georgia Railroad and Banking Company, fully owned by the <!--del_lnk--> Louisville and Nashville Railroad since 1898. This gave the ACL access to <!--del_lnk--> Atlanta and <!--del_lnk--> Macon, Georgia via the former <!--del_lnk--> Manchester and Augusta Railroad and the Georgia Railroad.<p>By 1899 the ACL also owned the <!--del_lnk--> Charleston and Western Carolina Railway, running from <!--del_lnk--> Port Royal, South Carolina at the south orner of the state northwest into the northwest part of the state, with lines ending at <!--del_lnk--> Anderson, <!--del_lnk--> Greenville and <!--del_lnk--> Spartanburg.<p><a id="Virginia" name="Virginia"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Virginia</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Petersburg Railroad was chartered in 1830 and opened in 1833, running from <!--del_lnk--> Petersburg, Virginia south to <!--del_lnk--> Garysburg, North Carolina, from which it ran to <!--del_lnk--> Weldon via <!--del_lnk--> trackage rights over the <!--del_lnk--> Seaboard and Roanoke Railroad (later eliminated with a new alignment). The <!--del_lnk--> Richmond and Petersburg Railroad was chartered in 1836 and opened in 1838, continuing north from Petersburg to <!--del_lnk--> Richmond.<p>In March 1898, the Petersburg Railroad was merged into the Richmond and Petersburg, which was renamed to the <b>Atlantic Coast Line Railroad of Virginia</b> on <!--del_lnk--> November 21.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Norfolk and Carolina Railroad was chartered in 1887 as the <!--del_lnk--> Chowan and Southern Railroad and renamed in 1889, opening in 1890 as a connection from the <!--del_lnk--> Wilmington and Weldon Railroad&#39;s branch to <!--del_lnk--> Tarboro, North Carolina northeast to <!--del_lnk--> Pinner&#39;s Point, Virginia, serving the <!--del_lnk--> Hampton Roads area.<p><a id="Florida_and_Georgia" name="Florida_and_Georgia"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Florida and Georgia</span></h3>

      <p>The <b>Atlantic Coast Line Railroad</b> was formed on <!--del_lnk--> April 21, <!--del_lnk--> 1900 as a merger of the two companies in Virginia and South Carolina, as well as the <!--del_lnk--> Wilmington and Weldon Railroad and <!--del_lnk--> Norfolk and Carolina Railroad.<p>In 1902 the ACL acquired the massive <!--del_lnk--> Plant System, stretching from <!--del_lnk--> Charleston, South Carolina southwest via <!--del_lnk--> Savannah, Georgia to <!--del_lnk--> Waycross, with lines branching out from there to <!--del_lnk--> Albany, Georgia, <!--del_lnk--> Montgomery, Alabama, and many points in <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a> (including the main line to <!--del_lnk--> Tampa). The <!--del_lnk--> Jacksonville and Southwestern Railroad was bought <!--del_lnk--> July 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1904, running from <!--del_lnk--> Jacksonville, Florida southwest to <!--del_lnk--> Newberry. Around this time, the ACL built a new line from <!--del_lnk--> High Springs south to <!--del_lnk--> Juliette, Florida, connecting two Plant System lines and forming a shortcut around <!--del_lnk--> Gainesville down the west side of Florida.<p>The ACL bought the large <!--del_lnk--> Louisville and Nashville Railroad system on <!--del_lnk--> November 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1902, but kept operations separate for its entire life.<p>A short branch from <!--del_lnk--> Climax, Georgia south to <!--del_lnk--> Amsterdam opened in 1903.<p>The ACL bought the <!--del_lnk--> Conway Coast and Western Railroad on <!--del_lnk--> July 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1912, giving it access to <!--del_lnk--> Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> October 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1913, the ACL acquired the <!--del_lnk--> Sanford and Everglades Railroad, a short line near <!--del_lnk--> Sanford, Florida.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Florida Central Railroad, bought <!--del_lnk--> February 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1915, provided a spur to <!--del_lnk--> Fanlew, Florida.<p>In July 1922 the ACL acquired the <!--del_lnk--> Rockingham Railroad, extending the former <!--del_lnk--> Charleston, Sumter and Northern Railroad from <!--del_lnk--> Gibson, North Carolina to <!--del_lnk--> Rockingham.<p>Also in 1922 the ACL leased the <!--del_lnk--> Virginia and Carolina Southern Railroad, running from <!--del_lnk--> Fayetteville, North Carolina south to <!--del_lnk--> Lumberton with a spur to <!--del_lnk--> Elizabethtown.<p>The ACL acquired the <!--del_lnk--> Moore Haven and Clewiston Railway on <!--del_lnk--> July 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1925, and the <!--del_lnk--> Deep Lake Railroad, a short line from the <a href="../../wp/g/Gulf_of_Mexico.htm" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> port of <!--del_lnk--> Everglades City north to <!--del_lnk--> Deep Lake, Florida, on <!--del_lnk--> December 8, <!--del_lnk--> 1928. These formed short parts of a new line from the main line at <!--del_lnk--> Haines City south to Everglades City, with a branch to <!--del_lnk--> Lake Harbour on <!--del_lnk--> Lake Okeechobee via <!--del_lnk--> Moore Haven and <!--del_lnk--> Clewiston.<p>Also in 1925, the ACL leased the <!--del_lnk--> Fort Myers Southern Railroad, which continued the line of the <!--del_lnk--> Florida Southern Railroad south from <!--del_lnk--> Fort Myers to <!--del_lnk--> Marco. That same year, the <!--del_lnk--> Tampa Southern Railroad was leased, running from <!--del_lnk--> Uceta Yard in eastern <!--del_lnk--> Tampa south via <!--del_lnk--> Sarasota to the Florida Southern at <!--del_lnk--> Fort Ogden.<p>In 1926 the ACL acquired the <!--del_lnk--> Columbia, Newberry and Laurens Railroad, running from the end of the old <!--del_lnk--> Wilmington, Columbia and Augusta Railroad at <!--del_lnk--> Columbia, South Carolina northwest to <!--del_lnk--> Laurens.<p>The ACL incorporated the <!--del_lnk--> Atlanta, Birmingham and Coast Railroad on <!--del_lnk--> November 22, <!--del_lnk--> 1926 as a reorganization of the <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic, Birmingham and Atlantic Railway. This gave the ACL lines from <!--del_lnk--> Waycross to <a href="../../wp/a/Atlanta%252C_Georgia.htm" title="Atlanta, Georgia">Atlanta, Georgia</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Birmingham, Alabama, with a branch east to <!--del_lnk--> Brunswick<p>On <!--del_lnk--> May 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1927 the ACL leased the <!--del_lnk--> Washington and Vandemere Railroad, extending the old <!--del_lnk--> Wilmington and Weldon Railroad branch to <!--del_lnk--> Washington southeast to <!--del_lnk--> Vandemere.<p>In 1928 the <!--del_lnk--> Perry Cutoff was finished, providing a new shortcut from <!--del_lnk--> Thomasville, Georgia via <!--del_lnk--> Perry, Florida to <!--del_lnk--> Dunnellon, Florida, with a branch to <!--del_lnk--> Newberry, Florida. Additionally, the old <!--del_lnk--> Tampa and Thonotosassa Railroad line was extended northeast from <!--del_lnk--> Thonotosassa to <!--del_lnk--> Vitis, providing a shortcut between <!--del_lnk--> Tampa and the newly-important west Florida line.<p>The ACL acquired the <!--del_lnk--> East Carolina Railway at some point, running south from <!--del_lnk--> Tarboro to <!--del_lnk--> Hookerton.<p><a id="Seaboard_Coast_Line.2C_CSX_Transportation" name="Seaboard_Coast_Line.2C_CSX_Transportation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Seaboard Coast Line, CSX Transportation</span></h3>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> July 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1967 the ACL merged with the <!--del_lnk--> Seaboard Air Line Railroad, its longtime rival, to form the <!--del_lnk--> Seaboard Coast Line Railroad.<p><!--del_lnk--> CSX Transportation was formed on <!--del_lnk--> July 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1986 as a renaming of the <!--del_lnk--> Seaboard System Railroad, which had absorbed the former <strong class="selflink">Atlantic Coast Line Railroad</strong>, <!--del_lnk--> Louisville and Nashville Railroad and <!--del_lnk--> Seaboard Air Line Railroad, as well as several smaller subsidiaries. On <!--del_lnk--> August 31, <!--del_lnk--> 1987 the <!--del_lnk--> Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, which had absorbed the <!--del_lnk--> Baltimore and Ohio Railroad <!--del_lnk--> April 30 of that year, merged into CSX.
