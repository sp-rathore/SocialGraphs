With his <i><!--del_lnk--> Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse</i> (1497&ndash;1498), from the <i>Apocalypse</i> series, it is his most iconic image, followed by his &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Rhinoceros&quot; and his numerous painted self-portraits.<p>

      <p>D&uuml;rer was born on May 21, 1471, the third child and second son of fourteen to eighteen children. His father was a successful goldsmith, named Ajt&oacute;si, who had moved in 1455 to Nuremberg from <!--del_lnk--> Ajt&oacute;s, near <!--del_lnk--> Gyula in <a href="../../wp/h/Hungary.htm" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>. The German name &quot;D&uuml;rer&quot; is derived from the Hungarian &quot;Ajt&oacute;si&quot;. Initially it was &quot;Th&uuml;rer&quot;, meaning doormaker which is &quot;ajt&oacute;s&quot; in Hungarian (from &quot;ajt&oacute;&quot; meaning door). The name &quot;Th&uuml;rer&quot; became &quot;D&uuml;rer&quot;; a door featured in the <!--del_lnk--> coat-of-arms the family acquired. Albrecht Ajt&oacute;si-D&uuml;rer the Elder married Barbara Holper, from a prosperous Nuremberg family, in 1467.<p>His godfather was Anton Koberger, who in the year of D&uuml;rer&#39;s birth ceased <!--del_lnk--> goldsmithing to become a printer and publisher. He quickly became the most successful publisher in Germany, eventually owning twenty-four <!--del_lnk--> printing-presses and having many offices in Germany and abroad. His most famous publication was the <!--del_lnk--> Nuremberg Chronicle, published in 1493 in German and Latin editions, with and an unprecedented 1,809 <!--del_lnk--> woodcut illustrations (many repeated uses of the same block) by the <!--del_lnk--> Wolgemut workshop.<p>It is fortunate that D&uuml;rer left some autobiographical notes, and also became very famous by his mid-twenties, so that his life is well documented from a number of sources. After a few years of school, D&uuml;rer started to learn the basics of <!--del_lnk--> goldsmithing and drawing from his father. Though his father wanted him to continue to train as a goldsmith, he showed such a precocious talent in drawing that he started as an apprentice to <!--del_lnk--> Michael Wolgemut at the age of 15 in <!--del_lnk--> 1486. A superb self-portrait <a href="../../wp/d/Drawing.htm" title="Drawing">drawing</a> in <!--del_lnk--> silverpoint is dated 1484 (<!--del_lnk--> Albertina, Vienna) - &quot;when I was a child&quot; as his later inscription on it says. Wolgemut was the leading artist in Nuremberg at the time, with a large workshop producing a variety of works of art, including woodcuts for books. Nuremberg was a prosperous city, a centre for publishing and many luxury trades. It had strong links with <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>, especially <!--del_lnk--> Venice, a relatively short distance across the <!--del_lnk--> Alps.<p><a id="Gap_year.2C_or_four" name="Gap_year.2C_or_four"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Gap year, or four</span></h2>
      <p>After completing his term of apprenticeship in 1489, D&uuml;rer followed the common German custom of taking a &quot;wanderjahre&quot; - in effect a gap year. However D&uuml;rer was away nearly four years, travelling to Germany, <a href="../../wp/s/Switzerland.htm" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, and probably the Netherlands. To his great regret, he missed meeting <!--del_lnk--> Martin Schongauer, the leading engraver of Northern Europe, who had died shortly before D&uuml;rer&#39;s arrival. However he was very hospitably treated by Schongauer&#39;s brother and seems to have acquired at this point some works by Schongauer that he is known to have owned. His first self-portrait (<!--del_lnk--> Louvre) was painted in <!--del_lnk--> Strasbourg, probably to be sent back to his fianc&eacute; in Nuremberg.<p><a id="Marriage_and_first_visit_to_Italy" name="Marriage_and_first_visit_to_Italy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Marriage and first visit to Italy</span></h2>
      <p>Very soon after his return to Nuremberg, on <!--del_lnk--> July 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1494, D&uuml;rer was married, following an arrangement made during his absence, to Agnes Frey, the daughter of a prominent brassworker (and amateur harpist) in the city. The nature of his relationship with his wife is unclear, but it would not seem to have been a love-match, and his portraits of her lack warmth. They had no children. Within three months D&uuml;rer left again for Italy, alone, perhaps stimulated by an outbreak of plague in Nuremberg. He made <!--del_lnk--> watercolour sketches as he travelled over the Alps, some of which have survived, and others of which can be deduced from the accurate landscapes of real places in his later work, for example his engraving <i>Nemesis</i>. These are the first pure landscape studies known in Western art.<p>In Italy, he went to <!--del_lnk--> Venice to study the more advanced artistic world there.  Through Wolgemut&#39;s tutelage, D&uuml;rer had learned how to make prints in <!--del_lnk--> drypoint and design <!--del_lnk--> woodcuts in the German style. based on <!--del_lnk--> Martin Schongauer and the <!--del_lnk--> Housebook Master.. He would also have had access to some Italian works in Germany, but the two visits he made to Italy had an enormous influence on him. He wrote that <!--del_lnk--> Giovanni Bellini was the oldest and still the best of the artists in Venice. His drawings and engravings show the influence of others notably <!--del_lnk--> Antonio Pollaiuolo with his interest in the proportions of the body, <!--del_lnk--> Mantegna, <!--del_lnk--> Lorenzo di Credi and others. D&uuml;rer probably also visited <!--del_lnk--> Padua and <!--del_lnk--> Mantua on this trip.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>On his return to Nuremberg in 1495, D&uuml;rer opened his own workshop (being married was a requirement for this). Over the next five years his style increasingly worked Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. D&uuml;rer lost his parents during the following years, his father in <!--del_lnk--> 1502 and his mother in <!--del_lnk--> 1513. His best works in the first years were his <!--del_lnk--> woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes like <i>The Mens Bath-house</i> (c1496). These were larger than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition.<p>It is now thought unlikely that D&uuml;rer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this was left for a specialist craftsman. But his training in Wolgemut&#39;s studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces, and both designed and cut woodblocks for <!--del_lnk--> woodcut , evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with blockcutters. D&uuml;rer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block. Either way his drawing was destroyed during the cutting of the block.<p>His famous series of sixteen great designs for the <i>Apocalypse</i>, are dated <!--del_lnk--> 1498. He made the first seven scenes of the <i>Great Passion</i> in the same year, and a little later a series of eleven on the Holy Family and saints. Around 1503&ndash;1505 he produced the first seventeen of a set illustrating the life of the Virgin, which he did not finish for some years. Neither these nor the <i>Great Passion</i> were published as sets until several years later, but prints were sold individually in considerable numbers.<p>Over the same period D&uuml;rer trained himself in the difficult art of the use of the <!--del_lnk--> burin to make <!--del_lnk--> engravings; perhaps he had made a start on this during his early training with his father. The first few were relatively unambitious, but by 1496 he was able to produce the masterpiece of the <i>Prodigal Son</i> which <!--del_lnk--> Vasari singled out for praise some decades later, noting its Germanic quality. He was soon producing some spectacular and original images, notably <i>Nemesis</i> (1502), <i>The Sea Monster</i> (1498) and <i>St Eustace</i> (1501), with a highly detailed landscape background, and beautiful animals. He made a number of <!--del_lnk--> Madonnas, single religious figures, and small scenes with comic peasant figures. Prints are highly portable, and these works made D&uuml;rer famous throughout the main artistic centres of Europe within a very few years.<p>The Venetian artist <!--del_lnk--> Jacopo de Barbari, whom D&uuml;rer had met in Venice, visited Nuremberg in 1500, and D&uuml;rer says that he learned from him much about the new developments in <!--del_lnk--> perspective, <a href="../../wp/a/Anatomy.htm" title="Anatomy">anatomy</a> and <!--del_lnk--> proportion, although de Barberi would not explain everything he knew. D&uuml;rer therefore began his own studies, which would be a lifelong preoccupation. A series of extant drawings show D&uuml;rer&#39;s experiments in human proportion, leading to the famous engraving of <i><!--del_lnk--> Adam and Eve</i> (1504); showing his subtlety at using the <!--del_lnk--> burin in the texturing of flesh surfaces.<p>D&uuml;rer made large numbers of preparatory drawings, especially for his paintings and engravings, and many survive, most famously the <i>Praying Hands</i> (1508 <!--del_lnk--> Albertina, Vienna), a study for an apostle in the Heller altarpiece. He also continued to make images in <!--del_lnk--> watercolour and <!--del_lnk--> bodycolour (usually combined), including a number of exquisite still-lifes of pieces of meadow or animals, including his &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Hare&quot; (1502, <!--del_lnk--> Albertina, Vienna).<p><a id="Second_visit_to_Italy" name="Second_visit_to_Italy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Second visit to Italy</span></h2>
      <p>In Italy, he turned again to painting, at first producing a series of works by <!--del_lnk--> tempera-painting on <!--del_lnk--> linen, including portraits and altarpieces, notably the <!--del_lnk--> Paumgartner <!--del_lnk--> altarpiece and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Adoration of the Magi</i>. In early 1506, he returned to Venice, and stayed there until the spring of 1507. By this time D&uuml;rer&#39;s engravings had attained great popularity, and had begun to be copied. In Venice he was given a valuable commission from the emigrant German community for the church of <!--del_lnk--> St. Bartholomew. The picture painted by D&uuml;rer was closer to the Italian style&mdash;the <i>Adoration of the Virgin</i>, also known as the <i>Feast of Rose Garlands</i>; it was subsequently acquired by the Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Rudolf II and taken to <a href="../../wp/p/Prague.htm" title="Prague">Prague</a>. Other paintings D&uuml;rer produced in Venice include <i>The Virgin and Child with the Goldfinch</i>, a <i>Christ disputing with the Doctors</i> (supposedly produced in a mere five days) and a number of smaller works.<p><a id="Nuremberg_and_the_masterworks" name="Nuremberg_and_the_masterworks"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Nuremberg and the masterworks</span></h2>

      <p>Despite the regard in which he was held by the Venetians, D&uuml;rer was back in Nuremberg by mid-1507. He remained in Germany until 1520. His reputation had spread all over <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>. He was on terms of friendship or friendly communication with most of the major artists of Europe, and exchanged drawings with <a href="../../wp/r/Raphael.htm" title="Raphael">Raphael</a>.<p>The years between his return from Venice and his journey to the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> are divided according to the type of work with which he was principally occupied. The first five years, 1507&ndash;1511, are pre-eminently the painting years of his life. In them, working with a vast number of preliminary drawings and studies, he produced what have been accounted his four best works in painting: <i>Adam and Eve</i> (1507), <i>Virgin with the Iris</i> (1508), the altarpiece the <i>Assumption of the Virgin</i> (1509), and the <i>Adoration of the Trinity by all the Saints</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1511). During this period he also completed the two woodcut series of the <i>Great Passion</i> and the <i>Life of the Virgin</i>, both published in 1511 together with a second edition of the <i>Apocalypse</i> series.<p>He complained that painting did not make enough money to justify the time spent, when compared to his prints, and from 1511 to 1514 concentrated on <a href="../../wp/p/Printmaking.htm" title="Printmaking">printmaking</a>, in <!--del_lnk--> woodcut and especially <!--del_lnk--> engraving. The major works he produced in this period were the thirty-seven <!--del_lnk--> woodcut subjects of the <i>Little Passion</i>, published first in 1511, and a set of fifteen small <!--del_lnk--> engravings on the same theme in 1512. In 1513 and 1514 appeared the three most famous of D&uuml;rer&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> engravings , <i>The Knight, Death, and the Devil</i> (or simply <i>The Knight</i>, as he called it, 1513), the enigmatic and much analysed <i><!--del_lnk--> Melencolia I</i> and <i>St. Jerome in his Study</i> (both 1514).<p>In &#39;<!--del_lnk--> Melencolia I&#39; appears a 4th-order <!--del_lnk--> magic square which is believed to be the first seen in European art. The two numbers in the middle of the bottom row give the date of the engraving: 1514.<div class="thumb tleft">

      </div>
      <p><i>Main Article: <!--del_lnk--> D&uuml;rer&#39;s Rhinoceros</i> In 1515, he created a woodcut of a <i>Rhinoceros</i> which had arrived in Lisbon from a written description and brief sketch, without ever seeing the animal depicted. Despite being relatively inaccurate (the animal belonged to a now extinct Indian species), the image has such force that it remains one of his best-known, and was still being used in some German school science text-books early last century.<p>In the years leading to 1520 he produced a wide range of works, including portraits in <!--del_lnk--> tempera on <!--del_lnk--> linen in 1516, engravings on many subjects, a few experiments in <!--del_lnk--> etching on plates of <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a>, and parts of the <i>Triumphal Arch</i> and the <i>Triumphs of Maximilian</i> which were huge propaganda <!--del_lnk--> woodcut projects commissioned by <!--del_lnk--> Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor. He drew marginal decorations for some pages of a copy of the Emperor&#39;s printed <!--del_lnk--> prayer book, which were hardly known until facsimiles were published in 1808 (the first book published in <!--del_lnk--> lithography ). These show a lighter, more fanciful, side to D&uuml;rer&#39;s art, as well as his usual suberb draftsmanship. He also drew a portrait of the Emperor Maximilian shortly before his death in 1519.<p><a id="Journey_to_the_Netherlands_and_beyond" name="Journey_to_the_Netherlands_and_beyond"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Journey to the Netherlands and beyond</span></h2>

      <p>In the summer of 1520 the desire of D&uuml;rer to renew the Imperial pension Maximilian had given him (typically instructing the City of Nuremberg to pay it) and to secure new <!--del_lnk--> patronage following the death of Maximilian and an outbreak of sickness in Nuremberg, gave occasion to his fourth and last journey. Together with his wife and her maid he set out in July for the Netherlands in order to be present at the coronation of the new Emperor <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_V%252C_Holy_Roman_Emperor.htm" title="Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor">Charles V</a>. He journeyed by the <a href="../../wp/r/Rhine.htm" title="Rhine">Rhine</a> to <a href="../../wp/c/Cologne.htm" title="Cologne">Cologne</a>, and then to <a href="../../wp/a/Antwerp.htm" title="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>, where he was well received and produced numerous drawings in <!--del_lnk--> silverpoint, <!--del_lnk--> chalk or <!--del_lnk--> charcoal. Besides going to <a href="../../wp/a/Aachen.htm" title="Aachen">Aachen</a> for the <!--del_lnk--> coronation, he made excursions to Cologne, <!--del_lnk--> Nijmegen, <!--del_lnk--> &#39;s-Hertogenbosch, <a href="../../wp/b/Brussels.htm" title="Brussels">Brussels</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Bruges, <!--del_lnk--> Ghent and <!--del_lnk--> Zeeland. In Brussels he saw &quot;the things which have been sent to the king from the golden land&quot; - the <a href="../../wp/a/Aztec.htm" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> treasure that <a href="../../wp/h/Hern%25C3%25A1n_Cort%25C3%25A9s.htm" title="Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s">Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s</a> had sent home to <!--del_lnk--> Holy Roman Emperor Charles V following the fall of <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. D&uuml;rer wrote that this trove &quot;was much more beautiful to me than miracles. These things are so precious that they have been valued at 100,000 florins&quot;.<p>He took a large stock of prints with him, and wrote in his diary who he gave, exchanged or sold them to, and for how much. This gives rare information on the monetary value placed on <!--del_lnk--> old master prints at this time; unlike paintings their sale was very rarely documented. He finally returned home in July 1521, having caught an undetermined illness which afflicted him for the rest of his life, and greatly reduced his rate of work.<p><a id="Final_years_in_Nuremberg" name="Final_years_in_Nuremberg"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Final years in Nuremberg</span></h2>

      <p>Back in Nuremberg, D&uuml;rer began work on a series of religious pictures. Many preliminary sketches and studies survive, but no paintings on the grand scale were ever carried out. This was due in part to his declining health, but more because of the time he gave to the preparation of his theoretical works on <a href="../../wp/g/Geometry.htm" title="Geometry">geometry</a> and <!--del_lnk--> perspective, the proportions of men and horses, and <!--del_lnk--> fortification. Though having little natural gift for writing, he worked hard to produce his works.<p>The consequence of this shift in emphasis was that in the last years of his life D&uuml;rer produced, as an artist, comparatively little. In painting there was a portrait of <!--del_lnk--> Hieronymus Holtzschuher, a <!--del_lnk--> <i>Madonna and Child</i> (1526), a <!--del_lnk--> <i>Salvator Mundi</i> (1526) and two panels showing <!--del_lnk--> St. John with <!--del_lnk--> St. Peter in <!--del_lnk--> front and <a href="../../wp/p/Paul_of_Tarsus.htm" title="Paul of Tarsus">St. Paul</a> with <!--del_lnk--> St. Mark in the <!--del_lnk--> background. In copper-engraving D&uuml;rer produced only a number of portraits, those of the cardinal-elector of Mainz (<i>The Great Cardinal</i>), <!--del_lnk--> Frederick the Wise, elector of Saxony, and his friends the <!--del_lnk--> humanist scholar <!--del_lnk--> Willibald Pirckheimer, <!--del_lnk--> Philipp Melanchthon and <!--del_lnk--> Erasmus of Rotterdam.<p>Despite complaining of his lack of formal education, especially in the classical languages, D&uuml;rer was greatly interested in intellectual matters, and learned much from his great friend <!--del_lnk--> Willibald Pirckheimer , who he probably consulted as to the content of many of his images. He also got great satisfaction from his friendship and correspondence with <!--del_lnk--> Erasmus and other scholars. Of his books, D&uuml;rer succeeded in finishing and producing two during his lifetime. One on geometry and perspective, <i>The Painter&#39;s Manual</i> (more literally the <i>Instructions on Measurement</i>) was published at Nuremberg in 1525, and is the first book for adults to be published on <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> in German. His work on fortification was published in 1527, and his work on human proportion was brought out in four volumes shortly after his death in 1528 at the age of 56.<p>It is clear from his writings that D&uuml;rer was highly sympathetic to <a href="../../wp/m/Martin_Luther.htm" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a>, and he may have been influential in the City Council declaring for Luther in 1525. However, he died before religious divisions had hardened into different churches, and may well have regarded himself as a reform-minded <!--del_lnk--> Catholic to the end.<p>He left an estate valued at 6,874 florins - a considerable sum. His large house, where his workshop also was, and his widow lived until her death in 1537, remains a prominent Nuremberg landmark, and is now a museum.<p><a id="Legacy" name="Legacy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Legacy</span></h2>
      <p>D&uuml;rer exerted a huge influence on the artists of succeeding generations; especially on <a href="../../wp/p/Printmaking.htm" title="Printmaking">printmaking</a>, the medium through which his contemporaries mostly experienced his art, as his paintings were mostly either in private collections or in a few cities. His success in spreading his reputation across Europe through prints was undoubtedly an inspiration for major artists like <a href="../../wp/r/Raphael.htm" title="Raphael">Raphael</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Titian and <!--del_lnk--> Parmigianino who entered into collaborations with <!--del_lnk--> printmakers to publicise their work beyond their local region.<p>His work in <!--del_lnk--> engraving seems to have had an intimidating effect on his German successors, the <i>Little Masters</i>, who attempted few large engravings, but continued D&uuml;rer&#39;s themes in tiny, rather cramped, compositions. The early <!--del_lnk--> Lucas van Leiden was the only Northern <!--del_lnk--> engraver to successfully continue to produce large engravings in the first third of the century. The generation of Italian engravers who trained in the shadow of D&uuml;rer all directly copied either parts of his landscape backgrounds (<!--del_lnk--> Giulio Campagnola and <!--del_lnk--> Christofano Robetta), or whole prints (<!--del_lnk--> Marcantonio Raimondi and <!--del_lnk--> Agostino Veneziano). However, D&uuml;rer&#39;s influence became less dominant after about 1515, when Marcantonio perfected his new engraving style, which in turn went over the Alps to dominate Northern engraving also.<p>In painting, D&uuml;rer had relatively little influence in Italy, where probably only his altarpiece in Venice was to be seen, and his German successors were less effective in blending German and Italian styles.<p>His intense and self-dramatising self-portraits have continued to have huge influence up to the present, and can perhaps be blamed for some of the wilder excesses of artist&#39;s self-portraiture, especially in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.<p>He has never fallen from critical favour, and there were particular revivals of interest in him in Germany in the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> D&uuml;rer Renaissance&quot; of c1570-c1630, in the early nineteenth century, and in <!--del_lnk--> German Nationalism from 1870-1945.<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Books</span></h2>
