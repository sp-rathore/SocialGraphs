      <p>Born to a wealthy family in <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Antoine Laurent Lavoisier inherited a large fortune when his mother died. He attended the <!--del_lnk--> College Mazarin from 1754 to 1761, studying <a href="../../wp/c/Chemistry.htm" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Botany.htm" title="Botany">botany</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Astronomy.htm" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a>, and <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>. His education was filled with the ideals of the French <!--del_lnk--> Enlightenment of the time, and he felt fascination for <!--del_lnk--> Maquois&#39;s dictionary. His devotion and passion for chemistry was largely influenced by <!--del_lnk--> &Eacute;tienne Condillac, a prominent French scholar of the 18th century. His first chemical publication appeared in 1764. In 1767 he <!--del_lnk--> worked on a geological survey of <!--del_lnk--> Alsace-Lorraine. He was elected a member of the <!--del_lnk--> French Academy of Sciences, France&#39;s most elite scientific society, at the age of 25 in 1768 for an essay on <!--del_lnk--> street lighting and in recognition for his earlier research. In 1769 he worked on the first geological map of <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>.<p>In 1771, he married the 13-year-old <!--del_lnk--> Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze, the daughter of a co-owner of the Ferme. With time, she proved to be a scientific colleague to her husband. She translated documents from English for him, including <!--del_lnk--> Richard Kirwan&#39;s &quot;<i>Essay on Phlogiston</i>&quot; and <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Priestley&#39;s research. She created many <a href="../../wp/d/Drawing.htm" title="Drawing">sketches</a> and carved engravings of the laboratory instruments used by Lavoisier and his colleagues. She also edited and published Lavoisier&rsquo;s memoirs and hosted many parties during which eminent scientists would discuss new chemical theories. As a result of her close work with her husband, it is difficult to separate her individual contributions from his, but it is correctly assumed that much of the work accredited to him bears her fingerprints.<p><a id="Contributions_to_chemistry" name="Contributions_to_chemistry"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Contributions to chemistry</span></h2>

      <p>Some of Lavoisier&#39;s most important experiments examined the nature of <!--del_lnk--> combustion, or burning. Through these experiments, he demonstrated that burning is a process that involves the combination of a substance with oxygen. He also demonstrated the role of oxygen in metal rusting, as well as its role in animal and plant respiration: working with <!--del_lnk--> Pierre-Simon Laplace, Lavoisier conducted experiments that showed that respiration was essentially a slow combustion of organic material using inhaled oxygen. Lavoisier&#39;s explanation of combustion replaced the <!--del_lnk--> phlogiston theory, which postulates that materials release a substance called phlogiston when they burn.<p><a id="Research_on_hydrogen_and_his_role_in_disproving_the_phlogiston_theory" name="Research_on_hydrogen_and_his_role_in_disproving_the_phlogiston_theory"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Research on hydrogen and his role in disproving the phlogiston theory</span></h3>

      <p>He also discovered that the flammable air of <!--del_lnk--> Henry Cavendish which he termed <i><a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a></i> (<!--del_lnk--> Greek for &quot;water-former&quot;), combined with oxygen to produce a dew, as <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Priestley had reported, which appeared to be water. Lavoisier&#39;s work was partly based on the work of Priestley (he corresponded with Priestley and fellow members of the <!--del_lnk--> Lunar Society). However, he tried to take credit for Priestley&#39;s discoveries. This tendency to use the results of others without acknowledgment, then draw conclusions of his own, is said to be characteristic of Lavoisier. In &quot;Sur la combustion en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral&quot; (&quot;On Combustion in general,&quot; 1777) and &quot;Consid&eacute;rations G&eacute;n&eacute;rales sur la Nature des Acides&quot; (&quot;General Considerations on the Nature of Acids,&quot; 1778), he demonstrated that the &quot;air&quot; responsible for combustion was also the source of acidity. In 1779, he named this part of the air &quot;oxygen&quot; (Greek for &quot;acid-former&quot;), and the other &quot;azote&quot; (Greek for &quot;no life&quot;). In &quot;R&eacute;flexions sur la Phlogistique&quot; (&quot;Reflections on Phlogiston,&quot; 1783), Lavoisier showed the <!--del_lnk--> phlogiston theory to be inconsistent.<p><a id="Pioneer_of_stoichiometry" name="Pioneer_of_stoichiometry"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Pioneer of <!--del_lnk--> stoichiometry</span></h3>

      <p>Lavoisier&#39;s experiments were among the first truly quantitative chemical experiments ever performed; that is, he carefully weighed the reactants and products involved, a crucial step in the advancement of chemistry. He showed that, although matter can change its state in a chemical reaction, the quantity of matter is the same at the end as at the beginning of every chemical reaction. He burnt phosphorus and sulphur in air, and proved that the products weighed more than the original. Nevertheless, the weight gained was lost from the air. These experiments provided evidence for the law of the conservation of matter, or in other words, the <!--del_lnk--> law of conservation of mass.<p><a id="Major_works_on_analytical_chemistry_and_chemical_nomenclature" name="Major_works_on_analytical_chemistry_and_chemical_nomenclature"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Major works on analytical chemistry and chemical nomenclature</span></h3>
      <p>Lavoisier also investigated the composition of water and air, which at the time were considered elements. He discovered the components of water were oxygen and hydrogen, and that air was a mixture of gases - primarily <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen.htm" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a> and <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a>. With the French chemists <!--del_lnk--> Claude-Louis Berthollet, Antoine Fourcroy and Guyton de Morveau, Lavoisier devised a chemical nomenclature, or a system of names describing the structure of chemical compounds. He described it in <i>M&eacute;thode de nomenclature chimique</i> (<i>Method of Chemical Nomenclature</i>, 1787). Their system facilitated communication of discoveries between chemists of different backgrounds and is still largely in use today, including names such as sulfuric acid, sulfates, and sulfites.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>His <i>Trait&eacute; &Eacute;l&eacute;mentaire de Chimie (Elementary Treatise of Chemistry</i>, 1789, translated into English by <!--del_lnk--> Robert Kerr) is considered to be the first modern chemical <!--del_lnk--> textbook, and presented a unified view of new theories of chemistry, contained a clear statement of the <!--del_lnk--> Law of Conservation of Mass, and denied the existence of phlogiston. Also, Lavoisier clarified the concept of an element as a simple substance that could not be broken down by any known method of chemical analysis, and he devised a theory of the formation of chemical compounds from elements.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Lavoisier&#39;s fundamental contributions to chemistry were a result of a conscious effort to fit all experiments into the framework of a single theory. He established the consistent use of <!--del_lnk--> chemical balance, used oxygen to overthrow the phlogiston theory, and developed a new system of chemical nomenclature which held that oxygen was an essential constituent of all acids (which later turned out to be erroneous). Lavoisier also made introductory research on physical chemistry and thermodynamics in joint experiment with <!--del_lnk--> Laplace, when he used a calorimeter to estimate the heat evolved per unit of carbon dioxide produced, eventually they found the same ratio for a flame and animals, indicating that animals produced energy by a type of combustion.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>He also made remarkable contributions to <!--del_lnk--> chemical bonding by stating the radical theory, believing that radicals, which function as a single group in a chemical reaction, would combine with oxygen in reactions. He also introduced the possibility of <!--del_lnk--> allotropy in chemical elements when he discovered that <a href="../../wp/d/Diamond.htm" title="Diamond">diamond</a> is a crystalline form of carbon.<p>He also updated many chemical concepts, for the first time the modern notion of elements was laid out systematically; the three or four elements of classical chemistry gave way to the modern system, and Lavoisier worked out reactions in chemical equations that respect the conservation of mass (see, for example, the <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen_cycle.htm" title="Nitrogen cycle">nitrogen cycle</a>).<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Lavoisier used a <!--del_lnk--> calorimeter to measure heat production as a result of respiration in a <!--del_lnk--> guinea pig. The outer shell of the calorimeter was packed with snow, which melted to maintain a constant temperature of 0 &deg;C around an inner shell filled with ice. The guinea pig in the centre of the chamber produced heat which melted the ice. The water which flowed out of the calorimeter was collected and weighed. 1 kg melted ice = 80 kcal heat production by the guinea pig. He concluded, &quot;la respiration est donc une combustion.&quot; That is, respiratory gas exchange is a combustion, like that of a candle burning.<p><a id="Law_and_politics" name="Law_and_politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Law and politics</span></h2>

      <p>As one of 28 French tax collectors and a powerful figure in the unpopular Ferme G&eacute;n&eacute;rale, Lavoisier was branded a traitor during the Reign of Terror by <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">revolutionists</a> in 1794. He was tried, convicted, and <!--del_lnk--> guillotined on the same day in Paris, at the age of 51. Ironically, Lavoisier was one of the few liberals in his position. One of his actions that may have sealed his fate was a <!--del_lnk--> contretemps a few years earlier with the young <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Paul Marat, who subsequently became a leading revolutionary.<p>An appeal to spare his life was cut short by the judge: &quot;The Republic has no need of geniuses [or, alternately, &quot;scientists&quot;].&quot; His importance for science was expressed by the mathematician <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Louis Lagrange who lamented the beheading by saying: &quot;It took them only an instant to cut off that head, but France may not produce another like it in a century.&quot;<p>One and a half years following his death, Lavoisier was exonerated by the French government. When his private belongings were delivered to his widow, a brief note was included reading &quot;To the widow of Lavoisier, who was falsely convicted&quot;.<p>About a century after his death, a statue of Lavoisier was erected in Paris. It was later discovered that the sculptor had not actually copied Lavoisier&#39;s head for the statue, but used a spare head of the <!--del_lnk--> Marquis de Condorcet, the Secretary of the Academy of Sciences during Lavoisier&#39;s last years. Lack of money prevented alterations being made. The statue was melted down during the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">Second World War</a> and has never been replaced.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Lavoisier&quot;</div>
