      <p><b>Valpara&iacute;so</b> is <a href="../../wp/c/Chile.htm" title="Chile">Chile</a>&#39;s most important seaport and an increasingly vital cultural centre. The city is located in central <a href="../../wp/c/Chile.htm" title="Chile">Chile</a>, where it is capital of the <!--del_lnk--> Region of Valpara&iacute;so. Valparaiso is also home of the <!--del_lnk--> National Congress. Built upon dozens of steep hillsides overlooking the Pacific Ocean, Valpara&iacute;so boasts a labyrinth of streets and cobblestone alleyways, embodyng a rich architectural and cultural legacy. Valpara&iacute;so is protected as a <!--del_lnk--> UNESCO World Heritage Site and is often considered to be one of Latin America&#39;s most intriguing urban areas.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 2003, the Chilean Congress declared Valpara&iacute;so to be &quot;Chile&#39;s Cultural Capital&quot; and home for the nation&#39;s new cultural ministry. Although technically only Chile&#39;s 6th largest city, with 263,499 inhabitants (2002 census), the Greater Valpara&iacute;so metropolitan area, including the neighboring resort city of <!--del_lnk--> Vi&ntilde;a del Mar, is the second largest in the country (803,683 inhabitants).<p>Valpara&iacute;so played an important geopolitical role in the second half of the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a>, when the city served as a major stopover for ships traveling between the <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic and <!--del_lnk--> Pacific oceans by crossing the <!--del_lnk--> Straits of Magellan. Always a magnet for European immigrants, Valpara&igrave;so mushroomed during its golden age, when the city was known by international sailors as &quot;Little San Francisco&quot; or &quot;The Jewel of the Pacific.&quot;<p>Examples of Valpara&iacute;so&#39;s former glory include <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>&#39;s oldest stock exchange, the continent&#39;s first volunteer fire department, Chile&#39;s first public library, and the oldest Spanish language newspaper in continuous publication in the world. The opening of the <a href="../../wp/p/Panama_Canal.htm" title="Panama Canal">Panama Canal</a> and reduction in ship traffic, dealt a staggering blow to Valpara&iacute;so, though the city has staged an impressive rennaissance in recent years.<p>Valpara&iacute;so is located in central Chile, 120 km (74 miles) to the northwest of the capital <a href="../../wp/s/Santiago%252C_Chile.htm" title="Santiago, Chile">Santiago</a>. The city is an important educational centre with nine universities. Major industries include tourism, culture, and transport. Valpara&iacute;so stages a major festival attended by hundreds of thousands of participants on the last three days of every year. The festival culminates with a &quot;New Year&#39;s by the Sea&quot; fireworks show, attended by a million tourists who fill the coastline and hillsides with a view of the bay.<p>Approximately 50 international cruise ships call on Valpara&iacute;so during the 4-month Chilean summer. The port of Valpara&iacute;so is also an important hub for shipping of container freight, and exports of wine, copper, and fresh fruit.<p>Travel between Valpara&iacute;so and Santiago currently takes some 70 minutes on a state-of-the-art toll road.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Chilean Congress meets in a modern building in the Almendral section of Valpara&iacute;so, after relocation from Santiago during the last years of the military rule of general <!--del_lnk--> Augusto Pinochet. Although congressional activities were to be legally moved by a ruling in 1987, the newly built site only began to function as the seat of Congress during the democratically-elected government of <!--del_lnk--> Patricio Aylwin, who followed Pinochet, in 1990.<p>The historic quarter of Valpara&iacute;so was declared a <!--del_lnk--> UNESCO <a href="../../wp/w/World_Heritage_Site.htm" title="World Heritage Site">World Heritage Site</a> in 2003.<p>

      <p>Valpara&iacute;so&#39;s bay was first populated by <!--del_lnk--> Changos, an ethnic group dedicated to fishing and gathering. Spanish explorers arrived in 1536, on the Santiaguillo, a ship sent by <!--del_lnk--> Diego de Almagro, considered the first European explorer of Chile. The Santiaguillo carried men and supplies for Almagro&#39;s expedition, under the command of <!--del_lnk--> Juan de Saavedra, who named the town after his native village of <!--del_lnk--> Valpara&iacute;so de Arriba in <!--del_lnk--> Cuenca, <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>During Spanish colonial times, Valpara&iacute;so remained a small village, with only a few houses and a church. After Chilean Independence from Spain, Valpara&iacute;so became the main harbour for the nascent Chilean navy, and opened to international trade, which had been limited to commerce with Spain and its other colonies. Valpara&iacute;so soon became a required stopover for ships crossing between the <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic and <!--del_lnk--> Pacific oceans via the <!--del_lnk--> Strait of Magellan and <a href="../../wp/c/Cape_Horn.htm" title="Cape Horn">Cape Horn</a>, and gained particular importance supporting and supplying the <!--del_lnk--> California Gold Rush (1848-1858). In its role as a major seaport, Valpara&iacute;so received immigrants from many european countries, mainly from England, Germany, France, Switzerland and Italy. German, French, Italian and English were commonly spoken among its citizens, who also had newspapers in these same languages.<p>International immigration transformed the local culture from its Spanish origins. <a href="../../wp/f/Football.htm" title="Football">Football</a> (soccer) was introduced to Chile by the English immigrants, and the first private and catholic school in Chile was founded by french inmigrants in Valpara&iacute;so: Le Coll&egrave;ge de Les Sacr&eacute;s Coeurs (The Sacred Hearts School) which has been working for about 170 years in this city. In Valparaiso, there were also founded the firsts non-Catholic schools by immigrants from England and Germany (The MacKay School, and Der Deutsche Schule respectively). Immigrants also formed the first volunteer fire-fighting units (still a volunteer activity in Chile), while architecture reflected European styles.<p>The golden age of Valpara&iacute;so&#39;s commerce ended after the opening of the <a href="../../wp/p/Panama_Canal.htm" title="Panama Canal">Panama Canal</a>, as most ships sought to avoid the Strait of Magellan, and the port&#39;s importance and use was reduced substantially. Traffic has increased in the last few decades with fruit exports and increasing opening of the Chilean economy to world commerce.<p><a id="Today" name="Today"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Today</span></h2>
      <p>Though <!--del_lnk--> San Antonio has taken the reins as the country&#39;s most commercially important seaport, the City of Valpara&iacute;so remains a vibrant centre of Chilean culture, and the Greater Valpara&iacute;so metropolitan area (which includes Valpara&iacute;so, <!--del_lnk--> Vi&ntilde;a del Mar, <!--del_lnk--> Quilpu&eacute; and <!--del_lnk--> Villa Alemana) has the second largest concentration of population in the country after <!--del_lnk--> Gran Santiago.<p>Nicknamed &quot;The Jewel of the Pacific&quot;, Valpara&iacute;so was declared a world heritage site based on its industrial heritage, improvised urban design, and unique architecture. The official Unesco declaration also places exceptional emphasis on Valpara&iacute;so&#39;s unique &quot;intangible heritage,&quot; which includes the city&#39;s ethnic heritage as seen through the traditions and life styles of Valpara&iacute;so&#39;s immigrant communities.<p>Immortalized in the words of Pablo Neruda as the &#39;Ocean&#39;s sweetheart&#39; (&quot;novia del oc&eacute;ano&quot;), the city that &#39;goes to Paradise&#39; (Va al para&iacute;so) is one of Chile&#39;s &mdash;if not South America&#39;s&mdash; most charismatic and historic ports, with its charming &quot;ascensores&quot; (funiculars) and colorful hillside houses. Valpara&iacute;so&#39;s road infrastructure is under substantial improvement at present, particularly with the upcoming completion of the <!--del_lnk--> &quot;Curaima - Placilla - La P&oacute;lvora&quot; highway bypass, which will permit trucks to go directly to the port facility over a modern highway and through tunnels, without driving through the historic and already congested downtown streets. In addition, roads to link Valpara&iacute;so to San Antonio, Chile&#39;s second largest port, and the coastal towns in between (Laguna Verde, Quintay, Algarrobo, and Isla Negra, for example), are also under various degrees of completion.<p>A new, regional <!--del_lnk--> Metro system, opened to the public on <!--del_lnk--> 24 November <!--del_lnk--> 2005, updated the railroad that joined Santiago and Valpara&iacute;so (and cities in between, finished in 1863). The new metro constitutes the so-called &quot;fourth stage&quot; (&quot;Cuarta Etapa&quot; in Spanish) of Metropolitan improvements. The metro railway extends along most of Gran Valpara&iacute;so and is the second metro system in operation in Chile (after Santiago&#39;s), and includes an underground section that crosses Vi&ntilde;a del Mar&#39;s downtown.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

      <p>During Valpara&iacute;so&#39;s golden age (1848-1914) the city received large numbers of immigrants, primarily from Europe. The immigrant communities left a unique imprint on the city&#39;s architecture. Each community built its own churches and schools, while many also founded other noteworthy cultural and economic institutions. The largest immigrant communities came from England, Germany, and Italy, each developing their own hillside neighbourhood, preserved today as National Historic Districts or &quot;Zonas T&iacute;picas.&quot;<p>During the second half of the twentieth century, Valpara&iacute;so experienced a great decline, as wealthy families de-gentrified the historic quarter, moving to bustling Santiago or nearby Vi&ntilde;a del Mar. By the early 1990s, much of the city&#39;s unique heritage had been lost and many Chileans had given up on the city. But in the mid 1990s, a grass roots preservation movement blossomed in Valpara&iacute;so.<p>In 1996, the World Monuments Fund declared Valpara&iacute;so&#39;s unusual system of funicular elevators (highly-inclined cable cars) one of the world&#39;s 100 most endangered historical treasures. In 1998, grassroots activists convinced the Chilean government and local authorities to apply for UNESCO world heritage status for Valpara&iacute;so.<p>One such activist group was the <!--del_lnk--> &quot;Fundaci&oacute;n Valpara&iacute;so&quot; or Valpara&iacute;so Foundation, founded by a contemporary North American Poet, <!--del_lnk--> Todd Temkin, who fell in love with the city while teaching literature at the Catholic University of Valpara&iacute;so. The Valpara&iacute;so Foundation has executed major neighbourhood redevelopment projects; has improved the city&#39;s tourist infrastructure; and administers the city&#39;s jazz, ethnic music, and opera festivals; among other projects.<p>Some noteworthy foundation projects include: <!--del_lnk--> &quot;The World Heritage Trail&quot;;<!--del_lnk--> &quot;Opera by the Sea&quot;; and Chile&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> &quot;Cultural Capital&quot;.<p>Valpara&iacute;so was declared a <!--del_lnk--> World Heritage Site in 2003, thanks to its historical importance, natural beauty (large number of hills surrounding a picturesque harbour), and unique architecture (particularly, a mix of 19th century styles of housing).<p>Valpara&iacute;so&#39;s newspaper, <!--del_lnk--> &quot;El Mercurio de Valpara&iacute;so&quot;, claims to be the oldest Spanish-language newspaper in circulation in the world.<p><!--del_lnk--> &quot;Fundaci&oacute;n Renzo Pecchenino, LUKAS&quot; maintains the drawings and paintings of the artist/cartoonist who came to symbolize Valpara&iacute;so in popular culture, in a newly restored building on Cerro Concepci&oacute;n, overlooking the bay.<p>Valpara&iacute;so is also home to the so called <b>&quot;<!--del_lnk--> School of Valpara&iacute;so&quot;</b>, which is in fact the Faculty of Architecture &amp; Urbanism of the <!--del_lnk--> Pontificia Universidad Cat&oacute;lica de Valpara&iacute;so. The &quot;School of Valparaiso&quot; is one of the most experimental, avantgarde and controversial Architectural schools in the country.<p>The city has the second largest concentration of universities in Chile, and is home to five major universities:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Universidad T&eacute;cnica Federico Santa Mar&iacute;a<li><!--del_lnk--> Pontificia Universidad Cat&oacute;lica de Valpara&iacute;so<li><!--del_lnk--> Universidad Adolfo Ib&aacute;&ntilde;ez<li><!--del_lnk--> Universidad de Valpara&iacute;so<li><!--del_lnk--> Universidad de Playa Ancha</ul>
      <p>Valpara&iacute;so is the birthplace of many historically significant figures, including <!--del_lnk--> Augusto Pinochet, <!--del_lnk--> Salvador Allende, Roberto Ampuero, author of the internationally published novels about the private eye Cayetano Brul&eacute;, and Australia&#39;s third Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> John Christian Watson among them. It has also been the residence of many artists like <!--del_lnk--> Pablo Neruda and Nicaraguan poet <!--del_lnk--> Rub&eacute;n Dar&iacute;o.<p>The nightlife in Valpara&iacute;so claims to be te best in the Country, there is a tradition from the sailors, who comes to the Harbour sector to drink and in this sector are large number of bars, some of them in activity even today. For example &quot;Bar La Playa&quot; near Sotomayor Square. The big proportion of University students keeps the tradition alive and a huge number of nightclubs, bars and discotheques turns some nights into day. A vivid guide of Valparaiso can be found in the novels of Cayetano Brule, the private detective who lives in a Victorian house in the pictoresque Paseo Gervasoni, Cerro Concepcion.<p><a id="Sports" name="Sports"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sports</span></h2>
