      <p>A <b>volcano</b> is an opening (or rupture) in the Earth&#39;s surface or crust, which allows hot, usually molten rock, ash, and gases to escape from deep below the surface. Volcanic activity involving the <!--del_lnk--> extrusion of rock tends to form mountains or features like mountains over a period of time.<p>Volcanoes are generally found where two to three <a href="../../wp/p/Plate_tectonics.htm" title="Tectonic plates">tectonic plates</a> <!--del_lnk--> pull apart or are <!--del_lnk--> coming together. A <!--del_lnk--> mid-oceanic ridge, like the <!--del_lnk--> Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has examples of volcanoes caused by &quot;divergent tectonic plates&quot; pulling apart; the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Ring of Fire has examples of volcanoes caused by &quot;convergent tectonic plates&quot; coming together. By contrast, volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another (like the <!--del_lnk--> San Andreas fault). Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching of the Earth&#39;s crust and where the crust grows thin (called &quot;non-hotspot intraplate volcanism&quot;), such as in the <!--del_lnk--> African Rift Valley or the European <!--del_lnk--> Rhine Graben with its <!--del_lnk--> Eifel volcanoes).<p>Finally, volcanoes can be caused by &quot;<!--del_lnk--> mantle plumes,&quot; so-called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> hotspots;&quot; these hotspots can occur far from plate boundaries, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Hawaiian Islands. Interestingly, hotspot volcanoes are also found elsewhere in the <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_System.htm" title="Solar system">solar system</a>, especially on rocky planets and moons.<p>

      <p>At the mid-oceanic <!--del_lnk--> ridges, two <!--del_lnk--> tectonic plates diverge from one another. New <a href="../../wp/c/Crust_%2528geology%2529.htm" title="Crust (geology)">oceanic crust</a> is being formed by hot molten rock slowly cooling down and solidifying. In these places, the crust is very thin and eruptions occur frequently because of the pull by the tectonic plates. The main part of the mid-oceanic ridges are at the bottom of the ocean, and most volcanic activity is submarine. <!--del_lnk--> Black smokers are a typical example of this kind of volcanic activity. Where the mid-oceanic ridge comes above sea-level, volcanoes like the <!--del_lnk--> Hekla on <a href="../../wp/i/Iceland.htm" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> are formed. Divergent plate boundaries create new seafloor and volcanic islands.<p><a id="Convergent_plate_boundaries" name="Convergent_plate_boundaries"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Convergent plate boundaries</span></h3>
      <p>In places where one tectonic plate submerges beneath another, the crust melts and becomes <a href="../../wp/m/Magma.htm" title="Magma">magma</a>. This surplus amount of magma generated in one location causes the formation of the volcano. Typical examples for this kind of volcano are the volcanoes in the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Ring of Fire, and also <!--del_lnk--> Mount Etna and <a href="../../wp/m/Mount_Vesuvius.htm" title="Mount Vesuvius">Mount Vesuvius</a>.<p><a id="Hotspots" name="Hotspots"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Hotspots</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Hotspots are not located on the ridges of tectonic plates, but on top of <!--del_lnk--> mantle plumes, where the <!--del_lnk--> convection of <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> mantle creates a column of hot material that rises until it reaches the crust. The temperature of the plume causes the crust to melt and form pipes, which can vent magma. Because the tectonic plates move whereas the mantle plume remains in the same place, each volcano becomes extinct after a while and a new volcano is then being formed as the plate shifts over the hotspot. The <!--del_lnk--> Hawaiian Islands are thought to be formed in such a manner, as well as the <!--del_lnk--> Snake River Plain, with the <!--del_lnk--> Yellowstone Caldera being the current part of the North American plate over the hotspot.<p><a id="Petitspots" name="Petitspots"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Petitspots</span></h3>
      <p>In July 2006, volcanoes were discovered that did not fit in any of the above-mentioned categories, since they are located far from the plate boundary, but are too small to be the result of a mantle plume. A new theory suggests that submergence of tectonic plates causes stress all over the plate, which causes the plate to crack in some places. However, other scientists believe the mantle plume theory to be incorrect, and consider this discovery a confirmation of their ideas.<p><a id="Shape" name="Shape"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Shape</span></h2>
      <p>The most common perception of a volcano is of a <!--del_lnk--> conical mountain, spewing lava and poisonous gases from a <!--del_lnk--> crater in its top. This describes just one of many types of volcano and the features of volcanoes are much more complicated. The structure and behaviour of volcanoes depends on a number of factors. Some volcanoes have rugged peaks formed by <!--del_lnk--> lava domes rather than a <!--del_lnk--> summit crater, whereas others present <a href="../../wp/l/Landscape.htm" title="Landscape">landscape</a> features such as massive plateaus. Vents that issue volcanic material (lava, which is what magma is called once it has broken the surface, and <!--del_lnk--> ash) and gases (mainly <!--del_lnk--> steam and magmatic gases) can be located anywhere on the landform. Many of these vents give rise to smaller cones such as <!--del_lnk--> Pu<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">&#x2BB;</font>u <font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">&#x2BB;</font>&#x14C;<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">&#x2BB;</font>&#x14D; on a flank of <!--del_lnk--> Hawai<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">&#x2BB;</font>i&#39;s <a href="../../wp/k/K%25C4%25ABlauea.htm" title="K&#x12B;lauea">K&#x12B;lauea</a>.<p>Other types of volcanoes include <!--del_lnk--> cryovolcanos (or ice volcanoes), particularly on some moons of <a href="../../wp/j/Jupiter.htm" title="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Saturn.htm" title="Saturn">Saturn</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/Neptune.htm" title="Neptune">Neptune</a>; and <!--del_lnk--> mud volcanoes, which are formations often not associated with known magmatic activity.

Their lava flows are generally very hot and very fluid, contributing to long flows. The largest lava shield on Earth, <a href="../../wp/m/Mauna_Loa.htm" title="Mauna Loa">Mauna Loa</a>, rises over 9,000 m from the ocean floor, is 120 km in diameter and forms part of the <!--del_lnk--> Big Island of Hawai<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">&#x2BB;</font>i. <!--del_lnk--> Olympus Mons is the largest shield volcano on <a href="../../wp/m/Mars.htm" title="Mars">Mars</a>, and is the tallest known mountain in the <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_System.htm" title="Solar system">solar system</a>. Smaller versions of shield volcanoes include <i>lava cones</i>, and <i>lava mounds</i>.<p>Quiet eruptions spread out basaltic lava in flat layers.

      <p><i><!--del_lnk--> Volcanic cones</i> or <i><!--del_lnk--> cinder cones</i> result from eruptions that throw out mostly small pieces of <!--del_lnk--> scoria and <!--del_lnk--> pyroclastics (both resemble cinders, hence the name of this volcano type) that build up around the vent.

      <p><i><!--del_lnk--> Submarine volcanoes</i> are common features on the ocean floor. Some are active and, in shallow water, disclose their presence by blasting steam and rocky debris high above the surface of the sea. Many others lie at such great depths that the tremendous weight of the water above them prevents the explosive release of steam and gases, although they can be detected by <!--del_lnk--> hydrophones and discoloration of water because of <!--del_lnk--> volcanic gases. Even large submarine eruptions may not disturb the ocean surface. Because of the rapid cooling effect of water as compared to air, and increased buoyancy, submarine volcanoes often form rather steep pillars over their volcanic vents as compared to above-surface volcanos. In due time, they may break the ocean surface as new islands. <!--del_lnk--> Pillow lava is a common eruptive product of submarine volcanoes.<p><a id="Subglacial_volcanoes" name="Subglacial_volcanoes"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Subglacial volcanoes</span></h3>

      <p><i><!--del_lnk--> Subglacial volcanoes</i> develop underneath icecaps. They are made up of flat <!--del_lnk--> lava flows atop extensive pillow lavas and <!--del_lnk--> palagonite. When the icecap melts, the lavas on the top collapse leaving a flat-topped mountain. Then, the pillow lavas also collapse, giving an angle of 37.5 degrees. Very good examples of this can be seen in Iceland. These volcanoes are also called table volcanoes, tuyas or (uncommonly) mobergs.<p><a id="Erupted_material" name="Erupted_material"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Erupted material</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Lava_composition" name="Lava_composition"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Lava composition</span></h3>
      <p>Another way of classifying volcanoes is by the <i>composition of material erupted</i> (<!--del_lnk--> lava), since this affects the shape of the volcano. Lava can be broadly classified into 4 different compositions (Cas &amp; Wright, 1987):<ul>
       <li>If the erupted <a href="../../wp/m/Magma.htm" title="Magma">magma</a> contains a high percentage (&gt;63%) of <!--del_lnk--> silica, the lava is called <!--del_lnk--> felsic. <ul>
         <li>Felsic lavas (or <!--del_lnk--> rhyolites) tend to be highly <!--del_lnk--> viscous (not very fluid) and are erupted as domes or short, stubby flows. Viscous lavas tend to form <!--del_lnk--> stratovolcanoes or lava domes. <!--del_lnk--> Lassen Peak in <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a> is an example of a volcano formed from felsic lava and is actually a large lava dome.<li>Because siliceous magmas are so viscous, they tend to trap <!--del_lnk--> volatiles (gases) that are present, which cause the magma to erupt catastrophically, eventually forming <!--del_lnk--> stratovolcanoes. <!--del_lnk--> Pyroclastic flows (<!--del_lnk--> ignimbrites) are highly hazardous products of such volcanoes, since they are composed of molten volcanic ash too heavy to go up into the atmosphere, so they hug the volcano&#39;s slopes and travel far from their vents during large eruptions. Temperatures as high as 1,200 &deg;C are known to occur in <!--del_lnk--> pyroclastic flows, which will incinerate everything flammable in their path and thick layers of hot pyroclastic flow deposits can be laid down, often up to many meters thick. <!--del_lnk--> Alaska&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, formed by the eruption of <!--del_lnk--> Novarupta near <!--del_lnk--> Katmai in 1912, is an example of a thick <!--del_lnk--> pyroclastic flow or <!--del_lnk--> ignimbrite deposit. Volcanic ash that is light enough to be erupted high into the <a href="../../wp/e/Earth%2527s_atmosphere.htm" title="Earth&#39;s atmosphere">Earth&#39;s atmosphere</a> may travel many kilometres before it falls back to ground as a <!--del_lnk--> tuff.</ul>
       <li>If the erupted magma contains 52-63% silica, the lava is of <i>intermediate</i> composition. <ul>
         <li>These &quot;<!--del_lnk--> andesitic&quot; volcanoes generally only occur above <!--del_lnk--> subduction zones (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> Mount Merapi in <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>).</ul>
       <li>If the erupted magma contains &lt;52% and &gt;45% silica, the lava is called <!--del_lnk--> mafic (because it contains higher percentages of <a href="../../wp/m/Magnesium.htm" title="Magnesium">magnesium</a> (Mg) and <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a> (Fe)) or <!--del_lnk--> basaltic. These lavas are usually much less viscous than rhyolitic lavas, depending on their eruption <!--del_lnk--> temperature; they also tend to be hotter than felsic lavas. Mafic lavas occur in a wide range of settings: <ul>
         <li>At <!--del_lnk--> mid-ocean ridges, where two oceanic <a href="../../wp/p/Plate_tectonics.htm" title="Tectonic plate">plates</a> are pulling apart, basaltic lava erupts as <!--del_lnk--> pillows to fill the gap;<li><!--del_lnk--> Shield volcanoes (e.g. the <!--del_lnk--> Hawaiian Islands, including <a href="../../wp/m/Mauna_Loa.htm" title="Mauna Loa">Mauna Loa</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Kilauea), on both <!--del_lnk--> oceanic and <a href="../../wp/c/Continental_crust.htm" title="Continental crust">continental crust</a>;<li>As <!--del_lnk--> continental flood basalts.</ul>
       <li>If the erupted magma contains &lt;=45% silica, the lava is called <!--del_lnk--> ultramafic. Ultramafic flows are very rare; indeed, it is likely that none have been erupted at the Earth&#39;s surface since the <!--del_lnk--> Proterozoic, when the planet&#39;s heat flow was higher. They are (or were) the hottest lavas, and probably more fluid than common mafic lavas.</ul>
      <p><a id="Lava_texture" name="Lava_texture"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Lava texture</span></h3>
      <p>Two types of lava are erupted according to the <!--del_lnk--> surface texture: <font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">&#x2BB;</font>A<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">&#x2BB;</font>a (pronounced <!--del_lnk--> IPA <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[&#x294;a&#x294;a]</span>) and <!--del_lnk--> p&#x101;hoehoe (pronounced <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[pa&#x2D0;ho&#x361;e&#x2D0;ho&#x361;e&#x2D0;]</span>), both words having <!--del_lnk--> Hawaiian origins. <font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">&#x2BB;</font>A<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">&#x2BB;</font>a is characterized by a rough, clinkery surface and is what most viscous and hot lava flows look like. However, even basaltic or mafic flows can be erupted as <font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">&#x2BB;</font>a<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">&#x2BB;</font>a flows, particularly if the eruption rate is high and the slope is steep. P&#x101;hoehoe is characterized by its smooth and often ropey or wrinkly surface and is generally formed from more fluid lava flows. Usually, only mafic flows will erupt as p&#x101;hoehoe, since they often erupt at higher temperatures or have the proper chemical make-up to allow them to flow at a higher fluidity.<p><a id="Volcanic_activity" name="Volcanic_activity"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Volcanic activity</span></h2>

      <p>A popular way of classifying magmatic volcanoes goes by their frequency of eruption, with those that erupt regularly called <b>active</b>, those that have erupted in historical times but are now quiet called <b>dormant</b>, and those that have not erupted in historical times called <b>extinct</b>. However, these popular classifications&mdash;extinct in particular&mdash;are practically meaningless to scientists. They use classifications which refer to a particular volcano&#39;s formative and eruptive processes and resulting shapes, which was explained above.<p>There is no real consensus among volcanologists on how to define an &quot;active&quot; volcano. The lifespan of a volcano can vary from months to several million years, making such a distinction sometimes meaningless when compared to the lifespans of humans or even civilizations. For example, many of Earth&#39;s volcanoes have erupted dozens of times in the past few thousand years but are not currently showing signs of eruption. Given the long lifespan of such volcanoes, they are very active. By our lifespans, however, they are not. Complicating the definition are volcanoes that become restless (producing earthquakes, venting gasses, or other non-eruptive activities) but do not actually erupt.<p>Scientists usually consider a volcano <b>active</b> if it is currently erupting or showing signs of unrest, such as unusual earthquake activity or significant new gas emissions. Many scientists also consider a volcano active if it has erupted in historic time. It is important to note that the span of recorded history differs from region to region; in the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>, recorded history reaches back more than 3,000 years but in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, it reaches back less than 300 years, and in <!--del_lnk--> Hawaii, little more than 200 years. The Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program&#39;s definition of &#39;active&#39; is having erupted within the last 10,000 years.<p><b>Dormant</b> volcanoes are those that are not currently active (as defined above), but could become restless or erupt again. Confusion however, can arise because many volcanoes which scientists consider to be <i>active</i> are referred to as <i>dormant</i> by laypersons or in the media.<p><b>Extinct</b> volcanoes are those that scientists consider unlikely to erupt again. Whether a volcano is truly extinct is often difficult to determine. Since &quot;supervolcano&quot; <!--del_lnk--> calderas can have eruptive lifespans sometimes measured in millions of years, a caldera that has not produced an eruption in tens of thousands of years is likely to be considered dormant instead of extinct.<p>For example, the <!--del_lnk--> Yellowstone Caldera in <a href="../../wp/y/Yellowstone_National_Park.htm" title="Yellowstone National Park">Yellowstone National Park</a> is at least 2 million years old and hasn&#39;t erupted violently for approximately 640,000 years, although there has been some minor activity relatively recently, with hydrothermal eruptions less than 10,000 years ago and lava flows about 70,000 years ago. For this reason, scientists do not consider the Yellowstone Caldera extinct. In fact, because the caldera has frequent earthquakes, a very active geothermal system (i.e., the entirety of the geothermal activity found in Yellowstone National Park), and rapid rates of ground uplift, many scientists consider it to be an active volcano.<p><a id="Notable_volcanoes" name="Notable_volcanoes"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Notable volcanoes</span></h2>

      <p>The Earth&#39;s <a href="../../wp/m/Moon.htm" title="Moon">Moon</a> has no large volcanoes and no volcanic activity, although recent evidence suggests it may still possess a partially molten core. However, the Moon does have many volcanic features such as <!--del_lnk--> maria (the darker patches seen on the moon), <!--del_lnk--> rilles and <!--del_lnk--> domes.<p>The planet <!--del_lnk--> Venus has a surface that is 90% <!--del_lnk--> basalt, indicating that volcanism played a major role in shaping its surface. The planet may have had a major global resurfacing event about 500 million years ago, from what scientists can tell from the density of impact craters on the surface. Lava flows are widespread and forms of volcanism not present on Earth occur as well. Changes in the planet&#39;s atmosphere and observations of lightning, have been attributed to ongoing volcanic eruptions, although there is no confirmation of whether or not Venus is still volcanically active.<p>There are several extinct volcanoes on <!--del_lnk--> Mars, four of which are vast shield volcanoes far bigger than any on Earth. They include <!--del_lnk--> Arsia Mons, <!--del_lnk--> Ascraeus Mons, <!--del_lnk--> Hecates Tholus, <!--del_lnk--> Olympus Mons, and <!--del_lnk--> Pavonis Mons. These volcanoes have been extinct for many millions of years, but the European <i><!--del_lnk--> Mars Express</i> spacecraft has found evidence that volcanic activity may have occurred on Mars in the recent past as well.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Jupiter&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> moon <!--del_lnk--> Io is the most volcanically active object in the solar system because of <!--del_lnk--> tidal interaction with Jupiter. It is covered with volcanoes that erupt <a href="../../wp/s/Sulfur.htm" title="Sulfur">sulfur</a>, <!--del_lnk--> sulfur dioxide and <!--del_lnk--> silicate rock, and as a result, <!--del_lnk--> Io is constantly being resurfaced. Its lavas are the hottest known anywhere in the solar system, with temperatures exceeding 1,800 K (1,500 &deg;C). In February <!--del_lnk--> 2001, the largest recorded volcanic eruptions in the solar system occurred on Io . <!--del_lnk--> Europa, the smallest of Jupiter&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Galilean moons, also appears to have an active volcanic system, except that its volcanic activity is entirely in the form of water, which freezes into ice on the frigid surface. This process is known as <!--del_lnk--> cryovolcanism, and is apparently most common on the moons of the outer planets of the <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_System.htm" title="Solar system">solar system</a>.<p>In 1989 the <!--del_lnk--> Voyager 2 spacecraft observed <!--del_lnk--> cryovolcanos (ice volcanoes) on <!--del_lnk--> Triton, a <!--del_lnk--> moon of <!--del_lnk--> Neptune, and in 2005 the <a href="../../wp/c/Cassini-Huygens.htm" title="Cassini-Huygens">Cassini-Huygens</a> probe photographed <!--del_lnk--> fountains of frozen particles erupting from Enceladus, a moon of <a href="../../wp/s/Saturn.htm" title="Saturn">Saturn</a>.

      <p>There are many different kinds of volcanic activity and eruptions: <!--del_lnk--> phreatic eruptions (steam-generated eruptions), explosive eruption of high-<!--del_lnk--> silica <!--del_lnk--> lava (e.g., <!--del_lnk--> rhyolite), effusive eruption of low-silica lava (e.g., <!--del_lnk--> basalt), <!--del_lnk--> pyroclastic flows, <!--del_lnk--> lahars (debris flow) and <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> emission. All of these activities can pose a hazard to humans. Volcanic activity is often accompanied by <a href="../../wp/e/Earthquake.htm" title="Earthquake">earthquakes</a>, <!--del_lnk--> hot springs, <!--del_lnk--> fumaroles, <!--del_lnk--> mud pots and <!--del_lnk--> geysers. Low-magnitude earthquakes often precede eruptions.<p>The concentrations of different volcanic gases can vary considerably from one volcano to the next. <!--del_lnk--> Water vapor is typically the most abundant volcanic gas, followed by <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> and <!--del_lnk--> sulphur dioxide. Other principal volcanic gases include <!--del_lnk--> hydrogen sulphide, <!--del_lnk--> hydrogen chloride, and <!--del_lnk--> hydrogen fluoride. A large number of minor and trace gases are also found in volcanic emissions, for example <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, <!--del_lnk--> carbon monoxide, <!--del_lnk--> halocarbons, organic compounds, and volatile metal chlorides.<p>Large, explosive volcanic eruptions inject water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), hydrogen chloride (HCl), hydrogen fluoride (HF) and ash (pulverized rock and pumice) into the stratosphere to heights of 10-20 miles above the Earth&#39;s surface. The most significant impacts from these injections come from the conversion of sulphur dioxide to <a href="../../wp/s/Sulfuric_acid.htm" title="Sulphuric acid">sulphuric acid</a> (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), which condenses rapidly in the stratosphere to form fine <!--del_lnk--> sulfate <!--del_lnk--> aerosols. The aerosols increase the Earth&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> albedo&mdash;its reflection of radiation from the <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">Sun</a> back into space - and thus cool the Earth&#39;s lower atmosphere or troposphere; however, they also absorb heat radiated up from the Earth, thereby warming the <!--del_lnk--> stratosphere. Several eruptions during the past century have caused a decline in the average temperature at the Earth&#39;s surface of up to half a degree (Fahrenheit scale) for periods of one to three years. The sulphate aerosols also promote complex <!--del_lnk--> chemical reactions on their surfaces that alter chlorine and <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen.htm" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a> chemical species in the stratosphere. This effect, together with increased stratospheric <a href="../../wp/c/Chlorine.htm" title="Chlorine">chlorine</a> levels from <!--del_lnk--> chlorofluorocarbon pollution, generates chlorine monoxide (ClO), which destroys <a href="../../wp/o/Ozone.htm" title="Ozone">ozone</a> (O<sub>3</sub>). As the aerosols grow and coagulate, they settle down into the upper troposphere where they serve as nuclei for <!--del_lnk--> cirrus clouds and further modify the Earth&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> radiation balance. Most of the hydrogen chloride (HCl) and hydrogen fluoride (HF) are dissolved in water droplets in the eruption cloud and quickly fall to the ground as <a href="../../wp/a/Acid_rain.htm" title="Acid rain">acid rain</a>. The injected ash also falls rapidly from the stratosphere; most of it is removed within several days to a few weeks. Finally, explosive volcanic eruptions release the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and thus provide a deep source of <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon.htm" title="Carbon">carbon</a> for biogeochemical cycles.<p>Gas emissions from volcanoes are a natural contributor to acid rain. Volcanic activity releases about 130 to 230 <!--del_lnk--> teragrams (145 million to 255 million <!--del_lnk--> short tons) of <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> each year. Volcanic eruptions may inject <!--del_lnk--> aerosols into the <a href="../../wp/e/Earth%2527s_atmosphere.htm" title="Earth&#39;s atmosphere">Earth&#39;s atmosphere</a>. Large injections may cause visual effects such as unusually colorful sunsets and affect global climate mainly by cooling it. Volcanic eruptions also provide the benefit of adding nutrients to soil through the <!--del_lnk--> weathering process of volcanic rocks. These fertile soils assist the growth of plants and various crops. Volcanic eruptions can also create new islands, as the magma dries on the water.<p><a id="Etymology" name="Etymology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Etymology</span></h2>

      <p>Before it was understood that most of the Earth&#39;s interior is molten, various explanations existed for volcano behaviour. For decades after awareness that compression and radioactive materials may be heat sources, their contributions were specifically discounted.
