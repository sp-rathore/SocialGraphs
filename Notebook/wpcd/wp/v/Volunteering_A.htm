<h2>Volunteering to help SOS Children</h2><p><strong>18/02/2006</strong></p>
<p>People often respond to hearing about our charity's work by offering to volunteer for us. It is a natural reaction to want to help the children in need that we care for. At the same time, most people recognise that actual long term childcare for vulnerable children in the third world is better done by properly trained and supported local staff who are able to help the child grow in security. </p><p>For this reason although our world-wide operation is substantial we do not take vast numbers of short-term volunteers abroad. </p><p>However, we do welcome volunteers in the UK. Both people who offer to help us with administration or fundraising in our office in Cambridge as well as around the UK.</p><p><strong>Regional Volunteer Co-ordinators</strong><br />We are looking to recruit individuals who can raise awareness of our work in their area and facilitate community fundraising for our work with orphaned and abandoned children. </p><p><strong>Encourage more support</strong><br />Do you have contacts with schools, companies and community groups? Would you be willing to approach these contacts? Are you happy to make new contacts for SOS Children to encourage more support for the charity? </p><p><strong>A great success</strong><br />The first WOW in 2005 was a great success and we want to make 2006 even better with the help of Regional Volunteer Co-ordinators. We are planning a host of events for 2006 including WOW Balloon Races, Cinema previews, raffles and many more to make WOW fantastic. </p><p><strong>A regional face</strong><br />We need enthusiastic and motivated individuals who have about 8-10 hours to spare a week. If you are confident in front of groups of people and could be a regional &lsquo;face&rsquo; of the charity, please call Bec on 01223 365589 or email <a href="mailto:bec@soschildren.org">bec@soschildren.org</a></p><p>At any one time we have about ten volunteers on our books and most come in for about a half day a week: whether they help us with filing and sending out information to sponsors, or by maintaining a supply of leaflets and a poster in a waiting room, or even helping with proof-reading and improving documents sent to us by people for whom English is not their mother tongue. If you would like to help in this way, please just email us and we will send you our brief form to fill in to help us help you find something valuable you can do for the world's orphans. </p><p><strong>Current overseas opportunities</strong><br />We currently have one year teaching opportunities for volunteers in Jordan and China. If you have medical qualifications and a year to spare, then contact us about one of our 54 medical centres.</p><p>Please contact Caroline Baker on 01223 365589 or <a href="mailto:caroline@soschildren.org">caroline@soschildren.org</a> for more details. </p><p>SOS Children is a working name for the charity SOS Children's Villages UK. Charity Commission registered Charity number 1069204</p>
