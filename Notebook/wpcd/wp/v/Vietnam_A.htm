<h2>SOS Children in Vietnam</h2>
<img src="../../wp/j/Jwp_map_vietnam_en.gif" width="343" height="450" alt="Sponsorship sites in Vietnam" class="left" /><p>Vietnam, a former French colony, achieved independence in 1954 and was split into North (communist) and South (US-backed) Vietnam. From 1964 to 1976 Vietnam experienced the longest and bloodiest war since World War II which left one million dead and two million injured, as well as six million refugees and over a million orphans. The outcome was that in 1976 Vietnam was reunified as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. </p><p>There is increasing foreign investment. USA is now its main trading partner. While new opportunities and economic benefits for many Vietnamese people have improved, there are ever-increasing gaps between the rich and the poor, and between rural and urban populations. Average daily income is less than &pound;1 (&pound;46.60 in the UK). Gender discrimination also continues to undermine the well-being of women and their children.</p><p>SOS Children's Villages work in Vietnam began in 1967 when the first village was established near Ho-Chi-Minh City (formerly Saigon). Fifty pre-fabricated houses, made in Austria, provided a home for over 500 orphans and war damaged children. A second village was opened at Da Lat in 1974, but both were taken over by the new government in 1976. Then in 1990, after many years of negotiation with the government, they were returned to SOS Children's Villages. Today there are 12 SOS Children's Villages and 31 related projects.</p><img src="../../wp/p/Portrait_Of_Boy_Ca_Mau_Vietnam.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="SOS Children Vietnam Boy" class="right" /><p>SOS Children's Village Ben Tre is about 50 miles south of Ho Chi Minh City.
