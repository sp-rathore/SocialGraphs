      <p>Commissioned by King <!--del_lnk--> Manuel I of Portugal to find <!--del_lnk--> Christian lands in the East (the King, like many Europeans, was under the impression that India was the legendary Christian Kingdom of <!--del_lnk--> Prester John), and to gain Portuguese access to the commercial markets of the <!--del_lnk--> Orient, da Gama extended the sea route exploration of his predecessor <!--del_lnk--> Bartolomeu Dias, who had first rounded <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Cape of Good Hope in 1488, culminating a generation of Portuguese sea exploration fostered by the nautical school of <!--del_lnk--> Henry the Navigator.<p>Da Gama&#39;s voyage was successful in establishing a sea route from Europe to India that would permit trade with the <!--del_lnk--> Far East, without the use of the costly and unsafe <!--del_lnk--> Silk Road <!--del_lnk--> caravan routes, of the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Central Asia. However, the voyage was also hampered by its failure to bring any trade goods of interest to the nations of <!--del_lnk--> Asia Minor and India. The route was fraught with peril: only 54 of his 170 voyagers, and two of four ships, returned to Portugal in 1499. Nevertheless, da Gama&#39;s initial journey led directly to a several-hundred year era of European domination through sea power and commerce, and 450 years of Portuguese <!--del_lnk--> colonialism in India that brought wealth and power to the Portuguese throne.<p><a id="Exploration_before_da_Gama" name="Exploration_before_da_Gama"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Exploration before da Gama</span></h2>
      <p>From the early 15th century, the nautical school of <!--del_lnk--> Henry the Navigator had been extending Portuguese knowledge of the African coastline. From the 1460s, the goal had become one of rounding that continent&#39;s southern extremity to gain easier access to the riches of India (mainly black pepper and other spices) through a reliable sea route.<p>By the time da Gama was 10 years old, these long-term plans were coming to fruition. Bartolomeu Dias had returned from rounding the Cape of Good Hope, having explored as far as the <!--del_lnk--> Fish River (<i>Rio do Infante</i>) in modern-day <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, and verified that the unknown coast stretched away to the northeast.<p>Concurrent land exploration during the reign of <!--del_lnk--> Jo&atilde;o II of Portugal supported the theory that India was reachable by sea from the Atlantic Ocean. <!--del_lnk--> P&ecirc;ro da Covilh&atilde; and <!--del_lnk--> Afonso de Paiva were sent via <a href="../../wp/b/Barcelona.htm" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Naples, and <!--del_lnk--> Rhodes, into <!--del_lnk--> Alexandria, and from there to <!--del_lnk--> Aden, <!--del_lnk--> Hormuz, and India, which gave credence to the theory.<p>It remained for an explorer to prove the link between the findings of Dias and those of da Covilh&atilde; and de Paiva, and to connect these separate segments of a potentially lucrative trade route into the Indian Ocean. The task, originally given to Da Gama&#39;s father, was offered to Vasco by <!--del_lnk--> Manuel I on the strength of his record of protecting Portuguese trading stations along the African <!--del_lnk--> Gold Coast from depredations by the French.<p><a id="First_voyage" name="First_voyage"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">First voyage</span></h2>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> 8 July <!--del_lnk--> 1497 the fleet, consisting of four ships, left <a href="../../wp/l/Lisbon.htm" title="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>. Its ships were:<ul>
       <li>The <i>S&atilde;o Gabriel</i>, commanded by Vasco da Gama; a <!--del_lnk--> carrack of 178 tons, length 27 m , width 8.5 m, <!--del_lnk--> draft 2.3 m, sails of 372 <!--del_lnk--> m&sup2;, 150 crew<li>The <i>S&atilde;o Rafael</i>, whose commander was his brother <!--del_lnk--> Paulo da Gama; similar dimensions to the <i>S&atilde;o Gabriel</i><li>The <!--del_lnk--> caravel <i>Berrio</i>, slightly smaller than the former two (later re-baptized S&atilde;o Miguel), commanded by Nicolau Coelho.<li>A storage ship of unknown name, commanded by Gon&ccedil;alo Nunes, later lost near the Bay of S&atilde;o Br&aacute;s, along the east coast of Africa.</ul>

      <p>By <!--del_lnk--> December 16, the fleet had passed the <!--del_lnk--> White River, South Africa where Dias had turned back, and continued on into waters unknown to Europeans. With Christmas pending, they gave the coast they were passing the name <!--del_lnk--> Natal (Christmas in <a href="../../wp/p/Portuguese_language.htm" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a>),<p><!--del_lnk--> Arab-controlled territory on the East African coast that was part of the Indian Ocean&#39;s network of trade. Fearing the local population would be hostile to Christians, da Gama impersonated a Muslim and gained audience with the Sultan of Mozambique. With the paltry trade goods he had to offer, da Gama was unable to provide a suitable gift to the ruler, and soon the local populace began to see through the <!--del_lnk--> subterfuge of da Gama and his men. Forced to quit Mozambique by a hostile crowd, da Gama departed the harbour, firing his cannon into the city in retaliation .<p><a id="Mombasa" name="Mombasa"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Mombasa</span></h3>
      <p>In the vicinity of modern <a href="../../wp/k/Kenya.htm" title="Kenya">Kenya</a>, the expedition resorted to <!--del_lnk--> piracy, looting Arab merchant ships - generally unarmed trading vessels without heavy cannon. The Portuguese became the first known Europeans to visit the port of <!--del_lnk--> Mombasa, but were met with hostility, and soon departed.<p><a id="Malindi" name="Malindi"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Malindi</span></h3>
      <p>Da Gama continued north, landing at the friendlier port of <!--del_lnk--> Malindi, whose leaders were in conflict with those of Mombasa; and there the expedition first noted evidence of Indian traders. They contracted the services of <!--del_lnk--> Ibn Majid, an <!--del_lnk--> Arab <!--del_lnk--> navigator and <!--del_lnk--> cartographer, whose knowledge of the <!--del_lnk--> monsoon winds allowed him to bring the expedition the rest of the way to <!--del_lnk--> Calicut (modern Kozhikode) on the southwest coast of India.<p><a id="India" name="India"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">India</span></h3>
      <p>They arrived in India on <!--del_lnk--> 20 May <!--del_lnk--> 1498. Sometimes violent negotiations with the local ruler (usually anglicized as <i><!--del_lnk--> Zamorin</i>), the <i>Wyatt Enourato</i> ensued, in the teeth of resistance from Arab merchants. Eventually da Gama was able to gain an ambiguous letter of concession for trading rights, but had to sail off without warning after the Zamorin insisted da Gama leave all his goods as <!--del_lnk--> collateral. Da Gama kept his goods, but left a few Portuguese with orders to start a trading post<p><a id="Return" name="Return"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Return</span></h3>

      <p>Paulo da Gama died in the Azores on the homeward voyage, but on Vasco da Gama&#39;s return to Portugal in September 1499, he was richly rewarded as the man who had brought to fruition a plan that had taken eighty years. He was given the title &quot;Admiral of the Indian Ocean&quot;, and the feudal rights over Sines were confirmed. He also was awarded the title <i>Dom</i> (<!--del_lnk--> count) by Manuel I.<p>Da Gama&#39;s voyage had made it clear that the farther (East) coast of Africa, the <i>Contra Costa</i>, was essential to Portuguese interests: its ports provided fresh water and provisions, timber and harbors for repairs, and a region to wait out unfavorable seasons. Also the spice commodity would prove to be a major contribution to the Portuguese economy.<p><a id="Second_voyage" name="Second_voyage"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Second voyage</span></h2>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> 12 February <!--del_lnk--> 1502, da Gama again sailed with a fleet of twenty <!--del_lnk--> warships, to enforce Portuguese interests. <!--del_lnk--> Pedro &Aacute;lvares Cabral had been sent to India two years earlier (when he accidentally discovered <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, though some claim it was intentional), and finding that those at the trading post had been murdered, and encountering further resistance, he had bombarded <!--del_lnk--> Calicut. He also brought back silk and gold to prove he had been to India once again.<p>At one point, da Gama waited for a ship to return from <a href="../../wp/m/Mecca.htm" title="Mecca">Mecca</a>, and seized all the merchandise; they then locked the 380 passengers in the hold and set the ship on fire. It took four days for the ship to sink, killing all men, women, and children, when da Gama returned to Calicut on October 30, 1502 the Zamorin was willing to sign a treaty..<p>Da Gama assaulted and exacted tribute from the Arab-controlled port of <!--del_lnk--> Kilwa in East Africa, one of those ports involved in frustrating the Portuguese; he played <!--del_lnk--> privateer amongst Arab merchant ships, then finally smashed a Calicut fleet of twenty-nine ships, and essentially conquered that port city. In return for peace, he received valuable trade concessions and a vast quantity of plunder, putting him in extremely good favour with the Portuguese crown.<p>On his return to Portugal, in September 1503, he was made Count of <!--del_lnk--> Vidigueira out of lands previously belonging to the future royal <!--del_lnk--> Bragan&ccedil;a family. He was also awarded feudal rights and jurisdiction over <!--del_lnk--> Vidigueira and Vila dos Frades.<p><a id="Third_voyage" name="Third_voyage"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Third voyage</span></h2>

      <p>Having acquired a fearsome reputation as a &quot;fixer&quot; of problems that arose in India, he was sent to the subcontinent once more in 1524. The intention was that he was to replace the incompetent <!--del_lnk--> Eduardo de Menezes as viceroy (representative) of the Portuguese possessions, but he contracted malaria not long after arriving in Goa and died in the city of Cochin on Christmas Eve in 1524. His body was first buried at St. Francis Church, Fort Kochi, <a href="../../wp/k/Kochi_%2528India%2529.htm" title="Kochi (India)">Kochi</a>, then later his remains were returned to Portugal in 1539 and re-interred in Vidigueira in a splendid tomb. The <!--del_lnk--> Monastery of the Hieronymites in <!--del_lnk--> Bel&eacute;m was erected in honour of his voyage to India.<p><a id="Legacy" name="Legacy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Legacy</span></h2>
