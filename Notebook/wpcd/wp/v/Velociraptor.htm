      <p><i><b>Velociraptor</b></i> (meaning &quot;swift thief&quot;) is a <!--del_lnk--> genus of <!--del_lnk--> dromaeosaurid <a href="../../wp/t/Theropoda.htm" title="Theropoda">theropod</a> <a href="../../wp/d/Dinosaur.htm" title="Dinosaur">dinosaur</a> that existed approximately 83 to 70 <!--del_lnk--> million years ago during the later part of the <a href="../../wp/c/Cretaceous.htm" title="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> <!--del_lnk--> Period. There is only one universally recognized <!--del_lnk--> species, <i>V. mongoliensis</i>, although others have been attributed in the past. <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil.htm" title="Fossil">Fossils</a> of this species have been found in <!--del_lnk--> central Asia, from both <!--del_lnk--> Inner and <a href="../../wp/m/Mongolia.htm" title="Mongolia">Outer Mongolia</a>.<p>Smaller than other dromaeosaurids like <i><a href="../../wp/d/Deinonychus.htm" title="Deinonychus">Deinonychus</a></i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Achillobator</i>, the <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey_%2528bird%2529.htm" title="Turkey (bird)">turkey</a>-sized <i>Velociraptor</i> nevertheless shared many of the same <a href="../../wp/a/Anatomy.htm" title="Anatomy">anatomical</a> features. It was a <!--del_lnk--> bipedal <a href="../../wp/c/Carnivore.htm" title="Carnivore">carnivore</a> with a long, stiffened tail and had an enlarged, sickle-shaped <!--del_lnk--> claw on each hindfoot, which is thought to have been used to kill its <!--del_lnk--> prey. <i>Velociraptor</i> can be distinguished from other dromaeosaurids by its long and low <!--del_lnk--> skull, with an upturned snout.<p>Due in large part to its prominent role in <!--del_lnk--> Michael Crichton&#39;s novel <i><!--del_lnk--> Jurassic Park</i> and the subsequent <!--del_lnk--> motion picture series, <i>Velociraptor</i> (commonly shortened to &#39;raptor&#39;) is one of the dinosaur genera most familiar to the general public.

      <p><i>Velociraptor</i> was small for a dromaeosaurid, with adults measuring up to 1.798&nbsp;meters (5.9&nbsp;ft) long, 0.62&nbsp;meters (2&nbsp;ft) high at the hip, and weighing 20&nbsp;kilograms (45&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> lb). The skull, which grew up to 249&nbsp;millimeters (9.80&nbsp;in) long, was uniquely up-curved, with a concave upper surface and convex lower. The jaws were lined with 26&ndash;28 widely-spaced teeth on each side, each more strongly serrated on the back edge than the front &mdash; possibly an adaptation that improved its ability to catch and hold fast-moving prey.<p><i>Velociraptor</i>, like other dromaeosaurids, had three strongly-curved claws on each forelimb and large &#39;hands&#39;, which were similar in construction and flexibility to the wing bones of modern <a href="../../wp/b/Bird.htm" title="Bird">birds</a>. Of the three digits present, the first was shortest and the second longest. The structure of the <!--del_lnk--> carpal bones prevented <!--del_lnk--> pronation of the wrist and forced the &#39;hands&#39; to be held with the <!--del_lnk--> palmar surface facing inwards (medially), not downwards. Unlike most theropod dinosaurs, which had three functional toes on the hindlimb, dromaeosaurids like <i>Velociraptor</i> walked on only their third and fourth digits. The first digit, as in other theropods, was a small <!--del_lnk--> dewclaw. The second digit, for which <i>Velociraptor</i> is most famous, was highly modified and held retracted off of the ground. It bore a relatively large, sickle-shaped claw, typical of dromaeosaurid and <!--del_lnk--> troodontid dinosaurs. This enlarged claw, up to 67&nbsp;millimeters (2.6&nbsp;in) long around its outer edge, was most likely a predatory device, used to tear into the prey, possibly delivering a fatal blow.<p>The tail of <i>Velociraptor</i> was stiffened, both by long bony projections (<i>prezygapophyses</i>) from the upper surfaces of the <!--del_lnk--> vertebrae and by <!--del_lnk--> ossified <!--del_lnk--> tendons underneath. The prezygapophyses began on the tenth tail (caudal) vertebra and extended forward to brace four to ten additional vertebrae, depending on position in the tail. The stiffening forced the entire tail to act as a single rod-like unit, preventing <!--del_lnk--> vertical motion between vertebrae. However, at least one specimen preserves a series of intact tail vertebrae in an <i>S</i>-shaped curve, suggesting that there was considerably more <!--del_lnk--> horizontal flexibility. These adaptations of the tail probably provided balance and stability while turning, especially at high speeds.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p>An <!--del_lnk--> American Museum of Natural History expedition to the <a href="../../wp/m/Mongolia.htm" title="Mongolia">Mongolian</a> <!--del_lnk--> Gobi desert in 1922 recovered the first <i>Velociraptor</i> fossil known to science: a crushed but complete skull, associated with one of the raptorial second toe claws. Two years later, museum president <!--del_lnk--> Henry Fairfield Osborn mentioned the animal in a popular press article, under the name &quot;Ovoraptor djadochtari&quot; (not to be confused with the similarly named <i><a href="../../wp/o/Oviraptor.htm" title="Oviraptor">Oviraptor</a></i>). However, because the name &quot;Ovoraptor&quot; was not published in a scientific journal or accompanied by a formal description, it remained a <i><!--del_lnk--> nomen nudum</i> (&quot;naked name&quot;), and the name <i>Velociraptor</i> retains priority. Later that year, Osborn designated the skull and claw (which he assumed came from the hand) as the <!--del_lnk--> type specimen of his new genus, <i>Velociraptor</i>. This name is derived from the <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> words <i>velox</i> (meaning &#39;swift&#39;) and <i>raptor</i> (meaning &#39;robber&#39; or &#39;plunderer&#39;) and refers to the animal&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> cursorial nature and <a href="../../wp/c/Carnivore.htm" title="Carnivore">carnivorous</a> diet. Osborn named the type species <i>V. mongoliensis</i> after its country of origin.<p>While North American teams were shut out of Mongolia, during the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>, expeditions by <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Polish</a> scientists, in collaboration with Mongolian colleagues, recovered several more specimens of <i>Velociraptor</i>. The most famous is part of the legendary &quot;Fighting Dinosaurs&quot; specimen, discovered by a Polish-Mongolian team in 1971. This fossil preserves a single <i>Velociraptor</i> in the midst of battle against a lone <i>Protoceratops</i>.<p>Between 1988 and 1990, a joint <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">Chinese</a>-<a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canadian</a> team discovered <i>Velociraptor</i> remains in northern China; joint Mongolian-American expeditions to the Gobi, led by the American Museum of Natural History and the <!--del_lnk--> Mongolian Academy of Sciences, turned up several well-preserved skeletons between 1990 and 1995.<p><a id="Provenance" name="Provenance"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Provenance</span></h2>
      <p>All known specimens of <i>Velociraptor mongoliensis</i> were discovered in the <!--del_lnk--> Djadochta Formation of the Mongolian province of <!--del_lnk--> &Ouml;mn&ouml;govi, or of Chinese Inner Mongolia. A species of <i>Velociraptor</i>, possibly <i>V. mongoliensis</i>, is also preserved in the slightly younger <!--del_lnk--> Barun Goyot Formation of Mongolia. These <!--del_lnk--> geologic formations are estimated to date back to the <!--del_lnk--> Campanian <!--del_lnk--> stage (about 83 to 70 million years ago) of the <!--del_lnk--> Late Cretaceous <!--del_lnk--> Epoch.<p><i>V. mongoliensis</i> has been found at many of the most famous Djadochta localities. The type specimen was discovered at the <!--del_lnk--> Flaming Cliffs site (also known as Bayn Dzak and Shabarakh Usu), while the &quot;Fighting Dinosaurs&quot; were found at the Tugrig locality (also known as Tugrugeen Shireh). More recently, fossils of <i>V. mongoliensis</i> were recovered from Bayan Mandahu, a prolific site from the Djadochta of Inner Mongolia in China. A dromaeosaurid skull, currently known only as <b>IGM 100/1015</b>, was recovered from the site called Ukhaa Tolgod and may represent a new species of <i>Velociraptor</i>, but is not <i>V. mongoliensis</i>. The well-known Barun Goyot localities of Khulsan and Khermeen Tsav have also produced remains which may also belong to the genus <i>Velociraptor</i>.<p>All of these sites preserve an arid environment with fields of sand <a href="../../wp/d/Dune.htm" title="Dune">dunes</a> and only intermittent <!--del_lnk--> streams, although the younger Barun Goyot environment seems to have been slightly wetter than the older Djadochta. Aside from <i>Protoceratops</i>, upon which it preyed, <i>Velociraptor</i> shared its environment with other <!--del_lnk--> basal <!--del_lnk--> ceratopsians, like <i><!--del_lnk--> Udanoceratops</i> and <!--del_lnk--> ankylosaurids, like <i><!--del_lnk--> Pinacosaurus</i>, along with several species of <!--del_lnk--> oviraptorid, <!--del_lnk--> troodontid, and <!--del_lnk--> alvarezsaurid theropods.<p><a id="Taxonomy" name="Taxonomy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Taxonomy</span></h2>
      <p><i>Velociraptor</i> is a member of the subfamily Velociraptorinae, a <!--del_lnk--> derived sub-group of the larger family Dromaeosauridae. In <!--del_lnk--> phylogenetic taxonomy, Velociraptorinae is usually defined as &quot;all dromaeosaurs more closely related to <i>Velociraptor</i> than to <i><!--del_lnk--> Dromaeosaurus</i>.&quot; Dromaeosaurid classification is highly variable. Originally, the subfamily Velociraptorinae was erected solely to contain <i>Velociraptor</i>. Other analyses have included other genera, usually <i>Deinonychus</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Saurornitholestes</i>. A recent <!--del_lnk--> cladistic analysis indicated that this subfamily may only contain <i>Deinonychus</i> and the specimen IGM 100/1015, which may be a species of <i>Velociraptor</i>.<div class="thumb tright">

      </div>
      <p>In the past, other dromaeosaurid genera, including <i>Deinonychus</i> and <i>Saurornitholestes</i>, have sometimes been classified with <i>Velociraptor</i> within a single genus. Since <i>Velociraptor</i> was the first to be named, the species <i>Deinonychus antirrhopus</i> and <i>Saurornitholestes langstoni</i> were sunk into <i>Velociraptor</i>, as <i>V. antirrhopus</i> and <i>V. langstoni</i>. However, the only currently recognized species of <i>Velociraptor</i> is <i>V. mongoliensis</i>.<p>When first described in 1924, <i>Velociraptor</i> was placed in the family <!--del_lnk--> Megalosauridae, as was the case with most carnivorous dinosaurs at the time (Megalosauridae, like <i><!--del_lnk--> Megalosaurus</i>, functioned as a sort of &#39;wastebin&#39; taxon, where many unrelated species were grouped together). As dinosaur discoveries multiplied, <i>Velociraptor</i> was later recognized as a dromaeosaurid. All dromaeosaurids have also been referred to the family <!--del_lnk--> Archaeopterygidae by at least one author (which would, in effect, make <i>Velociraptor</i> a flightless bird).<p>Whether <i>Velociraptor</i> was a bird or a dinosaur depends on the definition being used. Phylogenetically, all members of the clade <!--del_lnk--> Aves are dinosaurs. However, in <!--del_lnk--> Linnean taxonomy and common terminology, a &quot;bird&quot; is not just a member of Aves but any animal with feathers. Under the latter definition, <i>Velociraptor</i> and all <!--del_lnk--> maniraptoran dinosaurs are actually birds, since feather-bearing animals are known from every maniraptoran group. Recently, fossils of dromaeosaurids more primitive than <i>Velociraptor</i> have been found in <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, with <a href="../../wp/f/Feather.htm" title="Feather">feathers</a> covering their bodies and fully-developed, feathered wings. In light of this, it is most likely that <i>Velociraptor</i> bore feathers too, since even flightless birds today retain most of their feathers. While there is, as yet, no fossil evidence to confirm that <i>Velociraptor</i> had feathers, there is no reason to suspect it of being an exception.<p>It has been recently suggested that <i>Velociraptor</i> and other dromaeosaurids were true birds, both under the phylogenetic definition and under the common usage of the word. <!--del_lnk--> Basal dromaeosaurids, such as <i><a href="../../wp/m/Microraptor.htm" title="Microraptor">Microraptor</a></i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Rahonavis</i>, have been found to have had even more bird-like characters than derived forms like <i>Velociraptor</i>, some even having flight capability - possibly indicating that <i>Velociraptor</i> was secondarily flightless, like an <a href="../../wp/o/Ostrich.htm" title="Ostrich">ostrich</a>. The discovery, in 2005, of the <!--del_lnk--> Thermopolis specimen of <i><a href="../../wp/a/Archaeopteryx.htm" title="Archaeopteryx">Archaeopteryx</a></i>, which preserves a dromaeosaurid-like hyperextendible second toe, may mean that <i>Archaeopteryx</i> itself is more basal than <i>Velociraptor</i>. If this is true, then all dromaeosaurids must be considered true birds and members of Aves by definition, as Aves is defined to include <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, all living birds and all descendents of their most common ancestor.<p><a id="Paleobiology" name="Paleobiology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Paleobiology</span></h2>

      <p>The &quot;Fighting Dinosaurs&quot; specimen, found in 1971, preserves a <i>Velociraptor</i> and <i><a href="../../wp/p/Protoceratops.htm" title="Protoceratops">Protoceratops</a></i> in combat and provides direct evidence of predatory behaviour. When originally reported, it was hypothesized that the two animals drowned. However, taking into account the fact that the animals were preserved in ancient sand dune deposits, it is now thought that the animals were buried in sand, either from a collapsing dune or while trapped in a <!--del_lnk--> sandstorm. Burial must have been extremely fast, judging from the lifelike poses in which the animals were preserved. Both forelimbs and one hindlimb of the <i>Protoceratops</i> are missing, which has been seen as evidence of <!--del_lnk--> scavenging by other animals.<p>The distinctive claw, on the second digit of dromaeosaurids, has traditionally been depicted as a slashing weapon; its assumed use being to cut and <!--del_lnk--> disembowel prey. In the &quot;Fighting Dinosaurs&quot; specimen, the <i>Velociraptor</i> lies underneath, with one of its sickle claws apparently embedded in the throat of its prey, while the beak of <i>Protoceratops</i> is clamped down upon the right forelimb of its attacker. This suggests <i>Velociraptor</i> may have used its sickle claw for precision killing by piercing vital organs such as the <!--del_lnk--> jugular vein, <!--del_lnk--> carotid artery, or <!--del_lnk--> trachea (windpipe) rather than slashing the abdomen. The inside edge of the claw was rounded and not at all sharp, which may have precluded any sort of cutting or slashing action, although only the bony core of the claw is known, so the <!--del_lnk--> keratin sheath may have had a sharper edge. However, it is unlikely that any sharp edge could be maintained, as the claw was not retractable for its protection, nor could it easily be sharpened by scraping against other objects, as seen in <a href="../../wp/c/Cat.htm" title="Cat">cats</a>. The thick abdominal wall of <!--del_lnk--> skin and <!--del_lnk--> muscle would have been difficult to slash with such a dull cutting surface. The slashing <!--del_lnk--> hypothesis was tested during a 2005 <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a> documentary, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Truth About Killer Dinosaurs</i>. The producers of the program created an artificial <i>Velociraptor</i> leg with a sickle claw and used a <!--del_lnk--> pork belly to simulate the dinosaur&#39;s prey. The sickle claw did not fully penetrate the abdominal wall, indicating that the claw was not used to disembowel prey.<p>Remains of <i>Deinonychus</i>, a closely related dromaeosaurid, have commonly been found in aggregations of several individuals. <i>Deinonychus</i> is also occasionally found in association with a larger herbivore, <i><!--del_lnk--> Tenontosaurus</i>, which has been seen as evidence of cooperative hunting. However, although many fossils of <i>Velociraptor</i> and other dromaeosaurids have been found in Mongolia, all have been isolated specimens not closely associated with any others. Therefore, while <i>Velociraptor</i> is commonly depicted as a pack hunter, as in the movie <i><!--del_lnk--> Jurassic Park</i>, no fossil evidence currently supports this theory.<p><a id="Metabolism" name="Metabolism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Metabolism</span></h3>
      <p><i>Velociraptor</i> was probably warm-blooded to some degree, as it required a significant amount of energy to hunt. Modern animals that possess feathery or furry coats, like <i>Velociraptor</i> likely did, tend to be warm-blooded, since these coverings function as insulation. However, bone growth rates in dromaeosaurids and some early birds suggest a more moderate metabolism, compared with most modern warm-blooded mammals and birds. The <!--del_lnk--> kiwi is similar to dromaeosaurids in anatomy, feather type, bone structure and even the narrow anatomy of the nasal passages (usually a key indicator of metabolism). The kiwi is a highly active, if specialized, flightless bird, with a stable body temperature and a fairly low resting metabolic rate, making it a good model for the metabolism of primitive birds and dromaeosaurids.<p><a id="In_popular_culture" name="In_popular_culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">In popular culture</span></h2>
      <p><i>Velociraptor</i> is well-known in its role as a vicious and cunning killer, from the 1990 novel <i><!--del_lnk--> Jurassic Park</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Michael Crichton, and its 1993 <!--del_lnk--> film adaptation, directed by <!--del_lnk--> Steven Spielberg. The &quot;raptors&quot; portrayed in <i>Jurassic Park</i> were modelled after a slightly larger relative, <i><a href="../../wp/d/Deinonychus.htm" title="Deinonychus">Deinonychus</a></i>, which some scientists at the time called <i>Velociraptor antirrhopus</i>. The paleontologists in the film and the novel excavate a <i>Velociraptor</i> skeleton in <!--del_lnk--> Montana, where <i>Deinonychus</i> fossils would be found, far from the central Asian range of <i>Velociraptor</i>. A character in Crichton&#39;s novel also states that &quot;...<i>Deinonychus</i> is now considered one of the velociraptors&quot;, indicating that Crichton used this <!--del_lnk--> taxonomy, though the &quot;raptors&quot; in the novel are referred to as <i>V. mongoliensis</i>.<p>The <i>Velociraptor</i> depicted in the <i>Jurassic Park</i> films were scientifically inaccurate in numerous ways. One major discrepancy, possibly explained by the fact that <i>Deinonychus</i> was used as a model, is that the size of the <i>Velociraptor</i> in the film was much greater than their diminutive real-world counterparts. The size of the film&#39;s <i>Velociraptor</i> may also have been increased for dramatic reasons by director <!--del_lnk--> Steven Spielberg. The film versions of <i>Velociraptor</i> were also covered in <!--del_lnk--> scales. No evidence of body scales has been reported for any maniraptoran dinosaur and it is more likely that they were covered in feathers, though no direct fossil evidence of <!--del_lnk--> integument of any kind exists for <i>Velociraptor</i> itself. <i><!--del_lnk--> Jurassic Park III</i> does depict a type of feathers on its <i>Velociraptor</i>, quill-like structures along the back of the head and neck, although these do not resemble the down-like feathers known from real-life dromaeosaurids. Additionally, the forelimbs of the film animals did not closely resemble those of real dromaeosaurids and their tails were too short and flexible, anatomical errors which directly contradict fossil evidence. In the sequel film <i>Jurassic Park III</i>, one character states that <i>Velociraptor</i> were smarter than dolphins, whales and primates. Based on fossil evidence, this is highly unlikely, and it is more probable that, while intelligent by dinosaur standards, they were less intelligent than modern big cats.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Since the success of <i>Jurassic Park</i>, <i>Velociraptor</i> has become a ubiquitous representation of dinosaurs in popular culture. It has appeared in several other films and television programs, including several of <i><!--del_lnk--> The Land Before Time</i> animated films and a <!--del_lnk--> spin-off of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Transformers</i> television series, <i><!--del_lnk--> Beast Wars</i>. <i>Velociraptor</i> was also featured in three documentary programs, <!--del_lnk--> The Discovery Channel&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Dinosaur Planet</i>, most notably a female trying to locate a pack, a special of the BBC&#39;s <i>Walking With...</i> series (&quot;<!--del_lnk--> The Giant Claw&quot;), attacking a <i><a href="../../wp/p/Protoceratops.htm" title="Protoceratops">Protoceratops</a></i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Truth About Killer Dinosaurs</i>, another BBC production which featured <i>Velociraptor</i> in an animated fight with an <i><a href="../../wp/a/Ankylosaurus.htm" title="Ankylosaurus">Ankylosaurus</a></i>.<p><i>Velociraptor</i> has also appeared in the realms of music and sport. For example, the <!--del_lnk--> Toronto Raptors, an <!--del_lnk--> NBA franchise, adopted a stylised <i>Velociraptor</i> as their logo, while the band <!--del_lnk--> Norma Jean named their 2005 tour the &quot;Velociraptour&quot;. There is also a robotic toy based on <i>Velociraptor</i>, called <!--del_lnk--> Roboraptor. Aside from <!--del_lnk--> titles based on <i>Jurassic Park</i>, <i>Velociraptor</i> has also been featured in other <!--del_lnk--> video games, including the <i><!--del_lnk--> Dino Crisis</i> series, <i><!--del_lnk--> Carnivores</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> World of Warcraft</i>.<ul>
