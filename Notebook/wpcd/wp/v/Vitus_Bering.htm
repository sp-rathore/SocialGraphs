      <p><b>Vitus Jonassen Bering</b> (also, less correctly, <i>Behring</i>) (<!--del_lnk--> August 1681&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> December 19, <!--del_lnk--> 1741) was a <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Danish</a>-born navigator in the service of the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Navy, a captain-<i>komandor</i> known among the Russian sailors as <b>Ivan Ivanovich</b>. He was born in the town of <!--del_lnk--> Horsens in <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> and died at <!--del_lnk--> Bering Island, near the <!--del_lnk--> Kamchatka Peninsula.<p>After a voyage to the East Indies, he joined the Russian Navy in <!--del_lnk--> 1703, serving in the <a href="../../wp/b/Baltic_Sea.htm" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic</a> <!--del_lnk--> Fleet during the <!--del_lnk--> Great Northern War. In <!--del_lnk--> 1710&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 1712 he served in the <!--del_lnk--> Azov Sea Fleet in <!--del_lnk--> Taganrog and took part in the <!--del_lnk--> Russo-Turkish War. He married a <!--del_lnk--> Russian woman, and in <!--del_lnk--> 1715 he made a brief visit to his hometown, never to see it again. A series of explorations of the north coast of <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a>, the outcome of a far-reaching plan devised by <a href="../../wp/p/Peter_I_of_Russia.htm" title="Peter I of Russia">Peter the Great</a>, led up to Bering&#39;s first voyage to Kamchatka. In <!--del_lnk--> 1725, under the auspices of the Russian government, he went overland to <!--del_lnk--> Okhotsk, crossed to Kamchatka, and built the ship <i>Sviatoi Gavriil</i> (<i><!--del_lnk--> St. Gabriel</i>). Aboard the ship, Bering pushed northward in <!--del_lnk--> 1728, until he could no longer observe any extension of the land to the north, or its appearance to the east.<p>In the following year he made an abortive search for mainland eastward, rediscovering one of the <!--del_lnk--> Diomede Islands (<!--del_lnk--> Ratmanov Island) observed earlier by <!--del_lnk--> Dezhnev. In the summer of <!--del_lnk--> 1730, Bering returned to <!--del_lnk--> St. Petersburg. During the long trip through <!--del_lnk--> Siberia along the whole <!--del_lnk--> Asian continent, he became very ill. Five of his children died during this trip. Bering was subsequently commissioned to a further expedition, and returned to Okhotsk in <!--del_lnk--> 1735. He had the local craftsmen Makar Rogachev and Andrey Kozmin build two vessels, <i>Sviatoi Piotr</i> (<i><!--del_lnk--> St. Peter</i>) and <i>Sviatoi Pavel</i> (<i><a href="../../wp/p/Paul_of_Tarsus.htm" title="Paul of Tarsus">St. Paul</a></i>), in which he sailed off and in <!--del_lnk--> 1740 established the settlement of <!--del_lnk--> Petropavlovsk in Kamchatka. From there, he led an expedition towards <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1741. A storm separated the ships, but Bering sighted the southern coast of <!--del_lnk--> Alaska, and a landing was made at <!--del_lnk--> Kayak Island or in the vicinity. Under the command of <!--del_lnk--> Aleksei Chirikov, the second ship discovered the shores of the northwestern America (<!--del_lnk--> Aleksander Archipelago of present-day Alaska). These voyages of Bering and Chirikov were a major part of the Russian exploration efforts in the North Pacific known today as the <!--del_lnk--> Great Northern Expedition.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Bering was soon forced by adverse conditions to return, and he discovered some of the <!--del_lnk--> Aleutian Islands on his way back. One of the sailors died and was buried on one of these islands, and the group was named after him (as the <!--del_lnk--> Shumagin Islands). Bering became too ill to command his ship, which was at last driven to refuge on an uninhabited island in the <!--del_lnk--> Commander Islands group (<i>Komandorskiye Ostrova</i>) in the southwest <!--del_lnk--> Bering Sea. On 19 December 1741 Vitus Bering died here of <a href="../../wp/s/Scurvy.htm" title="Scurvy">scurvy</a>, along with 28 men of his company. This island bears his name. A storm shipwrecked <i>Sv. Piotr</i>, but the only surviving carpenter, S. Starodubtsev, with the help of the crew managed to build a smaller vessel out of the wreckage. The new vessel had a keel length of only 12.2 meters (40 feet) and was also named <i>Sv. Piotr</i>. Out of 77 men aboard <i>Sv. Piotr</i>, only 46 survived the hardships of the expedition which claimed its last victim just one day before coming into home port. <i>Sv. Piotr</i> was in service for 12 years, sailing between Kamchatka and Okhotsk until <!--del_lnk--> 1755. Its builder, Starodubtsev, returned home with governmental awards and later built several other seaworthy ships.<p>The value of Bering&#39;s work was not fully recognized for many years, but <a href="../../wp/j/James_Cook.htm" title="James Cook">Captain Cook</a> was able to prove Bering&#39;s accuracy as an observer. Nowadays, the <!--del_lnk--> Bering Strait, the <!--del_lnk--> Bering Sea, <!--del_lnk--> Bering Island, and the <!--del_lnk--> Bering Land Bridge bear the explorer&#39;s name.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitus_Bering&quot;</div>
