      <p>The <b>1896 Summer Olympics</b>, officially known as the <b>Games of the I Olympiad</b>, were held in <!--del_lnk--> 1896 in <a href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Athens">Athens</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greece</a>. These games were the first modern <a href="../../wp/o/Olympic_Games.htm" title="Olympic Games">Olympic Games</a> and the first Games since <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman emperor</a> <!--del_lnk--> Theodosius I banned the <!--del_lnk--> Ancient Olympic Games in <!--del_lnk--> 393 as part of the <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christian</a> campaign against <!--del_lnk--> paganism. They were held between Monday, <!--del_lnk--> April 6 and Wednesday, <!--del_lnk--> April 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1896.<p>An 1894 congress organized by <!--del_lnk--> Pierre de Coubertin in <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a> established the <!--del_lnk--> International Olympic Committee and appointed the <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greek</a> capital of <a href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Athens">Athens</a> as the host city. The Greeks had little experience with organizing sports events, and initially had financial troubles as well, but managed to have everything ready in time.<p>Although the number of participating athletes was low by current standards, it had the largest international participation for any sports event to that date. In spite of the absence of many of the time&#39;s top athletes, the Games were a success with the Greek public. The athletic highlight for the Greeks was the <!--del_lnk--> marathon victory by their compatriot <!--del_lnk--> Spiridon Louis. The most successful competitor in terms of victories was <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">German</a> <!--del_lnk--> wrestler and <!--del_lnk--> gymnast <!--del_lnk--> Carl Schuhmann.<p>After the Games, De Coubertin and the IOC were petitioned by, among others, Greece&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> King George and some of the American competitors in Athens to hold all following Games in Athens. However, the <!--del_lnk--> 1900 Summer Olympics were already planned for Paris and, barring the so-called <!--del_lnk--> Intercalated Games of 1906, the Olympics did not return to Greece until the <!--del_lnk--> 2004 Summer Olympics.<p>

      <p>During the 19th century, several minor sports festivals named after the <!--del_lnk--> Ancient Olympic Games were held in a few <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European</a> countries. <!--del_lnk--> Pierre de Coubertin also had the idea to revive the Olympics, but as an international and multi-sport event. He presented his ideas at an 1894 congress held in the <!--del_lnk--> Sorbonne, <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>, with delegates from sports societies of 11 countries present.<p>After it had been decided to revive the Olympics, a host city for these first Olympics had to be selected. De Coubertin&#39;s idea was to hold these concurrently with the <!--del_lnk--> Universal Exposition of 1900 in Paris. Concerned that a six-year waiting period might lessen the interest in the Olympics, the congress decided to hold the first Olympics in 1896. Several congress members suggested <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> as the location, but after a brief talk with Greek delegate <!--del_lnk--> Demetrius Vikelas De Coubertin put <a href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Athens">Athens</a> forward as a possibility. Greece being the original home of the Olympics, the congress unanimously approved the proposal. Vikelas was elected as the first president of the newly established <!--del_lnk--> International Olympic Committee (IOC).<p>The true origin of the modern Olympics was acknowledged by De Coubertin as being in <!--del_lnk--> Much Wenlock, a rural market town in the English county of <!--del_lnk--> Shropshire. It was here that in 1850 the local doctor, William Penny Brooks, founded the Much Wenlock Olympics. The first games were held in October 1850. It was a mixture of events, including athletics and games such as <a href="../../wp/c/Cricket.htm" title="Cricket">cricket</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Football (soccer)">football</a>, quoits, and others.<p><a id="Organization" name="Organization"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Organization</span></h2>

      <p>The news that the Olympic Games would return to Greece was received favourably by the Greek public and media. However, the country was in financial troubles and was politically unstable, the job of <!--del_lnk--> prime minister alternating between <!--del_lnk--> Charilaos Trikoupis and <!--del_lnk--> Theodoros Deligiannis at a high frequency. In late 1894 the organizing committee, headed by <!--del_lnk--> Etienne Skouloudis, presented a report that the cost of the Games would be three times higher than originally estimated by De Coubertin. They concluded the Games could not be held, and offered their resignation.<p>Greek crown prince <!--del_lnk--> Constantine, a supporter of the Games, decided to set up a new committee, with himself as the president. His enthusiasm sparked a wave of contributions from the Greek public, raising 330,000 <!--del_lnk--> drachmas. A special set of postage stamps raised a further 400,000, and ticket sales added 200,000 drachmas. At the request of Constantine, wealthy businessman <!--del_lnk--> George Averoff agreed to pay for the restoration of the <!--del_lnk--> Panathinaiko Stadium, which would eventually cost 920,000 drachmas. As a tribute to his generosity, a statue of Averoff was constructed and unveiled on <!--del_lnk--> 5 April outside of the stadium, where it still stands.<p>Organized sports were relatively new to Greece, and as such the organizing committee had little experience in staging sports events. Their duties in this aspect were largely taken over by De Coubertin, who had to both elect the rules to follow and to invite athletes. Some of the athletes would take part in the Games because they happened to be in Athens at the time the Games were held, either on vacation or for work (e.g., some of the British competitors worked for the British <!--del_lnk--> embassy). The concept of a designated <!--del_lnk--> Olympic Village for the athletes would not appear until the <!--del_lnk--> 1932 Summer Olympics; the athletes had to care for their own lodging.<p><a id="Calendar" name="Calendar"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Calendar</span></h2>

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> 6 April, the Games of the First Olympiad were officially opened. It was <!--del_lnk--> Easter Monday for the <a href="../../wp/e/Eastern_Orthodox_Church.htm" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Eastern Orthodox</a>, <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Protestant churches, and was also the anniversary of the outbreak of the <a href="../../wp/g/Greek_War_of_Independence.htm" title="Greek War of Independence">war for Greek independence</a>.<p>The Panathenaic stadium was filled, with an estimated 80,000 spectators including King <!--del_lnk--> George I of Greece, his wife <!--del_lnk--> Olga, and their sons. Most of the competing athletes were aligned on the infield, grouped by nation. After a speech by the president of the organizing committee, <!--del_lnk--> Crown Prince Constantine, his father officially opened the Games:<dl>
       <dd><i>&quot;I declare the opening of the first international Olympic Games in Athens. Long live the Nation. Long live the Greek people.&quot;</i></dl>
      <p>Afterwards, 9 bands and 150 choir singers performed the <!--del_lnk--> Olympic Hymn, composed by <!--del_lnk--> Spyros Samaras, with words by poet <!--del_lnk--> Kostis Palamas. The hymn was well received, and the crowd desired an encore.<p>The current Olympic opening ceremonies contain elements of this brief opening ceremony. The head of state of the organizing nation still officially opens the Games, and the Olympic Hymn (official since 1958) is still played. Other elements, such as the parade of nations, the lighting of the <!--del_lnk--> Olympic Flame and the <!--del_lnk--> Olympic Oath were initiated later.<p><a id="Sport_by_sport_overview" name="Sport_by_sport_overview"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sport by sport overview</span></h2>
      <p>At the 1894 Sorbonne congress, a large roster of sports had been mentioned for the programme in Athens. The first edition of the official announcement featured sports such as <a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Football (soccer)">football</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Cricket.htm" title="Cricket">cricket</a>, but these plans were never carried out. <!--del_lnk--> Rowing was scheduled, but had to be cancelled due to strong winds on the planned day of competition. <!--del_lnk--> Yachting was cancelled too, because &quot;we had no proper boats for this, nor did any foreign ones appear for the contest&quot; (Official Report).<p><a id="Athletics" name="Athletics"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Athletics</span></h3>

      <p>The <a href="../../wp/a/Athletics_%2528track_and_field%2529.htm" title="Athletics (track and field)">athletics</a> events had the most international field of any of the sports. The major highlight of the athletics programme, however, was the <!--del_lnk--> marathon held for the first time in international competition. <!--del_lnk--> Spiridon Louis, a previously unrenowned water carrier, won the event to become the only <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greek</a> athletics champion and a national hero. No <!--del_lnk--> world records were set, as few international top competitors had turned up. In addition, the curves of the track were very tight, making fast times in the running events virtually impossible, despite this <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Burke won both the 100m and the 400m for the <!--del_lnk--> USA in times of 12.0 and 54.2 and winning in relative ease.<p><a id="Cycling" name="Cycling"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cycling</span></h3>

      <p>The sport of weightlifting was still very young in 1896, and the rules different from those in use today. Competitions were held outdoors, in the infield of the main stadium, and there were no weight limits.<p>The first event was the two-handed event, held in a style now known as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> clean and jerk&quot;. Two competitors stood out: Scotsman <!--del_lnk--> Launceston Elliot and <!--del_lnk--> Viggo Jensen of Denmark. Both of them lifted the same weight; but the jury, with <!--del_lnk--> Prince George as the chairman, ruled that Jensen had done so in a better style. The British delegation, unfamiliar with this tie-breaking rule, lodged a protest. The lifters were eventually allowed make further attempts, but neither lifter improved, and Jensen was declared the champion.<p>Elliot got his revenge in the single handed &quot;<!--del_lnk--> snatch&quot; event, which was held immediately after the two-handed one. Jensen had been slightly injured in his last two-handed attempt, and was no match for Elliot, who won the competition easily ahead of Jensen. The Greek audience was very charmed by the Scottish victor, whom they considered very attractive.

      <p>No weight classes existed for the wrestling competition, held in the Panathenaic Stadium which meant that there would only be one winner among competitors of all sizes. The rules used were similar to modern <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Roman wrestling, although there was no time limit, and not all leg holds were forbidden (in contrast to current rules).<p>Apart from the two Greek contestants, all competitors had previously been active in other sports. Weightlifting champion <!--del_lnk--> Launceston Elliot faced gymnastics champion <!--del_lnk--> Carl Schuhmann from Germany.

      <p>On the morning of Sunday <!--del_lnk--> 12 April, King George organized a banquet for officials and athletes (even though some competitions were not to be held). During his speech, he made clear that, as far as he was concerned, the Olympic should be held in Athens permanently.<p>The official closing ceremony was held the following Wednesday, being postponed from Tuesday due to rain. Again the royal family attended the ceremony, which was opened by the <!--del_lnk--> national anthem of Greece and an ode composed and cited by <!--del_lnk--> George S. Robertson, a British athlete and scholar.<p>Afterwards, the king awarded prizes to the winners. Unlike today, the winners received silver medals and the second-placed athletes bronze medals. Some winners also received additional prizes, such as Spyridon Louis, who received a cup from <!--del_lnk--> Michel Br&eacute;al, a friend of De Coubertin who had conceived the marathon event. Louis then led the medallists on a lap of honour through the stadium, while the Olympic Hymn was played again. The King then formally closed the Games, saying &quot;I declare the First International Olympic Games terminated.&quot;<p>Like the Greek king, many others supported the idea of holding the next Games in Athens as well; most of the American competitors signed a letter to the Crown Prince expressing this wish. De Coubertin, however, was heavily opposed to this idea, as he envisioned international rotation as one of the cornerstones of the modern Olympics. According to his wish, the next Games were held in <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>, although they would be subdued by the concurrently held <!--del_lnk--> Universal Exposition.<p><a id="Participating_nations" name="Participating_nations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Participating nations</span></h2>

However, the shooter listed by name simply as <!--del_lnk--> Rivabella was also Italian and did compete.<p><a id="Medal_count" name="Medal_count"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Medal count</span></h2>

      <p>Currently, many media sources publish medal counts for the Olympic Games. This was not the case in 1896, but many sources have tallied the 1896 medals to be able to compare the 1896 edition with later Games. These statistics should be used with care, however.<p>It should be noted, first, that no gold medals were awarded at all, and the third place finishers did not receive any prize in Athens. Secondly, national teams as we know now hardly existed. Greece and Hungary had held selection matches, but most other athletes represented their clubs or themselves. Furthermore, not all of the countries listed below did actually exist as of 1896. For example, Australia was not yet independent of the UK, and Hungary and Austria were formally joined together as one nation. Nevertheless, most sources have the countries as listed below.<div class="thumb tright">
