      <p>The mission of the MEU is to provide geographic combatant commanders with a forward-deployed, rapid-response force capable of conducting conventional <!--del_lnk--> amphibious and selected maritime special operations at night or under adverse weather conditions from the sea, by surface and/or by air while under communications and electronics restrictions.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>In April 1983, the <!--del_lnk--> Commandant of the Marine Corps approved the original <!--del_lnk--> Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Headquarters concept, providing for the sourcing of two Marine Amphibious Unit (MAU) headquarters from each Marine Amphibious Brigade headquarters. The Commandant directed the establishment of two additional MAU headquarters in November 1985. As a result, the Headquarters, 15th Marine Amphibious Unit was activated <!--del_lnk--> July 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1987 at Camp Pendleton.<p>The Commandant directed the replacement of the title &quot;Headquarters&quot; with &quot;Command Element&quot; in the titles of the MAGTFs in August of 1987. The 15th MAU&rsquo;s designation was further changed in February 1988 to the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit. Both changes were made to more accurately reflect the operational and <!--del_lnk--> expeditionary nature of the MAGTF. Prior to <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, and in the period between the war and the <!--del_lnk--> Vietnam Conflict, Marine units dispatched for overseas service were generally designated as &ldquo;expeditionary brigades.&quot;<p>Since its activation in July 1987, the 15th MEU has trained to meet its mission in the rotation with the <!--del_lnk--> 11th and <!--del_lnk--> 13th MEUs to provide a continuous presence in the <!--del_lnk--> Western Pacific, <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Ocean.htm" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>, and <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Gulf.htm" title="Persian Gulf">Persian Gulf</a> and as a ready MAGTF in the continental United States.<p>In October 1989, the MEU assisted in relief efforts following the <!--del_lnk--> San Francisco earthquake, performing their assigned missions and also taking on several volunteer projects to help the victims of the disaster.<p><a name="1990s"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1990s</span></h3>
      <p>Marines of the 15th MEU evacuated the <!--del_lnk--> Republic of the Philippines in June 1991 after the eruption of <a href="../../wp/m/Mount_Pinatubo.htm" title="Mount Pinatubo">Mount Pinatubo</a>. Assistance lasted over amonth as the Marines distributed food and medical supplies, evacuated stranded villagers and provided security to other rescue personnel.<p>The MEU spearheaded <!--del_lnk--> Operation Restore Hope on <!--del_lnk--> December 9, <!--del_lnk--> 1992, to provide <!--del_lnk--> humanitarian assistance to the <!--del_lnk--> civil war torn and <a href="../../wp/f/Famine.htm" title="Famine">famine</a> stricken country of <a href="../../wp/s/Somalia.htm" title="Somalia">Somalia</a>. After a predawn landing, the Marines secured the capital city of <a href="../../wp/m/Mogadishu.htm" title="Mogadishu">Mogadishu</a>, the international airport and maritime shipping port facilities, as well as the American Embassy, and quickly moved into other inland areas to protect food distribution convoys and patrol the streets to restore order. The MEU pushed into and secured the inland cities of Baidoa, Balidogle and the coastal town of Kismayo in order to establish relief efforts and maintain security. The span of operations for the Battalion Landing Team was over 150 miles.<p>During its deployment in 1994, the MEU provided a detachment of <!--del_lnk--> CH-53Es to assist in the <a href="../../wp/r/Rwanda.htm" title="Rwanda">Rwanda</a> Relief Effort. . The detachment, based in <!--del_lnk--> Entebbe, <a href="../../wp/u/Uganda.htm" title="Uganda">Uganda</a>, provided the only heavy lift capability to the joint task force commander. A few weeks later the MEU assisted in the relocation of the United States Liaison Office from Mogadishu, Somalia to <!--del_lnk--> Nairobi, Kenya.<p>In October 1994, the MEU was called on again to provide a <!--del_lnk--> quick reaction force to counter any possible <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq.htm" title="Iraq">Iraqi</a> aggression against <a href="../../wp/k/Kuwait.htm" title="Kuwait">Kuwait</a>. Within 48 hours, the MEU sent Marines ashore in <a href="../../wp/k/Kuwait_City.htm" title="Kuwait City">Kuwait City</a> to demonstrate U.S. resolve in maintaining peace and security in the area.<p>In January 1996, July 1997, and October 1998, <!--del_lnk--> AV-8B Harriers from the 15th MEU (SOC) participated in <!--del_lnk--> Operation Southern Watch, patrolling the <!--del_lnk--> No-fly zone over southern Iraq maintaining continuous surveillance of the Kuwait-Iraq border, and to ensure the Iraqi military did not violate any <!--del_lnk--> United Nations resolutions passed since the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf War.<p>During its 2000 deployment, the 15th MEU (SOC) also participated in the <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australian</a>-led <!--del_lnk--> Operation Stabilise, providing desperately needed assistance to the people of <a href="../../wp/e/East_Timor.htm" title="East Timor">East Timor</a>, and again patrolled the skies over Southern Iraq in support of Operation Southern Watch.<p><a id="Global_War_on_Terror" name="Global_War_on_Terror"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Global War on Terror</span></h3>

      <p>Following the <!--del_lnk--> September 11th attacks on the <!--del_lnk--> World Trade Centre and <!--del_lnk--> the Pentagon, the 15th MEU (SOC) continued their plans of humanitarian operations to assist the war-torn country of <a href="../../wp/e/East_Timor.htm" title="East Timor">East Timor</a>, before sailing to the North <!--del_lnk--> Arabian Sea in support of <!--del_lnk--> Operation Enduring Freedom.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> October 7, <!--del_lnk--> 2001, the 15th MEU participated in the United States&#39; new <!--del_lnk--> &quot;War on Terrorism,&quot; sending Marines and Sailors into Northern <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> to establish a <!--del_lnk--> forward operating air base and <!--del_lnk--> logistical hub.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> November 25, <!--del_lnk--> 2001, the Marines and Sailors of the 15th MEU (SOC) conducted an <!--del_lnk--> Amphibious assault over 400 miles into the land-locked country of <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. The Marines and Sailors set new standards for Marine Corps amphibious doctrine. Landing at a remote airbase, 90 miles southwest of <!--del_lnk--> Kandahar, the Marines established <!--del_lnk--> Camp Rhino, America&#39;s first <!--del_lnk--> Forward Operating Base while maintaining the first significant conventional ground presence in Afghanistan. The Marines and coalition forces later moved north to <!--del_lnk--> Kandahar International Airport securing a new forward operating base. With the move, the Marines and coalition forces were able to continue with new missions and build a prison camp that housed numerous <!--del_lnk--> Taliban and <!--del_lnk--> Al-Qaeda fighters.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> January 6, <!--del_lnk--> 2003, this time onboard the <!--del_lnk--> USS Tarawa <!--del_lnk--> ARG, the 15th MEU (SOC) departed once again for another deployment. In mid-February, elements of the MEU off-loaded and established a training camp in Northern <a href="../../wp/k/Kuwait.htm" title="Kuwait">Kuwait</a> while other members of the MAGTF &mdash; primarily the helicopter squadron &mdash; remained onboard the Tarawa ARG in the <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Gulf.htm" title="Persian Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>.<p>During February and March 2003, the MEU was assigned tactical control (TACON) to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> 3 Commando Brigade <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Marines.htm" title="Royal Marines">Royal Marines</a> for <!--del_lnk--> Operation Iraqi Freedom. On <!--del_lnk--> March 21, <!--del_lnk--> 2003, Marines from the 15th MEU crossed the border into Southern Iraq and secured the ports of <!--del_lnk--> Umm Qasr and <!--del_lnk--> Az Zubayr in order to destroy Iraqi resistance and enable follow-on humanitarian assistance to begin. <p>In late-March 2003, the MEU again became part of the <!--del_lnk--> I Marine Expeditionary Force and moved to <!--del_lnk--> An Nasiriyah, Iraq to relieve the Marines of <!--del_lnk--> Task Force Tarawa. In An Nasiriyah, the 15th MEU secured the remaining sectors of the city, conducted a supporting attack during the rescue of American <!--del_lnk--> Prisoner of war <!--del_lnk--> Jessica Lynch  and continued to establish security throughout the greater An Nasiriyah area. The MEU provided humanitarian assistance to the local population that included purifying drinking water, and doctors and corpsmen assisted medical care. The MEU began helping establish the local government to include police and other local services in addition to continuing to conduct airborne surveillance and direct-action raids on the ground to seek out and capture any <!--del_lnk--> Ba&rsquo;ath Party or <!--del_lnk--> Fedayeen resistance.<p>In January 2005, the 15th MEU participated in <!--del_lnk--> Operation Unified Assistance by providing disaster relief to survivors of the <a href="../../wp/2/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake.htm" title="2004 Indian Ocean earthquake">massive tsunami</a> in <a href="../../wp/s/Sumatra.htm" title="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> and southern <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>. Immediately after wrapping up those operations, the 15th MEU proceeded to <!--del_lnk--> Baghdad, Iraq to provide security and stability in a rural area of the city.<p><a id="Current_Units" name="Current_Units"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Current Units</span></h3>
